Computational modelling of &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; protein synthesis is highly complicated, as it requires the simulation of ribosomal movement over the entire transcriptome, as well as consideration of the concentration effects from 40+ different types of tRNAs and numerous other protein factors. Here I report on the development of a stochastic model for protein translation that is capable of simulating the dynamical process of &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; protein synthesis in a prokaryotic cell containing several thousand unique mRNA sequences, with explicit nucleotide information for each, and report on a number of biological predictions which are beyond the scope of existing models. In particular, I show that, when the complex network of concentration dependent interactions between elongation factors, tRNAs, ribosomes, and other factors required for protein synthesis are included in full detail, several biological phenomena, such as the increasing peptide elongation rate with bacterial growth rate, are predicted as emergent properties of the model. The stochastic model presented here demonstrates the importance of considering the translational process at this level of detail, and provides a platform to interrogate various aspects of translation that are difficult to study in more coarse-grained models.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/CHfDF3l3LDU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Molecular diagnosis is an essential step of patient care. An increasing number of Copy Number Variations (CNVs) have been identified that are involved in inherited and somatic diseases. However, there are few existing tools to identify them among amplicon sequencing data generated by Next Generation Sequencing (NGS). We present here a new tool, CovCopCan, that allows the rapid and easy detection of CNVs in inherited diseases, as well as somatic data of patients with cancer, even with a low ratio of cancer cells to healthy cells. This tool could be very useful for molecular geneticists to rapidly identify CNVs in an interactive and user-friendly way.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/tspyDynXg5Q&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Calmodulin sits at the center of molecular mechanisms underlying learning and memory. Its complex and sometimes opposite influences, mediated via the binding to various proteins, are yet to be fully understood. Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and calcineurin (CaN) both bind open calmodulin, favoring Long-Term Potentiation (LTP) or Depression (LTD) respectively. Neurogranin binds to the closed conformation of calmodulin and its impact on synaptic plasticity is less clear. We set up a mechanistic computational model based on allosteric principles to simulate calmodulin state transitions and its interactions with calcium ions and the three binding partners mentioned above. We simulated calcium spikes at various frequencies and show that neurogranin regulates synaptic plasticity along three modalities. At low spike frequencies, neurogranin inhibits the onset of LTD by limiting CaN activation. At intermediate frequencies, neurogranin facilitates LTD, but limits LTP by precluding binding of CaMKII with calmodulin. Finally, at high spike frequencies, neurogranin promotes LTP by enhancing CaMKII autophosphorylation. While neurogranin might act as a calmodulin buffer, it does not significantly preclude the calmodulin opening by calcium. On the contrary, neurogranin synchronizes the opening of calmodulin’s two lobes and promotes their activation at specific frequencies. Neurogranin suppresses basal CaN activity, thus increasing the chance of CaMKII trans-autophosphorylation at high-frequency calcium spikes. Taken together, our study reveals dynamic regulatory roles played by neurogranin on synaptic plasticity, which provide mechanistic explanations for opposing experimental findings.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/OQ5e-Q_Qtz8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The organization of region-to-region functional connectivity has major implications for understanding information transfer and transformation between brain regions. We extended connective field mapping methodology to 3-D anatomic space to derive estimates of corticocortical functional organization. Using multiple publicly available human (both male and female) resting-state fMRI data samples for model testing and replication analysis, we have three main findings. First, we found that the functional connectivity between early visual regions maintained a topographic relationship along the anterior-posterior dimension, which corroborates previous research. Higher order visual regions showed a pattern of connectivity that supports convergence and biased sampling, which has implications for their receptive field properties. Second, we demonstrated that topographic organization is a fundamental aspect of functional connectivity across the entire cortex, with higher topographic connectivity between regions within a functional network than across networks. The principle gradient of topographic connectivity across the cortex resembled whole-brain gradients found in previous work. Last but not least, we showed that the organization of higher order regions such as the lateral prefrontal cortex demonstrate functional gradients of topographic connectivity and convergence. These organizational features of the lateral prefrontal cortex predict task-based activation patterns, particularly visual specialization and higher order rules. In sum, these findings suggest that topographic input is a fundamental motif of functional connectivity between cortical regions for information processing and transfer, with maintenance of topography potentially important for preserving the integrity of information from one region to another.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder, resulting in the progressive decline of cognitive function in patients. Familial forms of AD are tied to mutations in the amyloid precursor protein, but the cellular mechanisms that cause AD remain unclear. Inflammation and amyloidosis from amyloid β (Aβ) aggregates are implicated in neuron loss and cognitive decline. Inflammation activates the protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), and this could suppress many signaling pathways that activate glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) implicated in neurodegeneration. However, the significance of PTP1B in AD pathology remains unclear. Here, we show that pharmacological inhibition of PTP1B with trodusquemine or selective ablation of PTP1B in neurons prevents hippocampal neuron loss and spatial memory deficits in a transgenic AD mouse model with Aβ pathology (hAPP-J20 mice of both sexes). Intriguingly, while systemic inhibition of PTP1B reduced inflammation in the hippocampus, neuronal PTP1B ablation did not. These results dissociate inflammation from neuronal loss and cognitive decline and demonstrate that neuronal PTP1B hastens neurodegeneration and cognitive decline in this model of AD. The protective effect of PTP1B inhibition or ablation coincides with the restoration of GSK3β inhibition. Neuronal ablation of PTP1B did not affect cerebral amyloid levels or plaque numbers, but reduced Aβ plaque size in the hippocampus. In summary, our preclinical study suggests that targeting PTP1B may be a new strategy to intervene in the progression of AD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Familial forms of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are tied to mutations in the amyloid precursor protein, but the cellular mechanisms that cause AD remain unclear. Here, we used a mouse model expressing human amyloid precursor protein bearing two familial mutations and asked whether activation of a phosphatase PTP1B participates in the disease process. Systemic inhibition of this phosphatase using a selective inhibitor prevented cognitive decline, neuron loss in the hippocampus, and attenuated inflammation. Importantly, neuron-targeted ablation of PTP1B also prevented cognitive decline and neuron loss but did not reduce inflammation. Therefore, neuronal loss rather than inflammation was critical for AD progression in this mouse model, and that disease progression could be ameliorated by inhibition of PTP1B.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Bursts of beta frequency band activity in the basal ganglia of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) are associated with impaired motor performance. Here we test in human adults whether small variations in the timing of movement relative to beta bursts have a critical effect on movement velocity and whether the cumulative effects of multiple beta bursts, both locally and across networks, matter. We recorded local field potentials from the subthalamic nucleus (STN) in 15 PD patients of both genders OFF-medication, during temporary lead externalization after deep brain stimulation surgery. Beta bursts were defined as periods exceeding the 75th percentile amplitude threshold. Subjects performed a visual cued joystick reaching task, with the visual cue being triggered in real time with different temporal relationships to bursts of STN beta activity. The velocity of actions made in response to cues prospectively triggered by STN beta bursts was slower than when responses were not time-locked to recent beta bursts. Importantly, slow movements were those that followed multiple bursts close to each other within a trial. In contrast, small differences in the delay between the last burst and movement onset had no significant impact on velocity. Moreover, when the overlap of bursts between the two STN was high, slowing was more pronounced. Our findings suggest that the cumulative, but recent, history of beta bursting, both locally and across basal ganglia networks, may impact on motor performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Bursts of beta frequency band activity in the basal ganglia are associated with slowing of voluntary movement in patients with Parkinson's disease. We show that slow movements are those that follow multiple bursts close to each other and bursts that are coupled across regions. These results suggest that the cumulative, but recent, history of beta bursting, both locally and across basal ganglia networks, impacts on motor performance in this condition. The manipulation of burst dynamics may be a means of selectively improving motor impairment.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Both visual and proprioceptive information contribute to the accuracy of limb movement, but the mechanism of integration of these different modality signals for movement control and learning remains controversial. We aimed to elucidate the mechanism of multisensory integration for motor adaptation by evaluating single-trial adaptation (i.e., aftereffect) induced by visual and proprioceptive perturbations while male and female human participants performed reaching movements. The force-channel method was used to precisely impose several combinations of visual and proprioceptive perturbations (i.e., error), including an instance when the directions of perturbation in both stimuli opposed each another. In the subsequent probe force-channel trial, the lateral force against the channel was quantified as the aftereffect to clarify the mechanism by which the motor adaptation system corrects movement in the event of visual and proprioceptive errors. We observed that the aftereffects had complex dependence on the visual and proprioceptive errors. Although this pattern could not be explained by previously proposed computational models based on the reliability of sensory information, we found that it could be reasonably explained by a mechanism known as divisive normalization, which was the reported mechanism underlying the integration of multisensory signals in neurons. Furthermore, we discovered evidence that the motor memory for each sensory modality developed separately in accordance with a divisive normalization mechanism and that the outputs of both memories were integrated. These results provide a novel view of the utilization and integration of different sensory modality signals in motor adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The mechanism of utilization of multimodal sensory information by the motor control system to perform limb movements with accuracy is a fundamental question. However, the mechanism of integration of these different sensory modalities for movement control and learning remains highly debatable. Herein, we demonstrate that multisensory integration in the motor learning system can be reasonably explained by divisive normalization, a canonical computation, ubiquitously observed in the brain (Carandini and Heeger, 2011). Moreover, we provide evidence of a novel idea that integration does not occur at the sensory information processing level, but at the motor execution level, after the motor memory for each sensory modality is separately created.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Understanding the contribution of neuropeptide-containing neurons to variation in social behavior remains critically important. Galanin has gained increased attention because of the demonstration that galanin neurons in the preoptic area (POA) promote mating and parental care in mammals. How widespread these mechanisms are among vertebrates essentially remains unexplored, especially among teleost fishes, which comprise nearly one-half of living vertebrate species. Teleosts with alternative reproductive tactics exhibit stereotyped patterns of social behavior that diverge widely between individuals within a sex. This includes midshipman that have two male morphs. Type I males mate using either acoustic courtship to attract females to enter a nest they guard or cuckoldry during which they steal fertilizations from a nest-holding male using a sneak or satellite spawning tactic, whereas type II males only cuckold. Using the neural activity marker phospho-S6, we show increased galanin neuron activation in courting type I males during mating that is not explained by their courtship vocalizations, parental care of eggs, or nest defense against cuckolders. This increase is not observed during mating in cuckolders of either morph or females (none of which show parental care). Together with their role in mating in male mammals, the results demonstrate an unexpectedly specific and deep-rooted, phylogenetically shared behavioral function for POA galanin neurons. The results also point to galanin-dependent circuitry as a potential substrate for the evolution of divergent phenotypes within one sex and provide new functional insights into how POA populations in teleosts compare to the POA and anterior hypothalamus of tetrapods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Studies of neuropeptide regulation of vertebrate social behavior have mainly focused on the vasopressin-oxytocin family. Recently, galanin has received attention as a regulator of social behavior largely because of studies demonstrating that galanin neurons in the preoptic area (POA) promote mating and parental care in mammals. Species with alternative reproductive tactics (ARTs) exhibit robust, consistent differences in behavioral phenotypes between individuals within a sex. Taking advantage of this trait, we show POA galanin neurons are specifically active during mating in one of two male reproductive tactics, but not other mating-related behaviors in a fish with ARTs. The results demonstrate a deep, phylogenetically shared role for POA galanin neurons in reproductive-related social behaviors with implications for the evolution of ARTs.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Our sensory impressions of pain are generally thought to represent the noxious properties of an agent but can be influenced by the predicted level of threat. Predictions can be sourced from higher-order cognitive processes, such as schemas, but the extent to which schemas can influence pain perception relative to bottom-up sensory inputs and the underlying neural underpinnings of such a phenomenon are unclear. Here, we investigate how threat predictions generated from learning a cognitive schema lead to inaccurate sensory impressions of the pain stimulus. Healthy male and female participants first detected a linear association between cue values and stimulus intensity and rated pain to reflect the linear schema when compared with uncued heat stimuli. The effect of bias on pain ratings was reduced when prediction errors (PEs) increased, but pain perception was only partially updated when measured against stepped increases in PEs. Cognitive, striatal, and sensory regions graded their responses to changes in predicted threat despite the PEs (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05, corrected). Individuals with more catastrophic thinking about pain and with low mindfulness were significantly more reliant on the schema than on the sensory evidence from the pain stimulus. These behavioral differences mapped to variability in responses of the striatum and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Thus, this study demonstrates a significant role of higher-order schemas in pain perception and indicates that pain perception is biased more toward predictions and less toward nociceptive inputs in individuals who report less mindfulness and more fear of pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; This study demonstrates that threat predictions generated from cognitive schemas continue to influence pain perception despite increasing prediction errors arising in pain pathways. Individuals first formed a cognitive schema of linearity in the relationship between the cued threat value and the stimulus intensity. Subsequently, the linearity was reduced gradually, and participants partially updated their evaluations of pain in relation to the stepped increases in prediction errors. Individuals who continued to rate pain based more on the predicted threat than on changes in nociceptive inputs reported high pain catastrophizing and less mindful-awareness scores. These two affects mapped to activity in the ventral and dorsal striatum, respectively. These findings direct us to a significant role of top-down processes in pain perception.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The ongoing activity of prefrontal neurons after a stimulus has disappeared is considered a neuronal correlate of working memory. It depends on the delicate but poorly understood interplay between excitatory glutamatergic and inhibitory GABAergic receptor effects. We administered the NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 and the GABA(A) receptor antagonist bicuculline methiodide while recording cellular activity in PFC of male rhesus monkeys performing a delayed decision task requiring working memory. The blockade of GABA(A) receptors strongly improved the selectivity of the neurons' delay activity, causing an increase in signal-to-noise ratio during working memory periods as well as an enhancement of the neurons' coding selectivity. The blockade of NMDA receptors resulted in a slight enhancement of selectivity and encoding capacity of the neurons. Our findings emphasize the delicate and more complex than expected interplay of excitatory and inhibitory transmitter systems in modulating working memory coding in prefrontal circuits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Ongoing delay activity of prefrontal neurons constitutes a neuronal correlate of working memory. However, how this delay activity is generated by the delicate interplay of synaptic excitation and inhibition is unknown. We probed the effects of excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate and inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA in regulating delay activity in rhesus monkeys performing a delayed decision task requiring working memory. Surprisingly, the blockade of both glutamatergic NMDA and GABA(A) receptors improved neuronal selectivity of delay activity, causing an increase in neuronal signal-to-noise ratio. Moreover, individual neurons were similarly affected by blockade of both receptors. This emphasizes the delicate and more complex than expected interplay of excitatory and inhibitory transmitter systems in modulating working memory coding in prefrontal circuits.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The neurodevelopmental disorder Rett syndrome is caused by mutations in the gene &lt;i&gt;Mecp2&lt;/i&gt;. Misexpression of the protein MECP2 is thought to contribute to neuropathology by causing dysregulation of plasticity. Female heterozygous &lt;i&gt;Mecp2&lt;/i&gt; mutants (&lt;i&gt;Mecp2&lt;sup&gt;het&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;) failed to acquire a learned maternal retrieval behavior when exposed to pups, an effect linked to disruption of parvalbumin-expressing inhibitory interneurons (PV) in the auditory cortex. Nevertheless, how dysregulated PV networks affect the neural activity dynamics that underlie auditory cortical plasticity during early maternal experience is unknown. Here we show that maternal experience in WT adult female mice (&lt;i&gt;WT&lt;/i&gt;) triggers suppression of PV auditory responses. We also observe concomitant disinhibition of auditory responses in deep-layer pyramidal neurons that is selective for behaviorally relevant pup vocalizations. These neurons further exhibit sharpened tuning for pup vocalizations following maternal experience. All of these neuronal changes are abolished in &lt;i&gt;Mecp2&lt;sup&gt;het&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, suggesting that they are an essential component of maternal learning. This is further supported by our finding that genetic manipulation of GABAergic networks that restores accurate retrieval behavior in &lt;i&gt;Mecp2&lt;sup&gt;het&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; also restores maternal experience-dependent plasticity of PV. Our data are consistent with a growing body of evidence that cortical networks are particularly vulnerable to mutations of &lt;i&gt;Mecp2&lt;/i&gt; in PV neurons. Moreover, our work links, for the first time, impaired &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; cortical plasticity in awake &lt;i&gt;Mecp2&lt;/i&gt; mutant animals to a natural, ethologically relevant behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Rett syndrome is a genetic disorder that includes language communication problems. Nearly all Rett syndrome is caused by mutations in the gene that produces the protein MECP2, which is important for changes in brain connectivity believed to underlie learning. We previously showed that female &lt;i&gt;Mecp2&lt;/i&gt; mutants fail to learn a simple maternal care behavior performed in response to their pups' distress cries. This impairment appeared to critically involve inhibitory neurons in the auditory cortex called parvalbumin neurons. Here we record from these neurons before and after maternal experience, and we show that they adapt their response to pup calls during maternal learning in nonmutants, but not in mutants. This adaptation is partially restored by a manipulation that improves learning.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The bHLH transcription factor &lt;i&gt;Hes1&lt;/i&gt; is a key downstream effector for the Notch signaling pathway. During embryogenesis neural progenitors express low levels of Hes1 in an oscillating pattern, whereas glial brain boundary regions (e.g., isthmus) have high, sustained Hes1 levels that suppress neuronal fates. Here, we show that in the embryonic mouse retina, the optic nerve head and stalk express high Hes1, with the ONH constituting a boundary between the neural retina and glial cells that ultimately line the optic stalk. Using two Cre drivers with distinct spatiotemporal expression we conditionally inactivated &lt;i&gt;Hes1&lt;/i&gt;, to delineate the requirements for this transcriptional repressor during retinal neurogenesis versus patterning of the optic cup and stalk. Throughout retinal neurogenesis, &lt;i&gt;Hes1&lt;/i&gt; maintains proliferation and blocks retinal ganglion cell formation, but surprisingly we found it also promotes cone photoreceptor genesis. In the postnatal eye, &lt;i&gt;Hes1&lt;/i&gt; inactivation with Rax-Cre resulted in increased bipolar neurons and a mispositioning of Müller glia. Our results indicate that Notch pathway regulation of cone genesis is more complex than previously assumed, and reveal a novel role for &lt;i&gt;Hes1&lt;/i&gt; in maintaining the optic cup–stalk boundary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The bHLH repressor Hes1 regulates the timing of neurogenesis, rate of progenitor cell division, gliogenesis, and maintains tissue compartment boundaries. This study expands current eye development models by showing Notch-independent roles for Hes1 in the developing optic nerve head (ONH). Defects in ONH formation result in optic nerve coloboma; our work now inserts Hes1 into the genetic hierarchy regulating optic fissure closure. Given that Hes1 acts analogously in the ONH as the brain isthmus, it prompts future investigation of the ONH as a signaling factor center, or local organizer. Embryonic development of the ONH region has been poorly studied, which is surprising given it is where the pan-ocular disease glaucoma is widely believed to inflict damage on RGC axons.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Myelin loss limits neurological recovery and myelin regeneration and is critical for restoration of function. We recently discovered that global knock-out of the thrombin receptor, also known as Protease Activated Receptor 1 (PAR1), accelerates myelin development. Here we demonstrate that knocking out PAR1 also promotes myelin regeneration. Outcomes in two unique models of myelin injury and repair, that is lysolecithin or cuprizone-mediated demyelination, showed that PAR1 knock-out in male mice improves replenishment of myelinating cells and remyelinated nerve fibers and slows early axon damage. Improvements in myelin regeneration in PAR1 knock-out mice occurred in tandem with a skewing of reactive astrocyte signatures toward a prorepair phenotype. In cell culture, the promyelinating effects of PAR1 loss of function are consistent with possible direct effects on the myelinating potential of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), in addition to OPC-indirect effects involving enhanced astrocyte expression of promyelinating factors, such as BDNF. These findings highlight previously unrecognized roles of PAR1 in myelin regeneration, including integrated actions across the oligodendrocyte and astroglial compartments that are at least partially mechanistically linked to the powerful BDNF-TrkB neurotrophic signaling system. Altogether, findings suggest PAR1 may be a therapeutically tractable target for demyelinating disorders of the CNS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Replacement of oligodendroglia and myelin regeneration holds tremendous potential to improve function across neurological conditions. Here we demonstrate Protease Activated Receptor 1 (PAR1) is an important regulator of the capacity for myelin regeneration across two experimental murine models of myelin injury. PAR1 is a G-protein-coupled receptor densely expressed in the CNS, however there is limited information regarding its physiological roles in health and disease. Using a combination of PAR1 knock-out mice, oligodendrocyte monocultures and oligodendrocyte-astrocyte cocultures, we demonstrate blocking PAR1 improves myelin production by a mechanism related to effects across glial compartments and linked in part to regulatory actions toward growth factors such as BDNF. These findings set the stage for development of new clinically relevant myelin regeneration strategies.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;During adult hippocampal neurogenesis, most newborn cells undergo apoptosis and are rapidly phagocytosed by resident microglia to prevent the spillover of intracellular contents. Here, we propose that phagocytosis is not merely passive corpse removal but has an active role in maintaining neurogenesis. First, we found that neurogenesis was disrupted in male and female mice chronically deficient for two phagocytosis pathways: the purinergic receptor P2Y12, and the tyrosine kinases of the TAM family Mer tyrosine kinase (MerTK)/Axl. In contrast, neurogenesis was transiently increased in mice in which MerTK expression was conditionally downregulated. Next, we performed a transcriptomic analysis of the changes induced by phagocytosis in microglia &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and identified genes involved in metabolism, chromatin remodeling, and neurogenesis-related functions. Finally, we discovered that the secretome of phagocytic microglia limits the production of new neurons both &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. Our data suggest that microglia act as a sensor of local cell death, modulating the balance between proliferation and survival in the neurogenic niche through the phagocytosis secretome, thereby supporting the long-term maintenance of adult hippocampal neurogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Microglia are the brain professional phagocytes and, in the adult hippocampal neurogenic niche, they remove newborn cells naturally undergoing apoptosis. Here we show that phagocytosis of apoptotic cells triggers a coordinated transcriptional program that alters their secretome, limiting neurogenesis both &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. In addition, chronic phagocytosis disruption in mice deficient for receptors P2Y12 and MerTK/Axl reduces adult hippocampal neurogenesis. In contrast, inducible MerTK downregulation transiently increases neurogenesis, suggesting that microglial phagocytosis provides a negative feedback loop that is necessary for the long-term maintenance of adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Therefore, we speculate that the effects of promoting engulfment/degradation of cell debris may go beyond merely removing corpses to actively promoting regeneration in development, aging, and neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Neuronal diversity provides the spinal cord with the functional flexibility required to perform complex motor tasks. Spinal neurons arise during early embryonic development with the establishment of spatially and molecularly discrete progenitor domains that give rise to distinct, but highly heterogeneous, postmitotic interneuron (IN) populations. Our previous studies have shown that Sim1-expressing V3 INs, originating from the p3 progenitor domain, are anatomically and physiologically divergent. However, the developmental logic guiding V3 subpopulation diversity remains elusive. In specific cases of other IN classes, neurogenesis timing can play a role in determining the ultimate fates and unique characteristics of distinctive subpopulations. To examine whether neurogenesis timing contributes to V3 diversity, we systematically investigated the temporal neurogenesis profiles of V3 INs in the mouse spinal cord. Our work uncovered that V3 INs were organized into either early-born [embryonic day 9.5 (E9.5) to E10.5] or late-born (E11.5–E12.5) neurogenic waves. Early-born V3 INs displayed both ascending and descending commissural projections and clustered into subgroups across dorsoventral spinal laminae. In contrast, late-born V3 INs became fate-restricted to ventral laminae and displayed mostly descending and local commissural projections and uniform membrane properties. Furthermore, we found that the postmitotic transcription factor, Sim1, although expressed in all V3 INs, exclusively regulated the dorsal clustering and electrophysiological diversification of early-born, but not late-born, V3 INs, which indicates that neurogenesis timing may enable newborn V3 INs to interact with different postmitotic differentiation pathways. Thus, our work demonstrates neurogenesis timing as a developmental mechanism underlying the postmitotic differentiation of V3 INs into distinct subpopulation assemblies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Interneuron (IN) diversity empowers the spinal cord with the computation flexibility required to perform appropriate sensorimotor control. As such, uncovering the developmental logic guiding spinal IN diversity is fundamental to understanding the development of movement. In our current work, through a focus on the cardinal spinal V3 IN population, we investigated the role of neurogenesis timing on IN diversity. We uncovered that V3 INs are organized into early-born [embryonic day 9.5 (E9.5) to E10.5] or late-born (E11.5–E12.5) neurogenic waves, where late-born V3 INs display increasingly restricted subpopulation fates. Next, to better understand the consequences of V3 neurogenesis timing, we investigated the time-dependent functions of the Sim1 transcription factor, which is expressed in postmitotic V3 INs. Interestingly, Sim1 exclusively regulated the diversification of early-born, but not late-born, V3 INs. Thus, our current work indicates neurogenesis timing can modulate the functions of early postmitotic transcription factors and, thus, subpopulation fate specifications.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Long-term memory (LTM) is stored as functional modifications of relevant neural circuits in the brain. A large body of evidence indicates that the initial establishment of such modifications through the process known as memory consolidation requires learning-dependent transcriptional activation and &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; protein synthesis. However, it remains poorly understood how the consolidated memory is maintained for a long period in the brain, despite constant turnover of molecular substrates. Using the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; courtship conditioning assay of adult males as a memory paradigm, here, we show that in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;, environmental light plays a critical role in LTM maintenance. LTM is impaired when flies are kept in constant darkness (DD) during the memory maintenance phase. Because light activates the brain neurons expressing the neuropeptide pigment-dispersing factor (Pdf), we examined the possible involvement of Pdf neurons in LTM maintenance. Temporal activation of Pdf neurons compensated for the DD-dependent LTM impairment, whereas temporal knockdown of Pdf during the memory maintenance phase impaired LTM in light/dark cycles. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the transcription factor cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) is required in the memory center, namely, the mushroom bodies (MBs), for LTM maintenance, and Pdf signaling regulates light-dependent transcription via CREB. Our results demonstrate for the first time that universally available environmental light plays a critical role in LTM maintenance by activating the evolutionarily conserved memory modulator CREB in MBs via the Pdf signaling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Temporary memory can be consolidated into long-term memory (LTM) through &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; protein synthesis and functional modifications of neuronal circuits in the brain. Once established, LTM requires continual maintenance so that it is kept for an extended period against molecular turnover and cellular reorganization that may disrupt memory traces. How is LTM maintained mechanistically? Despite the critical importance of LTM maintenance, its molecular and cellular underpinnings remain elusive. This study using &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; is significant because it revealed for the first time in any organism that universally available environmental light plays an essential role in LTM maintenance. Interestingly, light does so by activating the evolutionarily conserved transcription factor cAMP response element-binding protein via peptidergic signaling.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;BDNF signaling via its transmembrane receptor TrkB has an important role in neuronal survival, differentiation, and synaptic plasticity. Remarkably, BDNF is capable of modulating its own expression levels in neurons, forming a transcriptional positive feedback loop. In the current study, we have investigated this phenomenon in primary cultures of rat cortical neurons using overexpression of dominant-negative forms of several transcription factors, including CREB, ATF2, C/EBP, USF, and NFAT. We show that CREB family transcription factors, together with the coactivator CBP/p300, but not the CRTC family, are the main regulators of rat &lt;i&gt;BDNF&lt;/i&gt; gene expression after TrkB signaling. CREB family transcription factors are required for the early induction of all the major &lt;i&gt;BDNF&lt;/i&gt; transcripts, whereas CREB itself directly binds only to &lt;i&gt;BDNF&lt;/i&gt; promoter IV, is phosphorylated in response to BDNF-TrkB signaling, and activates transcription from &lt;i&gt;BDNF&lt;/i&gt; promoter IV by recruiting CBP. Our complementary reporter assays with &lt;i&gt;BDNF&lt;/i&gt; promoter constructs indicate that the regulation of &lt;i&gt;BDNF&lt;/i&gt; by CREB family after BDNF-TrkB signaling is generally conserved between rat and human. However, we demonstrate that a nonconserved functional cAMP-responsive element in &lt;i&gt;BDNF&lt;/i&gt; promoter IXa in humans renders the human promoter responsive to BDNF-TrkB-CREB signaling, whereas the rat ortholog is unresponsive. Finally, we show that extensive BDNF transcriptional autoregulation, encompassing all major &lt;i&gt;BDNF&lt;/i&gt; transcripts, occurs also &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; in the adult rat hippocampus during BDNF-induced LTP. Collectively, these results improve the understanding of the intricate mechanism of BDNF transcriptional autoregulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Deeper understanding of stimulus-specific regulation of &lt;i&gt;BDNF&lt;/i&gt; gene expression is essential to precisely adjust BDNF levels that are dysregulated in various neurological disorders. Here, we have elucidated the molecular mechanisms behind TrkB signaling-dependent &lt;i&gt;BDNF&lt;/i&gt; mRNA induction and show that CREB family transcription factors are the main regulators of &lt;i&gt;BDNF&lt;/i&gt; gene expression after TrkB signaling. Our results suggest that BDNF-TrkB signaling may induce &lt;i&gt;BDNF&lt;/i&gt; gene expression in a distinct manner compared with neuronal activity. Moreover, our data suggest the existence of a stimulus-specific distal enhancer modulating &lt;i&gt;BDNF&lt;/i&gt; gene expression.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Leukocyte entry into the central nervous system (CNS) is essential for immune surveillance but is also the basis for the development of pathologic inflammatory conditions within the CNS, such as multiple sclerosis and its animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). The actin-binding protein, cortactin, in endothelial cells is an important player in regulating the interaction of immune cells with the vascular endothelium. Cortactin has been shown to control the integrity of the endothelial barrier and to support neutrophil transendothelial migration &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; in the skin. Here we use cortactin gene-inactivated male and female mice to study the role of this protein in EAE. Inducing EAE by immunization with a myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein peptide (MOG&lt;sub&gt;35–55&lt;/sub&gt;) revealed an ameliorated disease course in cortactin gene-deficient female mice compared with WT mice. However, proliferation capacity and expression of IL-17A and IFN by cortactin-deficient and WT splenocytes did not differ, suggesting that the lack of cortactin does not affect induction of the immune response. Rather, cortactin deficiency caused decreased vascular permeability and reduced leukocyte infiltration into the brains and spinal cords of EAE mice. Accordingly, cortactin gene-deficient mice had smaller numbers of proinflammatory cuffs, less extensive demyelination, and reduced expression levels of proinflammatory cytokines within the neural tissue compared with WT littermates. Thus, cortactin contributes to the development of neural inflammation by supporting leukocyte transmigration through the blood–brain barrier and, therefore, represents a potential candidate for targeting CNS autoimmunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune neuroinflammatory disorder, based on the entry of inflammatory leukocytes into the CNS where these cells cause demyelination and neurodegeneration. Here, we use a mouse model for multiple sclerosis, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, and show that gene inactivation of cortactin, an actin binding protein that modulates actin dynamics and branching, protects against neuroinflammation in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Leukocyte infiltration into the CNS was inhibited in cortactin-deficient mice, and lack of cortactin in cultured primary brain endothelial cells inhibited leukocyte transmigration. Expression levels of proinflammatory cytokines in the CNS and induction of vascular permeability were reduced. We conclude that cortactin represents a novel potential target for the treatment of multiple sclerosis.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Microglia exhibit multiple, phenotype-dependent motility patterns often triggered by purinergic stimuli. However, little data exist on motility of human microglia in pathological situations. Here we examine motility of microglia stained with a fluorescent lectin in tissue slices from female and male epileptic patients diagnosed with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy or cortical glioma (peritumoral cortex). Microglial shape varied from ramified to amoeboid cells predominantly in regions of high neuronal loss or closer to a tumor. Live imaging revealed unstimulated or purine-induced microglial motilities, including surveillance movements, membrane ruffling, and process extension or retraction. At different concentrations, ADP triggered opposing motilities. Low doses triggered process extension. It was suppressed by P2Y12 receptor antagonists, which also reduced process length and surveillance movements. Higher purine doses caused process retraction and membrane ruffling, which were blocked by joint application of P2Y1 and P2Y13 receptor antagonists. Purinergic effects on motility were similar for all microglia tested. Both amoeboid and ramified cells from mesial temporal lobe epilepsy or peritumoral cortex tissue expressed P2Y12 receptors. A minority of microglia expressed the adenosine A2A receptor, which has been linked with process withdrawal of rodent cells. Laser-mediated tissue damage let us test the functional significance of these effects. Moderate damage induced microglial process extension, which was blocked by P2Y12 receptor antagonists. Overall, the purine-induced motility of human microglia in epileptic tissue is similar to that of rodent microglia in that the P2Y12 receptor initiates process extension. It differs in that retraction is triggered by joint activation of P2Y1/P2Y13 receptors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Microglial cells are brain-resident immune cells with multiple functions in healthy or diseased brains. These diverse functions are associated with distinct phenotypes, including different microglial shapes. In the rodent, purinergic signaling is associated with changes in cell shape, such as process extension toward tissue damage. However, there are little data on living human microglia, especially in diseased states. We developed a reliable technique to stain microglia from epileptic and glioma patients to examine responses to purines. Low-intensity purinergic stimuli induced process extension, as in rodents. In contrast, high-intensity stimuli triggered a process withdrawal mediated by both P2Y1 and P2Y13 receptors. P2Y1/P2Y13 receptor activation has not previously been linked to microglial morphological changes.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract&lt;p&gt;Two-photon imaging studies in mouse primary visual cortex (V1) consistently report that around half of the neurons respond to oriented grating stimuli. However, in cats and primates, nearly all neurons respond to such stimuli. Here we show that mouse V1 responsiveness and selectivity strongly depends on neuronal depth. Moving from superficial layer 2 down to layer 4, the percentage of visually responsive neurons nearly doubled, ultimately reaching levels similar to what is seen in other species. Over this span, the amplitude of neuronal responses also doubled. Moreover, stimulus selectivity was also modulated, not only with depth but also with response amplitude. Specifically, we found that orientation and direction selectivity were greater in stronger responding neurons, but orientation selectivity decreased with depth whereas direction selectivity increased. Importantly, these depth-dependent trends were found not just between layer 2/3 and layer four but at different depths within layer 2/3 itself. Thus, neuronal depth is an important factor to consider when pooling neurons for population analyses. Furthermore, the inability to drive the majority of cells in superficial layer 2/3 of mouse V1 with grating stimuli indicates that there may be fundamental differences in the micro-circuitry and role of V1 between rodents and other mammals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Studies frequently pool responses of neurons from different cortical depths in population analyses. Here we show that population neuronal response characteristics in mouse primary visual cortex vary dramatically across depth planes separated by just 50 μm. We also demonstrate that the stimulus selectivity of neuronal responses varies with both cortical depth and the response amplitude of neurons. These findings highlight the importance of considering cell depth and response amplitude as important factors contributing to the overall characteristics of neurons in sensory cortex.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;We implement the dynamical Ising model on the large scale architecture of
white matter connections of healthy subjects in the age range 4-85 years, and
analyze the dynamics in terms of the synergy, a quantity measuring the extent
to which the joint state of pairs of variables is projected onto the dynamics
of a target one. We find that the amount of synergy in explaining the dynamics
of the hubs of the structural connectivity (in terms of degree strength) peaks
before the critical temperature, and can thus be considered as a precursor of a
critical transition. Conversely the greatest amount of synergy goes into
explaining the dynamics of more central nodes. We also find that the aging of
the structural connectivity is associated to significant changes in the
simulated dynamics: there are brain regions whose synergy decreases with age,
in particular the frontal pole, the Subcallosal area and the Supplementary
Motor area; these areas could then be more likely to show a decline in terms of
the capability to perform higher order computation (if structural connectivity
was the sole variable). On the other hand, several regions in the temporal
cortex show a positive correlation with age in the first 30 years of life, i.e.
during brain maturation.

 &lt;p&gt;Biehl et al (2020) present some interesting observations on an early
formulation of the free energy principle in (Friston, 2013). We use these
observations to scaffold a discussion of the technical arguments that
underwrite the free energy principle. This discussion focuses on solenoidal
coupling between various (subsets of) states in sparsely coupled systems that
possess a Markov blanket - and the distinction between exact and approximate
Bayesian inference, implied by the ensuing Bayesian mechanics.

 &lt;p&gt;Kinetic Ising models are powerful tools for studying the non-equilibrium
dynamics of complex discrete systems and analyzing their experimental
recordings. However, the behaviour of the model is in general not tractable for
large networks; therefore, mean field theories are frequently used to
approximate its statistical properties. Many variants of the classical naive
and TAP (i.e., second-order) mean field approximations have been proposed, each
of which makes unique assumptions about time evolution of the system's
correlation structure. This disparity of methods makes it difficult to
systematically advance the mean field approach over previous contributions.
Here, we propose a unified framework for mean field theories of the dynamics of
asymmetric kinetic Ising systems based on information geometry. The framework
is built on Plefka expansions of the model around a simplified model obtained
by an orthogonal projection to a sub-manifold of tractable probability
distributions. This approach not only unifies previous methods but allows us to
define novel methods that, in contrast with traditional mean-field approaches,
preserve correlations of the system, both in stationary and transient states.
By comparing analytical approximations and exact numerical simulations, we show
that the proposed methods provide more accurate estimates for the evolution of
equal-time and delayed covariance structures than classical equations, and
consequently outperform previous mean field theories for solving the inverse
Ising problem. In sum, our framework unifies and extends current mean-field
approximations of kinetic Ising model, constituting a powerful tool for
studying non-equilibrium dynamics of complex systems.

 &lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that leads to impaired memory and cognitive deficits. Spine loss as well as changes in spine morphology correlates with cognitive impairment in this neurological disorder. Many studies in animal models and ex vivo cultures indicate that amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) oligomers induce synaptic damage early during the progression of the disease. Here, in order to determine the events that initiate synaptic alterations, we acutely applied oligomeric Aβ to primary hippocampal neurons and an ex vivo model of organotypic hippocampal cultures from a mouse after targeted expression of EGFP to allow high-resolution imaging and algorithm-based evaluation of spine changes. Dendritic spines were classified as thin, stubby or mushroom, based on morphology. In vivo, time-lapse imaging showed that the three spine types were relatively stable, although their stability significantly decreased after treatment with Aβ oligomers. Unexpectedly, we observed that the density of total dendritic spines increased in organotypic hippocampal slices treated with Aβ compared to control cultures. Specifically, the fraction of stubby spines significantly increased, while mushroom and thin spines remained unaltered. Pharmacological tools revealed that acute Aβ oligomers induced spine changes through mechanisms involving CaMKII and integrin β1 activities. Additionally, analysis of dendritic complexity based on a 3D reconstruction of the whole neuron morphology showed an increase in the apical dendrite length and branching points in CA1 organotypic hippocampal slices treated with Aβ. In contrast to spines, the morphological changes were affected by integrin β1 but not by CaMKII inhibition. Altogether, these data indicate that the Aβ oligomers exhibit early dual effects by acutely enhancing dendritic complexity and spine density.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Emerging studies have demonstrated that interleukin (IL)-33 and its receptor ST2 act as key factors in inflammatory diseases. Moreover, accumulating evidence has suggested that cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and IL-1β, trigger an inflammatory cascade. SIRT1 has been shown to suppress the expression of inflammatory cytokines. However, the effects of SIRT1 on IL-33/ST2 signaling and initiation of the inflammatory cascade via modulation of TNF-α and IL-1β by IL-33 remain unclear. In the present study, we found that the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) IL-33 and ST2 were upregulated in a rat model of spared nerve injury (SNI) and intrathecal injection of either IL-33 or ST2 antibodies alleviated mechanical allodynia and downregulated TNF-α and IL-1β induced by SNI. In addition, activation of SIRT1 decreased enhanced DRG IL-33/ST2 signaling in SNI rats. Artificial inactivation of SIRT1 via intrathecal injection of an SIRT1 antagonist could induce mechanical allodynia and upregulate IL-33 and ST2. These results demonstrated that reduction in SIRT1 could induce upregulation of DRG IL-33 and ST2 and contribute to mechanical allodynia induced by SNI in rats.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Social attention deficits are a hallmark characteristic within autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and have been hypothesized to have cascading effects on emotion recognition. Eye-tracking methodology has emerged as a potentially reliable, feasible, and sensitive biomarker for examining core phenotypic features of ASD; however, these findings are mixed with regards to measuring treatment change in clinical trials. The present study aimed to assess the utility of an eye-tracking paradigm to discriminate between clinical groups in social attention and emotion recognition through face scanning and pupillometry. The present study also assessed the reliability of this paradigm within the ASD sample to further our understanding of the utility of eye-tracking for future clinical trials. Participants included 42 individuals with ASD, 29 developmental disability (DD) controls, and 62 typically developing (TD) controls between 3 and 25 years of age. An emotional faces eye-tracking paradigm was administered to all participants, with the ASD group completing the paradigm a second time approximately 2 months later. Participants’ average proportion of looking and number of fixations to specific areas of interest (AOI) were examined along with changes in pupil reactivity while viewing different emotional faces. Results suggest atypical face-scanning through a reduced proportion of looking and the number of fixations toward the eyes in the ASD group regardless of the emotion that was presented. Further, pupillometry measures were able to detect increases in pupil dilation to happy faces in the ASD group. Lastly, test-retest reliability coefficients varied between the poor and excellent range based on the mechanism assessed, with the proportion of looking demonstrating the highest reliability coefficients. These findings build on the promise of eye-tracking as a feasible and reliable biomarker for identifying social attention and emotion recognition deficits in ASD. Detecting differences in emotion recognition explicitly through facial scanning was not as clear. Specific mechanisms within the eye-tracking paradigm may be viable options for assessing treatment-specific outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Abnormal structural connectivity of cerebral small-vessel disease (CSVD) is associated with cognitive impairment. But the different characteristics of structural connectivity have not been elucidated in early CSVD patients. The current study aimed to investigate the potential differences of structural connectivity in CSVD patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and CSVD patients with normal cognition. Twenty-two CSVD patients with MCI, 34 CSVD patients with normal cognition, and 35 controls, who were age, sex, and education matched underwent diffusion tensor imaging and high resolution T1-weighted imaging. Clinical characteristics, lacunar infarct volume, white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume, and global atrophy were quantitatively evaluated. Maps of fiber connectivity density (FiCD) were constructed and compared across groups in vertex levels. Pearson correlation was used to estimate the imaging–clinical relationships with control of general characteristics. CSVD patients with MCI had higher lesion load of WMH and lacunar infarcts, and correspondingly lower global FiCD value than CSVD patients with normal cognition (P &amp;lt; 0.01). Lacunar infarct (r = −0.318, P &amp;lt; 0.01) and WMH (r = −0.400, P &amp;lt; 0.01), but not global atrophy, age, or sex, were significantly correlated with the global FiCD value. CSVD patients with normal cognition showed decreased FiCD value mainly in the prefrontal areas (P &amp;lt; 0.01 with Monte Carlo correction). Compared with CSVD patients with normal cognition, CSVD patients with MCI showed significantly decreased FiCD value in enlarged frontal and parietal areas (P &amp;lt; 0.01 with Monte Carlo correction). Inter-group comparisons showed regional enhanced impairment of connectivity density in CSVD patients with MCI in the left superior frontal gyrus, the left precuneus, and the orbital part of the right inferior frontal gyrus (P &amp;lt; 0.01 with Monte Carlo correction). Regional FiCD value of frontal and parietal areas was associated with the cognitive function (P &amp;lt; 0.01). In conclusion, cognitively normal CSVD patients already have disruptions of structural connectivity. The extent and intensity of connectivity disruptions in frontal and parietal areas may underlie the mechanism of cognitive impairment in CSVD. Fiber connectivity density measurements may be helpful for quantitative description of structural cortical connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Recent works have shown that the resting-state brain functional connectivity hypernetwork, where multiple nodes can be connected, are an effective technique for brain disease diagnosis and classification research. The lasso method was used to construct hypernetworks by solving sparse linear regression models in previous research. But, constructing a hypernetwork based on the lasso method simply selects a single variable, in that it lacks the ability to interpret the grouping effect. Considering the group structure problem, the previous study proposed to create a hypernetwork based on the elastic net and the group lasso methods, and the results showed that the former method had the best classification performance. However, the highly correlated variables selected by the elastic net method were not necessarily in the active set in the group. Therefore, we extended our research to address this issue. Herein, we propose a new method that introduces the sparse group lasso method to improve the construction of the hypernetwork by solving the group structure problem of the brain regions. We used the traditional lasso, group lasso method, and sparse group lasso method to construct a hypernetwork in patients with depression and normal subjects. Meanwhile, other clustering coefficients (clustering coefficients based on pairs of nodes) were also introduced to extract features with traditional clustering coefficients. Two types of features with significant differences obtained after feature selection were subjected to multi-kernel learning for feature fusion and classification using each method, respectively. The network topology results revealed differences among the three networks, where hypernetwork using the lasso method was the strictest; the group lasso, most lenient; and the sgLasso method, moderate. The network topology of the sparse group lasso method was similar to that of the group lasso method but different from the lasso method. The classification results show that the sparse group lasso method achieves the best classification accuracy by using multi-kernel learning, which indicates that better classification performance can be achieved when the group structure exists and is properly extended.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Aims: Recent research suggests that aerobic exercise can be performed safely within the first week following a concussion injury and that early initiation of exercise may speed recovery. To better understand the physiological changes during a concussion, we tested the hypothesis that mild-to-intense exercise testing can be performed within days immediately following injury, and can be used to discern differences between the concussed and normal healthy state. Thus, the purpose was to observe the cerebral hemodynamic responses to incremental exercise testing performed acutely post-concussion in high-performance athletes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: This study was a within- and between-experimental design, with seven male university ice hockey teams participating. A subgroup of five players acted as control subjects (CON) and was tested at the same time as the 14 concussed (mTBI) players on Day 2, 4, and 7 post-concussion. A 5-min resting baseline and 5-min exercise bouts of mild (EX1), moderate (EX2), and high (EX3) intensity exercise were performed on a cycle ergometer. Near-infrared spectroscopy was used to monitor pre-frontal cortex oxy-haemoglobin (HbO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), deoxy-haemoglobin (HHb), and total blood volume (tHb) changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: ANOVA compared differences between testing days and groups, and although large percentage changes in HbO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (20–30%), HHb (30–40%), and tHb (30–40%) were recorded, no significant (p ≤ 0.05) differences in cerebral hemodynamics occurred between mTBI vs. CON during aerobic exercise testing on any day post-injury. Furthermore, there was a linear relationship between exercise intensity vs. cerebral hemodynamics during testing for each day (r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.83–0.99).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: These results demonstrate two novel findings: (1) mild-to-intense aerobic exercise testing can be performed safely as early as Day 2 post-concussion injury in a controlled laboratory environment; and (2) evidence-based objective measures such as cerebral hemodynamics can easily be collected using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to monitor physiological changes during the first-week post-injury. This research has important implications for monitoring physiological recovery post-injury and establishing new rehabilitation guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Sleep and wakefulness are promoted not by a single neural pathway but via wake or sleep-promoting nodes distributed across layers of the brain. We equate each layer with a brain region in proposing a layered subsumption model for arousal based on a computational architecture. Beyond the brainstem the layers include the diencephalon (hypothalamus, thalamus), basal ganglia, and cortex. In light of existing empirical evidence, we propose that each layer have sleep and wake computations driven by similar high-level architecture and processing units. Specifically, an interconnected wake-promoting system is suggested as driving arousal in each brain layer with the processing converging to produce the features of wakefulness. In contrast, sleep-promoting GABAergic neurons largely project to and inhibit wake-promoting neurons. We propose a general pattern of caudal wake-promoting and sleep-promoting neurons having a strong effect on overall behavior. However, while rostral brain layers have less influence on sleep and wake, through descending projections, they can subsume the activity of caudal brain layers to promote arousal. The two models presented in this work will suggest computations for the layering and hierarchy. Through dynamic system theory several hypotheses are introduced for the interaction of controllers and systems that correspond to the different populations of neurons at each layer. The models will be drawn-upon to discuss future experiments to elucidate the structure of the hierarchy that exists among the sleep-arousal architecture.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;In contrast to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced preconditioning, which has repeatedly been examined in the past, the effects of post-ischemic LPS-induced sepsis, although clinically considerably more important, have not systemically been studied. We exposed mice to transient intraluminal middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and examined the effects of intraperitoneal LPS (0.1 or 1 mg/kg) which was administered 24 h post-ischemia. Post-ischemic glial reactivity, neuronal survival and neurological outcome were differently modulated by the higher and the lower LPS dose. Although both doses promoted neuronal survival after 72 h, the underlying mechanisms were not similar. Mice receiving 1 mg/kg LPS exhibited transient hypothermia at 1 and 3 hours post sepsis (hps), followed by reduced focal neurological deficits at 24, 48 and 72 hps. The lower dose (0.1 mg/kg) did not induce hypothermia, but reduced microglia/macrophage activation with the appearance of an anti-inflammatory CD206 positive cell phenotype in the brain parenchyma. Together, our results indicate a novel, dose-dependent modulation of microglial cells that is intricately involved in brain protection.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 Pannexins are large-pore forming channels responsible for ATP release under a variety of physiological and pathological conditions. Although predicted to share similar membrane topology with other large-pore forming proteins such as connexins, innexins, and LRRC8, pannexins have minimal sequence similarity to these protein families. Here, we present the cryo-EM structure of a frog pannexin 1 (Panx1) channel at 3.0 Å. We find that Panx1 protomers harbor four transmembrane helices similar in arrangement to other large-pore forming proteins but assemble as a heptameric channel with a unique constriction formed by Trp74 in the first extracellular loop. Mutating Trp74 or the nearby Arg75 disrupt ion selectivity whereas altering residues in the hydrophobic groove formed by the two extracellular loops abrogates channel inhibition by carbenoxolone. Our structural and functional study establishes the extracellular loops as important structural motifs for ion selectivity and channel inhibition in Panx1.</content>

		<content type="html">
 More than 30% of genes in higher eukaryotes are regulated by promoter-proximal pausing of RNA polymerase II (Pol II). Phosphorylation of Pol II CTD by positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) is a necessary precursor event that enables productive transcription elongation. The exact mechanism on how the sequestered P-TEFb is released from the 7SK snRNP complex and recruited to Pol II CTD remains unknown. In this report, we utilize mouse and human models to reveal methylphosphate capping enzyme (MePCE), a core component of the 7SK snRNP complex, as the cognate substrate for Jumonji domain-containing 6 (JMJD6)’s novel proteolytic function. Our evidences consist of a crystal structure of JMJD6 bound to methyl-arginine, enzymatic assays of JMJD6 cleaving MePCE &lt;i&gt;in vivo &lt;/i&gt;and&lt;i&gt; in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, binding assays, and downstream effects of &lt;i&gt;Jmjd6 &lt;/i&gt;knockout and overexpression on Pol II CTD phosphorylation. We propose that JMJD6 assists bromodomain containing 4 (BRD4) to recruit P-TEFb to Pol II CTD by disrupting the 7SK snRNP complex.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Naïve human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) provide a unique experimental platform of cell fate decisions during pre-implantation development, but their lineage potential remains incompletely characterized. As naïve hPSCs share transcriptional and epigenomic signatures with trophoblast cells, it has been proposed that the naïve state may have enhanced predisposition for differentiation along this extraembryonic lineage. Here we examined the trophoblast potential of isogenic naïve and primed hPSCs. We found that naïve hPSCs can directly give rise to human trophoblast stem cells (hTSCs) and undergo further differentiation into both extravillous and syncytiotrophoblast. In contrast, primed hPSCs do not support hTSC derivation, but give rise to non-self-renewing cytotrophoblasts in response to BMP4. Global transcriptome and chromatin accessibility analyses indicate that hTSCs derived from naïve hPSCs are similar to blastocyst-derived hTSCs and acquire features of post-implantation trophectoderm. The derivation of hTSCs from naïve hPSCs will enable elucidation of early mechanisms that govern normal human trophoblast development and associated pathologies.</content>

 Khoomei is a unique singing style originating from the Central Asian republic of Tuva. Singers produce two pitches simultaneously: a booming low-frequency rumble alongside a hovering high-pitched whistle-like tone. The biomechanics of this biphonation are not well-understood. Here, we use sound analysis, dynamic magnetic resonance imaging, and vocal tract modeling to demonstrate how biphonation is achieved by modulating vocal tract morphology. Tuvan singers show remarkable control in shaping their vocal tract to narrowly focus the harmonics (or overtones) emanating from their vocal cords. The biphonic sound is a combination of the fundamental pitch and a focused filter state, which is at the higher pitch (1-2 kHz) and formed by merging two formants, thereby greatly enhancing sound-production in a very narrow frequency range. Most importantly, we demonstrate that this biphonation is a phenomenon arising from linear filtering rather than a nonlinear source.</content>

 Do developmental systems preferentially produce certain types of variation that orient phenotypic evolution along preferred directions? At different scales, from the intra-population to the interspecific, the murine first upper molar shows repeated anterior elongation. Using a novel quantitative approach to compare the development of two mouse strains with short or long molars, we identified temporal, spatial and functional differences in tooth signaling center activity, that arise from differential tuning of the activation-inhibition mechanisms underlying tooth patterning. By tracing their fate, we could explain why only the upper first molar reacts via elongation of its anterior part. Despite a lack of genetic variation, individuals of the elongated strain varied in tooth length and the temporal dynamics of their signaling centers, highlighting the intrinsic instability of the upper molar developmental system. Collectively, these results reveal the variational properties of murine molar development that drive morphological evolution along a line of least resistance.</content>

 Axon caliber plays a crucial role in determining conduction velocity and, consequently, in the timing and synchronization of neural activation. Noninvasive measurement of axon radii could have significant impact on the understanding of healthy and diseased neural processes. Until now, accurate axon radius mapping has eluded in vivo neuroimaging, mainly due to a lack of sensitivity of the MRI signal to micron-sized axons. Here, we show how – when confounding factors such as extra-axonal water and axonal orientation dispersion are eliminated – heavily diffusion-weighted MRI signals become sensitive to axon radii. However, diffusion MRI is only capable of estimating a single metric, the effective radius, representing the entire axon radius distribution within a voxel that emphasizes the larger axons. Our findings, both in rodents and humans, enable noninvasive mapping of critical information on axon radii, as well as resolve the long-standing debate on whether axon radii can be quantified.</content>

 During development, many mutations cause increased variation in phenotypic outcomes, a phenomenon termed decanalization. Phenotypic discordance is often observed in the absence of genetic and environmental variations, but the mechanisms underlying such inter-individual phenotypic discordance remain elusive. Here, using the anterior-posterior (AP) patterning of the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila &lt;/i&gt;embryo, we identified embryonic geometry as a key factor predetermining patterning outcomes under decanalizing mutations. With the wild-type AP patterning network, we found that AP patterning is robust to variations in embryonic geometry; segmentation gene expression remains reproducible even when the embryo aspect ratio is artificially reduced by more than twofold. In contrast, embryonic geometry is highly predictive of individual patterning defects under decanalized conditions of either increased &lt;i&gt;bicoid (bcd)&lt;/i&gt; dosage or &lt;i&gt;bcd &lt;/i&gt;knockout. We showed that the phenotypic discordance can be traced back to variations in the gap gene expression, which is rendered sensitive to the geometry of the embryo under mutations.</content>

 How an animal responds to a particular sensory stimulus will to a great extent depend on prior experience associated with that stimulus. For instance, aversive associative learning may lead to a change in the predicted outcomes, which suppresses the behavioural response to an otherwise rewarding stimulus. However, the neuronal mechanisms of how aversive learning can result in the suppression of even a vitally important innate behaviour is much less understood. Here we used the model system of Lymnaea stagnalis to address the question of how an anticipated aversive outcome can alter the behavioural response to a previously effective feeding stimulus. We found that aversive classical conditioning with sucrose as the CS (conditioned stimulus) and strong touch as the aversive US (unconditioned stimulus) reverses the decision so that the same salient feeding stimulus inhibits feeding, rather than activating it. Key to the understanding of the neural mechanism underlying this switch in the behavioural response is the PlB (pleural buccal) extrinsic interneuron of the feeding network whose modulatory effects on the feeding circuit inhibit feeding. After associative aversive training, PlB is excited by sucrose to reverse its effects on the feeding response. Aversive associative learning induces a persistent change in the electrical properties of PlB that is both sufficient and necessary for the switch in the behavioral output. In addition, the strong touch used as the US during the associative training protocol can also serve as a sensitizing stimulus to lead to an enhanced defensive withdrawal response to a mild touch stimulus. This non-associative effect of the strong touch is probably based on the facilitated excitatory response of PlB to spike activity in a key identified interneuron of the defensive withdrawal network, PeD12.</content>

 Analyzing resting state fMRI data is difficult due to a weak signal and several noise sources. Head motion is also a major problem and it is common to apply motion scrubbing, i.e. to remove time points where a subject has moved more than some pre-defined motion threshold. A problem arises if one cohort on average moves more than another, since the remaining temporal degrees of freedom are then different for the two groups. The effect of this is that the uncertainty of the functional connectivity estimates (e.g. Pearson correlations) are different for the two groups, but this is seldom modelled in resting state fMRI. We demonstrate that group differences in motion scrubbing can result in inflated false positives, depending on how the temporal auto correlation is modelled when performing the Fisher r-to-z transform.</content>

 The recent advances in the chronic implantation of electrodes have allowed the collection of extracellular activity from neurons over long periods of time. To fully take advantage of these recordings, it is necessary to track single neurons continuously, particularly when their associated waveform changes with time. Multiple spike sorting algorithms can track drifting neurons but they do not perform well in conditions like a temporary increase in the noise level, sparsely firing neurons, and changes in the number of detectable neurons. In this work, we present Spikes_Link, a general framework to track neurons under these conditions. Spikes_Link can be implemented with different spike sorting algorithms, allowing the experimenter to use the algorithm best fitted to their recording setup. The main idea behind Spikes_Link is the blockwise analysis of the recording using overlapping sets of spikes to equally represent all the putative neurons being tracked on a given block. This way, we can link classes with clusters obtained in a new block based on an overlapping metric. Moreover, the algorithm can fix temporary sorting errors (splits and merges). We compared an implementation of Spikes_Link with other algorithms using long-term simulations and obtained superior performance in all the metrics. In general, the Spikes_Link framework could be used for other clustering problems with concept drift and class imbalance.</content>

 The global neuronal workspace (GNW) model has inspired over two decades of hypothesis driven research on the neural basis consciousness. However, recent studies have reported findings that appear inconsistent with the predictions of the model. Further, the macroanatomical focus of current GNW research has limited the specificity of predictions afforded by the model. In this paper we present a neurocomputational model, based on the active inference framework, that captures central architectural elements of the GNW and that can address these limitations. The resulting predictive global workspace casts neuronal dynamics as approximating Bayesian inference, allowing precise, testable predictions at both the behavioural and neural levels of description. We report simulations demonstrating the model's ability to reproduce: 1) the electrophysiological and behaviour results observed in previous studies of inattentional blindness, and 2) the previously described four-way taxonomy predicted by the GNW, which describes the relationship between consciousness, attention, and sensory signal strength. We then illustrate how our model can reconcile/explain (apparently) conflicting findings, extend the GNW taxonomy to include the influence of prior expectations, and inspire novel paradigms to test associated behavioural and neural predictions.</content>

 Although somatic mutations have well-established roles in cancer and certain focal epilepsies, the extent to which mutational mosaicism shapes the developing human brain is poorly understood. Here we characterize the landscape of somatic mutations in the human brain using ultra-deep (~250x) whole-genome sequencing of brains from 59 autism spectrum disorder (ASD) cases and 15 controls. We observe a mean of 26 ({+/-}10, range 10-60) somatic single nucleotide variants (sSNVs) per brain present in [≥]4% of cells, with enrichment of mutations in coding and putative regulatory regions. Our analysis reveals that the first cell division after fertilization produces ~3.4 mutations, followed by 2-3 mutations in subsequent generations. This rate suggests that a typical individual possesses ~80 sSNVs present in [≥]2% of cells -- comparable to the number of de novo germline mutations per generation -- with about half of individuals having at least one potentially function-altering somatic mutation somewhere in the cortex. Although limited by sample size, ASD brains show an excess of somatic mutations in neural enhancer sequences compared to controls, suggesting that mosaic enhancer mutations may contribute to ASD risk.</content>

 Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) leads to profound deficits in spatial memory and synaptic and cellular alterations to the hippocampus that last into adulthood. Neurons in the hippocampus, called place cells, discharge as an animal enters specific places in an environment, establish distinct ensemble codes for familiar and novel places, and are modulated by local theta rhythms. Spatial memory is thought to critically depend on the integrity of hippocampal place cell firing. We therefore tested the hypothesis that hippocampal place cell firing is impaired after PAE by performing in-vivo recordings from the hippocampi (CA1 and CA3) of moderate PAE and control adult rats. Our results show that hippocampal CA3 neurons from PAE rats have reduced spatial tuning. Secondly, CA1 and CA3 neurons from PAE rats are less likely to orthogonalize their firing between directions of travel on a linear track and between contexts in an open arena compared to control neurons. Lastly, reductions in the number of hippocampal place cells exhibiting significant theta rhythmicity and phase precession were observed which may suggest changes to hippocampal microcircuit function. Together, the reduced spatial tuning and sensitivity to context provides a neural systems-level mechanism to explain spatial memory impairment after moderate PAE.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Hebbian plasticity, a mechanism believed to be the substrate of learning and memory, detects and further enhances correlated neural activity. Because this constitutes an unstable positive feedback loop, it requires additional homeostatic control. Computational work suggests that in recurrent networks, the homeostatic mechanisms observed in experiments are too slow to compensate instabilities arising from Hebbian plasticity and need to be complemented by rapid compensatory processes. We suggest presynaptic inhibition as a candidate that rapidly provides stability by compensating recurrent excitation induced by Hebbian changes. Presynaptic inhibition is mediated by presynaptic GABA receptors that effectively and reversibly attenuate transmitter release. Activation of these receptors can be triggered by excess network activity, hence providing a stabilising negative feedback loop that weakens recurrent interactions on sub-second timescales. We study the stabilising effect of presynaptic inhibition in a recurrent networks, in which presynaptic inhibition is implemented as a multiplicative reduction of recurrent synaptic weights in response to increasing inhibitory activity. We show that networks with presynaptic inhibition display a gradual increase of firing rates with growing excitatory weights, in contrast to traditional excitatory-inhibitory networks. This alleviates the positive feedback loop between Hebbian plasticity and network activity and thereby allows homeostasis to act on timescales similar to those observed in experiments. Our results generalise to spiking networks with a biophysically more detailed implementation of the presynaptic inhibition mechanism. In conclusion, presynaptic inhibition provides a powerful compensatory mechanism that rapidly reduces effective recurrent interactions and thereby stabilises Hebbian learning.</content>

 Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the precentral hand knob can evoke motor evoked potentials (MEP) in contralateral hand muscles. Biophysical modelling points to the dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) in the superficial crown-lip region as primary site of TMS-induced neuronal excitation. Here, we used a sulcus-aligned MRI-informed TMS mapping approach to determine the optimal site (hotspot) for evoking MEPs in the precentral hand knob. Individual precentral hotspot location varied along the rostro-caudal axis. Individuals with a more rostral location had longer MEP latencies. Spatiotemporal hotspot rostrality was associated with higher precentral myelin-related signals, stronger movement-related activation of PMd in the precentral crown, and higher temporal precision during paced finger tapping. Together, our multimodal mapping approach provides first-time evidence for behaviourally relevant, structural and functional phenotypic variation in the crown of human precentral motor hand knob. The results have important implications for physiological and interventional TMS studies targeting the precentral hand knob.</content>

 Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) signaling plays key regulatory roles in multiple processes of brain physiology and pathology. While the direct effects of IGF-I in neurons have been extensively studied, the astrocyte involvement in IGF-I signaling and the consequences on synaptic plasticity and animal behavior remain unknown. Here we show that IGF-I induces the long-term depression (LTD) of inhibitory synaptic transmission in the mouse barrel cortex. This LTD requires the activation of the IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) in astrocytes, which stimulates astrocyte Ca2+ signaling and the release of ATP/adenosine that in turn activates A2A adenosine receptors at presynaptic inhibitory terminals. Specific deletion of IGF-IR in cortical astrocytes (IGF-IR-/-) impaired the behavioral performance in a whisker discrimination task. These results show novel mechanisms and functional consequences of IGF-I signaling on cortical inhibitory synaptic plasticity and animal behavior, revealing astrocytes as key elements in these processes.</content>

 Virtual delineation of white matter bundles in the human brain is of paramount importance for multiple applications, such as pre-surgical planning and connectomics. A substantial body of literature is related to methods that automatically segment bundles from diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (dMRI) data indirectly, by exploiting either the idea of connectivity between regions or the geometry of fiber paths obtained with tractography techniques or, directly, through the information in volumetric data. Despite the remarkable improvement in automatic segmentation methods over the years, their segmentation quality is not yet satisfactory, especially when dealing with datasets with very diverse characteristics, such as different tracking methods, bundle sizes or data quality. In this work, we propose a novel, supervised streamline-based segmentation method, called Classifyber, which combines information from atlases, connectivity patterns, and the geometry of fiber paths into a simple linear model. With a wide range of experiments on multiple datasets that span from research to clinical domains, we show that Classifyber substantially improves the quality of segmentation as compared to other state-of-the-art methods and, more importantly, that it is robust across very diverse settings. We provide an implementation of the proposed method as open source code, as well as web service.</content>

 E3-ubiquitin ligase Cullin3 (Cul3) is a high confidence risk gene for Neurodevelopmental Disorders (NDD) including Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Developmental Delay (DD). We generated haploinsufficient Cul3 mouse model to investigate brain anatomy, behavior, molecular, cellular, and circuit-level mechanisms dysregulated by Cul3 mutations. Brain MRI of Cul3 mutant animals found profound abnormalities in half of brain regions, including decreased volume of cortical regions and increased volume of subcortical regions. Cul3 mutant mice exhibited social and cognitive deficits, and hyperactive behavior. Spatiotemporal transcriptomic and proteomic profiling of the brain implicated neurogenesis and cytoskeletal defects as key drivers of Cul3 functional impact. Cortical neurons from mutant mice had reduced dendritic length and loss of filamentous actin puncta, along with reduced spontaneous network activity. Inhibition of small GTPase RhoA, a molecular substrate of Cul3 ligase, rescued dendrite length phenotype. This study identified RhoA signaling as a potential mechanism, through which Cul3 mutation impacts early brain development.</content>

Genetic risk prediction is an important problem in human genetics, and accurate prediction can facilitate disease prevention and treatment. Calculating polygenic risk score (PRS) has become widely used due to its simplicity and effectiveness, where only summary statistics from genome-wide association studies are needed in the standard method. Recently, several methods have been proposed to improve standard PRS by utilizing external information, such as linkage disequilibrium and functional annotations. In this paper, we introduce EB-PRS, a novel method that leverages information for effect sizes across all the markers to improve prediction accuracy. Compared to most existing genetic risk prediction methods, our method does not need to tune parameters nor external information. Real data applications on six diseases, including asthma, breast cancer, celiac disease, Crohn’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and type 2 diabetes show that EB-PRS achieved 307.1%, 42.8%, 25.5%, 3.1%, 74.3% and 49.6% relative improvements in terms of predictive &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; over standard PRS method with optimally tuned parameters. Besides, compared to LDpred that makes use of LD information, EB-PRS also achieved 37.9%, 33.6%, 8.6%, 36.2%, 40.6% and 10.8% relative improvements. We note that our method is not the first method leveraging effect size distributions. Here we first justify our method by presenting theoretical optimal property over existing methods in this class of methods, and substantiate our theoretical result with extensive simulation results. The R-package EBPRS that implements our method is available on CRAN.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/erXzdSY1DMA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The first retinal synapse, photoreceptor-&amp;gt;bipolar cell (BC), is both anatomically and functionally complex. Within the same synaptic region, a change in presynaptic glutamate release is sensed by both ON BCs (DBCs) via the metabotropic glutamate receptor 6 (mGluR6), and OFF BCs (HBCs) via ionotropic glutamate receptors to establish parallel signaling pathways that preferentially encode light increments (ON) or decrements (OFF), respectively. The synaptic structural organization of ON and OFF-type BCs at the photoreceptor terminal differs. DBCs make an invaginating synapse that contains a diverse but incompletely understood complex of interacting proteins (signalplex). HBCs make primarily flat contacts that contain an apparent different set of proteins that is equally uncharacterized. LRIT3 is a synaptic protein known to be essential for ON pathway visual function. In both male and female mice, we demonstrate that LRIT3 interacts with and is required for expression of nyctalopin, and thus TRPM1 at all DBC dendritic tips, but DBC signalplex components are not required for LRIT3 expression. Using whole-cell and multielectrode array (MEA) electrophysiology and glutamate imaging, we demonstrate that the loss of LRIT3 impacts both ON and OFF signaling pathway function. Without LRIT3, excitatory input to type 1 BCs is reduced, as are the visually evoked responses of many OFF retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). We conclude that the absence of LRIT3 expression disrupts excitatory input to OFF BCs and, thus disrupts the normal function of OFF RGCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract&lt;p&gt;Within neuroscience, models have many roles, including driving hypotheses, making assumptions explicit, synthesizing knowledge, making experimental predictions, and facilitating applications to medicine. While specific modeling techniques are often taught, the process of constructing models for a given phenomenon or question is generally left opaque. Here, informed by guiding many students through modeling exercises at our CoSMo summer school we provide a practical ten step breakdown of the modeling process. This approach makes choices and criteria more explicit and replicable. Experiment design has long been taught in neuroscience; the modeling process should receive the same attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance&lt;/b&gt; Modeling in Neuroscience is often perceived as a mysterious process and is hard to teach. Here we provide the first how-to-model guide that breaks down the modeling endeavor into a step-by-step process.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract&lt;p&gt;Post-stroke functional recovery can occur spontaneously during the subacute phase; however, how post-stroke fibrotic repair affects functional recovery is highly debated. Platelet derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFRβ)-expressing pericytes are responsible for post-stroke fibrotic repair within infarct areas; therefore, we examined peri-infarct neural reorganization and functional recovery after permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO) using pericyte-deficient &lt;i&gt;Pdgfrb&lt;sup&gt;+/–&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice. Time-dependent reduction of infarct area sizes, &lt;i&gt;i.e.&lt;/i&gt; repair, was significantly impaired in &lt;i&gt;Pdgfrb&lt;sup&gt;+/–&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice with recovery of cerebral blood flow in ischemic areas attenuated by defective leptomeningeal arteriogenesis and intra-infarct angiogenesis. Peri-infarct astrogliosis, accompanied by increased STAT3 phosphorylation, was attenuated in &lt;i&gt;Pdgfrb&lt;sup&gt;+/–&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice. Pericyte-conditioned medium (PCM), particularly when treated with platelet derived growth factor subunit B (PDGFB) homodimer (PDGF-BB) (PCM/PDGF-BB), activated STAT3 and enhanced the proliferation and activity of cultured astrocytes. Although peri-infarct proliferation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) was induced promptly after pMCAO regardless of intra-infarct repair, OPC differentiation and remyelination were significantly attenuated in &lt;i&gt;Pdgfrb&lt;sup&gt;+/–&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice. Consistently, astrocyte-conditioned medium promoted OPC differentiation and myelination, which were enhanced remarkably by adding PCM/PDGF-BB to the medium. Post-stroke functional recovery correlated well with the extent and process of intra-infarct repair and peri-infarct oligodendrogenesis. Overall, pericyte-mediated intra-infarct fibrotic repair through PDGFRβ may promote functional recovery through enhancement of peri-infarct oligodendrogenesis as well as astrogliosis after acute ischemic stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Pericyte-mediated fibrotic tissue repair is a major histological change within the infarct area during the subacute phase after ischemic stroke. Whether fibrotic repair is beneficial or detrimental to post-stroke functional recovery is highly debated. Here we demonstrate that inhibition of fibrotic repair in mice by heterozygous deletion of PDGFRβ (&lt;i&gt;Pdgfrb&lt;sup&gt;+/–&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;) significantly attenuates functional recovery after ischemic stroke. Pericyte-derived PDGFRβ-positive cells within the infarct area produced trophic factors that activated astrocytes, thereby enhancing peri-infarct astrogliosis. Furthermore, astrocytes, conditioned with PDGF-BB-stimulated pericyte culture medium, promoted oligodendrocyte differentiation and a myelinating response. Peri-infarct oligodendrogenesis and re-myelination within areas of astrogliosis was significantly attenuated in &lt;i&gt;Pdgfrb&lt;sup&gt;+/–&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice. Pericyte-mediated tissue repair is beneficial for post-stroke functional recovery and is a potential therapeutic target.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.03738"/>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;It is proposed that both human creativity and human consciousness are
(unintended) consequences of the human brain's extraordinary energy efficiency.
The topics of creativity and consciousness are treated separately, though have
a common sub-structure. It is argued that creativity arises from a synergy
between two cognitive modes of the human brain (which broadly coincide with
Kahneman's Systems 1 and 2). In the first, available energy is spread across a
relatively large network of neurons. As such, the amount of energy per active
neuron is so small that the operation of such neurons is susceptible to thermal
(ultimately quantum decoherent) noise. In the second, available energy is
focussed on a small enough subset of neurons to guarantee a deterministic
operation. An illustration of how this synergy can lead to creativity with
implications for computing in silicon are discussed. Starting with a discussion
of the concept of free will, the notion of consciousness is defined in terms of
an awareness of what are perceived to be nearby counterfactual worlds in state
space. It is argued that such awareness arises from an interplay between our
memories on the one hand, and quantum physical mechanisms (where, unlike in
classical physics, nearby counterfactual worlds play an indispensable dynamical
role) in the ion channels of neural networks. As with the brain's
susceptibility to noise, it is argued that in situations where quantum physics
plays a role in the brain, it does so for reasons of energy efficiency. As an
illustration of this definition of consciousness, a novel proposal is outlined
as to why quantum entanglement appears so counter-intuitive.

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;The machine learning community has become increasingly interested in the
energy efficiency of neural networks. The Spiking Neural Network (SNN) is a
promising approach to energy-efficient computing, since its activation levels
are quantized into temporally sparse, one-bit values (i.e., &quot;spike&quot; events),
which additionally converts the sum over weight-activity products into a simple
addition of weights (one weight for each spike). However, the goal of
maintaining state-of-the-art (SotA) accuracy when converting a non-spiking
network into an SNN has remained an elusive challenge, primarily due to spikes
having only a single bit of precision. Adopting tools from signal processing,
we cast neural activation functions as quantizers with temporally-diffused
error, and then train networks while smoothly interpolating between the
non-spiking and spiking regimes. We apply this technique to the Legendre Memory
Unit (LMU) to obtain the first known example of a hybrid SNN outperforming SotA
recurrent architectures---including the LSTM, GRU, and NRU---in accuracy, while
reducing activities to at most 3.74 bits on average with 1.26 significant bits
multiplying each weight. We discuss how these methods can significantly improve
the energy efficiency of neural networks.

 &lt;p&gt;A combinatorial neural code $\mathscr C\subseteq 2^{[n]}$ is convex if it
arises as the intersection pattern of convex open subsets of $\mathbb R^d$. We
relate the emerging theory of convex neural codes to the established theory of
oriented matroids, both categorically and with respect to geometry and
computational complexity. On the categorical side, we show that the map taking
an acyclic oriented matroid to the code of positive parts of its topes is a
faithful functor. We adapt the oriented matroid ideal introduced by Novik,
Postnikov, and Sturmfels into a functor from the category of oriented matroids
to the category of rings; then, we show that the resulting ring maps naturally
to the neural ring of the matroid's neural code.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For geometry and computational complexity, we show that a code has a
realization with convex polytopes if and only if it lies below the code of a
representable oriented matroid in the partial order of codes introduced by
Jeffs. We show that previously published examples of non-convex codes do not
lie below any oriented matroids, and we construct examples of non-convex codes
lying below non-representable oriented matroids. By way of this construction,
we can apply Mn\&quot;{e}v-Sturmfels universality to show that deciding whether a
combinatorial code is convex is NP-hard.

 &lt;p&gt;We design a physical wave-pulse neural network (WPNN) for both wave and pulse
propagation, which gives more degrees of freedom for neural coding than spike
neural networks (SNN). We define the rules and the information entropy of this
kind of neural network, where the signal speed, arrival time, and the length of
connections between neurons all become crucial parameters for signal coding. We
call it quasi-quantum coding (QQC) since the combination of wave and pulse
signals here behaves like a classical mimic of quantum wave-particle duality,
and can be studied by borrowing some concepts form quantum mechanics. We
present that the quasi-quantum coding can give efficient methods for both sound
and image recognitions. We also discuss the possibility of the wave-pulse
neural network and the quasi-quantum coding methods running on it in biological
brains where both neural oscillations and action potentials are important to
cognition.

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Empirical estimates of the dimensionality of neural population activity are
often much lower than the population size. Similar phenomena are also observed
in trained and designed neural network models. These experimental and
computational results suggest that mapping low-dimensional dynamics to
high-dimensional neural space is a common feature of cortical computation.
Despite the ubiquity of this observation, the constraints arising from such
mapping are poorly understood. Here we consider a specific example of mapping
low-dimensional dynamics to high-dimensional neural activity -- the neural
engineering framework. We analytically solve the framework for the classic ring
model -- a neural network encoding a static or dynamic angular variable. Our
results provide a complete characterization of the success and failure modes
for this model. Based on similarities between this and other frameworks, we
speculate that these results could apply to more general scenarios.

 &lt;p&gt;Within computational neuroscience, informal interactions with modelers often
reveal wildly divergent goals. In this opinion piece, we explicitly address the
diversity of goals that motivate and ultimately influence modeling efforts. We
argue that a wide range of goals can be meaningfully taken to be of highest
importance. A simple informal survey conducted on the Internet confirmed the
diversity of goals in the community. However, different priorities or
preferences of individual researchers can lead to divergent model evaluation
criteria. We propose that many disagreements in evaluating the merit of
computational research stem from differences in goals and not from the
mechanics of constructing, describing, and validating models. We suggest that
authors state explicitly their goals when proposing models so that others can
judge the quality of the research with respect to its stated goals.

 &lt;p&gt;Consciousness while under general anesthesia is a dreadful condition. Various electroencephalogram (EEG)-based technologies have been developed, on the basis of empirical evidence, in order to identify this condition. However, certain electrophysiological phenomena, which seem strongly related with depth of anesthesia in some drugs, appear less consistent with those of other anesthetic drugs. There is a gap between the complexity of the phenomenon of consciousness and its behavioral manifestations, on the one hand, and the empirical nature of the reported electrophysiological markers, which are associated with it, on the other hand. In fact, such a gap might prevent us from progressing toward unified electrophysiological markers of consciousness while under anesthesia, which are applicable to all anesthetic drugs. We believe that there is a need to bridge this conceptual gap. Therefore, in this work, we will try to present a theoretical framework for such bridging. First, we suggest focusing on neuropsychological processes, which seem to have a clear role in the behavioral manifestations of consciousness while under anesthesia but seem, nevertheless, better defined than consciousness itself—such as perception and attention. Then, we suggest analyzing the effects of anesthesia upon these neuropsychological processes, as they are manifested in the EEG signal. Specifically, we will focus on the effects of anesthesia on event-related potentials (ERPs), which seem more easily associable with neuropsychological modeling.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Synaptic transmission between neurons is the basic mechanism for information processing in cortical microcircuits. To date, paired recording from synaptically coupled neurons is the most widely used method which allows a detailed functional characterization of unitary synaptic transmission at the cellular and synaptic level in combination with a structural characterization of both pre- and postsynaptic neurons at the light and electron microscopic level. In this review, we will summarize the many applications of paired recordings to investigate synaptic function and structure. Paired recordings have been used to study the detailed electrophysiological and anatomical properties of synaptically coupled cell pairs within a synaptic microcircuit; this is critical in order to understand the connectivity rules and dynamic properties of synaptic transmission. Paired recordings can also be adopted for quantal analysis of an identified synaptic connection and to study the regulation of synaptic transmission by neuromodulators such as acetylcholine, the monoamines, neuropeptides, and adenosine etc. Taken together, paired recordings from synaptically coupled neurons will remain a very useful approach for a detailed characterization of synaptic transmission not only in the rodent brain but also that of other species including humans.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Multiple TREX mRNA export complex subunits (e.g., THOC1, THOC2, THOC5, THOC6, THOC7) have now been implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), neurodegeneration and cancer. We previously implicated missense and splicing-defective THOC2 variants in NDDs and a broad range of other clinical features. Here we report 10 individuals from nine families with rare missense THOC2 variants including the first case of a recurrent variant (p.Arg77Cys), and an additional individual with an intragenic THOC2 microdeletion (Del-Ex37-38). Ex vivo missense variant testing and patient-derived cell line data from current and published studies show 9 of the 14 missense THOC2 variants result in reduced protein stability. The splicing-defective and deletion variants result in a loss of small regions of the C-terminal THOC2 RNA binding domain (RBD). Interestingly, reduced stability of THOC2 variant proteins has a flow-on effect on the stability of the multi-protein TREX complex; specifically on the other NDD-associated THOC subunits. Our current, expanded cohort refines the core phenotype of THOC2 NDDs to language disorder and/or ID, with a variable severity, and disorders of growth. A subset of affected individuals’ has severe-profound ID, persistent hypotonia and respiratory abnormalities. Further investigations to elucidate the pathophysiological basis for this severe phenotype are warranted.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Laminin-α2-related congenital muscular dystrophy (LAMA2-CMD) is a devastating neuromuscular disease caused by mutations in the LAMA2 gene. These mutations result in the complete absence or truncated expression of the laminin-α2 chain. The α2-chain is a major component of the laminin-211 and laminin-221 isoforms, the predominant laminin isoforms in healthy adult skeletal muscle. Mutations in this chain result in progressive skeletal muscle degeneration as early as neonatally. Laminin-211/221 is a ligand for muscle cell receptors integrin-α7β1 and α-dystroglycan. LAMA2 mutations are correlated with integrin-α7β1 disruption in skeletal muscle. In this review, we will summarize laminin-211/221 interactions with integrin-α7β1 in LAMA2-CMD muscle. Additionally, we will summarize recent developments using upregulation of laminin-111 in the sarcolemma of laminin-α2-deficient muscle. We will discuss potential mechanisms of action by which laminin-111 is able to prevent myopathy. These published studies demonstrate that laminin-111 is a disease modifier of LAMA2-CMD through different methods of delivery. Together, these studies show the potential for laminin-111 therapy as a novel paradigm for the treatment of LAMA2-CMD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 Background&lt;p&gt;Maladaptive reactivity to sensory inputs is commonly observed in neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g., autism, ADHD). Little is known, however, about the underlying neural mechanisms. For some children, atypical sensory reactivity is the primary complaint, despite absence of another identifiable neurodevelopmental diagnosis. Studying Sensory Processing Disorder (SPD) may well provide a window into the neuropathology of these symptoms. It has been proposed that a deficit in sensory integration underlies the SPD phenotype, but objective quantification of sensory integration is lacking. Here we used neural and behavioral measures of multisensory integration (MSI), which would be affected by impaired sensory integration and for which there are well accepted objective measures, to test whether failure to integrate across the senses is associated with atypical sensory reactivity in SPD. An autism group served to determine if observed differences were unique to SPD.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We tested whether children aged 6–16 years with SPD (N = 14) integrate multisensory inputs differently from age-matched typically developing controls (TD: N = 54), or from children with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD: N = 44). Participants performed a simple reaction-time task to the occurrence of auditory, visual, and audiovisual stimuli presented in random order, while high-density recordings of electrical brain activity were made.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Children with SPD showed large reductions in the extent to which they benefited from multisensory inputs compared to TDs. The ASD group showed similarly reduced response speeding to multisensory relative to unisensory inputs. Neural evidence for MSI was seen across all three groups, with the multisensory response differing from the sum of the unisensory responses. Post hoc tests suggested the possibility of enhanced MSI in SPD in timeframes consistent with cortical sensory registration (∼60 ms), followed by reduced MSI during a timeframe consistent with object formation (∼130 ms). The ASD group also showed reduced MSI in the later timeframe.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Children with SPD showed reduction in their ability to benefit from redundant audio-visual inputs, similar to children with ASD. Neurophysiological recordings, on the other hand, showed that major indices of MSI were largely intact, although post hoc testing pointed to periods of potential differential processing. While these exploratory electrophysiological observations point to potential sensory-perceptual differences in multisensory processing in SPD, it remains equally plausible at this stage that later attentional processing differences may yet prove responsible for the multisensory behavioral deficits uncovered here.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Objectives: To explore structural variations of the circle of Willis using three-dimensional time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography (3D-TOF-MRA), and to compare this modality with digital subtraction angiography (DSA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: A total of 819 consecutive patients suspected of having cerebral vascular diseases underwent 3D-TOF-MRA, followed by DSA within 2 weeks. We report accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of 3D-TOF-MRA compared with DSA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The sensitivity and specificity of combined analyses were 90–100 and 98–100%, respectively. The sensitivity and NPV of 3D-TOF-MRA images for A-, C-, D-, and H-types of circle of Willis anomalies were 100%. The specificity, accuracy and sensitivity were all 100% for detecting absence of the anterior communicating artery (ACOA). Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV were all 100% for detecting F-type. The sensitivity and PPV of volume rendered (VR) images for the B-, E-, and G-types were relatively low (85.0, 86.2, and 73.8%, respectively). Maximum intensity projection (MIP) was somewhat better (88.3, 89.2, and 81.8%, respectively). Combined analyses were better still (95.8, 96.1, and 99.0%, respectively). Specificity and NPVs were high (99.3–100%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: 3D-TOF-MRA compares well to DSA for evaluation of the structure of the circle of Willis. As 3D-TOF-MRA is a non-invasive modality, it may be preferred as a means to evaluate structural variations of the circle of Willis.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Tauopathies are neurodegenerative diseases characterized by the presence of aggregates of abnormally phosphorylated Tau. Deciphering the pathophysiological mechanisms that lead from the alteration of Tau biology to neuronal death depends on the identification of Tau cellular partners. Combining genetic and transcriptomic analyses in Drosophila, we identified 77 new modulators of human Tau-induced toxicity, bringing to 301 the number of Tau genetic interactors identified so far in flies. Network analysis showed that 229 of these genetic modulators constitute a connected network. The addition of 77 new genes strengthened the network structure, increased the intergenic connectivity and brought up key hubs with high connectivities, namely Src64B/FYN, Src42A/FRK, kuz/ADAM10, heph/PTBP1, scrib/SCRIB, and Cam/CALM3. Interestingly, we established for the first time a genetic link between Tau-induced toxicity and ADAM10, a recognized Alzheimer Disease protective factor. In addition, our data support the importance of the presynaptic compartment in mediating Tau toxicity.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;This paper examines the problem of diffeomorphic image registration in the presence of differing image intensity profiles and sparsely sampled, missing, or damaged tissue. Our motivation comes from the problem of aligning 3D brain MRI with 100-micron isotropic resolution to histology sections at 1 × 1 × 1,000-micron resolution with multiple varying stains. We pose registration as a penalized Bayesian estimation, exploiting statistical models of image formation where the target images are modeled as sparse and noisy observations of the atlas. In this injective setting, there is no assumption of symmetry between atlas and target. Cross-modality image matching is achieved by jointly estimating polynomial transformations of the atlas intensity. Missing data is accommodated via a multiple atlas selection procedure where several atlas images may be of homogeneous intensity and correspond to “background” or “artifact.” The two concepts are combined within an Expectation-Maximization algorithm, where atlas selection posteriors and deformation parameters are updated iteratively and polynomial coefficients are computed in closed form. We validate our method with simulated images, examples from neuropathology, and a standard benchmarking dataset. Finally, we apply it to reconstructing digital pathology and MRI in standard atlas coordinates. By using a standard convolutional neural network to detect tau tangles in histology slices, this registration method enabled us to quantify the 3D density distribution of tauopathy throughout the medial temporal lobe of an Alzheimer's disease postmortem specimen.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Large-scale research integration is contingent on seamless access to data in standardized formats. Standards enable researchers to understand external experiment structures, pool results, and apply homogeneous preprocessing and analysis workflows. Particularly, they facilitate these features without the need for numerous potentially confounding compatibility add-ons. In small animal magnetic resonance imaging, an overwhelming proportion of data is acquired via the ParaVision software of the Bruker Corporation. The original data structure is predominantly transparent, but fundamentally incompatible with modern pipelines. Additionally, it sources metadata from free-field operator input, which diverges strongly between laboratories and researchers. In this article we present an open-source workflow which automatically converts and reposits data from the ParaVision structure into the widely supported and openly documented Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS). Complementing this workflow we also present operator guidelines for appropriate ParaVision data input, and a programmatic walk-through detailing how preexisting scans with uninterpretable metadata records can easily be made compliant after the acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The aim of the study was to investigate the neural processing of congruent vs. incongruent affective audiovisual information (facial expressions and music) by means of ERPs (Event Related Potentials) recordings. Stimuli were 200 infant faces displaying Happiness, Relaxation, Sadness, Distress and 32 piano musical pieces conveying the same emotional states (as specifically assessed). Music and faces were presented simultaneously, and paired so that in half cases they were emotionally congruent or incongruent. Twenty subjects were told to pay attention and respond to infrequent targets (adult neutral faces) while their EEG was recorded from 128 channels. The face-related N170 (160–180 ms) component was the earliest response affected by the emotional content of faces (particularly by distress), while visual P300 (250–450 ms) and auditory N400 (350–550 ms) responses were specifically modulated by the emotional content of both facial expressions and musical pieces. Face/music emotional incongruence elicited a wide N400 negativity indicating the detection of a mismatch in the expressed emotion. A swLORETA inverse solution applied to N400 (difference wave Incong. – Cong.), showed the crucial role of Inferior and Superior Temporal Gyri in the multimodal representation of emotional information extracted from faces and music. Furthermore, the prefrontal cortex (superior and medial, BA 10) was also strongly active, possibly supporting working memory. The data hints at a common system for representing emotional information derived by social cognition and music processing, including uncus and cuneus.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Arithmetic abilities are among the most important school-taught skills and form the basis for higher mathematical competencies. At the same time, their acquisition and application can be challenging. Hence, there is broad interest in methods to improve arithmetic abilities. One promising method is transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). In the present study, we compared two anodal tDCS protocols in their efficacy to improve arithmetic performance and working memory. In addition, we investigated stimulation-related electrophysiological changes. Three groups of participants solved arithmetic problems (additions and subtractions) and an n-back task before, during, and after receiving either frontal or parietal anodal tDCS (25 min; 1 mA) or sham stimulation. EEG was simultaneously recorded to assess stimulation effects on event-related (de-) synchronisation (ERS/ERD) in theta and alpha bands. Persons receiving frontal stimulation showed an acceleration of calculation speed in large subtractions from before to during and after stimulation. However, a comparable, but delayed (apparent only after stimulation) increase was also found in the sham stimulation group, while it was absent in the group receiving parietal stimulation. In additions and small subtractions as well as the working memory task, analyses showed no effects of stimulation. Results of ERS/ERD during large subtractions indicate changes in ERS/ERD patterns over time. In the left hemisphere there was a change from theta band ERD to ERS in all three groups, whereas a similar change in the right hemisphere was restricted to the sham group. Taken together, tDCS did not lead to a general improvement of arithmetic performance. However, results indicate that frontal stimulation accelerated training gains, while parietal stimulation halted them. The absence of general performance improvements, but acceleration of training effects might be a further indicator of the advantages of using tDCS as training or learning support over tDCS as a sole performance enhancer.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Objective: To examine the short- and long-term clinical outcomes of the bilateral subthalamic nucleus (STN) and globus pallidus internus (GPi) deep brain stimulation (DBS) on gait and axial symptoms in Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients. Available data have been inconsistent and mostly short-term regarding the effect of both brain targets on gait and axial symptoms. We aimed to identify potential target specific differences at 3-year follow-up from a large single-center experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We retrospectively reviewed short-term (6-month follow-up) and long-term (36-month follow-up) changes in the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Part II and III total scores of 72 PD patients (53 with bilateral STN-DBS and 19 with bilateral GPi-DBS). An interdisciplinary team made target-specific decisions for each DBS patient. We analyzed changes in gait and axial subscores derived from UPDRS II and III.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: In both the STN- and GPi-DBS cohorts, we observed no significant differences in gait and axial UPDRS derived subscores in the off-med/on stimulation state at long-term follow-up when compared to baseline. On-med axial scores remained similar in the short-term but worsened in both groups (STN, 2.23 ± 3.43, p &amp;lt; 0.001; GPi, 2.53 ± 2.37, p &amp;lt; 0.01) in the long-term possibly due to disease progression. At long-term follow-up, the UPDRS III off-med/on stimulation scores worsened but were persistently improved from baseline in both groups (−9.07 ± 13.9, p &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: The study showed that long-term both STN- and GPi-DBS had a similar effect on gait and axial symptoms in UPDRS derived subscores at 36-month follow-up despite potential baseline differences in criteria for selection of each target. More sophisticated measures of gait and balance beyond the categorical UPDRS score will be needed for future studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Previous studies have shown that hand actions to visual objects are affected both by perceptual factors and by action goals. Our aim was to study how these processes affected hand actions in chronic stroke patients, based on whether they had limb apraxia. Twenty-two left hemisphere, chronic stroke patients were measured on neuropsychological tasks of limb apraxia, which was identified in a subgroup of 10 patients. All patients underwent testing on a separate task of making simple reach and grasp actions to a cup. Their performance was compared to a group of 18 healthy age-matched volunteers. Participants were instructed to grasp the top or bottom of a cup to either lift or turn it over so as to end with a hand position that was either comfortable or uncomfortable. This task tested the influence of the compatibility of hand–cup orientation, as well as goals driven by the end-state comfort of the hand, on action selection for object manipulation. Participants’ performance was measured in terms of error rates, and speed of initiation and reaching (movement time) to the object. The patients’ performance was significantly delayed, and error rates increased when reaching to grasp a cup under conditions of poor compatibility and end-state comfort. The subgroup of patients with apraxia showed a decreased influence of compatibility of hand interaction with the cup, with increased error rates and delayed response times, compared to patients with no apraxia and healthy volunteers. This is despite the fact they did not display significant deficits on neuropsychological tasks of real object use. The study shows that patients with apraxia have difficulties in selecting elements of object-directed actions, pertaining to both habitual and goal-directed factors.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;IRSp53 (also known as BAIAP2) is an abundant excitatory postsynaptic scaffolding protein implicated in autism spectrum disorders (ASD), schizophrenia, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). IRSp53 is expressed in different cell types across different brain regions, although it remains unclear how IRSp53 deletion in different cell types affects brain functions and behaviors in mice. Here, we deleted IRSp53 in excitatory and inhibitory neurons in mice and compared resulting phenotypes in males and females. IRSp53 deletion in excitatory neurons driven by Emx1 leads to strong social deficits and hyperactivity without affecting anxiety-like behavior, whereas IRSp53 deletion in inhibitory neurons driven by Viaat has minimal impacts on these behaviors in male mice. In female mice, excitatory neuronal IRSp53 deletion induces hyperactivity but moderate social deficits. Excitatory neuronal IRSp53 deletion in male mice induces an increased ratio of evoked excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission (E/I ratio) in layer V pyramidal neurons in the prelimbic region of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), whereas the same mutation does not alter the E/I ratio in female neurons. These results suggest that IRSp53 deletion in excitatory and inhibitory neurons and in male and female mice has distinct impacts on behaviors and synaptic transmission.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Glial cells are multifunctional, non-neuronal components of the central nervous system with diverse phenotypes that have gained much attention for their close involvement in neuroinflammation and neurodegenerative diseases. Glial phenotypes are primarily characterized by their structural and functional changes in response to various stimuli, which can be either neuroprotective or neurotoxic. The reliance of neurons on glial cells is essential to fulfill the energy demands of the brain for its proper functioning. Moreover, the glial cells perform distinct functions to regulate their own metabolic activities, as well as work in close conjunction with neurons through various secreted signaling or guidance molecules, thereby constituting a complex network of neuron-glial interactions in health and disease. The emerging evidence suggests that, in disease conditions, the metabolic alterations in the glial cells can induce structural and functional changes together with neuronal dysfunction indicating the importance of neuron–glia interactions in the pathophysiology of neurological disorders. This review covers the recent developments that implicate the regulation of glial phenotypic changes and its consequences on neuron–glia interactions in neurological disorders. Finally, we discuss the possibilities and challenges of targeting glial metabolism as a strategy to treat neurological disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a specific form of hemorrhagic stroke that frequently causes intracranial hypertension. The choroid plexus (CP) of the brain ventricles is responsible for producing cerebrospinal fluid and forms the blood – cerebrospinal fluid barrier. The aim of the current study was to determine whether SAH induces an immune cell reaction in the CP and whether the resulting increase in intracranial pressure (ICP) itself can lead to cellular changes in the CP. SAH was induced by injecting non-heparinized autologous blood to the cisterna magna. Artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) instead of blood was used to assess influence of increased ICP alone. SAH and ACSF animals were left to survive for 1, 3, and 7 days. SAH induced significantly increased numbers of M1 (ED1+, CCR7+) and M2 (ED2+, CD206+) macrophages as well as MHC-II+ antigen presenting cells (APC) compared to naïve and ACSF animals. Increased numbers of ED1+ macrophages and APC were found in the CP only 3 and 7 days after ACSF injection, while ED2+ macrophage number did not increase. CD3+ T cells were not found in any of the animals. Following SAH, proliferation activity in the CP gradually increased over time while ACSF application induced higher cellular proliferation only 1 and 3 days after injection. Our results show that SAH induces an immune reaction in the CP resulting in an increase in the number of several macrophage types in the epiplexus position. Moreover, we also found that increased ICP due to ACSF application induced both an immune reaction and increased proliferation of epiplexus cells in the CP. These findings indicate that increased ICP, and not just blood, contributes to cellular changes in the CP following SAH.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Cellular senescence is a homeostatic biological process characterized by a permanent state of cell cycle arrest that can contribute to the decline of the regenerative potential and function of tissues. The increased presence of senescent cells in different neurodegenerative diseases suggests the contribution of senescence in the pathophysiology of these disorders. Although several factors can induce senescence, DNA damage, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and altered proteostasis have been shown to play a role in its onset. Oxidative stress contributes to accelerated aging and cognitive dysfunction stages affecting neurogenesis, neuronal differentiation, connectivity, and survival. During later life stages, it is implicated in the progression of cognitive decline, synapse loss, and neuronal degeneration. Also, neuroinflammation exacerbates oxidative stress, synaptic dysfunction, and neuronal death through the harmful effects of pro-inflammatory cytokines on cell proliferation and maturation. Both oxidative stress and neuroinflammation can induce DNA damage and alterations in DNA repair that, in turn, can exacerbate them. Another important feature associated with senescence is altered proteostasis. Because of the disruption in the function and balance of the proteome, senescence can modify the proper synthesis, folding, quality control, and degradation rate of proteins producing, in some diseases, misfolded proteins or aggregation of abnormal proteins. There is an extensive body of literature that associates cellular senescence with several neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Down syndrome (DS), and Parkinson’s disease (PD). This review summarizes the evidence of the shared neuropathological events in these neurodegenerative diseases and the implication of cellular senescence in their onset or aggravation. Understanding the role that cellular senescence plays in them could help to develop new therapeutic strategies.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Human brain organoids (mini-brains) consist of self-organized three-dimensional (3D) neural tissue which can be derived from reprogrammed adult cells and maintained for months in culture. These 3D structures manifest substantial potential for the modeling of neurodegenerative diseases and pave the way for personalized medicine. However, as these 3D brain models can express the whole human genetic complexity, it is critical to have access to isogenic mini-brains that only differ in specific and controlled genetic variables. Genetic engineering based on retroviral vectors is incompatible with the long-term modeling needed here and implies a risk of random integration while methods using CRISPR-Cas9 are still too complex to adapt to stem cells. We demonstrate in this study that our strategy which relies on an episomal plasmid vector derived from the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) offers a simple and robust approach, avoiding the remaining caveats of mini-brain models. For this proof-of-concept, we used a normal tau protein with a fluorescent tag and a mutant genetic form (P301S) leading to Fronto-Temporal Dementia. Isogenic cell lines were obtained which were stable for more than 30 passages expressing either form. We show that the presence of the plasmid in the cells does not interfere with the mini-brain differentiation protocol and obtain the development of a pathologically relevant phenotype in cerebral organoids, with pathological hyperphosphorylation of the tau protein. Such a simple and versatile genetic strategy opens up the full potential of human organoids to contribute to disease modeling, personalized medicine and testing of therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Objective&lt;p&gt;Our study was designed to investigate whether the indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO)-mediated kynurenine/tryptophan (KYN/TRP) pathway participates in the development of emotional deficits from ethanol addiction/withdrawal mice.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;The expression of proinflammatory factors, including tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and interleukin-6 (IL-6), was tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The IDO levels in the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and amygdala were measured by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and western blot, and the neurotransmitters were tested by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Emotional deficits of mice were evaluated by behavioral tests.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Expression levels of inflammatory factors (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6) were increased in mice after 4 weeks of alcohol exposure. As for indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) expression, only the subtype IDO1 was found to increase at both mRNA level and protein level in all the tested brain regions of ethanol addiction/withdrawal mice. In behavioral tests, mice exposed to alcohol showed gradually declined memory function accompanied by anxiety-like and depressive-like behaviors. Meanwhile, increased expression of KYN, decreased expression of 5-HT, and abnormal expression of 3-HK and KA were found in the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and amygdala of ethanol addiction/withdrawal mice. Interestingly, the IDO1 inhibitor, 1-methyl-L-tryptophan (1-MT), reversed all above alterations induced by ethanol in mice.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Our results suggested that the TRP/KYN pathway, medicated by IDO1, in the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and amygdala, plays an important role in the development of emotional deficits caused by ethanol addiction and withdrawal.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors (GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;Rs) play a crucial role in mediating inhibition in the adult brain. In spite of progress in describing (mainly) the static structures of this receptor, the molecular mechanisms underlying its activation remain unclear. It is known that in the α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;β&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;γ&lt;sub&gt;2L&lt;/sub&gt; receptors, the mutation of the β&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;E155 residue, at the orthosteric binding site, strongly impairs the receptor activation, but the molecular and kinetic mechanisms of this effect remain elusive. Herein, we investigated the impact of the β&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;E155C mutation on binding and gating of the α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;β&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;γ&lt;sub&gt;2L&lt;/sub&gt; receptor. To this end, we combined the macroscopic and single-channel analysis, the use of different agonists [GABA and muscimol (MSC)] and flurazepam (FLU) as a modulator. As expected, the β&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;E155C mutation caused a vast right shift of the dose–response (for GABA and MSC) and, additionally, dramatic changes in the time course of current responses, indicative of alterations in gating. Mutated receptors showed reduced maximum open probability and enhanced receptor spontaneous activity. Model simulations for macroscopic currents revealed that the primary effect of the mutation was the downregulation of the preactivation (flipping) rate. Experiments with MSC and FLU further confirmed a reduction in the preactivation rate. Our single-channel analysis revealed the mutation impact mainly on the second component in the shut times distributions. Based on model simulations, this finding further confirms that this mutation affects mostly the preactivation transition, supporting thus the macroscopic data. Altogether, we provide new evidence that the β&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;E155 residue is involved in both binding and gating (primarily preactivation).&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The reelin haploinsufficient heterozygous reeler mice (HRM), an animal model of schizophrenia, have altered mesolimbic dopaminergic pathways and share similar neurochemical and behavioral properties with patients with schizophrenia. Dysfunctional neural circuitry with impaired gamma (γ) oscillation (30–80 Hz) has been implicated in abnormal cognition in patients with schizophrenia. However, the function of neural circuitry in terms of γ oscillation and its modulation by dopamine (DA) has not been reported in HRM. In this study, first, we recorded γ oscillations in CA3 from wild-type mice (WTM) and HRM hippocampal slices, and we studied the effects of DA on γ oscillations. We found that there was no difference in γ power between WTM and HRM and that DA increased γ power of WTM but not HRM, suggesting that DA modulations of network oscillations in HRM are impaired. Second, we found that N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist MK-801 itself increased γ power and occluded DA-mediated enhancement of γ power in WTM but partially restored DA modulation of γ oscillations in HRM. Third, inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), a downstream molecule of NMDAR, increased γ power and blocked the effects of DA on γ oscillation in WTM and had no significant effect on γ power but largely restored DA modulation of γ oscillations in HRM. Our results reveal that impaired DA function in HRM is associated with dysregulated NMDAR–PI3K signaling, a mechanism that may be relevant in the pathology of schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Zebrafish do not possess the typical astrocytes that are found in mammalian systems. In some brain areas, this teleost has radial glia that appears to perform astrocyte-like functions, but these cells have not been described in the zebrafish olfactory bulb. Mammalian astrocytes facilitate neuroplasticity and undergo astrogliosis after insult. The role of these cells in the zebrafish olfactory system after the damage has been poorly explored. This is important to examine because zebrafish have a high degree of neuroplasticity and the olfactory bulb is a brain area renowned for plasticity. The goal of this study was to explore the potential role of zebrafish astrocytes in the olfactory bulb damage response, with a goal to exploit the high level of regeneration in this system. We found that anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) labels numerous processes in the zebrafish olfactory bulb that are concentrated in the nerve and glomerular layers (GL) and do not show radial glial-like morphology. We propose to term this astroglia, since their location and response to damage suggests that they are similar in function to the mammalian astrocyte. To induce repetitive peripheral damage to the olfactory organ, a wax plug was inserted into the nasal cavity of adult zebrafish every 12 h for up to 7 days; this crushes the olfactory organ and leads to degradation of olfactory sensory neuron axons that project to the olfactory bulb. After 1 day, we found a significant increase in astroglial labeling in the affected bulb when compared to the internal control bulb and astroglial branches appeared to increase in number and size. By the third day of plug insertions there was no significant difference in astroglial labeling between the affected bulb and the internal control bulb. These data lead us to believe that astrogliosis does occur in the presence of peripheral damage, but this process attenuates within 1 week and no glial scar is evident upon recovery from the damage. Further exploration of astrocytes in zebrafish, in particular this apparent attenuation of astrogliosis, has the potential to elucidate key differences in glial function between teleosts and mammals.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The cat brain is a useful model for neuroscientific research and with the increasing use of advanced neuroimaging techniques there is a need for an open-source stereotaxic white matter brain atlas to accompany the cortical gray matter atlas, currently available. A stereotaxic white matter atlas would facilitate anatomic registration and segmentation of the white matter to aid in lesion localization or standardized regional analysis of specific regions of the white matter. In this article, we document the creation of a stereotaxic feline white matter atlas from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data obtained from a population of eight mesaticephalic felines. Deterministic tractography reconstructions were performed to create tract priors for the major white matter projections of Corpus callosum (CC), fornix, cingulum, uncinate, Corona Radiata (CR), Corticospinal tract (CST), inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF), Superior Longitudinal Fasciculus (SLF), and the cerebellar tracts. T1-weighted, fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), radial diffusivity (RD) and axial diffusivity (AD) population maps were generated. The volume, mean tract length and mean FA, MD, AD and RD values for each tract prior were documented. A structural connectome was then created using previously published cortical priors and the connectivity metrics for all cortical regions documented. The provided white matter atlas, diffusivity maps, tract priors and connectome will be a valuable resource for anatomical, pathological and translational neuroimaging research in the feline model. Multi-atlas population maps and segmentation priors are available at Cornell’s digital repository: https://ecommons.cornell.edu/handle/1813/58775.2.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Age-related hearing loss, one of the most frequently diagnosed disabilities in industrialized countries, may result from declining levels of GABA in the aging inferior colliculus (IC). However, the mechanisms of aging and subsequent disruptions of temporal processing in elderly hearing abilities are still being investigated. Perineuronal nets (PNs) are a specialized form of the extracellular matrix and have been linked to GABAergic neurotransmission and to the regulation of structural and synaptic plasticity. We sought to determine whether the density of PNs in the IC changes with age. We combined Wisteria floribunda agglutinin (WFA) staining with immunohistochemistry to glutamic acid decarboxylase in three age groups of Fischer Brown Norway (FBN) rats. The density of PNs on GABAergic and non-GABAergic cells in the three major subdivisions of the IC was quantified. Results first demonstrate that the density of PNs in the FBN IC increase with age. The greatest increases of PN density from young to old age occurred in the central IC (67% increase) and dorsal IC (117% increase). Second, in the young IC, PNs surround non-GABAergic and GABAergic cells with the majority of PNs surrounding the former. The increase of PNs with age in the IC occurred on both non-GABAergic and GABAergic populations. The average density of PN-surrounded non-GABAergic cells increased from 84.9 PNs/mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in the young to 134.2 PNs/mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in the old. While the density of PN-surrounded GABAergic cells increased from 26 PNs/mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in the young to 40.6 PNs/mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in the old. The causality is unclear, but increases in PN density in old age may play a role in altered auditory processing in the elderly, or may lead to further changes in IC plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Vascular pulsations, contractions of vascular smooth muscle cells and breathing have been reported to foster movement and clearance of interstitial and cerebrospinal fluids from the brain. The aim of this study was to estimate the contribution of these vital functions. We compared the spread of an injected hydrophilic tracer (Fluoro-Emerald, a 10 kDa fluorescein-coupled dextran amine) in the brains of live anesthetized and sacrificed rats at 30 and 90 min after injection. To determine the overall pattern of distribution of tracers, we created 3D-reconstructions of the horizontal transections of the whole brain. Immunofluorescence staining with laminin and collagen IV was performed to determine the pattern of distribution of tracer in relation to the cerebrovascular basement membranes. We found that diffusion was widely restricted to the periventricular region in sacrificed rats with no spread to the contralateral hemisphere, while the bulk flow occurred along the vasculature and reached the surface and the contralateral hemisphere as soon as 30 min after injection in live anesthetized animals. The tracer appeared to be localized along the vascular basement membranes and along fiber tracts as reported previously. Thus, our data indicate that vital functions are essential for the remote movement of extracellular fluids within the cerebral parenchyma.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Background: There is growing evidence supporting behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) as extreme points of a disease spectrum. The aim of this study was to delineate the common and different patterns of gray matter atrophy associated with bvFTD and with ALS by pooling together the results of previous voxel-based morphometry (VBM) studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We retrieved VBM studies that investigated gray matter atrophy in bvFTD patients vs. controls and in ALS patients vs. controls. Stereotactic data were extracted from those studies and subsequently tested for convergence and differences using activation likelihood estimation (ALE). A behavioral analysis using the BrainMap database was performed to assess the functional roles of the regions affected by bvFTD and/or ALS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Our study demonstrated a convergence of gray matter atrophy in the frontolimbic structures that involve the bilateral anterior insula and anterior cingulate cortex. Comparing the pattern of GM atrophy in bvFTD and ALS patients revealed greater atrophy in the frontomedial cortex, bilateral caudate, left anterior insula, and right thalamus in those with bvFTD and a higher degree of atrophy in the right motor cortex of those with ALS. Behavioral analysis revealed that the pattern of the affected regions contributed to the dysfunction of emotional and cognitive processing in bvFTD patients and the dysfunction of motor execution in ALS patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Our results revealed a shared neural basis between bvFTD and ALS subjects, as well as a specific and distinct neural signature that underpinned the clinical manifestations of those two diseases. Those findings outlined the role of the frontomedial-caudate circuit in the development of bvFTD-like deficits in ALS patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Neural progenitor cells (NPCs) have great potentials in cell replacement therapy for neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), by promoting neurogenesis associated with hippocampal memory improvement. Ephrin receptors and angiogenic growth factor receptors have a marked impact on the proliferation and differentiation of NPCs. Although ephrin receptor A4 (EphA4) was shown to directly interact with platelet-derived growth factor receptor β (PDGFRβ), the functional effects of this interaction on neurogenesis in cultured NPCs and adult hippocampus have not yet been studied. Immunoprecipitation demonstrated that EphA4 directly interacted with PDGFRβ in NPCs under ligand stimulation. Ephrin-A1 and PDGF-platelet-derived growth factor BB (BB) significantly increased proliferation and neuronal differentiation of NPCs, which was further augmented by combined treatment of Ephrin-A1 and PDGF-BB. We also found that ligand-dependent proliferation and neuronal differentiation were inhibited by the dominant-negative EphA4 mutant or a PDGFR inhibitor. Most importantly, injection of ephrin-A1 and/or PDGF-BB promoted hippocampal NPC proliferation in the APP/PS1 mouse model of AD, indicating that direct interaction of EphA4 with PDGFRβ plays a functional role on neurogenesis in vivo. Finally, studies in NPCs showed that the EphA4/PDGFRβ/FGFR1/FRS2α complex formed by ligand stimulation is involved in neurogenesis via ERK signaling. The present findings provided a novel insight into the functional role of direct interaction of EphA4 and PDGFRβ in neurogenesis, implicating its potential use for treating neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Amyloids are a class of protein with unique self-aggregation properties, and their aberrant accumulation can lead to cellular dysfunctions associated with neurodegenerative diseases. While genetic and environmental factors can influence amyloid formation, molecular triggers and/or facilitators are not well defined. Growing evidence suggests that non-identical amyloid proteins may accelerate reciprocal amyloid aggregation in a prion-like fashion. While humans encode ~30 amyloidogenic proteins, the gut microbiome also produces functional amyloids. For example, curli are cell surface amyloid proteins abundantly expressed by certain gut bacteria. In mice overexpressing the human amyloid α-synuclein (αSyn), we reveal that colonization with curli-producing &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; promotes αSyn pathology in the gut and the brain. Curli expression is required for &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; to exacerbate αSyn-induced behavioral deficits, including intestinal and motor impairments. Purified curli subunits accelerate αSyn aggregation in biochemical assays, while oral treatment of mice with a gut-restricted amyloid inhibitor prevents curli-mediated acceleration of pathology and behavioral abnormalities. We propose that exposure to microbial amyloids in the gastrointestinal tract can accelerate αSyn aggregation and disease in the gut and the brain.</content>

 In higher plants, germline differentiation occurs during a relatively short period within developing flowers. Understanding of the mechanisms that govern germline differentiation lags behind other plant developmental processes. This is largely because the germline is restricted to relatively few cells buried deep within floral tissues, which makes them difficult to study. To overcome this limitation, we have developed a methodology for live imaging of the germ cell lineage within floral organs of Arabidopsis using light sheet fluorescence microscopy. We have established reporter lines, cultivation conditions, and imaging protocols for high-resolution microscopy of developing flowers continuously for up to several days. We used multiview imagining to reconstruct a three-dimensional model of a flower at subcellular resolution. We demonstrate the power of this approach by capturing male and female meiosis, asymmetric pollen division, movement of meiotic chromosomes, and unusual restitution mitosis in tapetum cells. This method will enable new avenues of research into plant sexual reproduction.</content>

 Every movement ends in a period of stillness. Current models assume that commands that hold the limb at a target location do not depend on the commands that moved the limb to that location. Here, we report a surprising relationship between movement and posture in primates: on a within-trial basis, the commands that hold the arm and finger at a target location depend on the mathematical integration of the commands that moved the limb to that location. Following damage to the corticospinal tract, both the move and hold period commands become more variable. However, the hold period commands retain their dependence on the integral of the move period commands. Thus, our data suggest that the postural controller possesses a feedforward module that uses move commands to calculate a component of hold commands. This computation may arise within an unknown subcortical system that integrates cortical commands to stabilize limb posture.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Post-translational control of PERIOD stability by Casein Kinase 1δ and ε (CK1) plays a key regulatory role in metazoan circadian rhythms. Despite the deep evolutionary conservation of CK1 in eukaryotes, little is known about its regulation and the factors that influence substrate selectivity on functionally antagonistic sites in PERIOD that directly control circadian period. Here we describe a molecular switch involving a highly conserved anion binding site in CK1. This switch controls conformation of the kinase activation loop and determines which sites on mammalian PER2 are preferentially phosphorylated, thereby directly regulating PER2 stability. Integrated experimental and computational studies shed light on the allosteric linkage between two anion binding sites that dynamically regulate kinase activity. We show that period-altering kinase mutations from humans to &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; differentially modulate this activation loop switch to elicit predictable changes in PER2 stability, providing a foundation to understand and further manipulate CK1 regulation of circadian rhythms.</content>

 Guanine-rich DNA sequences can fold into four-stranded G-quadruplex (G4-DNA) structures. G4-DNA regulates replication and transcription, at least in cancer cells. Here, we demonstrate that, in neurons, pharmacologically stabilizing G4-DNA with G4 ligands strongly downregulates the &lt;i&gt;Atg7&lt;/i&gt; gene. &lt;i&gt;Atg7&lt;/i&gt; is a critical gene for the initiation of autophagy that exhibits decreased transcription with aging. Using an in vitro assay, we show that a putative G-quadruplex-forming sequence (PQFS) in the first intron of the &lt;i&gt;Atg7&lt;/i&gt; gene folds into a G4. An antibody specific to G4-DNA and the G4-DNA-binding protein PC4 bind to the &lt;i&gt;Atg7&lt;/i&gt; PQFS. Mice treated with a G4 stabilizer develop memory deficits. Brain samples from aged mice contain G4-DNA structures that are absent in brain samples from young mice. Overexpressing the G4-DNA helicase Pif1 in neurons exposed to the G4 stabilizer improves phenotypes associated with G4-DNA stabilization. Our findings indicate that G4-DNA is a novel pathway for regulating autophagy in neurons.</content>

 Many biological features are conserved and thus considered to be resistant to evolutionary change. While rapid genetic adaptation following the removal of conserved genes has been observed, we often lack a mechanistic understanding of how adaptation happens. We used the budding yeast, &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt;, to investigate the evolutionary plasticity of chromosome metabolism, a network of evolutionary conserved modules. We experimentally evolved cells constitutively experiencing DNA replication stress caused by the absence of Ctf4, a protein that coordinates the enzymatic activities at replication forks. Parallel populations adapted to replication stress, over 1000 generations, by acquiring multiple, concerted mutations. These mutations altered conserved features of two chromosome metabolism modules, DNA replication and sister chromatid cohesion, and inactivated a third, the DNA damage checkpoint. The selected mutations define a functionally reproducible evolutionary trajectory. We suggest that the evolutionary plasticity of chromosome metabolism has implications for genome evolution in natural populations and cancer.</content>

 The signal regulated transcription factors (SRTFs) control the ultimate transcriptional output of signaling pathways. Here, we examined a family of FGF-induced SRTFs – &lt;i&gt;Etv1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Etv 4&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Etv 5&lt;/i&gt; – in murine lens development. Contrary to FGF receptor mutants that displayed loss of ERK signaling and defective cell differentiation, &lt;i&gt;Etv&lt;/i&gt; deficiency augmented ERK phosphorylation without disrupting the normal lens fiber gene expression. Instead, the transitional zone for lens differentiation was shifted anteriorly as a result of reduced Jag1-Notch signaling. We also showed that Etv proteins suppresses mTOR activity by promoting &lt;i&gt;Tsc2&lt;/i&gt; expression, which is necessary for the nuclei clearance in mature lens. These results revealed the functional divergence between Etv and FGF in lens development, demonstrating that these SRTFs can operate outside the confine of their upstream signaling.</content>

 Single cell isolation from helminth-infected murine intestines has been notoriously difficult, due to the strong anti-parasite type 2 immune responses that drive mucus production, tissue remodeling and immune cell infiltration. Through the systematic optimization of a standard intestinal digestion protocol, we were able to successfully isolate millions of immune cells from the heavily infected duodenum. To validate that these cells gave an accurate representation of intestinal immune responses, we analyzed them using a high-dimensional spectral flow cytometry panel and confirmed our findings by confocal microscopy. Our cell isolation protocol and high-dimensional analysis allowed us to identify many known hallmarks of anti-parasite immune responses throughout the entire course of helminth infection and has the potential to accelerate single-cell discoveries of local helminth immune responses that have previously been unfeasible.</content>

 Biological age measurements (BAs) assess aging-related physiological change and predict health risks among individuals of the same chronological age (CA). Multiple BAs have been proposed and are well studied individually but not jointly. We included 845 individuals and 3973 repeated measurements from a Swedish population-based cohort and examined longitudinal trajectories, correlations, and mortality associations of nine BAs across 20 years follow-up. We found the longitudinal growth of functional BAs accelerated around age 70; average levels of BA curves differed by sex across the age span (50–90 years). All BAs were correlated to varying degrees; correlations were mostly explained by CA. Individually, all BAs except for telomere length were associated with mortality risk independently of CA. The largest effects were seen for methylation age estimators (GrimAge) and the frailty index (FI). In joint models, two methylation age estimators (Horvath and GrimAge) and FI remained predictive, suggesting they are complementary in predicting mortality.</content>

 The lateral habenula (LHb) is an epithalamic brain structure critical for processing and adapting to negative action outcomes. However, despite the importance of LHb to behavior and the clear anatomical and molecular diversity of LHb neurons, the neuron types of the habenula remain unknown. Here, we use high-throughput single-cell transcriptional profiling, monosynaptic retrograde tracing, and multiplexed FISH to characterize the cells of the mouse habenula. We find five subtypes of neurons in the medial habenula (MHb) that are organized into anatomical subregions. In the LHb, we describe four neuronal subtypes and show that they differentially target dopaminergic and GABAergic cells in the ventral tegmental area (VTA). These data provide a valuable resource for future study of habenular function and dysfunction and demonstrate neuronal subtype specificity in the LHb-VTA circuit.</content>

 Dysfunctions in the GABAergic system lead to various pathological conditions and impaired inhibitory function is one of the causes behind neuropathies characterized by neuronal hyper excitability. The Dlx homeobox genes are involved in the development of nervous system, neural crest, brachial arches and developing appendages. Dlx genes also take part in neuronal migration and differentiation during development, more precisely, in the migration and differentiation of GABAergic neurons. Functional analysis of dlx genes has mainly been carried out in developing zebrafish embryos and larvae; however information regarding the expression and roles of these genes in the adult zebrafish brain is still lacking. The extensive neurogenesis that takes place in the brain of adult zebrafish makes them a good model for the visualization of mechanisms involving dlx genes during adulthood in physiological conditions and during regeneration of the nervous system. We have identified the adult brain regions where transcripts of dlx1a, dlx2a, dlx5a and dlx6a genes are normally found and have confirmed that within telencephalic domains, there is high overlapping expression of the four dlx paralogs with a marker for GABAergic neurons. Co-localization analyses carried with the Tg( dlx6a -1.4kb dlx5a/dlx6a :GFP) reporter line have also shown that in some areas of the diencephalon, cells expressing the dlx5a/6a bigene may have a neural stem cell identity by co-localizing with a Sox2 antibody. Furthermore, investigations in a response to stab wound lesions, have demonstrated a possible participation of the dlx5a/6a bigene, most likely, of dlx5a during the regeneration of the adult zebrafish brain. These data suggest a possible participation of dlx -expressing cells during brain regeneration in adult zebrafish and also provide information on the role of dlx genes under normal physiological conditions in adults.</content>

 One of the few replicated functional brain differences between individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and neurotypical (NT) controls is reduced language lateralization. However, most prior reports relied on comparisons of group-level activation maps or functional markers that had not been validated at the individual-subject level, and/or used tasks that do not isolate language processing from other cognitive processes, complicating interpretation. Furthermore, few prior studies have examined functional responses in other functional networks, as needed to determine the selectivity of the effect. Using fMRI, we compared language lateralization between 28 ASD participants and carefully pairwise-matched controls, with the language regions defined individually with a well-validated language localizer. ASD participants showed less lateralized responses due to stronger right hemisphere activations. Further, this effect did not stem from a ubiquitous reduction in lateralization across the brain: ASD participants did not differ from controls in the lateralization of two other large-scale networks - the Theory of Mind network and the Multiple Demand network. Finally, in an exploratory study, we tested whether reduced language lateralization may also be present in NT individuals with high autistic trait load. Indeed, autistic trait load in a large set of NT participants (n=189) was associated with less lateralized language activations. These results suggest that reduced language lateralization is a robust and spatially selective neural marker of autism, present in individuals with ASD, but also in NT individuals with higher genetic liability for ASD, in line with a continuum model of underlying genetic risk.</content>

 Proper regulation of feeding is important for an organism's well-being and survival. Food intake in Drosophila can be determined in a number of ways, including by measuring the time a fly's proboscis interacts with a food source in the fly liquid-food interaction counter (FLIC). Here, we show that electrical current flowing through flies during this interaction is aversive and leads to a reduction in food intake. Based on the FLIC, we engineer a novel assay, the fly liquid-food electroshock assay (FLEA), which allows for current adjustments for each feeding well. Using the FLEA, we show that both external incentives as well as internal motivational state can serve as drivers for flies to overcome higher current (electric shock) to obtain superior food. Unlike similar assays in which bitterness is the aversive stimulus for the fly to overcome, we show that current perception is not discounted as flies become more food-deprived. The FLEA is therefore a novel assay to accurately measure incentive motivation in Drosophila. Using the FLEA, we also show that neuropeptide F is required for proper perception or processing of an electroshock, a novel function for this neuropeptide involved in processing of external and internal stimuli.</content>

 Major depressive disorder emerges from the complex interactions of biological systems that span across genes and molecules through cells, circuits, networks, and behavior. Establishing how neurobiological processes coalesce to contribute to the onset and maintenance of depression requires a multi-scale approach, encompassing measures of brain structure and function as well as genetic and cell-specific genomic data. Here, we examined anatomical (cortical thickness) and functional (functional variability, global brain connectivity) correlates of depression and negative affect across three population-imaging datasets: UK Biobank, Genome Superstruct Project, and ENIGMA (combined N[≥]23,723). Integrative analyses incorporated measures of cortical gene expression, post-mortem patient transcriptional data, depression GWAS, and single-cell transcription. Neuroimaging correlates of depression and negative affect were consistent across the three independent datasets. Linking ex-vivo gene downregulation with in-vivo neuroimaging, we found that genomic correlates of depression-linked neuroimaging phenotypes tracked gene downregulation in post-mortem cortical tissue samples of patients with depression. Integrated analysis of single-cell and Allen Human Brain Atlas expression data implicated somatostatin interneurons and astrocytes as consistent cell associates of depression, through both in-vivo imaging and ex-vivo cortical gene dysregulation. Providing converging evidence for these observations, GWAS derived polygenic risk for depression was enriched for genes expressed in interneurons, but not glia. Underscoring the translational potential of multi-scale approaches, the genomic correlates of depression-linked brain function and structure were enriched for known and novel disorder relevant molecular pathways. These findings bridge across levels to connect specific genes, cell classes, and biological pathways to in-vivo imaging correlates of depression.</content>

 Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's are associated with the prion-like propagation and aggregation of toxic proteins. A long standing hypothesis that amyloid-beta drives Alzheimer's disease has proven the subject of contemporary controversy; leading to new research in both the role of tau protein and its interaction with amyloid-beta. Conversely, recent work in mathematical modelling has demonstrated the relevance of nonlinear reaction-diffusion type equations to capture essential features of the disease. Such approaches have been further simplified, to network-based models, and offer researchers a powerful set of computationally tractable tools with which to investigate neurodegenerative disease dynamics. Here, we propose a novel, coupled network-based model for a two-protein system that includes an enzymatic interaction term alongside a simple model of aggregate transneuronal damage. We apply this model to test the possible interactions between tau proteins and amyloid-beta and study the complex coupled behaviour between toxic protein clearance and proteopathic propagation. This analysis reveals that amyloid-beta and tau proteins conspire with each other to enhance the nucleation and propagation of different diseases, thus shedding new light on the importance of protein clearance and protein interaction mechanisms in prion-like models of neurodegenerative disease.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is one of the most common inherited intellectual disability (ID) disorders, in which the loss of FMRP protein induces a range of cellular signaling changes primarily through excess protein synthesis. Although neuron-centered molecular and cellular events underlying FXS have been characterized, how different CNS cell types are involved in typical FXS synaptic signaling changes and behavioral phenotypes is largely unknown. Recent evidence suggests that selective loss of astroglial FMRP is able to dysregulate glutamate uptake, increase spine density, and impair motor-skill learning. Here we investigated the effect of astroglial FMRP on synaptic signaling and FXS-related behavioral and learning phenotypes in astroglial Fmr1 cKO and cON mice in which FMRP expression is selectively diminished or restored in astroglia. We found that selective loss of astroglial FMRP contributes to cortical hyperexcitability by enhancing NMDAR-mediated evoked but not spontaneous miniEPSCs and elongating cortical UP state duration. Selective loss of astroglial FMRP is also sufficient to increase locomotor hyperactivity, significantly diminish social novelty preference, and induce memory acquisition and extinction deficits in astroglial Fmr1 cKO mice. Importantly, re-expression of astroglial FMRP is able to significantly rescue the hyperactivity (evoked NMDAR response, UP state duration, and open field test) and social novelty preference in astroglial Fmr1 cON mice. These results demonstrate a profound role of astroglial FMRP in the evoked synaptic signaling, spontaneously occurring cortical UP states, and FXS-related behavioral and learning phenotypes and provide important new insights in the cell type consideration for the FMRP reactivation strategy.</content>

 Ex vivo imaging enables analysis of the human brain at a level of detail that is not possible in vivo with MRI. In particular, histology can be used to study brain tissue at the microscopic level, using a wide array of different stains that highlight different microanatomical features. Complementing MRI with histology has important applications in ex vivo atlas building and in modeling the link between microstructure and macroscopic MR signal. However, histology requires sectioning tissue, hence distorting its 3D structure, particularly in larger human samples. Here, we present an open-source computational pipeline to produce 3D consistent histology reconstructions of the human brain. The pipeline relies on a volumetric MRI scan that serves as undistorted reference, and on an intermediate imaging modality (blockface photography) that bridges the gap between MRI and histology. We present results on 3D histology reconstruction of a whole human hemisphere.</content>

 Little is known about the function of the auxiliary 2{delta} subunits of voltage-gated calcium channels in the retina. We investigated the role of 2{delta}-3 (Cacna2d3) using a mouse in which 2{delta}-3 was knocked out by LacZ insertion. Behavior experiments indicated a normal optokinetic reflex in 2{delta}-3 knockout animals. Strong expression of 2{delta}-3 could be localized to horizontal cells using the LacZ-reporter, but horizontal cell mosaic and currents carried by horizontal cell voltage-gated calcium channels were unchanged by the 2{delta}-3 knockout. In vivo electroretinography revealed unaffected photoreceptor activity and signal transmission to depolarizing bipolar cells. We recorded visual responses of retinal ganglion cells with multi-electrode arrays in scotopic to photopic luminance levels and found subtle changes in 2{delta}-3 knockout retinas. Spontaneous activity in OFF ganglion cells was elevated in all luminance levels. Differential response strength to high- and low-contrast Gaussian white noise was compressed in ON ganglion cells during mesopic ambient luminance and in OFF ganglion cells during scotopic and mesopic ambient luminances. In a subset of ON ganglion cells, we found a sharp increase in baseline spiking after the presentation of drifting gratings in scotopic luminance. This increase happened after gratings of different spatial properties in knockout compared to wild type retinas. In a subset of ON ganglion cells of the 2{delta}-3 knockout, we found altered delays in rebound-like spiking to full-field contrast steps in scotopic luminance. In conclusion, 2{delta}-3 seems to participate in shaping visual responses mostly within brightness regimes when rods or both rods and cones are active.</content>

 Normative modelling is an emerging method for quantifying how individuals deviate from the healthy populational pattern. Several machine learning models have been implemented to develop normative models to investigate brain disorders, including regression, support vector machines and Gaussian process models. With the advance of deep learning technology, the use of deep neural networks has also been proposed. In this study, we assessed normative models based on deep autoencoders using structural neuroimaging data from patients with Alzheimer's disease (n=206) and mild cognitive impairment (n=354). We first trained the autoencoder on an independent dataset (UK Biobank dataset) with 11,034 healthy controls. Then, we estimated how each patient deviated from this norm and established which brain regions were associated to this deviation. Finally, we compared the performance of our normative model against traditional classifiers. As expected, we found that patients exhibited deviations according to the severity of their clinical condition. The model identified medial temporal regions, including the hippocampus, and the ventricular system as critical regions for the calculation of the deviation score. Overall, the normative model had comparable cross-cohort generalizability to traditional classifiers. In order to promote open science, we are making all scripts and the trained models available to the wider research community.</content>

Most viruses have evolved strategies for preventing interferon (IFN) secretion and evading innate immunity. Recent work has shown that viral shutdown of IFN secretion can be viewed as a social trait, since the ability of a given virus to evade IFN-mediated immunity depends on the phenotype of neighbor viruses. Following this idea, we investigate the role of spatial structure in the evolution of innate immunity evasion. For this, we model IFN signaling and viral spread using a spatially explicit approximation that combines a diffusion-reaction model and cellular automaton. Our results indicate that the benefits of preventing IFN secretion for a virus are strongly determined by spatial structure through paracrine IFN signaling. Therefore, innate immunity evasion can evolve as a cooperative or even altruistic trait based on indirect fitness effects that IFN shutdown exerts on other members of the viral population. We identify key factors determining whether evasion from IFN-mediated immunity should evolve, such as population bottlenecks occurring during viral transmission, the relative speed of cellular infection and IFN secretion, and the diffusion properties of the medium.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/AN9UMwyBeOE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Epithelial-mesenchymal heterogeneity implies that cells within the same tumor can exhibit different phenotypes—epithelial, mesenchymal, or one or more hybrid epithelial-mesenchymal phenotypes. This behavior has been reported across cancer types, both &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, and implicated in multiple processes associated with metastatic aggressiveness including immune evasion, collective dissemination of tumor cells, and emergence of cancer cell subpopulations with stem cell-like properties. However, the ability of a population of cancer cells to generate, maintain, and propagate this heterogeneity has remained a mystifying feature. Here, we used a computational modeling approach to show that epithelial-mesenchymal heterogeneity can emerge from the noise in the partitioning of biomolecules (such as RNAs and proteins) among daughter cells during the division of a cancer cell. Our model captures the experimentally observed temporal changes in the fractions of different phenotypes in a population of murine prostate cancer cells, and describes the hysteresis in the population-level dynamics of epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity. The model is further able to predict how factors known to promote a hybrid epithelial-mesenchymal phenotype can alter the phenotypic composition of a population. Finally, we used the model to probe the implications of phenotypic heterogeneity and plasticity for different therapeutic regimens and found that co-targeting of epithelial and mesenchymal cells is likely to be the most effective strategy for restricting tumor growth. By connecting the dynamics of an intracellular circuit to the phenotypic composition of a population, our study serves as a first step towards understanding the generation and maintenance of non-genetic heterogeneity in a population of cancer cells, and towards the therapeutic targeting of phenotypic heterogeneity and plasticity in cancer cell populations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/pd-If0fBoZM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Recent experimental findings indicate that Purkinje cells in the cerebellum represent time intervals by mechanisms other than conventional synaptic weights. These findings add to the theoretical and experimental observations suggesting the presence of intra-cellular mechanisms for adaptation and processing. To account for these experimental results we propose a new biophysical model for time interval learning in a Purkinje cell. The numerical model focuses on a classical delay conditioning task (e.g. eyeblink conditioning) and relies on a few computational steps. In particular, the model posits the activation by the parallel fiber input of a local intra-cellular calcium store which can be modulated by intra-cellular pathways. The reciprocal interaction of the calcium signal with several proteins forming negative and positive feedback loops ensures that the timing of inhibition in the Purkinje cell anticipates the interval between parallel and climbing fiber inputs during training. We systematically test the model ability to learn time intervals at the 150-1000 ms time scale, while observing that learning can also extend to the multiple seconds scale. In agreement with experimental observations we also show that the number of pairings required to learn increases with inter-stimulus interval. Finally, we discuss how this model would allow the cerebellum to detect and generate specific spatio-temporal patterns, a classical theory for cerebellar function.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2RbSj3cH3UE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Genetic perturbation screens using RNA interference (RNAi) have been conducted successfully to identify host factors that are essential for the life cycle of bacteria or viruses. So far, most published studies identified host factors primarily for single pathogens. Furthermore, often only a small subset of genes, e.g., genes encoding kinases, have been targeted. Identification of host factors on a pan-pathogen level, i.e., genes that are crucial for the replication of a diverse group of pathogens has received relatively little attention, despite the fact that such common host factors would be highly relevant, for instance, for devising broad-spectrum anti-pathogenic drugs. Here, we present a novel two-stage procedure for the identification of host factors involved in the replication of different viruses using a combination of random effects models and Markov random walks on a functional interaction network. We first infer candidate genes by jointly analyzing multiple perturbations screens while at the same time adjusting for high variance inherent in these screens. Subsequently the inferred estimates are spread across a network of functional interactions thereby allowing for the analysis of missing genes in the biological studies, smoothing the effect sizes of previously found host factors, and considering a priori pathway information defined over edges of the network. We applied the procedure to RNAi screening data of four different positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses, Hepatitis C virus, Chikungunya virus, Dengue virus and Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and detected novel host factors, including UBC, PLCG1, and DYRK1B, which are predicted to significantly impact the replication cycles of these viruses. We validated the detected host factors experimentally using pharmacological inhibition and an additional siRNA screen and found that some of the predicted host factors indeed influence the replication of these pathogens.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/c7yWpG2SmZk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) localize in the cell nucleus and influence gene expression through a variety of molecular mechanisms. Chromatin-enriched RNAs (cheRNAs) are a unique class of lncRNAs that are tightly bound to chromatin and putatively function to locally &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-activate gene transcription. CheRNAs can be identified by biochemical fractionation of nuclear RNA followed by RNA sequencing, but until now, a rigorous analytic pipeline for nuclear RNA-seq has been lacking. In this study, we survey four computational strategies for nuclear RNA-seq data analysis and develop a new pipeline, Tuxedo-ch, which outperforms other approaches. Tuxedo-ch assembles a more complete transcriptome and identifies cheRNA with higher accuracy than other approaches. We used Tuxedo-ch to analyze benchmark datasets of K562 cells and further characterize the genomic features of intergenic cheRNA (icheRNA) and their similarity to enhancer RNAs (eRNAs). We quantify the transcriptional correlation of icheRNA and adjacent genes and show that icheRNA is more positively associated with neighboring gene expression than eRNA or cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) signals. We also explore two novel genomic associations of cheRNA, which indicate that cheRNAs may function to promote or repress gene expression in a context-dependent manner. IcheRNA loci with significant levels of H3K9me3 modifications are associated with active enhancers, consistent with the hypothesis that enhancers are derived from ancient mobile elements. In contrast, antisense cheRNA (as-cheRNA) may play a role in local gene repression, possibly through local RNA:DNA:DNA triple-helix formation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/tdefoXQ0d04&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 ABSTRACT&lt;p&gt;The lateral amygdala (LA) serves as the point of entry for sensory information within the amygdala complex, a structure that plays a critical role in emotional processes and has been implicated in alcohol use disorders. Within the amygdala, the corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) system has been shown to mediate some of the effects of both stress and ethanol, but the effects of ethanol on specific CRF1 receptor circuits in the amygdala have not been fully established. We used male CRF1:GFP reporter mice to characterize CRF1-expressing (CRF1+) and non-expressing (CRF1-) LA neurons and investigate the effects of acute and chronic ethanol exposure on these populations. The CRF1+ population was found to be comprised predominantly of glutamatergic projection neurons with a minority subpopulation of interneurons. CRF1+ neurons exhibited a tonic conductance that was insensitive to acute ethanol. CRF1- neurons did not display a basal tonic conductance, but application of acute ethanol induced a  GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor subunit-dependent tonic conductance and enhanced phasic GABA release onto these cells. Chronic ethanol increased CRF1+ neuronal excitability but did not significantly alter phasic or tonic GABA signaling in either CRF1+ or CRF1- cells. Chronic ethanol and withdrawal also did not alter basal extracellular GABA or glutamate transmitter levels in the LA/BLA and did not alter sensitivity of GABA or glutamate to acute ethanol-induced increases in transmitter release. Together, these results provide the first characterization of the CRF1+ population of LA neurons and suggest mechanisms for differential acute ethanol sensitivity within this region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) system is a critical component of the stress network and has been implicated in psychiatric disorders including addiction, anxiety, and depression. The present study examines CRF receptor-1 (CRF1) lateral amygdala (LA) neurons and reports differential inhibitory control and acute ethanol effects of CRF1 LA neurons as compared to the unlabeled (CRF1-) population. An improved understanding of CRF1 amygdala circuitry and the selective sensitivity of that circuitry to ethanol represents an important step in identifying brain region-specific neuroadaptations that occur with ethanol exposure. The present findings also have broad implications, including potential relevance to the role of CRF1 circuitry in other contexts that may provide insight into other disorders involving amygdala dysfunction, including anxiety and depression.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract&lt;p&gt;The zona incerta is a subthalamic nucleus proposed to link sensory stimuli with motor responses to guide behavior, but its functional role is not well established. Using mice of either sex, we studied the effect of manipulating zona incerta gabaergic cells on the expression of a signaled locomotor action, known as &lt;i&gt;signaled active avoidance&lt;/i&gt;. We found that modulation of gabaergic zona incerta cells, but not of cells in the adjacent thalamic reticular nucleus, fully controls the expression of signaled active avoidance responses. Inhibition of zona incerta gabaergic cells drives active avoidance responses, while excitation of these cells blocks signaled active avoidance mainly by inhibiting cells in the midbrain pedunculopontine tegmentum (PPT). The zona incerta regulates signaled locomotion in the midbrain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; The zona incerta is an enigmatic nucleus in the forebrain whose functional role is not well established. We found that gabaergic cells in the zona incerta, that project to the midbrain, control the ability of mice to avoid a threat signaled by a sensory stimulus.

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signals through its cognate receptor tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) to promote the function of several classes of inhibitory interneurons. We previously reported that loss of BDNF–TrkB signaling in cortistatin (Cort)-expressing interneurons leads to behavioral hyperactivity and spontaneous seizures in mice. We performed bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) from the cortex of mice with disruption of BDNF–TrkB signaling in cortistatin interneurons, and identified differential expression of genes important for excitatory neuron function. Using translating ribosome affinity purification and RNA-seq, we define a molecular profile for Cort-expressing inhibitory neurons and subsequently compare the translatome of normal and TrkB-depleted Cort neurons, revealing alterations in calcium signaling and axon development. Several of the genes enriched in Cort neurons and differentially expressed in TrkB-depleted neurons are also implicated in autism and epilepsy. Our findings highlight TrkB-dependent molecular pathways as critical for the maturation of inhibitory interneurons and support the hypothesis that loss of BDNF signaling in Cort interneurons leads to altered excitatory/inhibitory balance.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Adenosine receptors are G-protein-coupled receptors involved in a wide range
of physiological and pathological phenomena in most mammalian systems. All four
receptors are widely expressed in the central nervous system, where they
modulate neurotransmitter release and neuronal plasticity. A large number of
gene association studies have shown that common genetic variants of the
adenosine receptors (encoded by the ADORA1, ADORA2A, ADORA2B and ADORA3 genes)
have a neuroprotective or neurodegenerative role in neurologic/psychiatric
diseases. New genetic studies of rare variants and few novel associations with
depression or epilepsy subtypes have recently been reported. Here, we review
the literature on the genetics of adenosine receptors in neurologic and/or
psychiatric diseases in humans, and discuss perspectives for further genetic
research. We also provide an update on the genetic structures of the four human
adenosine receptor genes and their regulation - a topic that has not been
extensively addressed. Our review emphasizes the importance of (i) better
characterizing the genetics of adenosine receptor genes and (ii) understanding
how these genes are regulated.

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Human beings and other vertebrates show remarkable performance and efficiency
in locomotion, but the functioning of their biological control systems for
locomotion is still only partially understood. The basic patterns and timing
for locomotion are provided by a central pattern generator (CPG) in the spinal
cord. The cerebellum is known to play an important role in adaptive locomotion.
Recent studies have given insights into the error signals responsible for
driving the cerebellar adaptation in locomotion. However, the question of how
the cerebellar output influences the gait remains unanswered. We hypothesize
that the cerebellar correction is applied to the pattern formation part of the
CPG. Here, a bio-inspired control system for adaptive locomotion of the
musculoskeletal system of the mouse is presented, where a cerebellar-like
module adapts the step time by using the double support interlimb asymmetry as
a temporal teaching signal. The control system is tested on a simulated mouse
in a split-belt treadmill setup similar to those used in experiments with real
mice. The results show adaptive locomotion behavior in the interlimb parameters
similar to that seen in humans and mice. The control system adaptively
decreases the double support asymmetry that occurs due to environmental
perturbations in the split-belt protocol.

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Navigation is crucial for animal behavior and is assumed to require an
internal representation of the external environment, termed a cognitive map.
The precise form of this representation is often considered to be a metric
representation of space. An internal representation, however, is judged by its
contribution to performance on a given task, and may thus vary between
different types of navigation tasks. Here we train a recurrent neural network
that controls an agent performing several navigation tasks in a simple
environment. To focus on internal representations, we split learning into a
task-agnostic pre-training stage that modifies internal connectivity and a
task-specific Q learning stage that controls the network's output. We show that
pre-training shapes the attractor landscape of the networks, leading to either
a continuous attractor, discrete attractors or a disordered state. These
structures induce bias onto the Q-Learning phase, leading to a performance
pattern across the tasks corresponding to metric and topological regularities.
By combining two types of networks in a modular structure, we could get better
performance for both regularities. Our results show that, in recurrent
networks, inductive bias takes the form of attractor landscapes -- which can be
shaped by pre-training and analyzed using dynamical systems methods.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that non-metric representations are useful for
navigation tasks, and their combination with metric representation leads to
flexibile multiple-task learning.

 &lt;p&gt;In many stochastic dynamical systems, ordinary chaotic behavior is preceded
by a full-dimensional phase that exhibits 1/f-type power-spectra and/or
scale-free statistics of (anti)instantons such as neuroavalanches, earthquakes,
etc. In contrast with the phenomenological concept of self-organized
criticality, the recently developed approximation-free supersymmetric theory of
stochastic differential equations, or stochastics, (STS) identifies this phase
as the noise-induced chaos (N-phase), i.e., the phase where the topological
supersymmetry pertaining to all stochastic dynamical systems is broken
spontaneously by the condensation of the noise-induced (anti-)instantons. Here,
we support this picture in the context of neurodynamics. We study a 1D chain of
neuron-like elements and find that the dynamics in the N-phase is indeed
featured by positive stochastic Lyapunov exponents and dominated by
(anti)instantonic processes of (creation)annihilation of kinks and antikinks,
which can be viewed as predecessors of boundaries of neuroavalanches. We also
construct the phase diagram of emulated stochastic neurodynamics on Spikey
neuromorphic hardware and demonstrate that the width of the N-phase vanishes in
the deterministic limit in accordance with STS. As a first result of the
application of STS to neurodynamics comes the conclusion that a conscious brain
can reside only in the N-phase.

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Annals of Neurology TLR4 signaling in neurons enhances calcium‐permeable AMPAR currents and drives post‐traumatic epileptogenesis&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/53bcdd2a-3cb5-4ce1-a7af-507b4bddbfc1/ana25698-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graphic illustration of the effect of injury and early TLR4 antagonist treatment on early network excitability and the long‐term network state. The schematic neurons include TLR4 and AMPAR subunit expression profiles in the acute phase of sham or brain injury. The corresponding early effects on network excitability are depicted by schematic population response traces (inset on upper left). Note the increase in excitability of the uninjured neuron after TLR4 antagonism without changes in AMPAR expression. Note also the increase in TLR4, calcium permeable AMPARs and population excitability after injury and its reduction by TLR4 antagonist treatment. Ampakine enhancement of excitability during TLR4 antagonism is illustrated. The early phase responses and manipulations (including injury, treatments, and molecular responses) are superimposed on a two‐tone color‐coded network state topology where green indicates low‐normal network excitability, ensuring network stability and low risk for epilepsy (Inset on upper right). Note the correspondence between early excitability state (population response profile) and long‐term seizure susceptibility and the effects of pharmacological manipulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traumatic brain injury is a major risk factor for acquired epilepsies and understanding the mechanisms underlying the early pathophysiology could yield viable therapeutic targets. Growing evidence indicates a role for inflammatory signaling in modifying neuronal excitability and promoting epileptogenesis. Here we examined the effect of innate immune receptor, toll‐like receptor 4 (TLR4) on excitability of the hippocampal dentate gyrus and epileptogenesis after brain injury.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slice and in vivo electrophysiology and western blots were conducted in rats subject to fluid percussion brain injury or sham injury.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The studies identify that TLR4 signaling in neurons, augments dentate granule cell calcium‐permeable AMPA receptor (CP‐AMPAR) currents after brain injury. Blocking TLR4 signaling &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; shortly after brain injury reduced dentate network excitability and seizure susceptibility. When blocking of TLR4 signaling after injury was delayed, however, this treatment failed to reduce post‐injury seizure susceptibility. Further, TLR4 signal blocking was less efficacious in limiting seizure susceptibility when AMPAR currents, downstream targets of TLR4 signaling, were transiently enhanced. Paradoxically, blocking TLR4 signaling augmented both network excitability and seizure susceptibility in uninjured controls. Despite the differential effect on seizure susceptibility, TLR4 antagonism suppressed cellular inflammatory responses after injury without impacting sham controls.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings demonstrate that independently of glia, the immune receptor TLR4 directly regulates post‐traumatic neuronal excitability. Moreover, the TLR4‐dependent early increase in dentate excitability is causally associated with epileptogenesis. Identification and selective targeting of the mechanisms underlying the aberrant TLR4‐mediated increase in CP‐AMPAR signaling after injury may prevent epileptogenesis after brain trauma.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although migraine is defined by the headache and headache associated symptoms, the true beginning of a migraine attack lies in the premonitory phase and to understand the generation of attacks one needs to investigate the phase before headache starts. The premonitory phase of migraine is characterized by a well described complex of symptoms. Its duration, however, is not clearly defined and there are to date no biomarkers to help defining when this phase starts.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to elucidate the duration of the premonitory phase in spontaneous human migraine attacks. As migraine attacks are hardly predictable and thereby the premonitory phase difficult to catch, we scanned nine patients daily over a minimum period of 30 days using a well‐established paradigm for functional MRI of trigeminal nociception.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seven patients were included in the analysis thus providing cumulative data of 27 spontaneous human migraine attacks including scans before, during and after migraine pain as well as interictal scans. As a response to painful trigeminal stimulation activation of the hypothalamus was present within the last 48 hours before headache onset but not earlier.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using hypothalamic activation as a potential marker for the premonitory phase of migraine in this unique data set, our data thus corroborate a duration of 48 hours for the premonitory phase of migraine and we suggest to apply this timely criterion in future studies when focussing on this particular phase of the migraine cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Observational epidemiological studies have reported a relationship between coffee intake and risk of stroke. However, evidence for this association is inconsistent and it remains uncertain whether the association is causal or due to confounding or reverse causality. To clarify this relationship, we adopted a Mendelian randomization (MR) approach to evaluate the effects of coffee consumption on the risk of stroke and its subtypes.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Method&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A meta‐analysis of genome‐wide association studies (GWASs) including 91,462 coffee consumers was used to identify instruments for coffee consumption. Summary‐level data for stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, ischemic stroke (IS) and IS subtypes were obtained from GWAS meta‐analyses conducted by the MEGASTROKE consortium. MR analyses were performed using the inverse‐variance‐weighted (IVW), weighted‐median, MR Pleiotropy RESidual Sum and Outlier (PRESSO) test and MR‐Egger regression. Sensitivity analyses were further performed using alternative instruments to test the robustness of our findings.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genetically predicted coffee consumption (high vs. infrequent/no) was not associated with risk of stroke. Similarly, among coffee consumers, MR analysis did not indicate causal associations between coffee consumption (cups/day) and risk of stroke. However, in the subgroup analysis, we found weak suggestive evidence for a potential protective effect of coffee consumption on risk of small vessel ischemic stroke (SV‐IS), though the association did not reach statistical significance after correction for multiple comparisons.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study suggests that coffee consumption is not causally associated with risk of stroke or its subtypes. Further studies are warranted to elucidate the possible association between coffee intake and risk of SV‐IS, as well as its potential underlying mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objectives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;dual hit&lt;/i&gt; hypothesis about the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease suggests that the brainstem is a convergent area for the propagation of pathological α‐synuclein from the periphery to the brain. While brainstem structures are likely to be affected early in the course of the disease, detailed information regarding specific brainstem regions is lacking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aim of our study was to investigate the function of the superior colliculus, a sensori‐motor brainstem structure, in &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; Parkinson's patients compared to controls using brain functional magnetic imaging and visual stimulation paradigms.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;De novo&lt;/i&gt; Parkinson's patients and controls were recruited. PD subjects were imaged before and after starting PD medications. A recently developed functional magnetic resonance imaging protocol was used to stimulate and visualize the superior colliculus and two other visual structures: the lateral geniculate nucleus and the primary visual cortex.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 22 parkinsonian patients, there was no modulation of the superior colliculus responses to the luminance contrasts compared to controls. This implies a hypersensitivity to low luminance contrast and abnormal rapid BOLD signal saturation to high luminance contrasts. The lateral geniculate nucleus was only modulated by 3%‐9% luminance contrasts, compared to controls. No major differences were found in the primary visual cortex between both groups.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our findings suggest that pathological superior colliculus visual responses in &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; Parkinson's disease patients are present early on the course of the disease. Thus, changes in imaging the superior colliculus could play an important role as a preclinical biomarker of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;

There is an increasing need to use genome and transcriptome sequencing to genetically diagnose patients suffering from suspected monogenic rare diseases. The proper detection of compound heterozygous variant combinations as disease-causing candidates is a challenge in diagnostic workflows as haplotype information is lost by currently used next-generation sequencing technologies. Consequently, computational tools are required to phase, or resolve the haplotype of, the high number of heterozygous variants in the exome or genome of each patient. Here we present SmartPhase, a phasing tool designed to efficiently reduce the set of potential compound heterozygous variant pairs in genetic diagnoses pipelines. The phasing algorithm of SmartPhase creates haplotypes using both parental genotype information and reads generated by DNA or RNA sequencing and is thus well suited to resolve the phase of rare variants. To inform the user about the reliability of a phasing prediction, it computes a confidence score which is essential to select error-free predictions. It incorporates existing haplotype information and applies logical rules to determine variants that can be excluded as causing a recessive, monogenic disease. SmartPhase can phase either all possible variant pairs in predefined genetic loci or preselected variant pairs of interest, thus keeping the focus on clinically relevant results. We compared SmartPhase to WhatsHap, one of the leading comparable phasing tools, using simulated data and a real clinical cohort of 921 patients. On both data sets, SmartPhase generated error-free predictions using our derived confidence score threshold. It outperformed WhatsHap with regard to the percentage of resolved pairs when parental genotype information is available. On the cohort data, SmartPhase enabled on average the exclusion of approximately 22% of the input variant pairs in each singleton patient and 44% in each trio patient. SmartPhase is implemented as an open-source Java tool and freely available at http://ibis.helmholtz-muenchen.de/smartphase/.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/dzGC1WVgeuM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Computational protein design of an ensemble of conformations for one protein–&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;., multi-state design–determines the side chain identity by optimizing the energetic contributions of that side chain in each of the backbone conformations. Sampling the resulting large sequence-structure search space limits the number of conformations and the size of proteins in multi-state design algorithms. Here, we demonstrated that the REstrained CONvergence (RECON) algorithm can simultaneously evaluate the sequence of large proteins that undergo substantial conformational changes. Simultaneous optimization of side chain conformations across all conformations increased sequence conservation when compared to single-state designs in all cases. More importantly, the sequence space sampled by RECON MSD resembled the evolutionary sequence space of flexible proteins, particularly when confined to predicting the mutational preferences of limited common ancestral descent, such as in the case of influenza type A hemagglutinin. Additionally, we found that sequence positions which require substantial changes in their local environment across an ensemble of conformations are more likely to be conserved. These increased conservation rates are better captured by RECON MSD over multiple conformations and thus multiple local residue environments during design. To quantify this rewiring of contacts at a certain position in sequence and structure, we introduced a new metric designated ‘contact proximity deviation’ that enumerates contact map changes. This measure allows mapping of global conformational changes into local side chain proximity adjustments, a property not captured by traditional global similarity metrics such as RMSD or local similarity metrics such as changes in φ and ψ angles.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/KQCfRaWtDY0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Influenza A viruses cause seasonal epidemics and occasional pandemics in the human population. While the worldwide circulation of seasonal influenza is at least partly understood, the exact migration patterns between countries, states or cities are not well studied. Here, we use the Sankoff algorithm for parsimonious phylogeographic reconstruction together with effective distances based on a worldwide air transportation network. By first simulating geographic spread and then phylogenetic trees and genetic sequences, we confirmed that reconstructions with effective distances inferred phylogeographic spread more accurately than reconstructions with geographic distances and Bayesian reconstructions with BEAST that do not use any distance information, and led to comparable results to the Bayesian reconstruction using distance information via a generalized linear model. Our method extends Bayesian methods that estimate rates from the data by using fine-grained locations like airports and inferring intermediate locations not observed among sampled isolates. When applied to sequence data of the pandemic H1N1 influenza A virus in 2009, our approach correctly inferred the origin and proposed airports mainly involved in the spread of the virus. In case of a novel outbreak, this approach allows to rapidly analyze sequence data and infer origin and spread routes to improve disease surveillance and control.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/mcNkWiC65tY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

While spatiotemporal proximity is necessary for synapse formation, it remains unclear to what extent the underlying positional strategies are sufficient to ensure synapse formation between the right partners. Many neurons readily form synapses with wrong partners if they find themselves at the wrong place or time. Minimally, restricting spatiotemporal proximity can prevent incorrect synapses. Maximally, restricting encounters in time and space could be sufficient to ensure correct partnerships between neurons that can form synapses promiscuously. In this review we explore recent findings on positional strategies during developmental growth that contribute to precise outcomes in brain wiring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Estimated numerosity perception is processed in an approximate number system (ANS) that resembles the perception of a continuous magnitude. The ANS consists of a right lateralized frontoparietal network comprising the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) and the intraparietal sulcus. Although the ANS has been extensively investigated, only a few studies have focused on the mental representation of retained numerosity estimates. Specifically, the underlying mechanisms of estimated numerosity working memory (WM) is unclear. Besides numerosities, as another form of abstract quantity, vibrotactile WM studies provide initial evidence that the right LPFC takes a central role in maintaining magnitudes. In the present fMRI multivariate pattern analysis study, we designed a delayed match-to-numerosity paradigm to test what brain regions retain approximate numerosity memoranda. In line with parametric WM results, our study found numerosity-specific WM representations in the right LPFC as well as in the supplementary motor area and the left premotor cortex extending into the superior frontal gyrus, thus bridging the gap in abstract quantity WM literature.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract&lt;p&gt;Progressive loss of neuromuscular junctions (NMJ) is an early event in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), preceding the global degeneration of motor axons and being accompanied by new axonal sprouting within the same axonal arbor. Some aspects of ALS onset and progression seem to be affected by sex in animal models of the disease. However, whether there are sex-specific differences in the pattern or time course of NMJ loss and repair within single motor axons remains unknown. We performed further analysis of a previously published &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; dataset, obtained from male and female SOD1&lt;sup&gt;G37R&lt;/sup&gt; mice. We found that NMJ losses are as frequent in male and female motor axons but, intriguingly, axonal sprouting is more frequent in female than male mice, resulting in a net increase of axonal arborization. Interestingly, these numerous new axonal branches in female mice are associated with a slightly faster decline in grip strength, increased NMJ denervation, and reduced α-motor neuron survival. Collectively, these results suggest that excessive axonal sprouting and motor-unit expansion in female SOD1&lt;sup&gt;G37R&lt;/sup&gt; mice are maladaptive during ALS progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Sex-specific differences in ALS progression have been identified in patients and in some animal models of the disease. However, the physio-pathological changes underlying these disparities remain poorly defined. In this study, we identified that the pattern of motor axon retraction and regrowth in skeletal muscles is a novel factor to consider in our understanding of sex-linked differences in ALS. Analysis of single motor axons in a model of ALS identified that female motor axons were more likely to form compensatory branches, which was associated with a worse phenotype. These surprising findings highlight the necessity to more systematically evaluate the prevalence of sex-specific differences across animal models of ALS and in patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract&lt;p&gt;Diacylglycerol kinase  (DGK) regulates protein kinase C (PKC) activity by converting diacylglycerol (DG) to phosphatidic acid (PA). DGK directly interacts with PKC and is phosphorylated by PKC, resulting in the upregulation of lipid kinase activity. PKC dysfunction impairs motor coordination, indicating that the regulation of PKC activity is important for motor coordination. DGK and PKC are abundantly expressed in cerebellar Purkinje cells. However, the physiological role of DGK has not been elucidated. Therefore, we developed DGK knockout (KO) mice and tested their cerebellar motor coordination. In DGK KO mice, cerebellar motor coordination and long-term depression (LTD) were impaired, and the dendrites of Purkinje cells from DGK KO mice were significantly retracted. Interestingly, treatment with the cPKC inhibitor Gö6976 rescued the dendritic retraction of primary cultured Purkinje cells from DGK KO mice. In contrast, treatment with the PKC activator 12-&lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) reduced morphological alterations in the dendrites of Purkinje cells from WT mice. In addition, we confirmed the upregulation of PKC activity in the cerebellum of DGK KO mice and rescued impaired LTD in DGK KO mice with a PKC specific inhibitor. Furthermore, impairment of motor coordination observed in DGK KO mice was rescued in tm1c mice with DGK reexpression induced by the FLP-FRT recombination system. These results indicate that DGK is involved in cerebellar LTD and the dendritic development of Purkinje cells through the regulation of PKC activity, and thus contributes to cerebellar motor coordination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; The only output neurons of the cerebellum, Purkinje cells, regulate long-term depression (LTD). LTD and the dendritic development of Purkinje cells are important for motor function. Many studies have revealed functional correlations between signaling molecules involved in the mechanisms of motor coordination; however, we still do not have enough knowledge to understand the overall concept. Here, we show that the functional correlation between diacylglycerol kinase  (DGK) and protein kinase C  (PKC) contributes to motor coordination. DGK regulates the activity of PKC, which is an important factor in LTD and the dendritic development of Purkinje cells, allowing PKC to function precisely as a mediator of motor coordination.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mutations in &lt;i&gt;GBA1,&lt;/i&gt; the gene mutated in Gaucher disease, are a common genetic risk factor for Parkinson disease, although the penetrance is low. We performed [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]‐Fluorodopa PET studies of 57 homozygous and heterozygous &lt;i&gt;GBA1&lt;/i&gt; mutation carriers (15 with parkinsonism) and 98 controls looking for early indications of dopamine loss using voxel‐wise analyses to identify group differences in striatal [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]‐Fluorodopa uptake (K&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;). Forty‐eight subjects were followed longitudinally. Cross‐sectional and longitudinal comparisons of K&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; and K&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;‐change found significant effects of Parkinson disease. However, at baseline and over time, striatal [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]‐Fluorodopa uptake in mutation carriers without parkinsonism did not significantly differ from controls.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;We introduce a mean-field model for analysing the dynamics of human
consciousness. In particular, inspired by the Giulio Tononi's Integrated
Information Theory and by the Max Tegmark's representation of consciousness, we
study order-disorder phase transitions on Curie-Weiss models generated by
processing EEG signals. The latter have been recorded on healthy individuals
undergoing deep sedation. Then, we implement a machine learning tool for
classifying mental states using, as input, the critical temperatures computed
in the Curie-Weiss models. Results show that, by the proposed method, it is
possible to discriminate between states of awareness and states of deep
sedation. Besides, we identify a state space for representing the path between
mental states, whose dimensions correspond to critical temperatures computed
over different frequency bands of the EEG signal. Beyond possible theoretical
implications in the study of human consciousness, resulting from our model, we
deem relevant to emphasise that the proposed method could be exploited for
clinical applications.

 &lt;p&gt;There is a strong nexus between the network size and the computational
resources available, which may impede a neuroscience study. In the meantime,
rescaling the network while maintaining its behavior is not a trivial mission.
Additionally, modeling patterns of connections under topographic organization
presents an extra challenge: to solve the network boundaries or mingled with an
unwished behavior. This behavior, for example, could be an inset oscillation
due to the torus solution; or a blend with/of unbalanced neurons due to a lack
(or overdose) of connections. We detail the network rescaling method able to
sustain behavior statistical utilized in Romaro et al. (2018) and present a
boundary solution method based on the previous statistics recoup idea.

 &lt;p&gt;Connectomes are spatially embedded networks whose architecture has been
shaped by physical constraints and communication needs throughout evolution.
Using a decentralized navigation protocol, we investigate the relationship
between the structure of the connectomes of different species and their spatial
layout. As a navigation strategy, we use greedy routing where nearest
neighbors, in terms of geometric distance, are visited. We measure the fraction
of successful greedy paths and their length as compared to shortest paths in
the topology of connectomes. In Euclidean space, we find a striking difference
between the navigability properties of mammalian and non-mammalian species,
which implies the inability of Euclidean distances to fully explain the
structural organization of their connectomes. In contrast, we find that
hyperbolic space, the effective geometry of complex networks, provides almost
perfectly navigable maps of connectomes for all species, meaning that
hyperbolic distances are exceptionally congruent with the structure of
connectomes. Hyperbolic maps therefore offer a quantitative meaningful
representation of connectomes that suggests a new cartography of the brain
based on the combination of its connectivity with its effective geometry rather
than on its anatomy only. Hyperbolic maps also provide a universal framework to
study decentralized communication processes in connectomes of different species
and at different scales on an equal footing.

 &lt;p&gt;Calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMKII) is a molecule involved in several cell processes including plasticity related to learning and memory. Activation of NMDA-type glutamate receptors results in translocation of CaMKII to synapses. However, there are at least two distinct mechanisms by which glutamate-dependent CaMKII translocation occurs: one well-studied process resulting from whole-cell glutamate stimulation and one resulting from brief, local glutamate application. Unlike the relatively fast CaMKII translocation seen following whole-cell glutamate delivery (seconds), local application results in CaMKII translocation that occurs gradually within 6–10 min. This locally-induced translocation of CaMKII requires L-type Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channel co-activation but does not rely on GluN2B receptor subunit expression, unlike translocation following whole-cell application of glutamate. The current study examined if nucleotide binding is necessary for locally-induced CaMKII translocation, similar to CaMKII translocation resulting from whole-cell glutamate application. Three different mechanisms of inhibition were employed: staurosporine (ATP inhibitor), CaMKII(281–302) peptide inhibitor and expression of the K42M mutation. Locally-induced CaMKII translocation was moderately suppressed in the presence of either the broad-spectrum kinase inhibitor staurosporine (100 nm) or the CaMKII(281–302) peptide inhibitor. However, expression of the catalytically dead K42M mutation that prevents ATP-binding to CaMKII, significantly inhibited locally-induced translocation. Thus, CaMKII translocation following brief, local glutamate application requires nucleotide binding, providing support for future research into the molecular mechanisms of this distinct form of CaMKII translocation.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The brainstem has traditionally been considered an area of the brain with autonomous control of mostly homeostatic functions such as heart rate, respiration, and the sleep and wakefulness state, which would preclude the necessity to exhibit the high degree of synaptic or cellular mechanisms of plasticity typical of regions of the brain responsible for flexible, executive control, such as the medial prefrontal cortex or the hippocampus. The perception that the brainstem does not share the same degree of flexibility to alter synaptic strength and/or wiring within local circuits makes intuitive sense, as it is not easy to understand how “soft wiring” would be an advantage when considering the importance of faithful and consistent performance of the homeostatic, autonomic functions that are controlled by the brainstem. However, many of the molecular and cellular requirements which underlie strengthening of synapses seen in brain regions involved in higher-level processing are present in brainstem nuclei, and recent research suggest that the view of the brainstem as “hard wired,” with rigid and static connectivity and with unchanging synaptic strength, is outdated. In fact, information from studies within the last decades, including work conducted in our group, leads us to propose that the brainstem can dynamically alter synaptic proteins, and change synaptic connections in response to prenatal or postnatal stimuli, and this would likely alter functionality and output. This article reviews recent research that has provided information resulting in our revision of the view of the brainstem as static and non-changing by using as example recent information gleaned from a brainstem pontine nucleus, the laterodorsal tegmentum (LDT). The LDT has demonstrated mechanisms underlying synaptic plasticity, and plasticity has been exhibited in the postnatal LDT following exposure to drugs of abuse. Further, exposure of the brain during gestation to drugs of abuse results in alterations in development of signaling pathways in the LDT. As the LDT provides a high degree of innervation of mesoaccumbal and mesocortical circuits involved in salience, as well as thalamocortical circuits involved in control of arousal and orientation, changes in synaptic strength would be expected to alter output, which would significantly impact behavioral state, motivated behavior and directed attention. Further, alterations in developmental trajectory within the LDT following prenatal exposure to drugs of abuse would be expected to impact on later life expression of motivation and arousal.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

CACNA1A encodes the pore-containing α&lt;sub&gt;1A&lt;/sub&gt; subunit of Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2.1 channels. In humans, de novo CACNA1A mutations result in a wide spectrum of neurological, neuromuscular, and movement disorders, such as familial hemiplegic migraine type 1 (FHM1), episodic ataxia type 2 (EA2), as well as a more recently discovered class of more severe disorders, which are characterized by ataxia, hypotonia, cerebellar atrophy, and cognitive/developmental delay. Heterologous expression of Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2.1 channels has allowed for an understanding of the consequences of CACNA1A missense mutations on channel function. In contrast, a mechanistic understanding of how specific CACNA1A mutations lead in vivo to the resultant phenotypes is lacking. In this review, we present the zebrafish as a model to both study in vivo mechanisms of CACNA1A mutations that result in synaptic and behavioral defects and to screen for effective drug therapies to combat these and other Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2.1 channelopathies.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The objective of the Autism Biomarkers Consortium for Clinical Trials (ABC-CT) is to evaluate a set of lab-based behavioral video tracking (VT), electroencephalography (EEG), and eye tracking (ET) measures for use in clinical trials with children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Within the larger organizational structure of the ABC-CT, the Data Acquisition and Analytic Core (DAAC) oversees the standardization of VT, EEG, and ET data acquisition, data processing, and data analysis. This includes designing and documenting data acquisition and analytic protocols and manuals; facilitating site training in acquisition; data acquisition quality control (QC); derivation and validation of dependent variables (DVs); and analytic deliverables including preparation of data for submission to the National Database for Autism Research (NDAR). To oversee consistent application of scientific standards and methodological rigor for data acquisition, processing, and analytics, we developed standard operating procedures that reflect the logistical needs of multi-site research, and the need for well-articulated, transparent processes that can be implemented in future clinical trials. This report details the methodology of the ABC-CT related to acquisition and QC in our Feasibility and Main Study phases. Based on our acquisition metrics from a preplanned interim analysis, we report high levels of acquisition success utilizing VT, EEG, and ET experiments in a relatively large sample of children with ASD and typical development (TD), with data acquired across multiple sites and use of a manualized training and acquisition protocol.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Non-invasive imaging methods have become essential tools for understanding the central nervous system (CNS) in health and disease. In particular, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques provide information about the anatomy, microstructure, and function of the brain and spinal cord in vivo non-invasively. However, MRI is limited by its spatial resolution and signal specificity. In order to mitigate these shortcomings, it is crucial to validate MRI with an array of ancillary ex vivo imaging techniques. These techniques include histological methods, such as light and electron microscopy (EM), which can provide specific information on the tissue structure in healthy and diseased brain and spinal cord, at cellular and subcellular level. However, these conventional histological techniques are intrinsically two-dimensional (2D) and, as a result of sectioning, lack volumetric information of the tissue. This limitation can be overcome with genuine three-dimensional (3D) imaging approaches of the tissue. 3D highly resolved information of the CNS achievable by means of other imaging techniques can complement and improve the interpretation of MRI measurements. In this article, we provide an overview of different 3D imaging techniques that can be used to validate MRI. As an example, we introduce an approach of how to combine diffusion MRI and synchrotron X-ray phase contrast tomography (SXRPCT) data. Our approach paves the way for a new multiscale assessment of the CNS allowing to validate and to improve our understanding of in vivo imaging (such as MRI).&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Convolutional neural network (CNN) models obtain state of the art performance on image classification, localization, and segmentation tasks. Limitations in computer hardware, most notably memory size in deep learning accelerator cards, prevent relatively large images, such as those from medical and satellite imaging, from being processed as a whole in their original resolution. A fully convolutional topology, such as U-Net, is typically trained on down-sampled images and inferred on images of their original size and resolution, by simply dividing the larger image into smaller (typically overlapping) tiles, making predictions on these tiles, and stitching them back together as the prediction for the whole image. In this study, we show that this tiling technique combined with translationally-invariant nature of CNNs causes small, but relevant differences during inference that can be detrimental in the performance of the model. Here we quantify these variations in both medical (i.e., BraTS) and non-medical (i.e., satellite) images and show that training a 2D U-Net model on the whole image substantially improves the overall model performance. Finally, we compare 2D and 3D semantic segmentation models to show that providing CNN models with a wider context of the image in all three dimensions leads to more accurate and consistent predictions. Our results suggest that tiling the input to CNN models—while perhaps necessary to overcome the memory limitations in computer hardware—may lead to undesirable and unpredictable errors in the model's output that can only be adequately mitigated by increasing the input of the model to the largest possible tile size.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Available evidence suggests that diabetes mellitus (DM) is a non-genetic risk factor for Parkinson’s disease (PD). PD and DM have shared similarities in pathogenetic mechanisms, including age, environmental factors, inflammatory reaction, and protein aggregation, etc. α-Synuclein is the primary protein component in the protein inclusions in PD, while islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) aggregates to form amyloid structures in β cells in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Pancreatic and cerebral functions, pancreas and brain α-synuclein deposition as well as striatal alterations, were assessed in spontaneously developed T2DM monkeys and age-matched normal monkeys. We demonstrated increased accumulation, aggregation, and phosphorylation of α-synuclein, and IAPP in the pancreatic islets of spontaneously developed T2DM monkeys, compared to the age-matched normal subjects. Double immunofluorescence analyses showed complete overlap between α-synuclein and IAPP in the pancreatic islets. In addition, in T2DM monkeys’ brain, we observed concomitantly increased accumulation and phosphorylation of α-synuclein in the cortex, pre-commissural putamen and dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, which interestingly showed high correlation with levels of fasting plasma glucose (FPG), triglyceride (TG), and high density lipoprotein (HDL). Our data indicates the close association between IAPP and α-synuclein and the potential link between T2DM and PD, which implies that T2DM may facilitate PD disease onset and progress by interfering with the pathological protein aggregation both in the pancreatic islets and the brain.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals contain valuable information about the different physiological states of the brain, with a variety of linear and nonlinear features that can be used to investigate brain activity. Monitoring the depth of anesthesia (DoA) with EEG is an ongoing challenge in anesthesia research. In this paper, we propose a novel method based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and a sparse denoising autoencoder (SDAE) to combine the hybrid features of EEG to monitor the DoA. The EEG signals were preprocessed using filtering, etc., and then more than ten features including sample entropy, permutation entropy, spectra, and alpha-ratio were extracted from the EEG signal. We then integrated the optional features such as permutation entropy and alpha-ratio to extract the essential structure and learn the most efficient temporal model for monitoring the DoA. Compared with using a single feature, the proposed model could accurately estimate the depth of anesthesia with higher prediction probability (P&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;). Experimental results evaluated on the datasets demonstrated that our proposed method provided better performance than the methods using permutation entropy, alpha-ratio, LSTM, and other traditional indices.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Background: Classic motion abnormalities in Parkinson's disease (PD), such as tremor, bradykinesia, or rigidity, are well-covered by standard clinical assessments such as the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). However, PD includes motor abnormalities beyond the symptoms and signs as measured by UPDRS, such as the lack of anticipatory adjustments or compromised movement smoothness, which are difficult to assess clinically. Moreover, PD may entail motor abnormalities not yet known. All these abnormalities are quantifiable via motion capture and may serve as biomarkers to diagnose and monitor PD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: In this pilot study, we attempted to identify motion features revealing maximum contrast between healthy subjects and PD patients with deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the nucleus subthalamicus (STN) switched off and on as the first step to develop biomarkers for detecting and monitoring PD patients' motor symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We performed 3D gait analysis in 7 out of 26 PD patients with DBS switched off and on, and in 25 healthy control subjects. We computed feature values for each stride, related to 22 body segments, four time derivatives, left–right mean vs. difference, and mean vs. variance across stride time. We then ranked the feature values according to their distinguishing power between PD patients and healthy subjects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The foot and lower leg segments proved better in classifying motor anomalies than any other segment. Higher degrees of time derivatives were superior to lower degrees (jerk &amp;gt; acceleration &amp;gt; velocity &amp;gt; displacement). The averaged movements across left and right demonstrated greater distinguishing power than left–right asymmetries. The variability of motion was superior to motion's absolute values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: This small pilot study identified the variability of a smoothness measure, i.e., jerk of the foot, as the optimal signal to separate healthy subjects' from PD patients' gait. This biomarker is invisible to clinicians' naked eye and is therefore not included in current motor assessments such as the UPDRS. We therefore recommend that more extensive investigations be conducted to identify the most powerful biomarkers to characterize motor abnormalities in PD. Future studies may challenge the composition of traditional assessments such as the UPDRS.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The detailed mechanisms underlying oxidative stress that leads to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in retinal vascular conditions, including diabetic retinopathy, retinopathy of prematurity etc., remain largely unexplored mainly due to a lack of suitable disease models that can simulate the inherent neuron–glia interactions in human retina. Specifically, establishment of a mixed retinal culture (MRC) containing both neuron and glial cell types remains a challenge due to different conditions required for their optimal growth and differentiation. Here, we establish a novel primary MRC model system containing neurons, astrocytes, Müller glia, and microglia from human donor retina that can be used to study the neuromodulatory effects of glial cells under the stress. The cell characterization based on immunostaining with individual cell type–specific markers and their presence in close vicinity to each other further underscores their utility for studying their cross talk. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first instance of an in vitro model obtained from human donor retina containing four major cell types. Next, we induce hypoxic stress to MRC to investigate if hypoxia activated neuroglia modulates altered gene expression for inflammatory, apoptotic, and angiogenic markers and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients by live cell imaging. Further, we performed k-means clustering of the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; responses to identify the modification of clustering pattern in stressed condition. Finally, we provide the evidence that the altered Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transient correlates to differential expression of genes shown to be involved in neuroinflammation, angiogenesis, and neurodegeneration under the hypoxic conditions as seen earlier in human cell lines and animal models of diabetic retinopathy. The major features of the hypoxic conditions in the proposed human MRC model included: increase in microglia activity, chemokine and cytokine expression, and percentage of cells having higher amplitude and frequency of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients. Thus, the proposed experimental system can potentially serve as an ideal in vitro model for studying the neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative changes in the retina and identifying newer drug targets.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;A non-invasive, brain-to-brain interface (BBI) requires precision neuromodulation and high temporal resolution as well as portability to increase accessibility. A BBI is a combination of the brain–computer interface (BCI) and the computer–brain interface (CBI). The optimization of BCI parameters has been extensively researched, but CBI has not. Parameters taken from the BCI and CBI literature were used to simulate a two-class medical monitoring BBI system under a wide range of conditions. BBI function was assessed using the information transfer rate (ITR), measured in bits per trial and bits per minute. The BBI ITR was a function of classifier accuracy, window update rate, system latency, stimulation failure rate (SFR), and timeout threshold. The BCI parameters, including window length, update rate, and classifier accuracy, were kept constant to investigate the effects of varying the CBI parameters, including system latency, SFR, and timeout threshold. Based on passively monitoring BCI parameters, a base ITR of 1 bit/trial was used. The optimal latency was found to be 100 ms or less, with a threshold no more than twice its value. With the optimal latency and timeout parameters, the system was able to maintain near-maximum efficiency, even with a 25% SFR. When the CBI and BCI parameters are compared, the CBI’s system latency and timeout threshold should be reflected in the BCI’s update rate. This would maximize the number of trials, even at a high SFR. These findings suggested that a higher number of trials per minute optimizes the ITR of a non-invasive BBI. The delays innate to each BCI protocol and CBI stimulation method must also be accounted for. The high latencies in each are the primary constraints of non-invasive BBI for the foreseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;At present, the diagnosis of brain disease is mainly based on the self-reported symptoms and clinical signs of the patient, which can easily lead to psychiatrists' bias. The purpose of this study is to develop a brain network clustering model to accurately identify brain diseases based on resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in the absence of clinical information. We use cosine similarity and sub-network kernels to measure attribute similarity and structure similarity, respectively. By integrating the structure similarity and attribute similarity into one matrix, spectral clustering is used to achieve brain network clustering. Finally, we evaluate this method on three diseases: Alzheimer's disease, Bipolar disorder patients, and Schizophrenia. The performance of methods is evaluated by measuring clustering consistency. Clustering consistency is similar to clustering accuracy, which is used to evaluate the consistency between the clustering labels and clinical diagnostic labels of the subjects. The experimental results show that our proposed method can significantly improve clustering performance, with a consistency of 60.6% for Alzheimer's disease, with a consistency of 100% for Schizophrenia, with a consistency of 100% for Bipolar disorder patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Behavioral studies have shown that the ability to discriminate between non-native speech sounds improves after seeing how the sounds are articulated. This study examined the influence of visual articulatory information on the neural correlates of non-native speech sound discrimination. English speakers’ discrimination of the Hindi dental and retroflex sounds was measured using the mismatch negativity (MMN) event-related potential, before and after they completed one of three 8-min training conditions. In an audio-visual speech training condition (n = 14), each sound was presented with its corresponding visual articulation. In one control condition (n = 14), both sounds were presented with the same visual articulation, resulting in one congruent and one incongruent audio-visual pairing. In another control condition (n = 14), both sounds were presented with the same image of a still face. The control conditions aimed to rule out the possibility that the MMN is influenced by non-specific audio-visual pairings, or by general exposure to the dental and retroflex sounds over the course of the study. The results showed that audio-visual speech training reduced the latency of the MMN but did not affect MMN amplitude. No change in MMN amplitude or latency was observed for the two control conditions. The pattern of results suggests that a relatively short audio-visual speech training session (i.e., 8 min) may increase the speed with which the brain processes non-native speech sound contrasts. The absence of a training effect on MMN amplitude suggests a single session of audio-visual speech training does not lead to the formation of more discrete memory traces for non-native speech sounds. Longer and/or multiple sessions might be needed to influence the MMN amplitude.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The parent-child relationship and family context influence the development of emotion regulation (ER) brain circuitry and related skills in children and adolescents. Although both parents’ and children’s ER neurocircuitry simultaneously affect how they interact with one another, neuroimaging studies of parent-child relationships typically include only one member of the dyad in brain imaging procedures. The current study examined brain activation related to parenting and ER in parent-adolescent dyads during concurrent fMRI scanning with a novel task – the Testing Emotional Attunement and Mutuality (TEAM) task. The TEAM task includes feedback trials indicating the other dyad member made an error, resulting in a monetary loss for both participants. Results indicate that positive parenting practices as reported by the adolescent were positively correlated with parents’ hemodynamic activation of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, a region related to empathy, during these error trials. Additionally, during feedback conditions both parents and adolescents exhibited fMRI activation in ER-related regions, including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior insula, fusiform gyrus, thalamus, caudate, precuneus, and superior parietal lobule. Adolescents had higher left amygdala activation than parents during the feedback condition. These findings demonstrate the utility of dyadic fMRI scanning for investigating relational processes, particularly in the parent-child relationship.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have shown favorable performance recently. Nonetheless, the time-consuming computation on neuron level and complex optimization limit their real-time application. Curiosity has shown great performance in brain learning, which helps biological brains grasp new knowledge efficiently and actively. Inspired by this leaning mechanism, we propose a curiosity-based SNN (CBSNN) model, which contains four main learning processes. Firstly, the network is trained with biologically plausible plasticity principles to get the novelty estimations of all samples in only one epoch; secondly, the CBSNN begins to repeatedly learn the samples whose novelty estimations exceed the novelty threshold and dynamically update the novelty estimations of samples according to the learning results in five epochs; thirdly, in order to avoid the overfitting of the novel samples and forgetting of the learned samples, CBSNN retrains all samples in one epoch; finally, step two and step three are periodically taken until network convergence. Compared with the state-of-the-art Voltage-driven Plasticity-centric SNN (VPSNN) under standard architecture, our model achieves a higher accuracy of 98.55% with only 54.95% of its computation cost on the MNIST hand-written digit recognition dataset. Similar conclusion can also be found out in other datasets, i.e., Iris, NETtalk, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10, respectively. More experiments and analysis further prove that such curiosity-based learning theory is helpful in improving the efficiency of SNNs. As far as we know, this is the first practical combination of the curiosity mechanism and SNN, and these improvements will make the realistic application of SNNs possible on more specific tasks within the von Neumann framework.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The accurate automatic segmentation of gliomas and its intra-tumoral structures is important not only for treatment planning but also for follow-up evaluations. Several methods based on 2D and 3D Deep Neural Networks (DNN) have been developed to segment brain tumors and to classify different categories of tumors from different MRI modalities. However, these networks are often black-box models and do not provide any evidence regarding the process they take to perform this task. Increasing transparency and interpretability of such deep learning techniques is necessary for the complete integration of such methods into medical practice. In this paper, we explore various techniques to explain the functional organization of brain tumor segmentation models and to extract visualizations of internal concepts to understand how these networks achieve highly accurate tumor segmentations. We use the BraTS 2018 dataset to train three different networks with standard architectures and outline similarities and differences in the process that these networks take to segment brain tumors. We show that brain tumor segmentation networks learn certain human-understandable disentangled concepts on a filter level. We also show that they take a top-down or hierarchical approach to localizing the different parts of the tumor. We then extract visualizations of some internal feature maps and also provide a measure of uncertainty with regards to the outputs of the models to give additional qualitative evidence about the predictions of these networks. We believe that the emergence of such human-understandable organization and concepts might aid in the acceptance and integration of such methods in medical diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The piriform cortex (PC) is a key brain area involved in both processing and coding of olfactory information. It is implicated in various brain disorders, such as epilepsy, Alzheimer’s disease, and autism. The PC consists of the anterior (APC) and posterior (PPC) parts, which are different anatomically and functionally. However, the direct input networks to specific neuronal populations within the APC and PPC remain poorly understood. Here, we mapped the whole-brain direct inputs to the two major neuronal populations, the excitatory glutamatergic principal neurons and inhibitory γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic interneurons within the APC and PPC using the rabies virus (RV)-mediated retrograde trans-synaptic tracing system. We found that for both types of neurons, APC and PPC share some similarities in input networks, with dominant inputs originating from the olfactory region (OLF), followed by the cortical subplate (CTXsp), isocortex, cerebral nuclei (CNU), hippocampal formation (HPF) and interbrain (IB), whereas the midbrain (MB) and hindbrain (HB) were rarely labeled. However, APC and PPC also show distinct features in their input distribution patterns. For both types of neurons, the input proportion from the OLF to the APC was higher than that to the PPC; while the PPC received higher proportions of inputs from the HPF and CNU than the APC did. Overall, our results revealed the direct input networks of both excitatory and inhibitory neuronal populations of different PC subareas, providing a structural basis to analyze the diverse PC functions.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Microglia are the endogenous immune cells of the brain and act as sensor of infection and pathologic injury to the brain, leading to a rapid plastic process of activation that culminates in the endocytosis and phagocytosis of damaged tissue. Microglia cells are the most plastic cells in the brain. Microglia isolation from their environment as well as culturing them in the presence of serum alter their function and lead to a rapid loss of their signature gene expression. Previous studies have identified pivotal factors allowing microglia culture in the absence of serum. Here, we have further characterized the function, expression of markers, metabolic status and response to pro and anti-inflammatory stimulus of microglia isolated by magnetic-activated cell sorting and cultured in a chemically defined medium. We have compared this new method with previous traditional protocols of culturing microglia that use high concentrations of serum.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Pronounced activity-dependent slowing of conduction has been used to characterize mechano-insensitive, “silent” nociceptors and might be due to high expression of Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.8 and could, therefore, be characterized by their tetrodotoxin-resistance (TTX-r). Nociceptor-class specific differences in action potential characteristics were studied by: (i) in vitro calcium imaging in single porcine nerve growth factor (NGF)-responsive neurites; (ii) in vivo extracellular recordings in functionally identified porcine silent nociceptors; and (iii) in vitro patch-clamp recordings from murine silent nociceptors, genetically defined by nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit alpha-3 (CHRNA3) expression. Porcine TTX-r neurites (n = 26) in vitro had more than twice as high calcium transients per action potential as compared to TTX-s neurites (n = 18). In pig skin, silent nociceptors (n = 14) characterized by pronounced activity-dependent slowing of conduction were found to be TTX-r, whereas polymodal nociceptors were TTX-s (n = 12) and had only moderate slowing. Mechano-insensitive cold nociceptors were also TTX-r but showed less activity-dependent slowing than polymodal nociceptors. Action potentials in murine silent nociceptors differed from putative polymodal nociceptors by longer duration and higher peak amplitudes. Longer duration AP in silent murine nociceptors linked to increased sodium load would be compatible with a pronounced activity-dependent slowing in pig silent nociceptors and longer AP durations could be in line with increased calcium transients per action potential observed in vitro in TTX-resistant NGF responsive porcine neurites. Even though there is no direct link between slowing and TTX-resistant channels, the results indicate that axons of silent nociceptors not only differ in their receptive but also in their axonal properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The neurotoxin β-N-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA) is a natural non-proteinogenic diamino acid produced by several species of both prokaryotic (cyanobacteria) and eukaryotic (diatoms and dinoflagellates) microorganisms. BMAA has been shown to biomagnify through the food chain in some ecosystems, accumulating for example in seafood such as shellfish and fish, common dietary sources of BMAA whose ingestion may have possible neuronal consequences. In addition to its excitotoxic potential, BMAA has been implicated in protein misfolding and aggregation, inhibition of specific enzymes and neuroinflammation, all hallmark features of neurodegenerative diseases. However, the exact molecular mechanisms of neurotoxicity remain to be elucidated in detail. Although BMAA is commonly detected in its free form, complex BMAA-containing molecules have also been identified such as the paenilamicins, produced by an insect gut bacterial pathogen. On the other hand, production of BMAA or BMAA-containing molecules by members of the human gut microbiota, for example by non-photosynthetic cyanobacteria, the Melainabacteria, remains only hypothetical. In any case, should BMAA reach the gut it may interact with cells of the mucosal immune system and neurons of the enteric nervous system (ENS) and possibly target the mitochondria. Here, we review the available evidence and hint on possible mechanisms by which chronic exposure to dietary sources of this microbial neurotoxin may drive protein misfolding and mitochondrial dysfunction with concomitant activation of innate immune responses, chronic low-grade gut inflammation, and ultimately the neurodegenerative features observed across the gut-brain axis in Parkinson’s disease (PD).&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;With a lipid-rich environment and elevated oxygen consumption, the central nervous system (CNS) is subject to intricate regulation by lipid-derived electrophiles (LDEs). Investigations into oxidative damage and chronic LDE generation in neural disorders have spurred the development of tools that can detect and catalog the gamut of LDE-adducted proteins. Despite these advances, deconstructing the precise consequences of individual protein-specific LDE modifications remained largely impossible until recently. In this perspective, we first overview emerging toolsets that can decode electrophile-signaling events in a protein/context-specific manner, and how the accumulating mechanistic insights brought about by these tools have begun to offer new means to modulate pathways relevant to multiple sclerosis (MS). By surveying the latest data surrounding the blockbuster MS drug dimethyl fumarate that functions through LDE-signaling-like mechanisms, we further provide a vision for how chemical biology tools probing electrophile signaling may be leveraged toward novel interventions in CNS disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

Diseases in humans, animals and plants remain an important challenge in our society. Effective control of invasive pathogens often requires coordinated concerted action of a large group of stakeholders. Both epidemiological and human behavioural factors influence the outcome of a disease control campaign. In mathematical models that are frequently used to guide such campaigns, human behaviour is often ill-represented, if at all. Existing models of human, animal and plant disease that do incorporate participation or compliance are often driven by pay-offs or direct observations of the disease state. It is however very well known that opinion is an important driving factor of human decision making. Here we consider the case study of Citrus Huanglongbing disease (HLB), which is an acute bacterial disease that threatens the sustainability of citrus production across the world. We show how by coupling an epidemiological model of this invasive disease with an opinion dynamics model we are able to answer the question: What makes or breaks the effectiveness of a disease control campaign? Frequent contact between stakeholders and advisors is shown to increase the probability of successful control. More surprisingly, we show that informing stakeholders about the effectiveness of control methods is of much greater importance than prematurely increasing their perceptions of the risk of infection. We discuss the overarching consequences of this finding and the effect on human as well as plant disease epidemics.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/sboreAmKuck&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

We approach the &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; connectome as an information processing network that receives input from about 90 sensory neurons, processes that information through a highly recurrent network of about 80 interneurons, and it produces a coordinated output from about 120 motor neurons that control the nematode’s muscles. We focus on the feedforward flow of information from sensory neurons to motor neurons, and apply a recently developed network analysis framework referred to as the “hourglass effect”. The analysis reveals that this feedforward flow traverses a small core (“hourglass waist”) that consists of 10-15 interneurons. These are mostly the same interneurons that were previously shown (using a different analytical approach) to constitute the “rich-club” of the &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; connectome. This result is robust to the methodology that separates the feedforward from the feedback flow of information. The set of core interneurons remains mostly the same when we consider only chemical synapses or the combination of chemical synapses and gap junctions. The hourglass organization of the connectome suggests that &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; has some similarities with encoder-decoder artificial neural networks in which the input is first compressed and integrated in a low-dimensional latent space that encodes the given data in a more efficient manner, followed by a decoding network through which intermediate-level sub-functions are combined in different ways to compute the correlated outputs of the network. The core neurons at the hourglass waist represent the &lt;i&gt;information bottleneck&lt;/i&gt; of the system, balancing the representation accuracy and compactness (complexity) of the given sensory information.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/AYcqhyLM5-4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 ABSTRACT&lt;p&gt;Altered cortical excitation-inhibition (E-I) balance resulting from abnormal parvalbumin interneuron (PV IN) function is a proposed pathophysiological mechanism of schizophrenia (SZ) and other major psychiatric disorders. Preclinical studies have indicated that &lt;i&gt;disrupted-in-schizophrenia-1&lt;/i&gt; (DISC1) is a useful molecular lead to address the biology of prefrontal cortex dependent cognition and PV IN function. To date, prefrontal cortical inhibitory circuit function has not been investigated in depth in &lt;i&gt;Disc1&lt;/i&gt; locus impairment (LI) mouse models. Therefore, we used a &lt;i&gt;Disc1&lt;/i&gt; LI mouse model to investigate E-I balance in medial prefrontal cortical (mPFC) circuits. We found that inhibition onto layer 3 excitatory pyramidal neurons in the mPFC was significantly reduced in &lt;i&gt;Disc1&lt;/i&gt; LI mice. This reduced inhibition was accompanied by decreased GABA release from local PV, but not somatostatin (SOM) interneurons, and by impaired feedforward inhibition in the mediodorsal thalamus (MD) to mPFC circuit. Our mechanistic findings of abnormal PV IN function in a &lt;i&gt;Disc1&lt;/i&gt; LI model provide insight into biology that may be relevant to neuropsychiatric disorders including schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; A popular theory suggests that dysregulation of fast-spiking parvalbumin interneurons (PV INs) and elevated excitation-inhibition (E-I) balance contribute to the pathophysiology of various psychiatric disorders. Previous studies suggest that genetic perturbations of the &lt;i&gt;disrupted-in-schizophrenia-1&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Disc1&lt;/i&gt;) gene affect prefrontal cortex-dependent cognition and PV IN function, but synaptic and circuit physiology data are lacking. Here, we provide evidence that the presynaptic function of PV INs in the medial prefrontal cortex is altered in &lt;i&gt;Disc1&lt;/i&gt; LI mice and that E-I balance is elevated within a thalamofrontal circuit known to be important for cognition. These findings may contribute to our understanding of the biology that gives rise to cognitive symptoms in a range of neuropsychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Despite the still prevailing notion of a shared substrate of action for all addictive drugs, there is evidence suggesting that opioid and psychostimulant drugs differ substantially in terms of their neurobiological and behavioral effects. These differences may reflect separate neural circuits engaged by the two drugs. Here we used the catFISH (cellular compartment analysis of temporal activity by fluorescence &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; hybridization) technique to investigate the degree of overlap between neurons engaged by heroin versus cocaine in adult male Sprague Dawley rats. The catFISH technique is a within-subject procedure that takes advantage of the different transcriptional time course of the immediate-early genes &lt;i&gt;homer 1a&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;arc&lt;/i&gt; to determine to what extent two stimuli separated by an interval of 25 min engage the same neuronal population. We found that throughout the striatal complex the neuronal populations activated by noncontingent intravenous injections of cocaine (800 μg/kg) and heroin (100 and 200 μg/kg), administered at an interval of 25 min from each other, overlapped to a much lesser extent than in the case of two injections of cocaine (800 μg/kg), also 25 min apart. The greatest reduction in overlap between populations activated by cocaine and heroin was in the dorsomedial and dorsolateral striatum (~30% and ~22%, respectively, of the overlap observed for the sequence cocaine–cocaine). Our results point toward a significant separation between neuronal populations activated by heroin and cocaine in the striatal complex. We propose that our findings are a proof of concept that these two drugs are encoded differently in a brain area believed to be a common neurobiological substrate to drug abuse.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;With the advancement in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning
(ML) techniques, researchers are striving towards employing these techniques
for advancing clinical practice. One of the key objectives in healthcare is the
early detection and prediction of disease to timely provide preventive
interventions. This is especially the case for epilepsy, which is characterized
by recurrent and unpredictable seizures. Patients can be relieved from the
adverse consequences of epileptic seizures if it could somehow be predicted in
advance. Despite decades of research, seizure prediction remains an unsolved
problem. This is likely to remain at least partly because of the inadequate
amount of data to resolve the problem. There have been exciting new
developments in ML-based algorithms that have the potential to deliver a
paradigm shift in the early and accurate prediction of epileptic seizures. Here
we provide a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art ML techniques in early
prediction of seizures using EEG signals. We will identify the gaps,
challenges, and pitfalls in the current research and recommend future
directions.

 &lt;p&gt;Human babies respond preferentially to faces or face-like images. It has been proposed that an innate and rapid face detection system is present at birth before the cortical visual pathway is developed in many species, including primates. However, in primates, the visual area responsible for this process is yet to be unraveled. We hypothesized that the superior colliculus (SC) that receives direct and indirect retinal visual inputs may serve as an innate rapid face-detection system in primates. To test this hypothesis, we examined the responsiveness of monkey SC neurons to first-order information of faces required for face detection (basic spatial layout of facial features including eyes, nose, and mouth), by analyzing neuronal responses to line drawing images of: (1) face-like patterns with contours and properly placed facial features; (2) non-face patterns including face contours only; and (3) nonface random patterns with contours and randomly placed face features. Here, we show that SC neurons respond stronger and faster to upright and inverted face-like patterns compared to the responses to nonface patterns, regardless of contrast polarity and contour shapes. Furthermore, SC neurons with central receptive fields (RFs) were more selective to face-like patterns. In addition, the population activity of SC neurons with central RFs can discriminate face-like patterns from nonface patterns as early as 50 ms after the stimulus onset. Our results provide strong neurophysiological evidence for the involvement of the primate SC in face detection and suggest the existence of a broadly tuned template for face detection in the subcortical visual pathway.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Neuromodulation is a therapeutic technique that is well-established in the treatment of idiopathic Lower urinary tract (LUT) dysfunction such as overactive bladder (OAB). We have recently developed a novel neuromodulation approach, Transcutaneous Electrical Spinal Cord Neuromodulation (TESCoN) and demonstrated its acute effects on LUT dysfunction after spinal cord injury (SCI) during urodynamic studies. We found that TESCoN can promote urinary storage and induce urinary voiding when delivered during urodynamic studies. The objective of this study was to determine whether TESCoN can retrain the spinal neural networks to induce chronic improvement in the LUT, such that positive changes can persist even in the absence of stimulation. In addition, we wished to examine the effect of TESCoN on LUT dysfunction due to multiple pathologies. To achieve this objective, 14 patients [SCI = 5, stroke = 5, multiple sclerosis (MS) = 3, and idiopathic OAB (iOAB) = 1] completed 24 sessions of TESCoN over the course of 8 weeks. Patients completed urodynamic studies before and after undergoing TESCoN therapy. Additionally, each subject completed a voiding diary and the Neurogenic Bladder Symptom Score questionnaire before and after receiving TESCoN therapy. We found that TESCoN led to decreased detrusor overactivity, improved continence, and enhanced LUT sensation across the different pathologies underlying LUT dysfunction. This study serves as a pilot in preparation for a rigorous randomized placebo-controlled trial designed to demonstrate the effect of TESCoN on LUT function in neurogenic and non-neurogenic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;New And Noteworthy&lt;p&gt;Non-Surgical modality to reduce incidence of urinary incontinence and improve neurogenic bladder symptom scores (NBSS) in individuals with neurogenic bladder due to spinal cord injury or stroke.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Lysophosphatidic acid is a small extracellular signaling molecule, which is elevated in pathological conditions such as ischemic stroke and traumatic brain injury (TBI). LPA regulates the survival of neurons in various diseases. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying LPA-induced neuronal death remain unclear. Here we report that LPA activates LPA1 and LPA2 receptors, and the downstream MAPK pathway to induce the apoptosis of PC12 cells through mitochondrial dysfunction. LPA elicits the activation of ERK1/2, p38, and JNK pathways, decreases the expression of Bcl2, promotes the translocation of Bax, and enhances the activation of caspase-3, resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction and cell apoptosis. This process can be blocked by LPA1 receptor antagonist and LPA2 receptor antagonist and MAPK pathway inhibitors. Our results indicate that LPA1 receptor, LPA2 receptor and MAPK pathway play a critical role in LPA-induced neuronal injury. LPA receptors and MAPK pathways may be novel therapeutic targets for ischemic stroke and TBI, where excessive LPA signaling exist.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Fiber photometry has enabled neuroscientists to easily measure targeted brain activity patterns in awake, freely behaving animal. A focus of this technique is to identify functionally-relevant changes in activity around particular environmental and/or behavioral events, i.e., event-related activity transients (ERT). A simple and popular approach to identifying ERT is to summarize peri-event signal [e.g., area under the curve (AUC), peak activity, etc.,] and perform standard analyses on this summary statistic. We highlight the various issues with this approach and overview straightforward alternatives: waveform confidence intervals (CIs) and permutation tests. We introduce the rationale behind these approaches, describe the results of Monte Carlo simulations evaluating their effectiveness at controlling Type I and Type II error rates, and offer some recommendations for selecting appropriate analysis strategies for fiber photometry experiments.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Agglomerative hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) is a commonly used unsupervised machine learning approach for identifying informative natural clusters of observations. HCA is performed by calculating a pairwise dissimilarity matrix and then clustering similar observations until all observations are grouped within a cluster. Verifying the empirical clusters produced by HCA is complex and not well studied in biomedical applications. Here, we demonstrate the comparability of a novel HCA technique with one that was used in previous biomedical applications while applying both techniques to plasma angiogenic (FGF, FLT, PIGF, Tie-2, VEGF, VEGF-D) and inflammatory (MMP1, MMP3, MMP9, IL8, TNFα) protein data to identify informative subsets of individuals. Study subjects were diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment due to cerebrovascular disease (MCI-CVD). Through comparison of the two HCA techniques, we were able to identify subsets of individuals, based on differences in VEGF (p &amp;lt; 0.001), MMP1 (p &amp;lt; 0.001), and IL8 (p &amp;lt; 0.001) levels. These profiles provide novel insights into angiogenic and inflammatory pathologies that may contribute to VCID.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Huntington’s disease (HD) is a hereditary neurodegenerative disorder that typically manifests in midlife with motor, cognitive, and/or psychiatric symptoms. The disease is caused by a CAG triplet expansion in exon 1 of the huntingtin gene and leads to a severe neurodegeneration in the striatum and cortex. Classical electrophysiological studies in genetic HD mouse models provided important insights into the disbalance of excitatory, inhibitory and neuromodulatory inputs, as well as progressive disconnection between the cortex and striatum. However, the involvement of local cortical and striatal microcircuits still remains largely unexplored. Here we review the progress in understanding HD-related impairments in the cortical and basal ganglia circuits, and outline new opportunities that have opened with the development of modern circuit analysis methods. In particular, in vivo imaging studies in mouse HD models have demonstrated early structural and functional disturbances within the cortical network, and optogenetic manipulations of striatal cell types have started uncovering the causal roles of certain neuronal populations in disease pathogenesis. In addition, the important contribution of astrocytes to HD-related circuit defects has recently been recognized. In parallel, unbiased systems biology studies are providing insights into the possible molecular underpinnings of these functional defects at the level of synaptic signaling and neurotransmitter metabolism. With these approaches, we can now reach a deeper understanding of circuit-based HD mechanisms, which will be crucial for the development of effective and targeted therapeutic strategies.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Dynamic functional connectivity (DFC) obtained from resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data has been shown to provide novel insights into brain function which may be obscured by static functional connectivity (SFC). Further, DFC, and by implication how different brain regions may engage or disengage with each other over time, has been shown to be behaviorally relevant and more predictive than SFC of behavioral performance and/or diagnostic status. DFC is not a directional entity and may capture neural synchronization. However, directional interactions between different brain regions is another putative mechanism by which neural populations communicate. Accordingly, static effective connectivity (SEC) has been explored as a means of characterizing such directional interactions. But investigation of its dynamic counterpart, i.e., dynamic effective connectivity (DEC), is still in its infancy. Of particular note are methodological insufficiencies in identifying DEC configurations that are reproducible across time and subjects as well as a lack of understanding of the behavioral relevance of DEC obtained from resting state fMRI. In order to address these issues, we employed a dynamic multivariate autoregressive (MVAR) model to estimate DEC. The method was first validated using simulations and then applied to resting state fMRI data obtained in-house (N = 21), wherein we performed dynamic clustering of DEC matrices across multiple levels [using adaptive evolutionary clustering (AEC)] – spatial location, time, and subjects. We observed a small number of directional brain network configurations alternating between each other over time in a quasi-stable manner akin to brain microstates. The dominant and consistent DEC network patterns involved several regions including inferior and mid temporal cortex, motor and parietal cortex, occipital cortex, as well as part of frontal cortex. The functional relevance of these DEC states were determined using meta-analyses and pertained mainly to memory and emotion, but also involved execution and language. Finally, a larger cohort of resting-state fMRI and behavioral data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) (N = 232, Q1–Q3 release) was used to demonstrate that metrics derived from DEC can explain larger variance in 70 behaviors across different domains (alertness, cognition, emotion, and personality traits) compared to SEC in healthy individuals.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;This article unifies neural modeling results that illustrate several basic design principles and mechanisms that are used by advanced brains to develop cortical maps with multiple psychological functions. One principle concerns how brains use a strip map that simultaneously enables one feature to be represented throughout its extent, as well as an ordered array of another feature at different positions of the strip. Strip maps include circuits to represent ocular dominance and orientation columns, place-value numbers, auditory streams, speaker-normalized speech, and cognitive working memories that can code repeated items. A second principle concerns how feature detectors for multiple functions develop in topographic maps, including maps for optic flow navigation, reinforcement learning, motion perception, and category learning at multiple organizational levels. A third principle concerns how brains exploit a spatial gradient of cells that respond at an ordered sequence of different rates. Such a rate gradient is found along the dorsoventral axis of the entorhinal cortex, whose lateral branch controls the development of time cells, and whose medial branch controls the development of grid cells. Populations of time cells can be used to learn how to adaptively time behaviors for which a time interval of hundreds of milliseconds, or several seconds, must be bridged, as occurs during trace conditioning. Populations of grid cells can be used to learn hippocampal place cells that represent the large spaces in which animals navigate. A fourth principle concerns how and why all neocortical circuits are organized into layers, and how functionally distinct columns develop in these circuits to enable map development. A final principle concerns the role of Adaptive Resonance Theory top-down matching and attentional circuits in the dynamic stabilization of early development and adult learning. Cortical maps are modeled in visual, auditory, temporal, parietal, prefrontal, entorhinal, and hippocampal cortices.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Accurate stimulus onset timing is critical to almost all behavioral research. Auditory, visual, or manual response time stimulus onsets are typically sent through wires to various machines that record data such as: eye gaze positions, electroencephalography, stereo electroencephalography, and electrocorticography. These stimulus onsets are collated and analyzed according to experimental condition. If there is variability in the temporal accuracy of the delivery of these onsets to external systems, the quality of the resulting data and scientific analyses will degrade. Here, we describe an approximately 200 dollar Arduino based system and associated open-source codebase that achieved a maximum of 4 microseconds of delay from the inputs to the outputs while electrically opto-isolating the connected external systems. Using an oscilloscope, the device is configurable for the different environmental conditions particular to each laboratory (e.g., light sensor type, screen type, speaker type, stimulus type, temperature, etc). This low-cost open-source project delivered electrically isolated digital stimulus onset Transistor-Transistor Logic triggers with an input/output delay of 4 μs, and was successfully tested with seven different external systems that record eye and neurological data.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Direct eye contact between two individuals is a salient social behavior known to initiate and promote interpersonal interaction. However, the neural processes that underlie these live interactive behaviors and eye-to-eye contact are not well understood. The Dynamic Neural Coupling Hypothesis presents a general theoretical framework proposing that shared interactive behaviors are represented by cross-brain signal coherence. Using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) adapted for hyper scanning, we tested this hypothesis specifically for neural mechanisms associated with eye-to-eye gaze between human participants compared to similar direct eye-gaze at a dynamic video of a face and predicted that the coherence of neural signals between the two participants during reciprocal eye-to-eye contact would be greater than coherence observed during direct eye-gaze at a dynamic video for those signals originating in social and face processing systems. Consistent with this prediction cross-brain coherence was increased for signals within the angular gyrus (AG) during eye-to-eye contact relative to direct eye-gaze at a dynamic face video (p &amp;lt; 0.01). Further, activity in the right temporal-parietal junction (TPJ) was increased in the real eye-to-eye condition (p &amp;lt; 0.05, FDR corrected). Together, these findings advance a functional and mechanistic understanding of the AG and cross-brain neural coupling associated with real-time eye-to-eye contact.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Analyses of genoarchitecture recently stimulated substantial revisions of anatomical models for the developing hypothalamus in mammalian and other vertebrate systems. The prosomeric model proposes the hypothalamus to be derived from the secondary prosencephalon, and to consist of alar and basal regions. The basal hypothalamus can further be subdivided into tuberal and mamillary regions, each with distinct subregions. Albeit being a widely used model system for neurodevelopmental studies, no detailed genoarchitectural maps exist for the zebrafish (Danio rerio) hypothalamus. Here, we compare expression domains of zebrafish genes, including arxa, shha, otpa, isl1, lhx5, nkx2.1, nkx2.2a, pax6, and dlx5a, the orthologs of which delimit specific subregions within the murine basal hypothalamus. We develop the highly conserved brain-specific homeobox (bsx) gene as a novel marker for genoarchitectural analysis of hypothalamic regions. Our comparison of gene expression patterns reveals that the genoarchitecture of the basal hypothalamus in zebrafish embryos 48 hours post fertilization is highly similar to mouse embryos at E13.5. We found the tuberal hypothalamus in zebrafish embryos to be relatively large and to comprise previously ill-defined regions around the posterior hypothalamic recess. The mamillary hypothalamus is smaller and concentrates to rather medial areas in proximity to the anterior end of the neural tube floor plate. Within the basal hypothalamus we identified longitudinal and transverse tuberal and mamillary subregions topologically equivalent to those previously described in other vertebrates. However, the hypothalamic diencephalic boundary region and the posterior tuberculum still provide a challenge. We applied the updated prosomeric model to the developing zebrafish hypothalamus to facilitate cross-species comparisons. Accordingly, we applied the mammalian nomenclature of hypothalamic organization to zebrafish and propose it to replace some controversial previous nomenclature.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) is the application of subthreshold, sinusoidal current to modulate ongoing brain rhythms related to sensory, motor and cognitive processes. Electrophysiological studies suggested that the effect of tACS applied at an alpha frequency (8–12 Hz) was state-dependent. The effects of tACS, that is, an increase in parieto-occipital electroencephalography (EEG) alpha power and magnetoencephalography (MEG) phase coherence, was only observed when the eyes were open (low alpha power) and not when the eyes were closed (high alpha power). This state-dependency of the effects of alpha tACS might extend to the aging brain characterized by general slowing and decrease in spectral power of the alpha rhythm. We additionally hypothesized that tACS will influence the motor cortex, which is involved in motor skill learning and consolidation. A group of young and old healthy adults performed a serial reaction time task (SRTT) with their right hand before and after the tACS stimulation. Each participant underwent three sessions of stimulation: sham, stimulation applied at the individual participant’s alpha peak frequency or individual alpha peak frequency (iAPF; α-tACS) and stimulation with iAPF plus 2 Hz (α2-tACS) to the left motor cortex for 10 min (1.5 mA). We measured the effect of stimulation on general motor skill (GMS) and sequence-specific skill (SS) consolidation. We found that α-tACS and α2-tACS improved GMS and SS consolidation in the old group. In contrast, α-tACS minimally improved GMS consolidation but impaired SS consolidation in the young group. On the other hand, α2-tACS was detrimental to the consolidation of both skills in the young group. Our results suggest that individuals with aberrant alpha rhythm such as the elderly could benefit more from tACS stimulation, whereas for young healthy individuals with intact alpha rhythm the stimulation could be detrimental.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Electroacupuncture (EA) has become popular for its adjustable strength and frequency and easy quantification in the clinic and has demonstrated therapeutic potential for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, the mechanism remains unknown. Abnormally activated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) has been closely related to the pathological process of AD. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of EA on cognitive impairment and the role of the JNK signaling pathway in AD model amyloid precursor protein (APP)/presenilin 1 (PS1) mice. The memory and learning ability of each group was assessed using the Morris Water Maze (MWM). Immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry and Western blot were performed to measure the expression of APP, JNK, phosphorylated (P-)JNK, mitogen-activated protein kinase 4 (MKK4), MKK7, c-Jun and caspase-3 in hippocampal tissue samples in APP/PS1 mice after EA intervention. Obvious cognitive deficits were observed in the AD model APP/PS1 mice in the MWM test and were associated with JNK signaling pathway activation and APP upregulation. Four weeks of EA significantly ameliorated the cognitive impairments and inhibited JNK signaling pathway activation and APP upregulation. Taken together, the findings demonstrated that EA can reverse cognitive deficits and substantially lower the burden of APP in AD model APP/PS1 mice, at least partially through inhibiting the JNK signaling pathway and regulating apoptosis signals. Therefore, EA may offer an effective alternative therapeutic approach for AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;by Florent Le Möel, Antoine Wystrach&lt;/p&gt;

Solitary foraging insects display stunning navigational behaviours in visually complex natural environments. Current literature assumes that these insects are mostly driven by attractive visual memories, which are learnt when the insect’s gaze is precisely oriented toward the goal direction, typically along its familiar route or towards its nest. That way, an insect could return home by simply moving in the direction that appears most familiar. Here we show using virtual reconstructions of natural environments that this principle suffers from fundamental drawbacks, notably, a given view of the world does not provide information about whether the agent should turn or not to reach its goal. We propose a simple model where the agent continuously compares its current view with both goal and anti-goal visual memories, which are treated as attractive and repulsive respectively. We show that this strategy effectively results in an opponent process, albeit not at the perceptual level–such as those proposed for colour vision or polarisation detection–but at the level of environmental space. This opponent process results in a signal that strongly correlates with the angular error of the current body orientation so that a single view of the world now suffices to indicate whether the agent should turn or not. By incorporating this principle into a simple agent navigating in reconstructed natural environments, we show that it overcomes the usual shortcomings and produces a step-increase in navigation effectiveness and robustness. Our findings provide a functional explanation to recent behavioural observations in ants and why and how so-called aversive and appetitive memories must be combined. We propose a likely neural implementation based on insects’ mushroom bodies’ circuitry that produces behavioural and neural predictions contrasting with previous models.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Wf2BicC5Niw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Despite advances in the modeling and understanding of colorectal cancer development, the dynamics of the progression from benign adenomatous polyp to colorectal carcinoma are still not fully resolved. To take advantage of adenoma size and prevalence data in the National Endoscopic Database of the Clinical Outcomes Research Initiative (CORI) as well as colorectal cancer incidence and size data from the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database, we construct a two-type branching process model with compartments representing adenoma and carcinoma cells. To perform parameter inference we present a new large-size approximation to the size distribution of the cancer compartment and validate our approach on simulated data. By fitting the model to the CORI and SEER data, we learn biologically relevant parameters, including the transition rate from adenoma to cancer. The inferred parameters allow us to predict the individualized risk of the presence of cancer cells for each screened patient. We provide a web application which allows the user to calculate these individual probabilities at https://ccrc-eth.shinyapps.io/CCRC/. For example, we find a 1 in 100 chance of cancer given the presence of an adenoma between 10 and 20mm size in an average risk patient at age 50. We show that our two-type branching process model recapitulates the early growth dynamics of colon adenomas and cancers and can recover epidemiological trends such as adenoma prevalence and cancer incidence while remaining mathematically and computationally tractable.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ZKXVX0O7SD8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

We describe Orbit Image Analysis, an open-source whole slide image analysis tool. The tool consists of a generic tile-processing engine which allows the execution of various image analysis algorithms provided by either Orbit itself or from other open-source platforms using a tile-based map-reduce execution framework. Orbit Image Analysis is capable of sophisticated whole slide imaging analyses due to several key features. First, Orbit has machine-learning capabilities. This deep learning segmentation can be integrated with complex object detection for analysis of intricate tissues. In addition, Orbit can run locally as standalone or connect to the open-source image server OMERO. Another important characteristic is its scale-out functionality, using the Apache Spark framework for distributed computing. In this paper, we describe the use of Orbit in three different real-world applications: quantification of idiopathic lung fibrosis, nerve fibre density quantification, and glomeruli detection in the kidney.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/X-tN569iWBE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Humans and other animals adapt motor commands to predictable disturbances within tens of trials in laboratory conditions. A central question is how does the nervous system adapt to disturbances in natural conditions when exactly the same movements cannot be practiced several times. Because motor commands and sensory feedback together carry continuous information about limb dynamics, we hypothesized that the nervous system could adapt to unexpected disturbances online. We tested this hypothesis in two reaching experiments during which velocity-dependent force fields (FFs) were randomly applied. We found that within-movement feedback corrections gradually improved, despite the fact that the perturbations were unexpected. Moreover, when participants were instructed to stop at a via-point, the application of a FF prior to the via-point induced mirror-image after-effects after the via-point, consistent with within-trial adaptation to the unexpected dynamics. These findings suggest a fast time-scale of motor learning, which complements feedback control and supports adaptation of an ongoing movement.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract&lt;p&gt;The first Wnt signaling ligand discovered, &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; Wingless (Wg; Wnt1 in mammals), plays critical roles in neuromuscular junction (NMJ) development, regulating synaptic architecture and function. Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), consisting of a core protein with heparan sulfate (HS) glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains, bind to Wg ligands to control both extracellular distribution and intercellular signaling function. &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; HSPGs previously shown to regulate Wg &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-synaptic signaling at the NMJ include the glypican Dally-like Protein (Dlp) and perlecan Terribly Reduced Optic Lobes (Trol). Here, we investigate synaptogenic functions of the most recently described &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; HSPG, secreted Carrier of Wingless (Cow), which directly binds Wg in the extracellular space. At the glutamatergic NMJ, we find that Cow secreted from the presynaptic motor neuron acts to limit synaptic architecture and neurotransmission strength. In c&lt;i&gt;ow&lt;/i&gt; null mutants, we find increased synaptic bouton number and elevated excitatory current amplitudes, phenocopying presynaptic Wg overexpression. We show &lt;i&gt;cow&lt;/i&gt; null mutants exhibit an increased number of glutamatergic synapses and increased synaptic vesicle (SV) fusion frequency based both on GCaMP imaging and electrophysiology recording. We find that membrane-tethered Wg prevents &lt;i&gt;cow&lt;/i&gt; null defects in NMJ development, indicating that Cow mediates secreted Wg signaling. It was shown previously that the secreted Wg deacylase Notum restricts Wg signaling at the NMJ, and we show here that Cow and Notum work through the same pathway to limit synaptic development. We conclude Cow acts cooperatively with Notum to coordinate neuromuscular synapse structural and functional differentiation via negative regulation of Wg &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-synaptic signaling within the extracellular synaptomatrix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Wnt intercellular signaling is disrupted in numerous devastating neurological disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease. Therefore, an understanding of Wnt signaling regulation is important for the design and implementation of targeted treatments. As a disease model, the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; glutamatergic NMJ system is large, accessible and genetically malleable, and thus well suited for discovering the molecular and cellular mechanisms of Wnt signaling regulation. Extracellular HSPGs are important players as regulators of Wnt intercellular signaling. Here, we show secreted HSPG Carrier of Wingless (Cow), which directly binds to the founding Wnt-1 ligand, regulates NMJ structure and function. The mammalian homolog of Cow, Testican-2, is highly expressed in the brain. Studying this HSPG in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; should inform mechanisms of Wnt regulation in human brain.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/6/1355?rss=1"/>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited form of intellectual disability, resulted from the silencing of the &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; gene and the subsequent loss of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). Spine dysgenesis and cognitive impairment have been extensively characterized in FXS; however, the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. As an important regulator of spine maturation, intercellular adhesion molecule 5 (ICAM5) mRNA may be one of the targets of FMRP and involved in cognitive impairment in FXS. Here we show that in &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; KO male mice, ICAM5 was excessively expressed during the late developmental stage, and its expression was negatively correlated with the expression of FMRP and positively related with the morphological abnormalities of dendritic spines. While &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; reduction of ICAM5 normalized dendritic spine abnormalities in &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; KO neurons, and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; knockdown of ICAM5 in the dentate gyrus rescued the impaired spatial and fear memory and anxiety-like behaviors in &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; KO mice, through both granule cell and mossy cell with a relative rate of 1.32 ± 0.15. Furthermore, biochemical analyses showed direct binding of FMRP with ICAM5 mRNA, to the coding sequence of ICAM5 mRNA. Together, our study suggests that ICAM5 is one of the targets of FMRP and is implicated in the molecular pathogenesis of FXS. ICAM5 could be a therapeutic target for treating cognitive impairment in FXS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is characterized by dendritic spine dysgenesis and cognitive dysfunctions, while one of the FMRP latent targets, ICAM5, is well established for contributing both spine maturation and learning performance. In this study, we examined the potential link between ICAM5 mRNA and FMRP in FXS, and further investigated the molecular details and pathological consequences of ICAM5 overexpression. Our results indicate a critical role of ICAM5 in spine maturation and cognitive impairment in FXS and suggest that ICAM5 is a potential molecular target for the development of medication against FXS.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;In psychiatry, we often speak of constructing &quot;models.&quot; Here we try to make
sense of what such a claim might mean, starting with the most fundamental
question: &quot;What is (and isn't) a model?&quot;. We then discuss, in a concrete
measurable sense, what it means for a model to be useful. In so doing, we first
identify the added value that a computational model can provide, in the context
of accuracy and power. We then present the limitations of standard statistical
methods and provide suggestions for how we can expand the explanatory power of
our analyses by reconceptualizing statistical models as dynamical systems.
Finally, we address the problem of model building, suggesting ways in which
computational psychiatry can escape the potential for cognitive biases imposed
by classical hypothesis-driven research, exploiting deep systems-level
information contained within neuroimaging data to advance our understanding of
psychiatric neuroscience.

 &lt;p&gt;Declarative memory has been studied for its relationship with remembering
daily life experiences. Previous studies reported changes in power spectra
during encoding phase related to behavioral performance, however decoding phase
still needs to be explored. This study investigates neural oscillations changes
related to memory process. Participants were asked to perform a memory task for
encoding and decoding phase while EEG signals were recorded. Results showed
that for encoding phase, there was a significant decrease of power in low beta,
high beta bands over fronto-central area and a decrease in low beta, high beta
and gamma bands over left temporal area related to successful subsequent memory
effects. For decoding phase, only significant decreases of alpha power were
observed over fronto-central area. This finding showed relevance of beta and
alpha band for encoding and decoding phase of a memory task respectively.

 &lt;p&gt;In this study, 3D brain-computer interface (BCI) training platforms were used
to stimulate the subjects for visual motion imagery and visual perception. We
measured the activation brain region and alpha-band power activity when the
subjects perceived and imagined the stimuli. Based on this, 4-class were
classified in visual stimuli session and visual motion imagery session
respectively. The results showed that the occipital region is involved in
visual perception and visual motion imagery, and alpha-band power is increased
in visual motion imagery session and decreased in visual motion stimuli
session. Compared with the performance of visual motion imagery and motor
imagery, visual motion imagery has higher performance than motor imagery. The
binary class was classified using one versus rest approach as well as analysis

 &lt;p&gt;Hearing loss is a problem that impacts a significant proportion of the adult population. Cochlear hair cell (HC) loss due to loud noise, chemotherapy and aging is the major underlying cause. A significant proportion of these individuals are dissatisfied with available treatment options which include hearing aids and cochlear implants. An alternative approach to restore hearing would be to regenerate HCs. Such therapy would require a recapitulation of the complex architecture of the organ of Corti, necessitating regeneration of both mature HCs and supporting cells (SCs). Transcriptional profiles of the mature cell types in the cochlea are necessary to can provide a metric for eventual regeneration therapies. To assist in this effort, we sought to provide the first single-cell characterization of the adult cochlear SC transcriptome. We performed single-cell RNA-Seq on FACS-purified adult cochlear SCs from the Lfng&lt;sup&gt;EGFP&lt;/sup&gt; adult mouse, in which SCs express GFP. We demonstrate that adult cochlear SCs are transcriptionally distinct from their perinatal counterparts. We establish cell-type-specific adult cochlear SC transcriptome profiles, and we validate these expression profiles through a combination of both fluorescent immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization co-localization and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) of adult cochlear SCs. Furthermore, we demonstrate the relevance of these profiles to the adult human cochlea through immunofluorescent human temporal bone histopathology. Finally, we demonstrate cell cycle regulator expression in adult SCs and perform pathway analyses to identify potential mechanisms for facilitating mitotic regeneration (cell proliferation, differentiation, and eventually regeneration) in the adult mammalian cochlea. Our findings demonstrate the importance of characterizing mature as opposed to perinatal SCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;One of the main risk factors for brain diseases is aging. Recent studies have shown that aging is a progressive degenerative process associated with chronic low-level inflammation. The ATP-gated P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) plays an important role in inflammation and has been associated with different brain (e.g., Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s) or other age-related (osteoporosis, arthritis, cancer) diseases. Several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the P2RX7 gene have been identified, including the loss-of-function 1513A&amp;gt;C and 1405A&amp;gt;G SNPs, and the gain-of-function 489C&amp;gt;T and 1068G&amp;gt;A SNPs. We carried out a literature analysis to verify an association between P2RX7 SNPs’ frequency and age. In 34 worldwide eligible studies (11.858 subjects) no correlation between 1513CC genotype frequency and age emerged. On the contrary, analysis of European Caucasian cohorts (7.241 subjects) showed a significant increase in 1513CC frequency with age (P = 0.027). In agreement with these findings, analysis of two publicly available datasets, including USA Caucasian cohorts, unveiled an increased frequency of 1513CC and 489CC genotypes with age (P = 0.0055 and P = 0.0019, respectively). Thus, hypomorphic P2RX7 genotypes may be positively selected with age in European and North American Caucasian populations. We hypothesize that Caucasian individuals bearing an anti-inflammatory P2X7R phenotype and living in high-income countries may have a longer life expectancy.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Current evidence indicates that certain immune molecules such as components of the complement system are directly involved in neurobiological processes related to brain development, including neurogenesis, neuronal migration, synaptic remodeling, and response to prenatal or early postnatal brain insults. Consequently, complement system dysfunction has been increasingly implicated in disorders of neurodevelopmental origin, such as schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and Rett syndrome. However, the mechanistic evidence for a causal relationship between impaired complement regulation and these disorders varies depending on the disease involved. Also, it is still unclear to what extent altered complement expression plays a role in these disorders through inflammation-independent or -dependent mechanisms. Furthermore, pathogenic mutations in specific complement components have been implicated in the etiology of 3MC syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive developmental disorder. The aims of this review are to discuss the current knowledge on the roles of the complement system in sculpting brain architecture and function during normal development as well as after specific inflammatory insults, such as maternal immune activation (MIA) during pregnancy, and to evaluate the existing evidence associating aberrant complement with developmental brain disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Background&lt;p&gt;Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the posterior subthalamic area (PSA) provides a potentially effective treatment for medication-refractory essential tremor (ET).&lt;/p&gt;Objective&lt;p&gt;To study the clinical benefits and adverse-event profile of bilateral PSA-DBS for refractory ET.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Seven patients with refractory ET underwent bilateral PSA-DBS surgery under general anesthesia between September 2017 and May 2018. Clinical outcome assessments, using the Essential Tremor Rating Scale, were performed at 1-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up, except for the last assessment of one patient who was followed up to 9 months. Analysis was focused on changes in patients’ motor symptoms and quality of life following surgery as well as documenting the adverse-event profile associated with the surgical PSA-DBS treatment.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;After surgery, patients’ motor symptoms, including upper limb tremor and head tremor, were improved by 84.2% and their quality of life by 81.25% at 1-month follow-up. The clinical benefits to patients were maintained at 6-month and last follow-up. Adverse side effects included dysarthria (n = 4), balance disorder (n = 2), and paresthesia of the right limb (n = 1). No habituation effects were observed throughout the follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Bilateral PSA-DBS seems to offer an effective and safe alternative treatment for medically intractable ET, warranting further research into its clinical utility, adverse-event profile, and comparative effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 Introduction&lt;p&gt;Several studies explored the biological effects of extremely low-frequency magnetic fields (ELF-MFs) in vitro, reporting the induction of functional changes in neuronal activity. In particular, ELF-MFs can influence synaptic plasticity both in vitro and in animal models but some studies reported an increase in long-term potentiation (LTP) whereas others suggested its reduction. However, no specific study has investigated such effect on humans.&lt;/p&gt;Aims&lt;p&gt;To evaluate whether ELF-MFs affect the propensity of the human cortex to undergo LTP-like plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We designed a randomized, single-blind, sham-controlled, cross-over study on 10 healthy subjects. Cortical plasticity was induced by intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) before and after 45-min ELF-MFs (75 Hz; 1.8 mT) or sham exposure and was estimated by measuring the changes of motor evoked potentials (MEP) amplitude before and after each iTBS.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;No adverse events were reported. No significant effects of ELF-MFs on cortical plasticity were found.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Whole-brain exposure to ELF-MFs (75 Hz; 1.8 mT) is safe and does not seem to significantly affect LTP-like plasticity in human motor cortex.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00474"/>
		<id>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00474</id>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Background: Transcranial stimulation with direct (tDCS) and alternating current (tACS) has increasingly gained interest in various fields, from cognitive neuroscience to clinical investigations. Transcranial current stimulation used alone may modulate brain activity that consequently influences behaviors, without providing information on potentially induced brain activity changes. The combination of transcranial current stimulation and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) may help to address this. This exploratory study investigated instantaneous and subsequent effects of tDCS and tACS on resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) in healthy adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We conducted a randomized crossover study with 15 healthy subjects receiving three stimulation conditions (tDCS, tACS, and sham) on separate days. Stimulation was applied over the left and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) for 30 min (1 mA). rsFC of the targeted prefrontal areas was assessed before, during, and after stimulation using multiband fMRI and using left and right DLPFC as seeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Both tDCS and tACS increased rsFC during and after the stimulation period, as compared to sham. tDCS-induced changes were observed between the left DLPFC and bilateral parietal regions at the junction of the superior parietal and the inferior parietal lobules. tACS-induced changes were observed between the left DLPFC and the right inferior parietal lobule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Overall, these results suggest that a single session with a low dose, 1 mA, of tDCS or tACS can cause changes in fronto-parietal connectivity that occur rapidly, that is, within the first 15 min. Although exploratory, this work contributes to the discussion of the potential of transcranial current stimulation to modulate resting-state networks and the interest of combining transcranial current stimulation with neuroimaging to identify these changes.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Aging, noise, and ototoxic drug-induced hair cell (HC) loss are the major causes of sensorineural hearing loss. Aminoglycoside antibiotics are commonly used in the clinic, but these often have ototoxic side effects due to the accumulation of oxygen-free radicals and the subsequent induction of HC apoptosis. Blebbistatin is a myosin II inhibitor that regulates microtubule assembly and myosin–actin interactions, and most research has focused on its ability to modulate cardiac or urinary bladder contractility. By regulating the cytoskeletal structure and reducing the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), blebbistatin can prevent apoptosis in many different types of cells. However, there are no reports on the effect of blebbistatin in HC apoptosis. In this study, we found that the presence of blebbistatin significantly inhibited neomycin-induced apoptosis in HC-like HEI-OC-1 cells. We also found that blebbistatin treatment significantly increased the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), decreased ROS accumulation, and inhibited pro-apoptotic gene expression in both HC-like HEI-OC-1 cells and explant-cultured cochlear HCs after neomycin exposure. Meanwhile, blebbistatin can protect the synaptic connections between HCs and cochlear spiral ganglion neurons. This study showed that blebbistatin could maintain mitochondrial function and reduce the ROS level and thus could maintain the viability of HCs after neomycin exposure and the neural function in the inner ear, suggesting that blebbistatin has potential clinic application in protecting against ototoxic drug-induced HC loss.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;A comprehensive concept of the biological basis of reward, social and emotional behavior, and language requires a deeper understanding of the microstructure and connectivity of the underlying brain regions. Such understanding could provide deeper insights into their role in functional networks, and form the anatomical basis of the functional segregation of this region as shown in recent in vivo imaging studies. Here, we investigated the cytoarchitecture of the lateral orbitofrontal cortex (lateral OFC) in serial histological sections of 10 human postmortem brains by image analysis and a statistically reproducible approach to detect borders between cortical areas. Profiles of the volume fraction of cell bodies were therefore extracted from digitized histological images, describing laminar changes from the layer I/layer II boundary to the white matter. As a result, four new areas, Fo4–7, were identified. Area Fo4 was mainly found in the anterior orbital gyrus (AOG), Fo5 anteriorly in the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), Fo6 in the lateral orbital gyrus (LOG), and Fo7 in the lateral orbital sulcus. Areas differed in cortical thickness, abundance and size of pyramidal cells in layer III and degree of granularity in layer IV. A hierarchical cluster analysis was used to quantify cytoarchitectonic differences between them. The 3D-reconstructed areas were transformed into the single-subject template of the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI), where probabilistic maps and a maximum probability map (MPM) were calculated as part of the JuBrain Cytoarchitectonic Atlas. These maps served as reference data to study the functional properties of the areas using the BrainMap database. The type of behavioral tasks that activated them was analyzed to get first insights of co-activation patterns of the lateral OFC and its contribution to cognitive networks. Meta-analytic connectivity modeling (MACM) showed that functional decoding revealed activation in gustatory perception in Fo4; reward and somesthetic perception in Fo5; semantic processing and pain perception in Fo6; and emotional processing and covert reading in Fo7. Together with existing maps of the JuBrain Cytoarchitectonic Atlas, the new maps can now be used as an open-source reference for neuroimaging studies, allowing to further decode brain function.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Objectives: Blood lipid profiles have been ambiguously reported as biomarkers of AD in recent years. This study was conducted to evaluate the correlation between blood lipid levels and AD in later-life and to explore the effectiveness and reliability of blood lipid profiles as biomarkers of AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Database searching was conducted using PubMed, the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and Medline. This study was designed following the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) criteria. Review Manager 5.3 (RevMan 5.3) software was adopted to perform meta-analysis evaluating the standard mean difference (SMD) with its 95% confidence intervals (CI).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: A total of 5,286 participants were enrolled from 27 case–control studies in this meta-analysis. The pooled results demonstrated that total cholesterol (TC) level was significantly associated with AD in late-life (SMD = 0.17, 95% CI: [0.01, 0.32], P = 0.03), especially in the subgroup under 70 years old (SMD: 0.45, 95% CI: [0.11, 0.79], P = 0.01) and the subgroup of Western population (SMD: 0.29, 95% CI: [0.04, 0.53], P = 0.02). In the subgroup under 70 years old, the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) level (SMD = −0.50, 95% CI: [−0.76, −0.25], P = 0.0001) and the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level (SMD = 0.59, 95% CI: [0.02, 1.16], P = 0.04) in the AD group were significantly lower and higher than in the control group, respectively. In the subgroup with a sample size larger than 100 subjects, the LDL-C level was significantly higher in AD patients than in the control elderly group (SMD = 0.31, 95% CI: [0.05, 0.56], P = 0.02). There was no significant association between triglyceride (TG) levels and AD in later-life (SMD = −0.00, 95% CI: [−0.12, 0.12], P = 1.00).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: TC can be a new predictive biomarker of AD or cognitive decline in later-life. Increased TC levels are found to be associated with an elevated risk of AD. Decreased HDL-C levels and increased LDL-C levels may relate to an elevated risk of AD in subjects aged 60–70. Further comprehensive researches will be necessary in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Richard H. Masland––Dick to all who knew him––died on December 13, 2019, from cancer, four years after his initial diagnosis. During this interval, while enduring major fluctuations in health, Dick managed to start and complete an approachable and reflective book, We Know It When We See It: What the Neurobiology of Vision Tells Us About How We Think (March 2020). We are gladdened, though not surprised, that his wife, Jean, reports, “Dick was truly amazing the way he faced his illness, never showing signs of depression or anger but soldiering on with a positive attitude toward life.”</content>

 In this issue of Neuron, Dong et al. (2020) finds that deficiency of the psychiatric risk gene Cul3, which encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase, leads to an upregulation of Cap-dependent protein translation. The resulting imbalance in protein synthesis and degradation is found to disrupt glutamatergic transmission and excitability in networks that underlie sociability and anxiety.</content>

HIV infection can be cleared with antiretroviral drugs if they are administered before exposure, where exposure occurs at low viral doses which infect one or few cells. However, infection clearance does not happen once infection is established, and this may be because of the very early formation of a reservoir of latently infected cells. Here we investigated whether initial low dose infection could be cleared with sub-optimal drug inhibition which allows ongoing viral replication, and hence does not require latency for viral persistence. We derived a model for infection clearance with inputs being drug effects on ongoing viral replication and initial number of infected cells. We experimentally tested the model by inhibiting low dose infection with the drug tenofovir, which interferes with initial infection, and atazanavir, which reduces the cellular virion burst size and hence inhibits replication only after initial infection. Drugs were used at concentrations which allowed infection to expand. Under these conditions, tenofovir dramatically increased clearance while atazanavir did not. Addition of latency to the model resulted in a minor decrease in clearance probability if the drug inhibited initial infection. If not, latency strongly decreased clearance even at low latent cell frequencies. Therefore, the ability of drugs to clear initial but not established infection can be recapitulated without latency and depends only on the ability to target initial infection. The presence of latency can dramatically decrease infection clearance, but only if the drug is unable to interfere with infection of the first cells.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/kF2hd7QFppY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Localization of odors is essential to animal survival, and thus animals are adept at odor navigation. In natural conditions animals encounter odor sources in which odor is carried by air flow varying in complexity. We sought to identify potential minimalist strategies that can effectively be used for odor-based navigation and asses their performance in an increasingly chaotic environment. To do so, we compared mouse, &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; model, and Arduino-based robot odor-localization behavior in a standardized odor landscape. Mouse performance remains robust in the presence of increased complexity, showing a shift in strategy towards faster movement with increased environmental complexity. Implementing simple binaral and temporal models of tropotaxis and klinotaxis, an &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; model and Arduino robot, in the same environment as the mice, are equally successful in locating the odor source within a plume of low complexity. However, performance of these algorithms significantly drops when the chaotic nature of the plume is increased. Additionally, both algorithm-driven systems show more successful performance when using a strictly binaral model at a larger sensor separation distance and more successful performance when using a temporal and binaral model when using a smaller sensor separation distance. This suggests that with an increasingly chaotic odor environment, mice rely on complex strategies that allow for robust odor localization that cannot be resolved by minimal algorithms that display robust performance at low levels of complexity. Thus, highlighting that an animal’s ability to modulate behavior with environmental complexity is beneficial for odor localization.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract&lt;p&gt;Propofol is the most common general anesthetic used for surgery in humans, yet its complete mechanism of action remains elusive. In addition to potentiating inhibitory synapses in the brain, propofol also impairs excitatory neurotransmission. We use electrophysiological recordings from individual glutamatergic boutons in male and female larval &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; motor nerve terminals to characterize this effect. We recorded from two bouton types, which have distinct presynaptic physiology and different average numbers of release sites or active zones. We show that a clinically relevant dose of propofol (3μM) impairs neurotransmitter release similarly at both bouton types, by decreasing the number of active release sites by half, without affecting release probability. In contrast, an analog of propofol has no effect on glutamate release. Co-expressing a truncated syntaxin1A protein in presynaptic boutons completely blocked this effect of propofol. Overexpressing wild-type syntaxin1A in boutons also conferred a level of resistance, by increasing the number of active release sites to a physiological ceiling set by the number of active zones or T-bars, and in this way counteracting the effect of propofol. These results point to the presynaptic release machinery as a target for the general anesthetic. Proportionally equivalent effects of propofol on the number of active release sites across the different bouton types suggests that smaller glutamatergic boutons with fewer release sites may be more vulnerable to the presynaptic effects of the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; Over 200 million surgeries are performed worldwide under general anesthesia every year, and the anesthetic of choice is increasingly the intravenous agent propofol. Sedation produced by propofol is understood to result from postsynaptic activation of inhibitory mechanisms in the brain. We have identified a presynaptic effect of propofol, on excitatory synapses. Recording from individual glutamatergic boutons in fly larvae, we found that a clinically relevant dose of propofol impairs glutamate release, by proportionally decreasing the participation of release sites across different bouton types. This suggests that propofol anesthesia involves presynaptic as well as postsynaptic mechanisms, and a proportional effect in large and small boutons may explain why some circuits are more vulnerable than others to the effects of the drug.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract&lt;p&gt;Neurons in the gustatory cortex (GC) process multiple aspects of a tasting experience, encoding not only the physiochemical identity of tastes, but also their anticipation and hedonic value. Information pertaining to these stimulus features is relayed to GC via the gustatory thalamus (VPMpc) and basolateral amygdala (BLA). It is not known if these inputs drive separate groups of neurons, thus activating separate channels of information, or are integrated by neurons that receive both afferents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we used anterograde labeling and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; intracellular recordings in anesthetized rats to assess the potential convergence of BLA and VPMpc inputs in GC, and to investigate the dynamics of integration of these inputs. We report substantial anatomical overlap of BLA and VPMpc axonal fields across GC, and identify a population of GC neurons receiving converging BLA and VPMpc inputs. Our data show that BLA modulates the gain of VPMpc-evoked responses in a time-dependent fashion and that this modulation is dependent on the recruitment of synaptic inhibition by both BLA and VPMpc. Our results suggest that BLA shapes cortical processing of thalamic inputs by dynamically gating the excitatory/inhibitory balance of the GC circuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; The gustatory cortex (GC) is ideal for studying sensory and limbic signals to primary sensory cortices. GC encodes the chemosensory and affective components of taste by integrating inputs from thalamus and basolateral amygdala. Classic studies postulated a separation of sensory and limbic channels. However, reports of GC neurons encoding taste, palatability, and expectation in their dynamic firing modulations challenge this view. Here, we show the synaptic basis of the convergence and integration of thalamic and amygdalar inputs onto single GC neurons. Our data reveal a population of GC neurons receiving monosynaptic drive from both regions and show that amygdalar inputs can gate the processing of thalamic signals. Altogether, our data demonstrate that GC integrates, rather than segregates, these channels.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;LAMA2-related congenital muscular dystrophy, also known as MDC1A, is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the alpha2 chain of Laminin-211. Loss of this protein interrupts the connection between the muscle cell and its extracellular environment and results in an aggressive, congenital-onset muscular dystrophy characterized by severe hypotonia, lack of independent ambulation, and early mortality driven by respiratory complications and/or failure to thrive. Of the pathomechanisms of MDC1A, the earliest and most prominent is widespread and rampant fibrosis. Here, we will discuss some of the key drivers of fibrosis including TGF-beta and renin–angiotensin system signaling and consequences of these pathways including myofibroblast transdifferentiation and matrix remodeling. We will also highlight some of the differences in fibrogenesis in congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD) with that seen in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Finally, we will connect the key signaling pathways in the pathogenesis of MDC1A to the current status of the therapeutic approaches that have been tested in the preclinical models of MDC1A to treat fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Brain structural plasticity is an extraordinary tool that allows the mature brain to adapt to environmental changes, to learn, to repair itself after lesions or disease, and to slow aging. A long history of neuroscience research led to fascinating discoveries of different types of plasticity, involving changes in the genetically determined structure of nervous tissue, up to the ultimate dream of neuronal replacement: a stem cell-driven “adult neurogenesis” (AN). Yet, this road does not seem a straight one, since mutable dogmas, conflicting results and conflicting interpretations continue to warm the field. As a result, after more than 10,000 papers published on AN, we still do not know its time course, rate or features with respect to other kinds of structural plasticity in our brain. The solution does not appear to be behind the next curve, as differences among mammals reveal a very complex landscape that cannot be easily understood from rodents models alone. By considering evolutionary aspects, some pitfalls in the interpretation of cell markers, and a novel population of undifferentiated cells that are not newly generated [immature neurons (INs)], we address some conflicting results and controversies in order to find the right road forward. We suggest that considering plasticity in a comparative framework might help assemble the evolutionary, anatomical and functional pieces of a very complex biological process with extraordinary translational potential.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Hemiparkinsonism-hemiatrophy syndrome (HPHA) and hemidystonia-hemiatrophy syndrome (HDHA) are rare movement disorders composed of hemidystonia or hemiparkinsonism that present with unilateral limb, face, trunk, or cerebral hemiatrophy and mostly occur following head trauma or postanoxic events. However, relatively little is known about the pathogenesis of these conditions. In our case series, we present three HPHA patients and one HDHA patient who underwent detailed neuropsychological, radiological, motor, and non-motor functional assessments with a mean follow-up of 2 years. We followed two patients who showed differences in their progression for more than 2 years: one barely progressed with no treatment, and the other exhibited levodopa-induce dyskinesia (LID) and definitive progression while receiving multiple adjunctive therapies. In addition, we performed positron emission tomography (PET) with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and 18F-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) in one HPHA patient who showed bilaterally symmetrical uptake of FDG with no significant increase or decrease in the cerebral hemispheres, including the striatum, but exhibited a significant reduction in the uptake of 18F-DOPA in the contralateral posterior striatum. In this study, we followed HPHA patients who showed different disease courses to explore the clinical characteristics and pathogenesis of HPHA and HDHA and illustrate the clinical heterogeneity of these diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) remains one of the most debilitating types of stroke and is characterized by a sudden bleeding from a ruptured blood vessel. ICH often results in high mortality and in survivors, permanent disability. Most studies have focused on neuroprotective strategies designed to minimize secondary consequences and prevent further pathology. Lacking is an understanding of how ICH acutely affects cerebrovascular components and their response to therapeutic interventions. We hypothesized that ICH alters cortical vessel complexity in the parenchyma adjacent to site of the initial vascular disruption and that vascular abnormalities would be mitigated by administration of the PDGFR inhibitor, Imatinib mesylate (Gleevec). Briefly, ICH was induced in male adult rats by injection of collagenase into basal ganglia, followed by Gleevec administration (60 mg/kg) 1 h after injury. Rats were then perfused using vessel painting methodology (Salehi et al., 2018b) to stain whole brain vascular networks at 1 day post-ICH. Axial and coronal wide field fluorescence microscopy was performed. Analyses for vascular features were undertaken and fractal analysis for vascular complexity. Data were collected from four groups of rats: Sham + Vehicle; Sham + Gleevec; ICH + Vehicle; ICH + Gleevec. Microscopy revealed that cortical vessels in both ipsi- and contralateral hemispheres exhibited significantly reduced density and branching by 22 and 34%, respectively. Fractal measures confirmed reduced complexity as well. Gleevec treatment further reduced vascular parameters, including reductions in vessel density in tissues adjacent to the ICH. The reductions in brain wide vascular networks after Gleevec in the current study after ICH is contrasted by previous reports of improved behavioral outcomes and decreased lCH lesion volumes Reductions in the vascular network after Gleevec may be involved in long-term repair mechanisms by pruning injured vessels to ultimately promote new vessel growth.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 Background&lt;p&gt;The astrocytic phospholipase A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (PLA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)-arachidonic acid (AA) pathway is crucial in understanding the reduction of cerebral blood flow (CBF) prior to cognitive deterioration. In complementary and alternative medicine, manual acupuncture (MA) is used as one of the most important therapies for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The beneficial effects of MA on CBF were reported in our previous study. However, the underlying molecular mechanism remains largely elusive.&lt;/p&gt;Objective&lt;p&gt;To investigate the effect of MA on the astrocytic PLA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-AA pathway in SAMP8 mice hippocampi.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;SAMP8 mice were divided into the SAMP8 control (Pc) group, the SAMP8 MA (Pm) group and the SAMP8 donepezil (Pd) group. SAMR1 mice were used as the SAMRl control (Rc) group. Mice in the Pd group were treated with donepezil hydrochloride at 0.65 μg/g. In the Pm group, MA was applied at Baihui (GV20) and Yintang (GV29) for 20 min. The above treatments were administered once a day for 26 consecutive days. The Morris water maze was applied to assess spatial learning and memory. Immunofluorescence staining, western blot and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry were used to investigate the expression of related proteins and measure the contents of the metabolic intermediates of the PLA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-AA pathway.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Compared with that in the Rc group, the escape latency in the Pc group significantly increased (p &amp;lt; 0.01); whereas, the platform crossover number and percentage of time and swimming distance in the platform quadrant decreased (p &amp;lt; 0.01). The hippocampal expression of PLA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, cyclooxygenase-1, cytochrome P450 proteins 2C23 and the levels of AA, prostaglandin E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and epoxyeicosatrienoic acids of the Pc group was drastically higher than that in the Rc group (p &amp;lt; 0.01). These changes were reversed by MA and donepezil (p &amp;lt; 0.01 or p &amp;lt; 0.05).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;MA can effectively improve the learning and memory abilities of SAMP8 mice and has a negative regulatory effect on the PLA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-AA pathway. We propose that the increase of the arterial tone, which is induced by the inhibition of vasodilatory pathway, may be a reason for the beneficial effect of MA on CBF.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Processing of positron emission tomography (PET) data typically involves manual work, causing inter-operator variance. Here we introduce the Magia toolbox that enables processing of brain PET data with minimal user intervention. We investigated the accuracy of Magia with four tracers: [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]carfentanil, [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]raclopride, [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]MADAM, and [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]PiB. We used data from 30 control subjects for each tracer. Five operators manually delineated reference regions for each subject. The data were processed using Magia using the manually and automatically generated reference regions. We first assessed inter-operator variance resulting from the manual delineation of reference regions. We then compared the differences between the manually and automatically produced reference regions and the subsequently obtained binding potentials and standardized-uptake-value-ratios. The results show that manually produced reference regions can be remarkably different from each other, leading to substantial differences also in outcome measures. While the Magia-derived reference regions were anatomically different from the manual ones, Magia produced outcome measures highly consistent with the average of the manually obtained estimates. For [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]carfentanil and [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]PiB there was no bias, while for [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]raclopride and [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]MADAM Magia produced 3–5% higher binding potentials. Based on these results and considering the high inter-operator variance of the manual method, we conclude that Magia can be reliably used to process brain PET data.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The aim of the present study was to investigate whether EEG resting state connectivity correlates with intelligence. One-hundred and sixty five participants took part in the study. Six minutes of eyes closed EEG resting state was recorded for each participant. Graph theoretical connectivity metrics were calculated separately for two well-established synchronization measures [weighted Phase Lag Index (wPLI) and Imaginary Coherence (iMCOH)] and for sensor- and source EEG space. Non-verbal intelligence was measured with Raven’s Progressive Matrices. In line with the Neural Efficiency Hypothesis, path lengths characteristics of the brain networks (Average and Characteristic Path lengths, Diameter and Closeness Centrality) within alpha band range were significantly correlated with non-verbal intelligence for sensor space but no for source space. According to our results, variance in non-verbal intelligence measure can be mainly explained by the graph metrics built from the networks that include both weak and strong connections between the nodes.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;In perceptual decision making the brain extracts and accumulates decision evidence from a stimulus over time and eventually makes a decision based on the accumulated evidence. Several characteristics of this process have been observed in human electrophysiological experiments, especially an average build-up of motor-related signals supposedly reflecting accumulated evidence, when averaged across trials. Another recently established approach to investigate the representation of decision evidence in brain signals is to correlate the within-trial fluctuations of decision evidence with the measured signals. We here report results of this approach for a two-alternative forced choice reaction time experiment measured using magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings. Our results show: (1) that decision evidence is most strongly represented in the MEG signals in three consecutive phases and (2) that posterior cingulate cortex is involved most consistently, among all brain areas, in all three of the identified phases. As most previous work on perceptual decision making in the brain has focused on parietal and motor areas, our findings therefore suggest that the role of the posterior cingulate cortex in perceptual decision making may be currently underestimated.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Optogenetics is revolutionizing Neuroscience, but an often neglected effect of light stimulation of the brain is the generation of heat. In extreme cases, light-generated heat kills neurons, but mild temperature changes alter neuronal function. To date, most in vivo experiments rely on light stimulation of neural tissue using fiber-coupled lasers of various wavelengths. Brain tissue is irradiated with high light power that can be deleterious to neuronal function. Furthermore, absorbed light generates heat that can lead to permanent tissue damage and affect neuronal excitability. Thus, light alone can generate effects in neuronal function that are unrelated to the genuine “optogenetic effect.” In this work, we perform a theoretical analysis to investigate the effects of heat transfer in rodent brain tissue for standard optogenetic protocols. More precisely, we first use the Kubelka-Munk model for light propagation in brain tissue to observe the absorption phenomenon. Then, we model the optothermal effect considering the common laser wavelengths (473 and 593 nm) used in optogenetic experiments approaching the time/space numerical solution of Pennes' bio-heat equation with the Finite Element Method. Finally, we then modeled channelrhodopsin-2 in a single and spontaneous-firing neuron to explore the effect of heat in light stimulated neurons. We found that, at commonly used light intensities, laser radiation considerably increases the temperature in the surrounding tissue. This effect alters action potential size and shape and causes an increase in spontaneous firing frequency in a neuron model. However, the shortening of activation time constants generated by heat in the single firing neuron model produces action potential failures in response to light stimulation. We also found changes in the power spectrum density and a reduction in the time required for synchronization in an interneuron network model of gamma oscillations. Our findings indicate that light stimulation with intensities used in optogenetic experiments may affect neuronal function not only by direct excitation of light sensitive ion channels and/or pumps but also by generating heat. This approach serves as a guide to design optogenetic experiments that minimize the role of tissue heating in the experimental outcome.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain tissue sodium levels increase during migraine. However, little is known regarding the underlying mechanisms of sodium homeostasis disturbance in the brain during the onset and propagation of migraine. Exploring the cause of sodium dysregulation in the brain is important, since correction of the altered sodium homeostasis could potentially treat migraine. Under the hypothesis that disturbances in sodium transport mechanisms at the blood-CSF barrier (BCSFB) and/or the blood-brain barrier (BBB) are the underlying cause of the elevated CSF and brain tissue sodium levels during migraines, we developed a mechanistic, differential equation model of a rat's brain to compare the significance of the BCSFB and the BBB in controlling CSF and brain tissue sodium levels. The model includes the ventricular system, subarachnoid space, brain tissue and blood. Sodium transport from blood to CSF across the BCSFB, and from blood to brain tissue across the BBB were modeled by influx permeability coefficients P&lt;sub&gt;BCSFB&lt;/sub&gt; and P&lt;sub&gt;BBB&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively, while sodium movement from CSF into blood across the BCSFB, and from brain tissue to blood across the BBB were modeled by efflux permeability coefficients PBCSFB′ and PBBB′, respectively. We then performed a global sensitivity analysis to investigate the sensitivity of the ventricular CSF, subarachnoid CSF and brain tissue sodium concentrations to pathophysiological variations in P&lt;sub&gt;BCSFB&lt;/sub&gt;, P&lt;sub&gt;BBB&lt;/sub&gt;, PBCSFB′ and PBBB′. Our results show that the ventricular CSF sodium concentration is highly influenced by perturbations of P&lt;sub&gt;BCSFB&lt;/sub&gt;, and to a much lesser extent by perturbations of PBCSFB′. Brain tissue and subarachnoid CSF sodium concentrations are more sensitive to pathophysiological variations of P&lt;sub&gt;BBB&lt;/sub&gt; and PBBB′ than variations of P&lt;sub&gt;BCSFB&lt;/sub&gt; and PBCSFB′ within 30 min of the onset of the perturbations. However, P&lt;sub&gt;BCSFB&lt;/sub&gt; is the most sensitive model parameter, followed by P&lt;sub&gt;BBB&lt;/sub&gt; and PBBB′, in controlling brain tissue and subarachnoid CSF sodium levels within 3 h of the perturbation onset.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The voltage-gated Kv7.2/Kv7.3 potassium channel is a critical regulator of neuronal excitability. It is strategically positioned at the axon initial segment (AIS) of neurons, where it effectively inhibits repetitive action potential firing. While the selective accumulation of Kv7.2/Kv7.3 channels at the AIS requires binding to the adaptor protein ankyrin G, it is currently unknown if additional molecular mechanisms contribute to the localization and fine-tuning of channel numbers at the AIS. Here, we utilized a chimeric approach to pinpoint regions within the Kv7.3 C-terminal tail with an impact upon AIS localization. This strategy identified two domains with opposing effects upon the AIS localization of Kv7.3 chimeras expressed in cultured hippocampal neurons. While a membrane proximal domain reduced AIS localization of Kv7.3 chimeras, helix D increased and stabilized chimera AIS localization. None of the identified domains were required for AIS localization. However, the domains modulated the relative efficiency of the localization raising the possibility that the two domains contribute to the regulation of Kv7 channel numbers and nanoscale organization at the AIS.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Objectives&lt;p&gt;This study aimed to explore the relationship between 18 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) within the southern Chinese population.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;A total of 420 participants, consisting of 215 AD patients and 205 sex- and age-matched controls, were recruited. The SNaPshot technique and polymer chain reaction (PCR) were used to detect the 18 SNPs. Combined with the apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele and age at onset, we performed an association analysis between these SNPs and AD susceptibility. Furthermore, we analyzed SNP-associated gene expression using the expression quantitative trait loci analysis.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Our study found that rs17125924 of FERMT2 was associated with the risk of developing AD in the dominant (P = 0.022, odds ratio [OR] = 1.57, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.07–2.32) and overdominant (P = 0.005, OR = 1.76, 95% CI: 1.18–2.61) models. Moreover, compared with APOE ε4 non-carriers, the frequency of the G-allele at rs17125924 was significantly higher among AD patients in APOE ε4 allele carriers (P = 0.029). The rs9271058 of HLA-DRB1 (dominant, overdominant, and additive models), rs9473117 of CD2AP (dominant and additive models), and rs73223431 of PTK2B (dominant, overdominant, and additive models) were associated with early onset AD (EOAD). Using the genotype-tissue expression (GTEx) and Braineac database, we found a significant association between rs9271058 genotypes and HLA-DRB1 expression levels, while the CC genotype at rs9473117 and the TT genotype of rs73223431 increased CD2AP and PTK2B gene expression, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Our study identifies the G-allele at rs17125924 as a risk factor for developing AD, especially in APOE ε4 carriers. In addition, we found that rs9271058 of HLA-DRB1, rs9473117 of CD2AP, and rs73223431 of PTK2B were associated with EOAD. Further studies with larger sample sizes are needed to confirm our results.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;A bidirectional crosstalk between peripheral players of immunity and the central nervous system (CNS) exists. Hence, blood–brain barrier (BBB) breakdown is emerging as a participant mechanism of dysregulated peripheral–CNS interplay, promoting diseases. Here, we examine the implication of BBB damage in neurodegeneration, linking it to peripheral brain-directed autoantibodies and gut–brain axis mechanisms. As BBB breakdown is a factor contributing to, or even anticipating, neuronal dysfunction(s), we here identify contemporary pharmacological strategies that could be exploited to repair the BBB in disease conditions. Developing neurovascular, add on, therapeutic strategies may lead to a more efficacious pre-clinical to clinical transition with the goal of curbing the progression of neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

Interactions between proteins and nucleic acids are at the heart of many essential biological processes. Despite increasing structural information about how these interactions may take place, our understanding of the usage made of protein surfaces by nucleic acids is still very limited. This is in part due to the inherent complexity associated to protein surface deformability and evolution. In this work, we present a method that contributes to decipher such complexity by predicting protein-DNA interfaces and characterizing their properties. It relies on three biologically and physically meaningful descriptors, namely evolutionary conservation, physico-chemical properties and surface geometry. We carefully assessed its performance on several hundreds of protein structures and compared it to several machine-learning state-of-the-art methods. Our approach achieves a higher sensitivity compared to the other methods, with a similar precision. Importantly, we show that it is able to unravel ‘hidden’ binding sites by applying it to unbound protein structures and to proteins binding to DNA via multiple sites and in different conformations. It is also applicable to the detection of RNA-binding sites, without significant loss of performance. This confirms that DNA and RNA-binding sites share similar properties. Our method is implemented as a fully automated tool, JET DNA 2, freely accessible at: http://www.lcqb.upmc.fr/JET2DNA. We also provide a new dataset of 187 protein-DNA complex structures, along with a subset of 82 associated unbound structures. The set represents the largest body of high-resolution crystallographic structures of protein-DNA complexes, use biological protein assemblies as DNA-binding units, and covers all major types of protein-DNA interactions. It is available at: http://www.lcqb.upmc.fr/PDNAbenchmarks.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/JanI5nvfovk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;Skn-1a&lt;/i&gt; transcription factor (&lt;i&gt;Pou2f3&lt;/i&gt;) is required for Type II taste cell differentiation in taste buds. Taste buds in &lt;i&gt;Skn-1a&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice lack Type II taste cells but have a concomitant expansion of Type III cells, providing an ideal model to determine the relative role of taste cell types in response specificity. We confirmed that chorda tympani responses to sweet, bitter, and umami stimuli were greatly reduced in the knock-outs (KOs) compared with wild-type (WT) littermates. &lt;i&gt;Skn-1a&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice also had reductions to NaCl that were partially amiloride-insensitive, suggesting that both Type II and Type III cells contribute to amiloride-insensitive salt detection in anterior tongue. We also confirmed that responses to sour stimuli are equivalent in the KOs, despite the large increase in the number of Type III taste cells. To examine their innervation, we crossed the &lt;i&gt;Htr3a&lt;/i&gt;-GFP (5-HT&lt;sub&gt;3A&lt;/sub&gt;-GFP) reporter mouse with the &lt;i&gt;Skn-1a&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice and examined geniculate ganglion neurons for GFP expression and responses to 5-HT. We found no change in the number of 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;3A&lt;/sub&gt;-expressing neurons with KO of &lt;i&gt;Skn-1a&lt;/i&gt;. Calcium imaging showed that only 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;3A&lt;/sub&gt;-expressing neurons respond to exogenous 5-HT, while most neurons respond to ATP, similar to WT mice. Interestingly, despite loss of all Type II cells, the P2X3 antagonist AF353 blocked all chorda tympani responses. These data collectively raise questions pertaining the source of ATP signaling in the absence of Type II taste cells and whether the additional Type III cells are innervated by fibers that would have normally innervated Type II cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract&lt;p&gt;Developmental cell death eliminates half of the neurons initially generated in the mammalian brain, and occurs perinatally in many species. It is possible that the timing of neuronal cell death is developmentally programmed, and only coincidentally associated with birth. Alternatively, birth may play a role in shaping cell death. To test these competing hypotheses, we experimentally advanced or delayed birth by one day in mice (within the normal range of gestation for the species) and examined effects on the &lt;i&gt;temporal pattern&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;magnitude&lt;/i&gt; (amount) of neuronal cell death, using immunohistochemical detection of activated caspase-3 as a cell death marker. In order to detect effects of subtle changes in birth timing, we focused on brain areas that exhibit sharp postnatal peaks in cell death. We find that advancing birth advances peak cell death, supporting the hypothesis that birth triggers cell death. However, a delay of birth does not delay cell death. Thus, birth can advance cell death, but if postponed, a developmental program governs. Advancing or delaying birth also caused region-specific changes in the overall magnitude of cell death. Our findings shed light on the long-standing question of what controls the timing and magnitude of developmental neuronal cell death, and position birth as an orchestrator of brain development. Because humans across the world now routinely alter birth timing, these findings may have implications for current obstetric practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; The importance of neuronal cell death for brain development has been recognized for decades, but it is unknown what regulates its timing, or accounts for differences in the amount of cell death between brain regions. In many species, including mice, developmental cell death occurs perinatally. We find that advancing birth by one day in mice advances patterns of cell death, but does not advance overall forebrain growth. Because humans across the world routinely alter birth timing, usually to advance birth, our findings may have implications for current obstetric practices. Birth timing also affects the magnitude of cell death in a region-specific manner, suggesting that birth has important, previously unrecognized, effects on brain development.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Hemianopia is characterized by blindness in one half of the visual field and is a common consequence of stroke and unilateral injury to the visual cortex. There are few effective rehabilitative strategies that can relieve it. Using the cat as an animal model of hemianopia, we found that blindness induced by lesions targeting all contiguous areas of the visual cortex could be rapidly reversed by a non-invasive, multisensory (auditory-visual) exposure procedure even while animals were anesthetized. Surprisingly few trials were required to reinstate vision in the previously blind hemisphere. That rehabilitation was possible under anesthesia indicates that the visuomotor behaviors commonly believed to be essential are not required for this recovery, nor are factors such as attention, motivation, reward, or the various other cognitive features that are generally thought to facilitate neuro-rehabilitative therapies.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The mood disorders, major depression (MD) and bipolar disorder (BD), have a high lifetime prevalence in the human population and accordingly generate huge costs for health care. Efficient, rapidly acting, and side-effect-free pharmaceuticals are hitherto not available, and therefore, the identification of new therapeutic targets is an imperative task for (pre)clinical research. Such a target may be the purinergic P2X7 receptor (P2X7R), which is localized in the central nervous system (CNS) at microglial and neuroglial cells mediating neuroinflammation. MD and BD are due to neuroinflammation caused in the first line by the release of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β (IL-1β) from the microglia. IL-1β in turn induces the secretion of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and in consequence the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol, which together with a plethora of further cytokines/chemokines lead to mood disorders. A number of biochemical/molecular biological measurements including the use of P2X7R- or IL-1β-deficient mice confirmed this chain of events. More recent studies showed that a decrease in the astrocytic release of ATP in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus is a major cause of mood disorders. It is an attractive hypothesis that compensatory increases in P2X7Rs in these areas of the brain are the immediate actuators of MD and BD. Hence, blood-brain barrier-permeable P2X7R antagonists may be promising therapeutic tools to improve depressive disorders in humans.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Currently, there is no effective treatment of proteinopathies, as well as their diagnosis in the early stages of the disease until the first clinical symptoms appear. The proposed model of fibrillation of the Aβ peptide and its fragments not only describes molecular rearrangements, but also offers models of processes that occur during the formation of amyloid aggregates. Since this model is also characteristic of other proteins and peptides, a new potential target for drug development in the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other proteinopathies is proposed on the basis of this model. In our opinion, it is oligomers that are promising targets for innovative developments in the treatment of these diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The inducible nitric oxide synthase/nitric oxide (iNOS/NO) signaling pathway and inflammatory cytokines play important roles in the pathogenesis of exercise-induced fatigue. Studies have found that Mongolian warm acupuncture (WA) could alleviate exercise-induced fatigue. However, the exact mechanisms underlying its effects remain unclear. In the present study, we investigated the effects of Mongolian WA on iNOS/NO signaling pathway and proinflammatory cytokines in a chronic exhaustive swimming-induced fatigue rat model. Animals were randomly divided into Control group, Ctrl + WA group, Model group, and Model + WA group. The body weight, exhaustive swimming time test, and Morris water maze test were performed before and after the chronic exhaustive swimming. The serum levels of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interferon-γ (IFN-γ), and iNOS were detected by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The mRNA expressions of IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, IFN-γ, and iNOS in the hippocampus were measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Moreover, the protein expression of iNOS in the hippocampus was measured by western blot, and the NO productions in the serum and hippocampus were detected by Griess reaction system. Chronic exhaustive exercise significantly reduced the body weight and exhaustive swimming time, and induced impairment in learning and memory, and which were reversed by WA treatment. Chronic exhaustive exercise also increased the expressions of iNOS and proinflammatory cytokines, while WA treatment significantly decreased the level of iNOS and proinflammatory cytokines. However, chronic exhaustive exercise did not affect the NO production. These findings demonstrated that WA could alleviate the chronic exhaustive swimming-induced fatigue and improve the learning and memory ability, and the actions might be related to the reduction of inflammatory response and iNOS expression.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 Objective&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have shown that combing with color properties may be used as part of the display presented to BCI users in order to improve performance. Build on this, we explored the effects of combinations of face stimuli with three primary colors (RGB) on BCI performance which is assessed by classification accuracy and information transfer rate (ITR). Furthermore, we analyzed the waveforms of three patterns.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We compared three patterns in which semitransparent face is overlaid three primary colors as stimuli: red semitransparent face (RSF), green semitransparent face (GSF), and blue semitransparent face (BSF). Bayesian linear discriminant analysis (BLDA) was used to construct the individual classifier model. In addition, a Repeated-measures ANOVA (RM-ANOVA) and Bonferroni correction were chosen for statistical analysis.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The results indicated that the RSF pattern achieved the highest online averaged accuracy with 93.89%, followed by the GSF pattern with 87.78%, while the lowest performance was caused by the BSF pattern with an accuracy of 81.39%. Furthermore, significant differences in classification accuracy and ITR were found between RSF and GSF (p &amp;lt; 0.05) and between RSF and BSF patterns (p &amp;lt; 0.05).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The semitransparent faces colored red (RSF) pattern yielded the best performance of the three patterns. The proposed patterns based on ERP-BCI system have a clinically significant impact by increasing communication speed and accuracy of the P300-speller for patients with severe motor impairment.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The underlying genetic and molecular mechanisms that drive amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) remain poorly understood. Structural variants within the genome can play a significant role in neurodegenerative disease risk, such as the repeat expansion in C9orf72 and the tri-nucleotide repeat in ATXN2, both of which are associated with familial and sporadic ALS. Many such structural variants reside in uncharacterized regions of the human genome, and have been under studied. Therefore, characterization of structural variants located in and around genes associated with ALS could provide insight into disease pathogenesis, and lead to the discovery of highly informative genetic tools for stratification in clinical trials. Such genomic variants may provide a deeper understanding of how gene expression can affect disease etiology, disease severity and trajectory, patient response to treatment, and may hold the key to understanding the genetics of sporadic ALS. This article outlines the current understanding of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis genetics and how structural variations may underpin some of the missing heritability of this disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Objectives&lt;p&gt;Visuospatial dysfunction (VSD) is one of the most important symptoms for the diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). The aim of this study was to validate a novel VSD questionnaire and determine the cutoff score for the screening for VSD in DLB.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;This is a retrospective analysis of data from a project of the History-based Artificial Intelligent Clinical Dementia Diagnostic System (HAICDDS). VSD of non-demented control (NDC), Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and DLB participants were analyzed and compared using the visuospatial questionnaire in the HAICDDS (HAI-VSQ), the Draw subscale in the Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument (CASI-Draw), and the visuospatial subscale in Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA-VS).&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;A total of 440 individuals were studied, including 154 NDC, 229 AD, and 57 DLB participants. Compared to NDC or AD participants, DLB participants showed a higher total score on HAI-VSQ after adjustment for age. Using HAI-VSQ, a cutoff score ≥ 2 was useful for the screening for VSD in DLB with a sensitivity of 0.77 and a specificity of 0.94. Compared with CASI-Draw or MoCA-VS, HAI-VSQ was least influenced by gender, age, and education and had the highest correlation with the sum of boxes of the Clinical Dementia Rating scale. After adjustment for age, education, gender, and global cognitive function, HAI-VSQ significantly discriminated DLB from AD and NDC whereas MoCA-VS or CASI-Draw did not.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Our study showed that the newly designed simple questionnaire was a practical screening tool for VSD in DLB that can be applied in clinical practice as well as on a registration platform.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Introduction&lt;p&gt;Cognitive symptoms from Parkinson’s disease cause severe disability and significantly limit quality of life. Little is known about mechanisms of cognitive impairment in PD, although aberrant oscillatory activity in basal ganglia-thalamo-prefrontal cortical circuits likely plays an important role. While continuous high-frequency deep brain stimulation (DBS) improves motor symptoms, it is generally ineffective for cognitive symptoms. Although we lack robust treatment options for these symptoms, recent studies with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), applying intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) to dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), suggest beneficial effects for certain aspects of cognition, such as memory or inhibitory control. While TMS is non-invasive, its results are transient and require repeated application. Subcortical DBS targets have strong reciprocal connections with prefrontal cortex, such that iTBS through the permanently implanted lead might represent a more durable solution. Here we demonstrate safety and feasibility for delivering iTBS from the DBS electrode and explore changes in DLPFC electrophysiology.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We enrolled seven participants with medically refractory Parkinson’s disease who underwent DBS surgery targeting either the subthalamic nucleus (STN) or globus pallidus interna (GPi). We temporarily placed an electrocorticography strip over DLPFC through the DBS burr hole. After placement of the DBS electrode into either GPi (n = 3) or STN (n = 4), awake subjects rested quietly during iTBS (three 50-Hz pulses delivered at 5 Hz for 2 s, followed by 8 s of rest). We contrasted power spectra in DLPFC local field potentials during iTBS versus at rest, as well as between iTBS and conventional high-frequency stimulation (HFS).&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Dominant frequencies in DLPFC at rest varied among subjects and along the subdural strip electrode, though they were generally localized in theta (3–8 Hz) and/or beta (10–30 Hz) ranges. Both iTBS and HFS were well-tolerated and imperceptible. iTBS increased theta-frequency activity more than HFS. Further, GPi stimulation resulted in significantly greater theta-power versus STN stimulation in our sample.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Acute subcortical iTBS from the DBS electrode was safe and well-tolerated. This novel stimulation pattern delivered from the GPi may increase theta-frequency power in ipsilateral DLPFC. Future studies will confirm these changes in DLPFC activity during iTBS and evaluate whether they are associated with improvements in cognitive or behavioral symptoms from PD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The hemodynamic response is a neurovascular and metabolic process in which there is rapid delivery of blood flow to a neuronal tissue in response to neuronal activation. The functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and the functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), for instance, are based on the physiological principles of such hemodynamic responses. Both techniques allow the mapping of active neuronal regions in which the neurovascular and metabolic events are occurring. However, although both techniques have revolutionized the neurosciences, they are mostly employed for neuroimaging of the human brain but not for the spinal cord during functional tasks. Moreover, little is known about other techniques measuring the hemodynamic response in the spinal cord. The purpose of the present study was to show for the first time that a simple optical system termed direct current photoplethysmography (DC-PPG) can be employed to detect hemodynamic responses of the spinal cord and the brainstem during the functional activation of the spinal central pattern generator (CPG). In particular, we positioned two DC-PPG systems directly on the brainstem and spinal cord during fictive scratching in the cat. The optical DC-PPG systems allowed the trial-by-trial recording of massive hemodynamic signals. We found that the “strength” of the flexor-plus-extensor motoneuron activities during motor episodes of fictive scratching was significantly correlated to the “strengths” of the brainstem and spinal DC-PPG signals. Because the DC-PPG was robustly detected in real-time, we claim that such a functional signal reflects the hemodynamic mass action of the brainstem and spinal cord associated with the CPG motor action. Our findings shed light on an unexplored hemodynamic observable of the spinal CPGs, providing a proof of concept that the DC-PPG can be used for the assessment of the integrity of the human CPGs.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) has been generally assessed with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) thanks to its high spatial resolution. However, fMRI has several disadvantages such as high cost and low portability. In addition, fMRI may not be appropriate for people with metal or electronic implants in their bodies, with claustrophobia and who are pregnant. Diffuse optical tomography (DOT), a method of neuroimaging using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to reconstruct three-dimensional brain activity images, offers a non-invasive alternative, because fNIRS as well as fMRI measures changes in deoxygenated hemoglobin concentrations and, in addition, fNIRS is free of above disadvantages. We recently proposed a hierarchical Bayesian (HB) DOT algorithm and verified its performance in terms of task-related brain responses. In this study, we attempted to evaluate the HB DOT in terms of estimating RSFC. In 20 healthy males (21–38 years old), 10 min of resting-state data was acquired with 3T MRI scanner or high-density NIRS on different days. The NIRS channels consisted of 96 long (29-mm) source-detector (SD) channels and 56 short (13-mm) SD channels, which covered bilateral frontal and parietal areas. There were one and two resting-state runs in the fMRI and fNIRS experiments, respectively. The reconstruction performances of our algorithm and the two currently prevailing algorithms for DOT were evaluated using fMRI signals as a reference. Compared with the currently prevailing algorithms, our HB algorithm showed better performances in both the similarity to fMRI data and inter-run reproducibility, in terms of estimating the RSFC.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Object&lt;p&gt;Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is common in Parkinson disease (PD), but the neural basis of EDS in PD is unclear. We aim to analyze the neural activity changes in PD-related EDS.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;In the present study, 38 PD patients and 19 healthy controls underwent clinical assessments and resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 3T. Patients were further classified into PD patients with EDS (n = 17) and PD patients without EDS (n = 21), according to the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) cutoff score with greater than 10 or less than 3. We evaluated all patients using PD-related motor and non-motor clinical scales. An analysis of covariance and post hoc two-sample t-tests were performed to examine between-groups differences of the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) and functional connectivity (FC).&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;We found that, all PD-EDS subjects in our study were male. Compared with the control subjects, PD patients with EDS had decreased ALFF in the Pons and increased ALFF in the Frontal_Mid_Orb_L (p &amp;lt; 0.01, corrected). Moreover, PD patients with EDS showed decreased ALFF in the left posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) relative to PD without EDS, which was negatively correlated with the ESS score (p &amp;lt; 0.001). After that, the FC analysis with the left PCC region of interest showed reduced FC of the right PCC and right precuneus in PD with EDS compared with PD without EDS (p &amp;lt; 0.01, corrected).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;We hypothesized the wake-promoting pathways and the default mode network dysfunction underlying the EDS in male PD patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Measures of brain activity through functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) or electroencephalography (EEG), two complementary modalities, are ground solutions in the context of neurofeedback (NF) mechanisms for brain rehabilitation protocols. While NF-EEG (in which real-time neurofeedback scores are computed from EEG signals) has been explored for a very long time, NF-fMRI (in which real-time neurofeedback scores are computed from fMRI signals) appeared more recently and provides more robust results and more specific brain training. Using fMRI and EEG simultaneously for bi-modal neurofeedback sessions (NF-EEG-fMRI, in which real-time neurofeedback scores are computed from fMRI and EEG) is very promising for the design of brain rehabilitation protocols. However, fMRI is cumbersome and more exhausting for patients. The original contribution of this paper concerns the prediction of bi-modal NF scores from EEG recordings only, using a training phase where EEG signals as well as the NF-EEG and NF-fMRI scores are available. We propose a sparse regression model able to exploit EEG only to predict NF-fMRI or NF-EEG-fMRI in motor imagery tasks. We compared different NF-predictors stemming from the proposed model. We showed that predicting NF-fMRI scores from EEG signals adds information to NF-EEG scores and significantly improves the correlation with bi-modal NF sessions compared to classical NF-EEG scores.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Inflammation is a complex biological response to injuries, metabolic disorders or infections. In the brain, astrocytes play an important role in the inflammatory processes during neurodegenerative diseases. Recent studies have shown that the increase of free saturated fatty acids such as palmitic acid produces a metabolic inflammatory response in astrocytes generally associated with damaging mechanisms such as oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and autophagic defects. In this aspect, the synthetic neurosteroid tibolone has shown to exert protective functions against inflammation in neuronal experimental models without the tumorigenic effects exerted by sexual hormones such as estradiol and progesterone. However, there is little information regarding the specific mechanisms of tibolone in astrocytes during inflammatory insults. In the present study, we performed a genome-scale metabolic reconstruction of astrocytes that was used to study astrocytic response during an inflammatory insult by palmitate through Flux Balance Analysis methods and data mining. In this aspect, we assessed the metabolic fluxes of human astrocytes under three different scenarios: healthy (normal conditions), induced inflammation by palmitate, and tibolone treatment under palmitate inflammation. Our results suggest that tibolone reduces the L-glutamate-mediated neurotoxicity in astrocytes through the modulation of several metabolic pathways involved in glutamate uptake. We also identified a set of reactions associated with the protective effects of tibolone, including the upregulation of taurine metabolism, gluconeogenesis, cPPAR and the modulation of calcium signaling pathways. In conclusion, the different scenarios studied in our model allowed us to identify several metabolic fluxes perturbed under an inflammatory response and the protective mechanisms exerted by tibolone.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Spinocerebellar ataxia type 14 (SCA14) is an autosomal neurodegenerative disease clinically characterized by progressive ataxia in the patient’s gait, accompanied by slurred speech and abnormal eye movements. These symptoms are linked to the loss of Purkinje cells (PCs), which leads to cerebellar neurodegeneration. PC observations link the mutations in PRKCG gene encoding protein kinase C γ (PKCγ) to SCA14. Observations also show that the link between PKCγ and SCA14 relies on a gain-of-function mechanism, and, in fact, both positive and negative regulation of PKCγ expression and activity may result in changes in cellular number, size, and complexity of the dendritic arbors in PCs. Here, through a systems biology approach, we investigate a key question relating to this system: why is PKCγ membrane residence time reduced in SCA14 mutant PCs compared to wild-type (WT) PCs? In this study, we investigate this question through two contrasting PKCγ signaling models in PCs. The first model proposed in this study describes the mechanism through which PKCγ signaling activity may be regulated in WT PCs. In contrast, the second model explores how mutations in PKCγ signaling affect the state of SCA14 in PCs. Numerical simulations of both models show that, in response to extracellular stimuli-induced depolarization of the membrane compartment, PKCγ and diacylglycerol kinase γ (DGKγ) translocate to the membrane. Results from our computational approach indicate that, for the same set of parameters, PKCγ membrane residence time is shorter in the SCA14 mutant model compared to the WT model. These results show how PKCγ membrane residence time is regulated by diacylglycerol (DAG), causing translocated PKCγ to return to the cytosol as DAG levels drop. This study shows that, when the strength of the extracellular signal is held constant, the membrane lifetime of mutant PKCγ is reduced. This reduction is due to the presence of constitutively active mutant PKCγ in the cytosol. Cytosolic PKCγ, in turn, leads to phosphorylation and activation of DGKγ while it is still residing in the cytosol. This effect occurs even during the resting conditions. Thus, the SCA14 mutant model explains that, when both DAG effector molecules are active in the cytosol, their interactions in the membrane compartment are reduced, critically influencing PKCγ membrane residence time.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Connectivity between brain regions has been redefined beyond a stationary state. Even when a person is in a resting state, brain connectivity dynamically shifts. However, shifted brain connectivity under externally evoked stimulus is still little understood. The current study, therefore, focuses on task-based dynamic functional-connectivity (FC) analysis of brain signals measured by functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). We hypothesize that a stimulus may influence not only brain connectivity but also the occurrence probabilities of task-related and task-irrelevant connectivity states. fNIRS measurement (of the prefrontal-to-inferior parietal lobes) was conducted on 21 typically developing (TD) and 21 age-matched attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) children performing an inhibitory control task, namely, the Go/No-Go (GNG) task. It has been reported that ADHD children lack inhibitory control; differences between TD and ADHD children in terms of task-based dynamic FC were also evaluated. Four connectivity states were found to occur during the temporal task course. Two dominant connectivity states (states 1 and 2) are characterized by strong connectivities within the frontoparietal network (occurrence probabilities of 40%–56% and 26%–29%), and presumptively interpreted as task-related states. A connectivity state (state 3) shows strong connectivities in the bilateral medial frontal-to-parietal cortices (occurrence probability of 7–15%). The strong connectivities were found at the overlapped regions related the default mode network (DMN). Another connectivity state (state 4) visualizes strong connectivities in all measured regions (occurrence probability of 10%–16%). A global effect coming from cerebral vascular may highly influence this connectivity state. During the GNG stimulus interval, the ADHD children tended to show decreased occurrence probability of the dominant connectivity state and increased occurrence probability of other connectivity states (states 3 and 4). Bringing a new perspective to explain neuropathophysiology, these findings suggest atypical dynamic network recruitment to accommodate task demands in ADHD children.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Regulatory T cells (Tregs) play an anti-inflammatory effect to protect against ischemic stroke. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) can induce regulatory T cells tolerance in sterile-inflammation conditions. However, whether and how pDCs-mediated Tregs response play a part in the pathology of ischemic stroke remains unclear. In this study, we showed that pDCs were increased in the brain of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) mice. Depletion of pDCs with 120G8 exacerbated MCAO-induced brain injury, peripheral pro-inflammation response and decreased the systemic Tregs in mice. Furthermore, the data of mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) in vitro demonstrate that splenic pDCs from MCAO mice can significantly promote Tregs proliferation, accompanying with the increased expression of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) on pDCs. Taken together, the findings here suggested that under the pathologic state of stroke, pDCs protect against MCAO-induced brain injury by priming Tregs, illustrating that pDCs represented as a therapeutic target for the prevention of ischemic brain injury.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Objective: To investigate whether the number of cerebral microbleeds (CMB) could be a useful indicator to predict glymphatic system dysfunction in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients, by comparing the degree of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) and interstitial fluid (ISF) stasis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Forty probable AD patients were included, with those exhibiting two or more CMB were included in the multiple CMB group (mCMB, n = 21, mean = 11.1), and none or one CMB included in the non-multiple CMB group (nmCMB, n = 19, mean = 0.84). CMB was defined in axial gradient recalled echo (GRE) T2*-weighted images. Evans index (EI) was calculated to measure lateral ventricle enlargement, Voxel-based Specific Regional Analysis System for Alzheimer’s Disease (VSRAD) software was used to determine the extent of gray and white matter atrophy, and Fazekas scale (FS) was used to determine white matter hyperintensities (WMH).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: EI was significantly larger in mCMB than in nmCMB, while the gray and white matter volume was not different between groups. Thus, the difference in lateral ventricle enlargement between AD with and without multiple CMB reflects a combination of the degree of brain atrophy and the extent of CSF stasis. FS was higher in mCMB than in the nmCMB, suggesting the failure of ISF elimination was more severe in mCMB cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: The difference in lateral ventricle enlargement and WMH between AD with or without multiple CMB may reflect a difference in the degree of CSF/ISF stagnation.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The hippocampus features structurally and functionally distinct anterior and posterior segments. Relatively few studies have examined how these change during aging or in response to pharmacological interventions. Alterations in hippocampal connectivity and changes in glucose regulation have each been associated with cognitive decline in aging. A distinct line of research suggests that administration of glucose can lead to a transient improvement in hippocampus-dependent memory. Here, we probe age, glucose and human cognition with a special emphasis on resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) of the hippocampus along its longitudinal axis to the rest of the brain. Using a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover design 32 healthy adults (16 young and 16 older) ingested a drink containing 25 g glucose or placebo across two counter balanced sessions. They then underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and cognitive testing. There was a clear dissociation in the effects of glucose by age. Magnitude change in rsFC from posterior hippocampus (pHPC) to medial frontal cortex (mPFC) was correlated with individual glucose regulation and gains in performance on a spatial navigation task. Our results demonstrate that glucose administration can attenuate cognitive performance deficits in older adults with impaired glucose regulation and suggest that increases in pHPC-mPFC rsFC are beneficial for navigation task performance in older participants.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second-leading cause of dementia and is characterized by a progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra alongside the presence of intraneuronal α-synuclein-positive inclusions. Therapies to date have been directed to the restoration of the dopaminergic system, and the prevention of dopaminergic neuronal cell death in the midbrain. This review discusses the physiological mechanisms involved in PD as well as new and prospective therapies for the disease. The current data suggest that prevention or early treatment of PD may be the most effective therapeutic strategy. New advances in the understanding of the underlying mechanisms of PD predict the development of more personalized and integral therapies in the years to come. Thus, the development of more reliable biomarkers at asymptomatic stages of the disease, and the use of genetic profiling of patients will surely permit a more effective treatment of PD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;We examined functional connectivity between the locus coeruleus (LC) and the salience network in healthy young and older adults to investigate why people become more prone to distraction with age. Recent findings suggest that the LC plays an important role in focusing processing on salient or goal-relevant information from multiple incoming sensory inputs (Mather et al., 2016). We hypothesized that the connection between LC and the salience network declines in older adults, and therefore the salience network fails to appropriately filter out irrelevant sensory signals. To examine this possibility, we used resting-state-like fMRI data, in which all task-related activities were regressed out (Fair et al., 2007; Elliott et al., 2019) and performed a functional connectivity analysis based on the time-course of LC activity. Older adults showed reduced functional connectivity between the LC and salience network compared with younger adults. Additionally, the salience network was relatively more coupled with the frontoparietal network than the default-mode network in older adults compared with younger adults, even though all task-related activities were regressed out. Together, these findings suggest that reduced interactions between LC and the salience network impairs the ability to prioritize the importance of incoming events, and in turn, the salience network fails to initiate network switching (e.g., Menon and Uddin, 2010; Uddin, 2015) that would promote further attentional processing. A chronic lack of functional connection between LC and salience network may limit older adults’ attentional and executive control resources.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

This study was conducted to clarify the effects of denture use on prefrontal and chewing muscle activities, occlusal state, and subjective chewing ability in partially edentulous elderly individuals.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;A total of 16 partially edentulous patients were enrolled. Chewing-related prefrontal cortex and jaw muscle activities were simultaneously examined using a functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) device and electromyography, under the conditions of unwearing, and wearing a denture. Occlusal state and masticatory score were also determined under both conditions. Using multiple linear regression analysis, associations between prefrontal and chewing activities with wearing were examined using change rates.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Chewing rhythmicity was maintained under both conditions. As compared with unwearing, the wearing condition was associated with improved prefrontal cortex and chewing muscle activities, occlusal state in regard to force and area, and masticatory score. Also, prefrontal activities were positively associated with burst duration and peak amplitude in masseter (Mm) and temporal muscle activities, as well as masticatory scores. In contrast, prefrontal activities were negatively associated with occlusal force.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Wearing a denture induced a positive association between burst duration and peak amplitude in Mm and temporal muscle activities and prefrontal activity, which may indicate a parallel consolidation of prefrontal cortex and rhythmical chewing activities, as well as masticatory scores. On the other hand, denture use induced a negative association of occlusal force with prefrontal activities, which might suggest that prefrontal compensative associations for the physiocognitive acquisition depended on biomechanical efficacy gained by wearing a denture.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Introduction&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative dementia with the key pathological hallmarks amyloid-beta deposition and neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated tau. microRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that contribute to the pathogenesis of AD. In this study, we investigated the effect of the loss of miR-369 on the phosphorylation of tau protein and the activation of the kinases Fyn and serine/threonine-protein kinase 2 (SRPK2) as the upstream molecules facilitating tau phosphorylation in miR-369 knockout 3xTg-AD mice.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We generated miR-369 knockout 3xTg-AD mice and investigated their cognitive behaviors by maze tests. Real-time qPCR, western blot, and immunohistochemistry were performed to evaluate the expression of the miR-369 gene, phosphorylation of tau protein, and activation of Fyn and SRPK2. Luciferase reporter assays were applied to confirm the predicted targets of miR-369.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Knocking out miR-369 in 3xTg AD mice aggravated cognitive impairment, promoted hyperphosphorylation of tau, and upregulated Fyn and SRPK2. Restoring miR-369 reversed the hyperphosphorylation of tau and downregulated Fyn and SRPK2. Additionally, miR-369 was shown to target the 3′UTRs of Fyn and SRPK2 to regulate their expression levels.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Loss of miR-369 promotes tau phosphorylation by targeting the Fyn and SRPK2 signaling pathways in AD mice, and supplementation with miR-369 might be a valuable option for AD therapeutic studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aging is a major risk factor for numerous neurological disorders, and the mechanisms underlying brain aging remain elusive. Recent animal studies demonstrated a tight relationship between impairment of the glymphatic pathway, meningeal lymphatic vessels, and aging. However, the relationship in the human brain remains uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this observational cohort study, patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging before and at multiple time points after intrathecal administration of a contrast agent. Head T1‐weighted imaging was performed to assess the function of the glymphatic pathway and head high‐resolution T2–fluid attenuated inversion recovery imaging to visualize putative meningeal lymphatic vessels (pMLVs). We measured the signal unit ratio (SUR) of 6 locations in the glymphatic pathway and pMLVs, defined the percentage change in SUR from baseline to 39 hours as the clearance of the glymphatic pathway and pMLVs, and then analyzed their relationships with aging.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all patients (N = 35), the SUR of the glymphatic pathway and pMLVs changed significantly after intrathecal injection of the contrast agent. The clearance of both the glymphatic pathway and pMLVs was related to aging (all &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). The clearance of pMLVs was significantly related to the clearance of the glymphatic pathway (all &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05), and the clearance of the glymphatic pathway was significantly faster in patients with early filling of pMLVs than those with late filling (all &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We revealed that both the glymphatic pathway and pMLVs might be impaired in the aging human brain through the novel, clinically available method to simultaneously visualize their clearance. Our findings also support that in humans, pMLVs are the downstream of the glymphatic pathway. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Background: An imbalance between total training load and total recovery may cause overtraining (OT). The purpose of the present study was to verify the effects of OT on the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), its receptor tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) and p75 and the dynamic expression patterns of brain-specific miR-34a and miR-124 or inflammation-related miR-21 and miR-132 in the mouse hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Method: Eight weeks old C57BL/6J mice were randomly assigned to the control (CON), normal training (NT) and OT groups. An 8-week OT training protocol was applied to evaluate the phenotype of mice endurance (incremental load test, ILT) and cognitive capacity (Morris water maze test). We used qRT-PCR and immunoblotting to detect changes in the molecular level of hippocampal samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Result: Compared with the CON, both NT and OT decreased bodyweight after 8-week training. After 8-week of training, NT increased the exhaustion velocity (EV) while the EV of OT was lower than NT. Mice in NT decreased the escape latency than CON. The percentage of time spent in the probe quadrant and the number of crossing platform times in NT were higher than CON and OT. The BDNF, p75 and TrkB mRNA levels were increased in NT than CON, only the p75 mRNA was increased in OT. The NT exhibited increased protein levels of BDNF and TrkB compared to CON. The protein expression of BDNF was decreased in OT than NT and CON. The protein level of p75 in the OT was higher than in NT and CON. In addition, the phosphorylation level of TrkB in OT was higher than CON and NT. Only the miR-34a level was increased in the OT. Moreover, the expression of miR-34a was found to be negatively correlated with the expression of BDNF, and the increase in miR-34a level was accompanied by a decrease in performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: In summary, the training-evoked increase in the BDNF level may help to improve performance, whereas this conditioning is lost after OT. Moreover, miR-34a potentially mediated changes in the expression of BDNF and may reflect the decrease in performance after OT.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Background: Amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) has a high conversion risk to Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The aMCI patients may have only a memory deficit (single-domain-aMCI, sd-aMCI) or deficits in multiple cognitive domains (multiple-domain-aMCI, md-aMCI). However, differences in intrinsic brain activity between these two sub-types remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Method: Neuropsychological and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were acquired from 24 patients with sd-aMCI, 23 patients with md-aMCI, and 32 healthy controls (HCs). We used the fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF) to characterize the intensity of spontaneous brain activity. The analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) and post hoc tests was performed to determine the between-group differences in fALFF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: We found higher fALFF in left-sided superior-to-middle frontal gyri and middle-to-inferior temporal gyri in sd-aMCI compared to both the md-aMCI and HCs. Conversely, a lower fALFF was found in the left inferior parietal lobe in both the md-aMCI and sd-aMCI patients. The fALFF values in the left middle and inferior temporal gyri were correlated with cognitive performances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: The gradual reduction in the left inferior parietal lobe from single to multiple domain aMCI suggest a functional inefficiency underlying cognitive impairment, while increased activity in the frontal and temporal gyri in sd-aMCI rather than md-aMCI might indicate functional compensation. This study indicates differential functional profiles in the sd-aMCI and md-aMCI, which may be helpful for the prediction of the future conversion of aMCI to AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The neural circuits responsible for social communication are among the least understood in the brain. Human studies have made great progress in advancing our understanding of the global computations required for processing speech, and animal models offer the opportunity to discover evolutionarily conserved mechanisms for decoding these signals. In this review article, we describe some of the most well-established speech decoding computations from human studies and describe animal research designed to reveal potential circuit mechanisms underlying these processes. Human and animal brains must perform the challenging tasks of rapidly recognizing, categorizing, and assigning communicative importance to sounds in a noisy environment. The instructions to these functions are found in the precise connections neurons make with one another. Therefore, identifying circuit-motifs in the auditory cortices and linking them to communicative functions is pivotal. We review recent advances in human recordings that have revealed the most basic unit of speech decoded by neurons is a phoneme, and consider circuit-mapping studies in rodents that have shown potential connectivity schemes to achieve this. Finally, we discuss other potentially important processing features in humans like lateralization, sensitivity to fine temporal features, and hierarchical processing. The goal is for animal studies to investigate neurophysiological and anatomical pathways responsible for establishing behavioral phenotypes that are shared between humans and animals. This can be accomplished by establishing cell types, connectivity patterns, genetic pathways and critical periods that are relevant in the development and function of social communication.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Objective: Brain atrophy is an established biomarker for dementia, yet spinal cord involvement has not been investigated to date. As the spinal cord is relaying sensorimotor control signals from the cortex to the peripheral nervous system and vice-versa, it is indeed a very interesting question to assess whether it is affected by atrophy due to a disease that is known for its involvement of cognitive domains first and foremost, with motor symptoms being clinically assessed too. We, therefore, hypothesize that in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), severe atrophy can affect the spinal cord too and that spinal cord atrophy is indeed an important in vivo imaging biomarker contributing to understanding neurodegeneration associated with dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: 3DT1 images of 31 AD and 35 healthy control (HC) subjects were processed to calculate volume of brain structures and cross-sectional area (CSA) and volume (CSV) of the cervical cord [per vertebra as well as the C2-C3 pair (CSA23 and CSV23)]. Correlated features (ρ &amp;gt; 0.7) were removed, and the best subset identified for patients’ classification with the Random Forest algorithm. General linear model regression was used to find significant differences between groups (p ≤ 0.05). Linear regression was implemented to assess the explained variance of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score as a dependent variable with the best features as predictors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Spinal cord features were significantly reduced in AD, independently of brain volumes. Patients classification reached 76% accuracy when including CSA23 together with volumes of hippocampi, left amygdala, white and gray matter, with 74% sensitivity and 78% specificity. CSA23 alone explained 13% of MMSE variance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion: Our findings reveal that C2-C3 spinal cord atrophy contributes to discriminate AD from HC, together with more established features. The results show that CSA23, calculated from the same 3DT1 scan as all other brain volumes (including right and left hippocampi), has a considerable weight in classification tasks warranting further investigations. Together with recent studies revealing that AD atrophy is spread beyond the temporal lobes, our result adds the spinal cord to a number of unsuspected regions involved in the disease. Interestingly, spinal cord atrophy explains also cognitive scores, which could significantly impact how we model sensorimotor control in degenerative diseases with a primary cognitive domain involvement. Prospective studies should be purposely designed to understand the mechanisms of atrophy and the role of the spinal cord in AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Neonatal hypoxic–ischemic (HI) brain injury is a detrimental disease, which results in high mortality and long-term neurological deficits. Nevertheless, the treatment options for this disease are limited. Thus, the aim of the present study was to assess the role of liraglutide in neonatal HI brain injury in rats and investigate the associated mechanisms. The results showed that treatment with liraglutide significantly reduced infarct volume and ameliorated cerebral edema, decreased inflammatory response, promoted the recovery of tissue structure, and improved prognosis following HI brain injury. Moreover, treatment with liraglutide inhibited apoptosis and promoted neuronal survival both in the rat model and following oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) insult. LY294002, an inhibitor of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), partially reversed these therapeutic effects, suggesting that the PI3K/protein kinase B (Akt) pathway was involved. In conclusion, our data revealed that treatment with liraglutide exerts neuroprotection after neonatal HI brain injury via the PI3K/Akt/glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β) pathway and may be a promising therapy for this disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Objective: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is an important risk state for dementia, particularly Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Depression, anxiety, and apathy are commonly observed neuropsychiatric features in MCI, which have been linked to cognitive and functional decline in daily activities, as well as disease progression. Accordingly, the study’s objective is to review the prevalence, neuropsychological characteristics, and conversion rates to dementia between MCI patients with and without depression, anxiety, and apathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: A PubMed search and critical review were performed relating to studies of MCI, depression, anxiety, and apathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: MCI patients have a high prevalence of depression/anxiety/apathy; furthermore, patients with MCI and concomitant depression/anxiety/apathy have more pronounced cognitive deficits and progress more often to dementia than MCI patients without depression/anxiety/apathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions and Implications: Depression, anxiety, and apathy are common in MCI and represent possible risk factors for cognitive decline and progression to dementia. Further studies are needed to better understand the role and neurobiology of depression, anxiety, and apathy in MCI.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Objective: To assess the association between low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) and risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Embase, Pubmed, and Web of Science were searched until June 2019. Standard mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) was estimated using random-effects models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Our meta-analysis of 26 studies revealed higher levels of LDL-c in AD than that of non-dementia controls (SMD = 0.35, 95% CI 0.12–0.58, p &amp;lt; 0.01). The meta-regression analysis on confounders showed that age (p &amp;lt; 0.01, Adj R-squared = 92.41%) and cardiovascular disease (p = 0.01, Adj R-squared = 85.21%), but not the body mass index, education, smoking, hypertension and diabetes mellitus, exerted an impact on the relationship between LDL-c and risk of ICH. Further subgroup analysis of age showed LDL-c levels in AD patients aged 60–70 were higher than that of non-dementia (60 ≤ age &amp;lt; 70: SMD = 0.80, 95% CI 0.23–1.37, p &amp;lt; 0.01); but no association between the SMD of AD in LDL-c and age over 70 was noted across the studies (70 ≤ age &amp;lt; 77: SMD = −0.02, 95% CI −0.39~0.34, p = 9.0; 77 ≤ age &amp;lt; 80: SMD = 0.15, 95% CI −0.17~0.47, p = 0.35; ≥80: SMD = 0.53, 95% CI −0.04~1.11, p = 0.07). The concentrations of LDL-c during the quintile interval of 3~4 were positively associated with AD (121 ≤ concentration &amp;lt; 137: SMD = 0.98, 95% CI 0.13~1.82, p = 0.02; ≥137: SMD = 0.62, 95% CI 0.18~1.06, p &amp;lt; 0.01); whereas there was no correlation between AD and LDL-c within the quintile interval of 1~2 (103.9 ≤ concentration &amp;lt; 112: SMD = 0.08, 95% CI −0.20~0.35, p = 0.59; 112 ≤ concentration &amp;lt; 121: SMD = −0.26, 95% CI −0.58~0.06, p = 0.11).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Elevated concentration of LDL-c (&amp;gt;121 mg/dl) may be a potential risk factor for AD. This association is strong in patients aged 60–70 years, but vanishes with advancing age.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evidence for a role of microglia in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS) is growing. We investigated association of microglial markers at time of diagnostic lumbar puncture (LP) with different aspects of disease activity (relapses, disability, magnetic resonance imaging parameters) up to 6 years later in a cohort of 143 patients.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), we measured 3 macrophage and microglia‐related proteins, chitotriosidase (CHIT1), chitinase‐3–like protein 1 (CHI3L1 or YKL‐40), and soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (sTREM2), as well as a marker of neuronal damage, neurofilament light chain (NfL), using enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay and electrochemiluminescence. We investigated the same microglia‐related markers in publicly available RNA expression data from postmortem brain tissue.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CHIT1 levels at diagnostic LP correlated with 2 aspects of long‐term disease activity after correction for multiple testing. First, CHIT1 increased with reduced tissue integrity in lesions at a median 3 years later (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 9.6E‐04). Second, CHIT1 reflected disease severity at a median 5 years later (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 1.2E‐04). Together with known clinical covariates, CHIT1 levels explained 12% and 27% of variance in these 2 measures, respectively, and were able to distinguish slow and fast disability progression (area under the curve = 85%). CHIT1 was the best discriminator of chronic active versus chronic inactive lesions and the only marker correlated with NfL (&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; = 0.3, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0019). Associations with disease activity were, however, independent of NfL.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CHIT1 CSF levels measured during the diagnostic LP reflect microglial activation early on in MS and can be considered a valuable prognostic biomarker for future disease activity. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Survivors of prolonged (&amp;gt;2 weeks) post–cardiac arrest (CA) coma are expected to remain permanently disabled. We aimed to investigate 3 outlier patients who ultimately achieved independent functional outcomes after prolonged post‐CA coma to identify electroencephalographic (EEG) markers of their recovery potential. For validation purposes, we also aimed to evaluate these markers in an independent cohort of post‐CA patients.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified 3 patients with late recovery from coma (17–37 days) following CA who recovered to functionally independent behavioral levels. We performed spectral power analyses of available EEGs during prominent burst suppression patterns (BSP) present in all 3 patients. Using identical methods, we also assessed the relationship of intraburst spectral power and outcomes in a prospectively enrolled cohort of post‐CA patients. We performed chart reviews of common clinical, imaging, and EEG prognostic variables and clinical outcomes for all patients.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All 3 patients with late recovery from coma lacked evidence of overwhelming cortical injury but demonstrated prominent BSP on EEG. Spectral analyses revealed a prominent theta (~4–7Hz) feature dominating the bursts during BSP in these patients. In the prospective cohort, similar intraburst theta spectral features were evident in patients with favorable outcomes; patients with BSP and unfavorable outcomes showed either no features, transient burst features, or decreasing intraburst frequencies with time.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BSP with theta (~4–7Hz) peak intraburst spectral power after CA may index a recovery potential. We discuss our results in the context of optimizing metabolic substrate availability and stimulating the corticothalamic system during recovery from prolonged post‐CA coma.

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GM2 gangliosidoses are lysosomal diseases due to biallelic mutations in the &lt;i&gt;HEXA&lt;/i&gt; (Tay–Sachs disease [TS]) or &lt;i&gt;HEXB&lt;/i&gt; (Sandhoff disease [SD]) genes, with subsequent low hexosaminidase(s) activity. Most patients have childhood onset, but some experience the first symptoms during adolescence/adulthood. This study aims to clarify the natural history of adult patients with GM2 gangliosidosis.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We retrospectively described 12 patients from a French cohort and 45 patients from the literature.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We observed 4 typical presentations: (1) lower motoneuron disorder responsible for proximal lower limb weakness that subsequently expanded to the upper limbs, (2) cerebellar ataxia, (3) psychosis and/or severe mood disorder (only in the TS patients), and (4) a complex phenotype mixing the above 3 manifestations. The psoas was the first and most affected muscle in the lower limbs, whereas the triceps and interosseous were predominantly involved in the upper limbs. A longitudinal study of compound motor action potentials showed a progressive decrease in all nerves, with different kinetics. Sensory potentials were sometimes abnormally low, mainly in the SD patients. The main brain magnetic resonance imaging feature was cerebellar atrophy, even in patients without cerebellar symptoms or leukodystrophy. The prognosis was mainly related to gait disorder, as we showed that beyond 20 years of disease evolution, half of the patients were wheelchair users.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Improved knowledge of GM2 gangliosidosis in adults will help clinicians achieve correct diagnoses and better inform patients on the evolution and prognosis. It may also contribute to defining proper outcome measures when testing emerging therapies. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;The bifunctional enzyme soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) is found in all regions of the brain. It has two different catalytic activities, each assigned to one of its terminal domains: the C-terminal domain presents hydrolase activity, whereas the N-terminal domain exhibits phosphatase activity. The enzyme’s C-terminal domain has been linked to cardiovascular protective and anti-inflammatory effects. Cholesterol-related disorders have been associated with sEH, which plays an important role in the metabolism of cholesterol precursors. The role of sEH’s phosphatase activity has been so far poorly investigated in the context of the central nervous system physiology. Given that brain cholesterol disturbances play a role in the onset of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) as well as of other neurodegenerative diseases, understanding the functions of this enzyme could provide pivotal information on the pathophysiology of these conditions. Moreover, the sEH phosphatase domain could represent an underexplored target for drug design and therapeutic strategies to improve symptoms related to neurodegenerative diseases. This review discusses the function of sEH in mammals and its protein structure and catalytic activities. Particular attention was given to the distribution and expression of sEH in the human brain, deepening into the enzyme’s phosphatase activity and its participation in brain cholesterol synthesis. Finally, this review focused on the metabolism of cholesterol and its association with AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;The physical continuity of axons over long cellular distances poses challenges for their maintenance. One organelle that faces this challenge is endoplasmic reticulum (ER); unlike other intracellular organelles, this forms a physically continuous network throughout the cell, with a single membrane and a single lumen. In axons, ER is mainly smooth, forming a tubular network with occasional sheets or cisternae and low amounts of rough ER. It has many potential roles: lipid biosynthesis, glucose homeostasis, a Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; store, protein export, and contacting and regulating other organelles. This tubular network structure is determined by ER-shaping proteins, mutations in some of which are causative for neurodegenerative disorders such as hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP). While axonal ER shares many features with the tubular ER network in other contexts, these features must be adapted to the long and narrow dimensions of axons. ER appears to be physically continuous throughout axons, over distances that are enormous on a subcellular scale. It is therefore a potential channel for long-distance or regional communication within neurons, independent of action potentials or physical transport of cargos, but involving its physiological roles such as Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; or organelle homeostasis. Despite its apparent stability, axonal ER is highly dynamic, showing features like anterograde and retrograde transport, potentially reflecting continuous fusion and breakage of the network. Here we discuss the transport processes that must contribute to this dynamic behavior of ER. We also discuss the model that these processes underpin a homeostatic process that ensures both enough ER to maintain continuity of the network and repair breaks in it, but not too much ER that might disrupt local cellular physiology. Finally, we discuss how failure of ER organization in axons could lead to axon degenerative diseases, and how a requirement for ER continuity could make distal axons most susceptible to degeneration in conditions that disrupt ER continuity.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;To investigate the potential applications and the molecular mechanisms of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on cognitive impairment in a vascular dementia (VD) animal model. Sprague-Dawley rats were used in this study. VD rat model was induced by modified permanent bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (2-VO) approach. Anodal tDCS was applied to the animals. Morris water maze was used to analyze spatial memory and navigation ability. The pathological changes in the hippocampal CA1 region and cerebral cortex were examined via Hematoxylin-Eosin staining. The rats were sacrificed for the measurement of the level of superoxide (SOD), glutathione (GSH), reactive oxidative species (ROS), malondialdehyd (MDA), Interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α level in the hippocampus. Western blot was carried out to measure the hippocampal expression of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC-3) and p62. Rats with VD have decreased number of neurons in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex, as well as worse cognitive impairment. The proliferation of activated microglia and astroglia, accompanied with attenuation of myelination were observed in the white matter about 1 month after 2-VO operation. These abnormalities were significantly ameliorated by tDCS treatment. Further study revealed that anodal tDCS could suppress the MDA and ROS level, while enhance the SOD and GSH level to reduce the oxidative stress. Anodal tDCS could inhibit hypoperfusion-induced IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α expression to attenuate inflammatory response in hippocampus. Moreover, anodal tDCS treatment could alleviate autophagy level. The study has demonstrated a possible therapeutic role of tDCS in the treatment of cognitive impairment in VD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Early life stress can exert detrimental or beneficial effects on neural development and postnatal behavior depending on the timing, duration, strength, and ability to control the stressors. In this study, we utilized a maternal and social deprivation (MSD) model to investigate the effects of early life stress on neural stem cells (NSCs) and neurogenesis in the adult brain. We found that MSD during the stress-hyporesponsive period (SHRP) (early-MSD), when corticosterone secretion is suppressed, increased the size of the NSC population, whereas the same stress beyond the SHRP abrogated these effects. Early-MSD enhanced neurogenesis not only in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, one of the classic neurogenic regions, but also in the amygdala. In addition, mice exposed to early-MSD exhibited a reduction in amygdala/hippocampus-dependent fear memory. These results suggest that animals exposed to early life stress during the SHRP have reinforced stress resilience to cope with perceived stressors to maintain a normal homeostatic state.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;α-Synuclein (αS) is a presynaptic protein whose aggregation is associated with Parkinson’s disease (PD). Although the physiological function of αS is still unclear, several lines of evidence indicate that this protein may play a role in the trafficking of synaptic vesicles (SVs) during neurotransmitter release, a task associated with its ability to bind SVs and promote their clustering. It is therefore crucial to identify the cellular factors that modulate this process. To address this question, using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy we have characterized the role of cholesterol, a major component of the membrane of SVs, in the binding of αS with synaptic-like vesicles. Our results indicate that cholesterol can act as a modulator of the overall affinity of αS for SVs by reducing the local affinity of the region spanning residues 65–97 in the non-amyloid-β component (NAC) of the protein. The increased population of bound states that expose the region 65–97 to the solvent was found to induce stronger vesicle-vesicle interactions by αS. These results provide evidence that cholesterol modulates the clustering of synaptic vesicles induced by (α)S, and supports the role of the disorder-to-order equilibrium of the NAC region in the modulation of the biological properties of the membrane-bound state of αS.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) is associated with high morbidity and mortality, mainly in childhood. Our aim was to evaluate the effects of postnatal ETS exposure in the brain 2-deoxy-2-[&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]-fluoro-D-glucose (&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-FDG) uptake of mice by positron emission tomography (PET) neuroimaging in a longitudinal study. C57BL/6J mice were exposed to ETS that was generated from 3R4F cigarettes from postnatal day 3 (P3) to P14. PET analyses were performed in male and female mice during infancy (P15), adolescence (P35), and adulthood (P65). We observed that ETS exposure decreased &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-FDG uptake in the whole brain, both left and right hemispheres, and frontal cortex in both male and female infant mice, while female infant mice exposed to ETS showed decreased &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-FDG uptake in the cerebellum. In addition, all mice showed reduced &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-FDG uptake in infancy, compared to adulthood in all analyzed VOIs. In adulthood, ETS exposure during the early postnatal period decreased brain &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-FDG uptake in adult male mice in the cortex, striatum, hippocampus, cingulate cortex, and thalamus when compared to control group. ETS induced an increase in &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-FDG uptake in adult female mice when compared to control group in the brainstem and cingulate cortex. Moreover, male ETS-exposed animals showed decreased &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-FDG uptake when compared to female ETS-exposed in the whole brain, brainstem, cortex, left amygdala, striatum, hippocampus, cingulate cortex, basal forebrain and septum, thalamus, hypothalamus, and midbrain. The present study shows that several brain regions are vulnerable to ETS exposure during the early postnatal period and these effects on &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-FDG uptake are observed even a long time after the last exposure. This study corroborates our previous findings, strengthening the idea that exposure to tobacco smoke in a critical period interferes with brain development of mice from late infancy to early adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Although the basis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) etiology remains unknown, oxidative stress (OS) has been recognized as a prodromal factor associated to its progression. OS refers to an imbalance between oxidant and antioxidant systems, which usually consist in an overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) which overwhelms the intrinsic antioxidant defenses. Due to this increased production of ROS and RNS, several biological functions such as glucose metabolism or synaptic activity are impaired. In AD, growing evidence links the ROS-mediated damages with molecular targets including mitochondrial dynamics and function, protein quality control system, and autophagic pathways, affecting the proteostasis balance. In this scenario, OS should be considered as not only a major feature in the pathophysiology of AD but also a potential target to combat the progression of the disease. In this review, we will discuss the role of OS in mitochondrial dysfunction, protein quality control systems, and autophagy associated to AD and suggest innovative therapeutic strategies based on a better understanding of the role of OS and proteostasis.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Iron is an essential transition metal for numerous biologic processes in mammals. Iron metabolism is regulated via several coordination mechanisms including absorption, utilization, recycling, and storage. Iron dyshomeostasis can result in intracellular iron retention, thereby damaging cells, tissues, and organs through free oxygen radical generation. Numerous studies have shown that brain iron overload is involved in the pathological mechanism of neurodegenerative disease including Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, the underlying mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. Ferroptosis, a newly defined iron-dependent form of cell death, which is distinct from apoptosis, necrosis, autophagy, and other forms of cell death, may provide us a new viewpoint. Here, we set out to summarize the current knowledge of iron metabolism and ferroptosis, and review the contributions of iron and ferroptosis to AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) is a debilitating condition estimated to impact at least 1 million individuals in the United States, however there persists controversy about its existence. Machine learning algorithms have become a powerful methodology for evaluating multi-regional areas of fMRI activation that can classify disease phenotype from sedentary control. Uncovering objective biomarkers such as an fMRI pattern is important for lending credibility to diagnosis of CFS. fMRI scans were evaluated for 69 patients (38 CFS and 31 Control) taken before (Day 1) and after (Day 2) a submaximal exercise test while undergoing the n-back memory paradigm. A predictive model was created by grouping fMRI voxels into the Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL) atlas, splitting the data into a training and testing dataset, and feeding these inputs into a logistic regression to evaluate differences between CFS and control. Model results were cross-validated 10 times to ensure accuracy. Model results were able to differentiate CFS from sedentary controls at a 80% accuracy on Day 1 and 76% accuracy on Day 2 (Table 3). Recursive features selection identified 29 ROI's that significantly distinguished CFS from control on Day 1 and 28 ROI's on Day 2 with 10 regions of overlap shared with Day 1 (Figure 3). These 10 shared regions included the putamen, inferior frontal gyrus, orbital (F3O), supramarginal gyrus (SMG), temporal pole; superior temporal gyrus (T1P) and caudate ROIs. This study was able to uncover a pattern of activated neurological regions that differentiated CFS from Control. This pattern provides a first step toward developing fMRI as a diagnostic biomarker and suggests this methodology could be emulated for other disorders. We concluded that a logistic regression model performed on fMRI data significantly differentiated CFS from Control.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Modality-invariant categorical representations, i.e., shared representation, is thought to play a key role in learning to categorize multi-modal information. We have investigated how a bimodal autoencoder can form a shared representation in an unsupervised manner with multi-modal data. We explored whether altering the depth of the network and mixing the multi-modal inputs at the input layer affect the development of the shared representations. Based on the activation of units in the hidden layers, we classified them into four different types: visual cells, auditory cells, inconsistent visual and auditory cells, and consistent visual and auditory cells. Our results show that the number and quality of the last type (i.e., shared representation) significantly differ depending on the depth of the network and are enhanced when the network receives mixed inputs as opposed to separate inputs for each modality, as occurs in typical two-stage frameworks. In the present work, we present a way to utilize information theory to understand the abstract representations formed in the hidden layers of the network. We believe that such an information theoretic approach could potentially provide insights into the development of more efficient and cost-effective ways to train neural networks using qualitative measures of the representations that cannot be captured by analyzing only the final outputs of the networks.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Electrical kindling, repeated brain stimulation eventually resulting in seizures, is widely used as an animal model of epileptogenesis and epilepsy. However, the stimulation electrode used for electric kindling targets unknown neuronal populations and may introduce tissue damage and inflammation. Optogenetics can be used to circumvent these shortcomings by permitting millisecond control of activity in genetically defined neurons without gross injury or inflammation. Here we describe an easy step-by-step protocol for optogenetic kindling – optokindling – by which seizures are eventually elicited in initially healthy mice through repeated light stimulation of neurons expressing Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2). Chronic EEG recordings may be performed over large time scales to monitor activity while video camera monitoring may be used to assess the behavioral severity of seizures. In conclusion, with optokindling, neuroscientists can elucidate the circuit changes that underpin epilepsy while minimizing the contribution of confounding factors such as brain damage and inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Müller cells are the predominant glial elements in the retina, extending vertically across this structure, and they fulfill a wealth support roles that are critical for neurons. Alterations to the behavior and phenotype of Müller glia are often seen in animal models of retinal degeneration and in retinal tissue from patients with a variety of retinal disorders. Thus, elucidating the mechanisms underlying the development of retinal diseases would help better understand the cellular processes involved in such pathological changes. Studies into Müller cell activity in vitro have been hindered by the difficulty in obtaining pure cell populations and the tendency of these cells to rapidly differentiate in culture. Most protocols currently used to isolate Müller glia use neonatal or embryonic tissue but here, we report an optimized protocol that facilitates the reliable and straightforward isolation and culture of Müller cells from adult pigs, rats and mice. The protocol described here provides an efficient method for the rapid isolation of adult mammalian Müller cells, which represents a reliable platform to study therapeutic targets and to test the effects of drugs that might combat retinal diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To determine the clinical and molecular features in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 4 (ALS4) due to mutations in the senataxin (&lt;i&gt;SETX&lt;/i&gt;) gene and to develop tools for evaluating &lt;i&gt;SETX&lt;/i&gt; variants.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our study involved 32 patients, including 31 with mutation in &lt;i&gt;SETX&lt;/i&gt; at c.1166 T&amp;gt;C (p.Leu389Ser) and 1 with mutation at c.1153 G&amp;gt;A (p.Glu385Lys). Clinical characterization of the patients included neurological examination, blood tests, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and dual‐energy x‐ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Fibroblasts and motor neurons were obtained to model the disease and characterize the molecular alteration in senataxin function.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report key clinical features of ALS4. Laboratory analysis showed alteration of serum creatine kinase and creatinine in the Leu389Ser ALS4 cohort. MRI showed increased muscle fat fraction in the lower extremities, which correlates with disease duration (thigh fat fraction &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.35, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.01; lower leg fat fraction &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.49, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01). DEXA measurements showed lower extremities are more affected than upper extremities (average fat &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt; scores of 2.1 and 0.6, respectively). A cellular assay for SETX function confirmed that like the Leu389Ser mutation, the Glu385Lys variant leads to a decrease in R loops, likely from a gain of function.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified clinical laboratory and radiological features of ALS4, and hence they should be monitored for disease progression. The molecular characterization of R‐loop levels in patient‐derived cells provides insight into the disease pathology and assays to evaluate the pathogenicity of candidate mutations in the &lt;i&gt;SETX&lt;/i&gt; gene.

 &lt;p&gt;The electrophysiology of the paralimbic network (“default mode”) for self-awareness has drawn much attention in the past couple of decades. In contrast, knowledge of the molecular organization of conscious experience has only lately come into focus. We here review newer data on dopaminergic control of awareness in humans, particularly in self-awareness. These results implicate mainly dopaminergic neurotransmission and the control of GABAergic function directly in the paralimbic network. The findings are important for understanding addiction, developmental disorders, and dysfunctional consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Perineuronal nets (PNNs) are condensed extracellular matrix (ECM) structures regulating developmental plasticity and protecting neurons against oxidative stress. PNN abnormalities have been observed in various psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, but the relationship between PNN density and depression still remains unclear. In the present study, we examined the density and components of PNNs including aggrecan, neurocan and Tenascin-R in the prelimbic cortex (PrL) after chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS). We found that depressive-like behaviors were induced after 30 days of CUMS accompanied by decreases in PNN&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cell density and aggrecan expression in the PrL. In addition, rats subjected to 20 days of CUMS were separated into vulnerable and resilient subpopulations that differ along several behavioral domains. Consistently, the density of PNNs and the expression level of neurocan in the vulnerable group were decreased compared to control and resilient groups. Finally, we examined individual differences based on locomotion in a novel context and classified rats as high responding (HR) and low responding (LR) phenotypes. The density of PNNs and the expression level of neurocan in the LR group were lower than the HR group. Moreover, the LR rats were more susceptible to depressive-like behaviors compared with HR rats. Altogether, these results suggest that the density of PNNs in the PrL is associated with depressive-like behaviors in young-aged rats, and it may serve as a potential endophenotype or therapeutic target for depression.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00016"/>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Introduction: Ocular manifestations in several neurological pathologies accentuate the strong relationship between the eye and the brain. Retinal alterations in particular can serve as surrogates for cerebral changes. Offering a “window to the brain,” the transparent eye enables non-invasive imaging of these changes in retinal structure and vasculature. Fractal dimension (FD) reflects the overall complexity of the retinal vasculature. Changes in FD could reflect subtle changes in the cerebral vasculature that correspond to preclinical stages of neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, the potential of this retinal vessel metric to serve as a biomarker in neurodegeneration and stroke will be explored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: A literature search was conducted, following the PRISMA Statement 2009 criteria, in four large bibliographic databases (Pubmed, Embase, Web Of Science and Cochrane Library) up to 12 October 2019. Articles have been included based upon their relevance. Wherever possible, level of evidence (LOE) has been assessed by means of the Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine Level of Evidence classification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Twenty-one studies were included for qualitative synthesis. We performed a narrative synthesis and produced summary tables of findings of included papers because methodological heterogeneity precluded a meta-analysis. A significant association was found between decreased FD and neurodegenerative disease, mainly addressing cognitive impairment (CI) and dementia. In acute, subacute as well as chronic settings, decreased FD seems to be associated with stroke. Differences in FD between subtypes of ischemic stroke remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: This review provides a summary of the scientific literature regarding the association between retinal FD and neurodegenerative disease and stroke. Central pathology is associated with a decreased FD, as a measure of microvascular network complexity. As retinal FD reflects the global integrity of the cerebral microvasculature, it is an attractive parameter to explore. Despite obvious concerns, mainly due to a lack of methodological standardization, retinal FD remains a promising non-invasive and low-cost diagnostic biomarker for neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular disease. Before FD can be implemented in clinic as a diagnostic biomarker, the research community should strive for uniformization and standardization.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Aging coincides with a decline in navigation and wayfinding abilities, but it is unclear to what extent factors relating to a given individual may contribute to mitigating this decline. The present study aims to analyze how older adults’ objective cognitive functioning and self-reported subjective wayfinding inclinations predict their navigation performance. Sixty-four older adults were assessed on their general cognitive functioning (all scoring from 22 to 30 on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, MoCA), visuospatial working memory (VSWM), and perspective-taking abilities. Their self-assessed wayfinding inclinations (such as their sense of direction, pleasure in exploring places, and spatial anxiety) were also examined. Then participants learned a path in an environment from video navigation and performed a route repetition task (which maintained the same egocentric perspective as the learning phase), and a sketch map task (which involved switching from an egocentric perspective used in the learning phase to an allocentric perspective). The results showed that positive wayfinding inclinations (in terms of pleasure in exploring) related to participants’ route repetition accuracy, while their general cognitive performance (MoCA scores) related to their sketch map drawing accuracy. Individual factors such as cognitive functioning and wayfinding inclinations relate differently to older people’s navigation performance, depending on the demands of the tasks used to test their environment learning.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Functional neuroimaging studies have emphasized distinct networks for social cognition and affective aspects of empathy. However, studies have not considered whether substrates of social cognition, such as the right temporoparietal junction (TPJ), play a role in affective responses to complex empathy-related stimuli. Here, we used repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to test whether the right TPJ contributes to psychophysiological responses to another person’s emotional suffering. We used a theory of mind functional localizer and image-guided TMS to target the sub-region of the right TPJ implicated in social cognition, and measured autonomic and subjective responses to an empathy induction video. We found evidence that TMS applied at 1 Hz over the right TPJ increased withdrawal of parasympathetic nervous system activity during the empathy induction (n = 32), but did not affect sympathetic nervous system activity (n = 27). Participants who received TMS over the right TPJ also reported feeling more irritation and annoyance, and were less likely to report feeling compassion over and above empathic sadness, than participants who received TMS over the vertex (N = 34). This study provides preliminary evidence for the role of right TPJ functioning in empathy-related psychophysiological and affective responding, potentially blurring the distinction between neural regions specific to social cognition vs. affective aspects of empathy.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2019.00082"/>
		<id>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2019.00082</id>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Associative learning of pure tones is known to cause tonotopic map expansion in the auditory cortex (ACx), but the function this plasticity sub-serves is unclear. We developed an automated training platform called the “Educage,” which was used to train mice on a go/no-go auditory discrimination task to their perceptual limits, for difficult discriminations among pure tones or natural sounds. Spiking responses of excitatory and inhibitory parvalbumin (PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) L2/3 neurons in mouse ACx revealed learning-induced overrepresentation of the learned frequencies, as expected from previous literature. The coordinated plasticity of excitatory and inhibitory neurons supports a role for PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons in homeostatic maintenance of excitation–inhibition balance within the circuit. Using a novel computational model to study auditory tuning curves, we show that overrepresentation of the learned tones does not necessarily improve discrimination performance of the network to these tones. In a separate set of experiments, we trained mice to discriminate among natural sounds. Perceptual learning of natural sounds induced “sparsening” and decorrelation of the neural response, consequently improving discrimination of these complex sounds. This signature of plasticity in A1 highlights its role in coding natural sounds.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leucine‐rich glioma‐inactivated 1 (LGI1) encephalitis is the second most common antibody‐mediated encephalopathy, but insight into the intrathecal B‐cell autoimmune response, including clonal relationships, isotype distribution, frequency, and pathogenic effects of single LGI1 antibodies, has remained limited.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We cloned, expressed, and tested antibodies from 90 antibody‐secreting cells (ASCs) and B cells from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of several patients with LGI1 encephalitis.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eighty‐four percent of the ASCs and 21% of the memory B cells encoded LGI1‐reactive antibodies, whereas reactivities to other brain epitopes were rare. All LGI1 antibodies were of IgG1, IgG2, or IgG4 isotype and had undergone affinity maturation. Seven of the overall 26 LGI1 antibodies efficiently blocked the interaction of LGI1 with its receptor ADAM22 in vitro, and their mean LGI1 signal on mouse brain sections was weak compared to the remaining, non–ADAM22‐competing antibodies. Nevertheless, both types of LGI1 antibodies increased the intrinsic cellular excitability and glutamatergic synaptic transmission of hippocampal CA3 neurons in slice cultures.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our data show that the patients’ intrathecal B‐cell autoimmune response is dominated by LGI1 antibodies and that LGI1 antibodies alone are sufficient to promote neuronal excitability, a basis of seizure generation. Fundamental differences in target specificity and antibody hypermutations compared to the CSF autoantibody repertoire in N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate receptor encephalitis underline the clinical concept that autoimmune encephalitides are very distinct entities.

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spontaneous recovery is an important determinant of upper extremity recovery after stroke and has been described by the 70% proportional recovery rule for the Fugl–Meyer motor upper extremity (FM‐UE) scale. However, this rule is criticized for overestimating the predictability of FM‐UE recovery. Our objectives were to develop a longitudinal mixture model of FM‐UE recovery, identify FM‐UE recovery subgroups, and internally validate the model predictions.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We developed an exponential recovery function with the following parameters: subgroup assignment probability, proportional recovery coefficient &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;
      &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;
   &lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;, time constant in weeks &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;τ&lt;/i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;
      &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;
   &lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;, and distribution of the initial FM‐UE scores. We fitted the model to FM‐UE measurements of 412 first‐ever ischemic stroke patients and cross‐validated endpoint predictions and FM‐UE recovery cluster assignment.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The model distinguished 5 subgroups with different recovery parameters (&lt;span&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.09&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;τ&lt;/i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 5.3&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.46&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;τ&lt;/i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 10.1&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.86&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;τ&lt;/i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 9.8&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.89&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;τ&lt;/i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; = 2.7&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.93&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;τ&lt;/i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.2&lt;/span&gt;). Endpoint FM‐UE was predicted with a median absolute error of 4.8 (interquartile range [IQR] = 1.3–12.8) at 1 week poststroke and 4.2 (IQR = 1.3–9.8) at 2 weeks. Overall accuracy of assignment to the poor (subgroup 1), moderate (subgroups 2 and 3), and good (subgroups 4 and 5) FM‐UE recovery clusters was 0.79 (95% equal‐tailed interval [ETI] = 0.78–0.80) at 1 week poststroke and 0.81 (95% ETI = 0.80–0.82) at 2 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FM‐UE recovery reflects different subgroups, each with its own recovery profile. Cross‐validation indicates that FM‐UE endpoints and FM‐UE recovery clusters can be well predicted. Results will contribute to the understanding of upper limb recovery patterns in the first 6 months after stroke. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long‐term cognitive decline is an adverse outcome after major surgery associated with increased risk for mortality and morbidity. We studied the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum biochemical inflammatory response to a standardized orthopedic surgical procedure and the possible association with long‐term changes in cognitive function. We hypothesized that the CSF inflammatory response pattern after surgery would differ in patients having long‐term cognitive decline defined as a composite cognitive &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt; score of ≥1.0 compared to patients without long‐term cognitive decline at 3 months postsurgery.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serum and CSF biomarkers of inflammation and blood–brain barrier (BBB) integrity were measured preoperatively and up to 48 hours postoperatively, and cognitive function was assessed preoperatively and at 2 to 5 days and 3 months postoperatively.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surgery was associated with a pronounced increase in inflammatory biomarkers in both CSF and blood throughout the 48‐hour study period. A principal component (PC) analysis was performed on 52 inflammatory biomarkers. The 2 first PC (PC1 and PC2) construct outcome variables on CSF biomarkers were significantly associated with long‐term cognitive decline at 3 months, but none of the PC construct serum variables showed a significant association with long‐term cognitive decline at 3 months. Patients both with and patients without long‐term cognitive decline showed early transient increases of the astroglial biomarkers S‐100B and glial fibrillary acidic protein in CSF, and in BBB permeability (CSF/serum albumin ratio).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surgery rapidly triggers a temporal neuroinflammatory response closely associated with long‐term cognitive outcome postsurgery. The findings of this explorative study require validation in a larger surgical patient cohort. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To systematically investigate causal relationships between obesity and cerebrovascular disease, and the extent to which hypertension and hyperglycemia mediate the effect of obesity on cerebrovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used summary statistics from genome‐wide association studies for body mass index (BMI), waist‐to‐hip ratio (WHR) and multiple cerebrovascular disease phenotypes. We explored causal associations with two‐sample Mendelian randomization (MR) accounting for genetic covariation between BMI and WHR; and assessed what proportion of the association between obesity and cerebrovascular disease was mediated by systolic blood pressure (SBP) and blood glucose levels respectively.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genetic predisposition to higher BMI did not increase the risk of cerebrovascular disease. In contrast, for each 10% increase in WHR there was a 75% increase (95% confidence interval (CI)=44%‐113%) in risk for large artery ischemic stroke, a 57% (CI=29%‐91%) increase in risk for small vessel ischemic stroke, a 197% increase (CI=59%‐457%) in risk of intracerebral hemorrhage, as well as an increase in white matter hyperintensity volume (β=0.11; CI=0.01‐0.21). These WHR associations persisted after adjusting for genetic determinants of BMI. Approximately one tenth of the observed effect of WHR was mediated by SBP for ischemic stroke (12%; CI=4%‐20%), but no evidence of mediation was found for average blood glucose.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abdominal adiposity may trigger causal pathological processes, partially independent from blood pressure and totally independent from glucose levels, that lead to cerebrovascular disease. Potential targets of these pathological processes could represent novel therapeutic opportunities for stroke.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;REM‐sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a prodromal synucleinopathy, as &amp;gt;80% will eventually convert to overt synucleinopathy. We performed an in‐depth analysis of the &lt;i&gt;SNCA&lt;/i&gt; locus to identify RBD‐specific risk variants.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Full sequencing and genotyping of &lt;i&gt;SNCA&lt;/i&gt; was performed in isolated/idiopathic RBD (iRBD, n=1,076), Parkinson's disease (PD, n=1,013), and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB, n=415), and in control subjects (n=6,155). iRBD cases were diagnosed with RBD prior to neurodegeneration, although some have since converted. A replication cohort from 23andMe of PD patients with probable RBD (pRBD) was also analyzed (cases n=1,782, controls n=131,250). Adjusted logistic regression models and meta‐analyses were performed. Effects on conversion rate were analyzed in 432 RBD patients with available data using Kaplan‐Meier survival analysis.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 5'‐region &lt;i&gt;SNCA&lt;/i&gt; variant (rs10005233) was associated with iRBD (OR=1.43, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;=1.1E‐08), which was replicated in pRBD. This variant is in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with other 5' risk variants across the different synucleinopathies. An independent iRBD‐specific suggestive association (rs11732740) was detected at the 3' of &lt;i&gt;SNCA&lt;/i&gt; (OR=1.32, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;=4.7E‐04, not statistically significant after Bonferroni correction). Homozygous carriers of both iRBD‐specific SNPs were at highly increased risk for iRBD (OR=5.74, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;=2E‐06). The known top PD‐associated variant (3' variant rs356182) had an opposite direction of effect in iRBD compared to PD.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a distinct pattern of association at the &lt;i&gt;SNCA&lt;/i&gt; locus in RBD as compared to PD, with an opposite direction of effect at the 3' of &lt;i&gt;SNCA&lt;/i&gt;. Several 5' &lt;i&gt;SNCA&lt;/i&gt; variants are associated with iRBD and with pRBD in overt synucleinopathies.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Tinnitus is one of the most prevalent auditory disorders worldwide, manifesting in both chronic and acute forms. The pathology of tinnitus has been mechanistically linked to induction of harmful neural plasticity stemming from traumatic noise exposure, exposure to ototoxic medications, input deprivation from age-related hearing loss, and in response to injuries or disorders damaging the conductive apparatus of the ears, the cochlear hair cells, the ganglionic cells of the VIIIth cranial nerve, or neurons of the classical auditory pathway which link the cochlear nuclei through the inferior colliculi and medial geniculate nuclei to auditory cortices. Research attempting to more specifically characterize the neural plasticity occurring in tinnitus have used a wide range of techniques, experimental paradigms, and sampled at different windows of time to reach different conclusions about why and which specific brain regions are crucial in the induction or ongoing maintenance of tinnitus-related plasticity. Despite differences in experimental methodologies, evidence reveals similar findings that strongly suggest that immediate and prolonged activation of non-classical auditory structures (i.e., amygdala, hippocampus, and cingulate cortex) may contribute to the initiation and development of tinnitus in addition to the ongoing maintenance of this devastating condition. The overarching focus of this review, therefore, is to highlight findings from the field supporting the hypothesis that abnormal early activation of non-classical sensory limbic regions are involved in tinnitus induction, with activation of these regions continuing to occur at different temporal stages. Since initial/early stages of tinnitus are difficult to control and to quantify in human clinical populations, a number of different animal paradigms have been developed and assessed in experimental investigations. Reviews of traumatic noise exposure and ototoxic doses of sodium salicylate, the most prevalently used animal models to induce experimental tinnitus, indicate early limbic system plasticity (within hours, minutes, or days after initial insult), supports subsequent plasticity in other auditory regions, and contributes to the pathophysiology of tinnitus. Understanding this early plasticity presents additional opportunities for intervention to reduce or eliminate tinnitus from the human condition.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Opioid drugs are the gold standard for the management of pain, but their use is severely limited by dangerous and unpleasant side effects. All clinically available opioid analgesics bind to and activate the mu-opioid receptor (MOR), a heterotrimeric G-protein-coupled receptor, to produce analgesia. The activity of these receptors is modulated by a family of intracellular RGS proteins or regulators of G-protein signaling proteins, characterized by the presence of a conserved RGS Homology (RH) domain. These proteins act as negative regulators of G-protein signaling by serving as GTPase accelerating proteins or GAPS to switch off signaling by both the Gα and βγ subunits of heterotrimeric G-proteins. Consequently, knockdown or knockout of RGS protein activity enhances signaling downstream of MOR. In this review we discuss current knowledge of how this activity, across the different families of RGS proteins, modulates MOR activity, as well as activity of other members of the opioid receptor family, and so pain and analgesia in animal models, with particular emphasis on RGS4 and RGS9 families. We discuss inhibition of RGS proteins with small molecule inhibitors that bind to sensitive cysteine moieties in the RH domain and the potential for targeting this family of intracellular proteins as adjuncts to provide an opioid sparing effect or as standalone analgesics by promoting the activity of endogenous opioid peptides. Overall, we conclude that RGS proteins may be a novel drug target to provide analgesia with reduced opioid-like side effects, but that much basic work is needed to define the roles for specific RGS proteins, particularly in chronic pain, as well as a need to develop newer inhibitors.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) caused by herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) infection can lead to a high mortality rate and severe neurological sequelae. The destruction of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is an important pathological mechanism for the development of HSE. However, the specific mechanism underlying the BBB destruction remains unclear. Our previous study found that the Golgi apparatus (GA) plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of the BBB. Therefore, this present study aimed to investigate the role of the GA in the destruction of the BBB and its underlying mechanisms. Mouse brain endothelial cells (Bend.3) were cultured to establish a BBB model in vitro, and then infected with HSV-1. The results showed that HSV-1 infection caused downregulation of the Golgi-associated protein GM130, accompanied by Golgi fragmentation, cell apoptosis, and downregulation of tight junction proteins occludin and claudin 5. Knockdown of GM130 with small interfering RNA in uninfected Bend.3 cells triggered Golgi fragmentation, apoptosis, and downregulation of occludin and claudin 5. However, overexpression of GM130 in HSV-1 infected Bend.3 cells by transient transfection partially attenuated the aforementioned damage caused by HSV-1 infection. When the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk was used after HSV-1 infection to inhibit apoptosis, the protein levels of GM130, occludin and claudin 5 were partially restored. Taken together, these observations indicate that HSV-1 infection of Bend.3 cells triggers a GM130-mediated Golgi stress response that is involved in apoptosis, which in turn results in downregulation of occludin and claudin 5 protein levels. Meanwhile, GM130 downregulation is partially due to apoptosis triggered by HSV-1 infection. Our findings reveal an association between the GA and the BBB during HSV-1 infection and identify potentially novel targets for protecting the BBB and therapeutic approaches for patients with HSE.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Astrocytes are the most abundant type of glial cells in the brain, and they play a key role in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Fibroblast Growth Factor-2 (FGF-2) has been implicated as a potential therapeutic agent for treating AD. In the present study, we investigated the protective effects of low molecular weight (LMW; 17 KDa) and high molecular weight (HMW; 23 KDa) forms of FGF-2 on Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1–42&lt;/sub&gt;-induced toxicity, and proliferation in astrocytes. We show that both isoforms of FGF-2 have similar protective effects against Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1–42&lt;/sub&gt;-induced cytotoxicity in primary cultured cortical astrocytes as measured by Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) release assay. Additionally, 17 KDa FGF-2 significantly promoted astrocyte proliferation as measured by Trypan Blue, DRAQ5 and 5-ethynyl-2’-deoxyuridine (EdU) staining, but not 23 kDa FGF-2. Furthermore, our results demonstrated that AKT signaling pathway was required for the protective and proliferative effects of FGF-2. Downstream effector studies indicated that 17 kDa FGF-2 promoted astrocyte proliferation by enhanced expression of c-Myc, Cyclin D1, Cyclin E. Furthermore, our data suggested that Cyclin D1 was required for the proliferative effect of LMW FGF2 in astrocytes. Taken together, our findings provide important information for the similarities and differences between 23 kDa and17 kDa isoforms of FGF-2 on astrocyte survival and proliferation.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) are two major forms of synaptic plasticity that are widely accepted as cellular mechanisms involved in learning and memory. Metaplasticity is a process whereby modifications in synaptic processes shift the threshold for subsequent plasticity. While metaplasticity has been functionally observed, its molecular basis is not well understood. Here, we report that neurogranin (Ng) regulates metaplasticity by shifting the threshold toward potentiation, i.e., increasing Ng in hippocampal neurons lowers the threshold for LTP and augments the threshold for LTD. We also show that Ng does not change the ultrastructural localization of calmodulin (CaM)-dependent protein Kinase II (CaMKII) or calcineurin, critical enzymes for the induction of LTP and LTD, respectively. Interestingly, while CaMKII concentrates close to the plasma membrane, calcineurin concentrates away from the plasma membrane. These data, along with the previous observation showing Ng targets CaM closer to the plasma membrane, suggesting that shifting the localization of CaM within the dendritic spines and closer to the plasma membrane, where there is more CaMKII, may be favoring the activation of CaMKII vs. that of calcineurin. Thus, the regulation of CaM localization/targeting within dendritic spines by Ng may provide a mechanistic basis for the regulation of metaplasticity.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Spaced training is robustly superior to massed training, which is a well-documented phenomenon in humans and animals. However, the mechanisms underlying the spacing effect still remain unclear. We have reported previously that spacing training exerts memory-enhancing effects by inhibiting forgetting via decreasing hippocampal Rac1 activity. Here, using contextual fear conditioning in rat, we found that spaced but not massed training increased hippocampal 5-HT2A receptors’ expression. Furthermore, hippocampal administration of 5-HT2A receptor antagonist MDL11939 before spaced training blocked the enhanced memory, while hippocampal administration of 5-HT2A receptor agonist TCB-2 before massed training promoted the memory. Moreover, MDL11939 activated hippocampal Rac1, while TCB-2 decreased hippocampal Rac1 activity in naïve rats. These results indicated the possibility of interaction between 5-HT2A receptors and Rac1, which was demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Our study first demonstrates that activation of hippocampal 5-HT2A is a mechanism underlying the spacing effect, and forgetting related molecular Rac1 is engaged in this process through interacting with 5-HT2A receptors, which suggest a promising strategy to modulate abnormal learning in cognitive disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Spinal motoneurons exhibit sustained afterdischarges and plateau potentials following a brief high-frequency stimulation of Ia afferents. Also, there is evidence that spinal cord interneurons exhibit plateau potentials. However, to our knowledge, there are no reports about the possible afterdischarge behavior of lumbar spinal interneurons activated by Ia afferents. Given that there are spinal interneurons receiving monosynaptic inputs from Ia afferents, these cells could then be activated in parallel to motoneurons after repetitive muscle stretch. We explored this possibility in cats with a precollicular-postmammillary decerebration. We found that a brief high-frequency stimulation of Ia afferents produces afterdischarges that are highly correlated to a DC slow potential recorded at the cord dorsum. We conclude that in the cat spinal cord, not only the motoneurons but also the interneurons from the superficial and deep dorsal horn produce sustained afterdischarges, thus highlighting the importance of interneurons in the spinal neuronal circuitry. The significance of our finding is that it opens the possibility that the spinal cord interneurons activated by Ia afferents could also exhibit bistability, a relevant phenomenon well-characterized in the motoneurons.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Performing an accurate segmentation of the hippocampus from brain magnetic resonance images is a crucial task in neuroimaging research, since its structural integrity is strongly related to several neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). Some automatic segmentation tools are already being used, but, in recent years, new deep learning (DL) based methods have been proven to be much more accurate in various medical image segmentation tasks. In this work, we propose a DL-based hippocampus segmentation framework that embeds statistical shape of the hippocampus as context information into the deep neural network (DNN). The inclusion of shape information is achieved with three main steps: (1) a U-Net based segmentation, (2) a shape model estimation and (3) a second U-Net based segmentation which uses both the original input data and the fitted shape model. The trained DL architectures were tested on image data of three diagnostic groups (AD patients, subjects with mild cognitive impairment and controls) from two cohorts (ADNI and AddNeuroMed). Both intra-cohort validation and cross-cohort validation were performed and compared with the conventional U-net architecture and some variations with other types of context information (i.e. autocontext and tissue-class context). Our results suggest that adding shape information can improve the segmentation accuracy in cross-cohort validation, i.e. when DNNs are trained on one cohort and applied to another. However, no significant benefit is observed in intra-cohort validation, i.e. training and testing DNNs on images from the same cohort. Moreover, compared to other types of context information, the use of shape context was shown to be the most successful in increasing the accuracy, while keeping the computational time in the order of a few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms are prevalent in both civilian and military service members. As the number of smartphone-based applications (apps) grows rapidly in health care, apps are also increasingly used to help individuals with subthreshold PTSD or full PTSD. Yet, if the apps are self-managed, the feasibility and efficacy of such interventions are still rather unclear in these two populations with PTSD symptoms. Hence, the present meta-analysis set out to evaluate the effect of self-management smartphone-based apps on PTSD and depressive symptoms in populations with subthreshold PTSD or full PTSD. Studies were included if they conducted randomized controlled trials or pre-post comparisons. Six studies (n = 2 randomized controlled trials) were identified for meta-analysis. In pre-post comparisons, N = 209 participants were included in the analyses. In randomized controlled trials, N = 87 participants received smartphone-based self-management interventions and N = 82 participants were in waitlist control conditions. Meta-analysis for pre-post comparisons concluded an effect of g = 0.55 (p &amp;lt; 0.001) regarding the overall reduction in PTSD symptoms (n = 6) and g = 0.45 (p &amp;lt; 0.001) for reduction in depressive symptoms (n = 5). Yet, in randomized controlled trials, no significant difference was found between app-based treatment and waitlist control groups (g = 0.09, p = 0.574). The duration of the interventions did not significantly influence the results. Overall, despite positive pre-post effects, current results indicate that smartphone-apps for PTSD patients are not significantly more effective than waitlist control conditions. Nevertheless, a combined smartphone and standard therapy approach may be a fruitful field for future research.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The manual brain tumor annotation process is time consuming and resource consuming, therefore, an automated and accurate brain tumor segmentation tool is greatly in demand. In this paper, we introduce a novel method to integrate location information with the state-of-the-art patch-based neural networks for brain tumor segmentation. This is motivated by the observation that lesions are not uniformly distributed across different brain parcellation regions and that a locality-sensitive segmentation is likely to obtain better segmentation accuracy. Toward this, we use an existing brain parcellation atlas in the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space and map this atlas to the individual subject data. This mapped atlas in the subject data space is integrated with structural Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging data, and patch-based neural networks, including 3D U-Net and DeepMedic, are trained to classify the different brain lesions. Multiple state-of-the-art neural networks are trained and integrated with XGBoost fusion in the proposed two-level ensemble method. The first level reduces the uncertainty of the same type of models with different seed initializations, and the second level leverages the advantages of different types of neural network models. The proposed location information fusion method improves the segmentation performance of state-of-the-art networks including 3D U-Net and DeepMedic. Our proposed ensemble also achieves better segmentation performance compared to the state-of-the-art networks in BraTS 2017 and rivals state-of-the-art networks in BraTS 2018. Detailed results are provided on the public multimodal brain tumor segmentation (BraTS) benchmarks.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The coordination of brain activity between disparate neural populations is highly dynamic. Investigations into intrinsic brain organization by evaluating dynamic resting-state functional connectivity (dRSFC) have attracted great attention in recent years. However, there are few dRSFC studies based on functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) even though it has some advantages for studying the temporal evolution of brain function. In this research, we recruited 20 young adults and measured their resting-state brain fluctuations in several areas of the frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes using fNIRS-electroencephalography (EEG) simultaneous recording. Based on a sliding-window approach, we found that the variability of the dRSFC within any region of interest was significantly lower than the connections between region of interests but noticeably greater than the correlation between the channels with a short interoptode distance, which mainly consist of physiological fluctuations occurring in the superficial layers. Furthermore, based on a time-resolved k-means clustering analysis, the temporal evolution was extracted for three dominant functional networks. These networks were roughly consistent between different subject subgroups and in varying sliding time window lengths of 20, 30, and 60 s. Between these three functional networks, there were obvious time-varied and system-specific synchronous relationships. In addition, the oscillation of the frontal-parietal-temporal network showed significant correlation with the switching of one EEG microstate, a finding which is consistent with a previous functional MRI-EEG study. All this evidence implies the functional significance of fNIRS-dRSFC and demonstrates the feasibility of fNIRS for extracting the dominant functional networks based on RSFC dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The ability to form a mental representation of the surroundings is a critical skill for spatial navigation and orientation in humans. Such a mental representation is known as a “cognitive map” and is formed as individuals familiarize themselves with the surrounding, providing detailed information about salient environmental landmarks and their spatial relationships. Despite evidence of the malleability and potential for training spatial orientation skills in humans, it remains unknown if the specific ability to form cognitive maps can be improved by an appositely developed training program. Here, we present a newly developed computerized 12-days training program in a virtual environment designed specifically to stimulate the acquisition of this important skill. We asked 15 healthy volunteers to complete the training program and perform a comprehensive spatial behavioral assessment before and after the training. We asked participants to become familiar with the environment by navigating a small area before slowly building them up to navigate within the larger and more complex environment; we asked them to travel back and forth between environmental landmarks until they had built an understanding of where those landmarks resided with respect to one another. This process repeated until participants had visited every landmark in the virtual town and had learned where each landmark resided with respect to the others. The results of this study confirmed the feasibility of the training program and suggested an improvement in the ability of participants to form mental representations of the spatial surrounding. This study provides preliminary findings on the feasibility of a 12-days program in training spatial orientation skills. We discuss the utility and potential impact of this training program in the lives of the many individuals affected by topographical disorientation as a result of an acquired or developmental condition.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Previous research has suggested that the lateral occipital cortex (LOC) is involved with visual decision making, and specifically with the accumulation of information leading to a decision. In humans, this research has been primarily based on imaging and electroencephalography (EEG), and as such only correlational. One line of such research has led to a model of three spatially distributed brain networks that activate in temporal sequence to enable visual decision-making. The model predicted that disturbing neural processing in the LOC at a specific latency would slow object decision-making, increasing reaction time (RT) in a difficult discrimination task. We utilized transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to test this prediction, perturbing LOC beginning at 400 ms post-stimulus onset, a time in the model corresponding to LOC activation at a particular difficulty level, with the expectation of increased RT. Thirteen healthy adults participated in two TMS sessions in which left and right LOC were stimulated separately utilizing neuronavigation and robotic coil guidance. Participants performed a two-alternative forced-choice task selecting whether a car or face was present on each trial amidst visual noise pre-tested to approximate a 75% accuracy level. In an effort to disrupt processing, pairs of TMS pulses separated by 50 ms were presented at one of five stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs): −200, 200, 400, 450, or 500 ms. Behavioral performance differed systematically across SOAs for RT and accuracy measures. As predicted, TMS at 400 ms resulted in a significant slowing of RT. TMS delivered at −200 ms resulted in faster RT, indicating early stimulation may result in priming and performance enhancement. Use of TMS thus causally demonstrated the involvement of LOC in this task, and more broadly with perceptual decision-making; additionally, it demonstrated the role of TMS in testing well-developed neural models of perceptual processing.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;A novel deep learning based model called Multi-Planar Spatial Convolutional Neural Network (MPS-CNN) is proposed for effective, automated segmentation of different sub-regions viz. peritumoral edema (ED), necrotic core (NCR), enhancing and non-enhancing tumor core (ET/NET), from multi-modal MR images of the brain. An encoder-decoder type CNN model is designed for pixel-wise segmentation of the tumor along three anatomical planes (axial, sagittal, and coronal) at the slice level. These are then combined, by incorporating a consensus fusion strategy with a fully connected Conditional Random Field (CRF) based post-refinement, to produce the final volumetric segmentation of the tumor and its constituent sub-regions. Concepts, such as spatial-pooling and unpooling are used to preserve the spatial locations of the edge pixels, for reducing segmentation error around the boundaries. A new aggregated loss function is also developed for effectively handling data imbalance. The MPS-CNN is trained and validated on the recent Multimodal Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge (BraTS) 2018 dataset. The Dice scores obtained for the validation set for whole tumor (WT :NCR/NE +ET +ED), tumor core (TC:NCR/NET +ET), and enhancing tumor (ET) are 0.90216, 0.87247, and 0.82445. The proposed MPS-CNN is found to perform the best (based on leaderboard scores) for ET and TC segmentation tasks, in terms of both the quantitative measures (viz. Dice and Hausdorff). In case of the WT segmentation it also achieved the second highest accuracy, with a score which was only 1% less than that of the best performing method.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has been suggested as a reliable, noninvasive, and inexpensive tool for the diagnosis of neurodegenerative dementias. In this study, we assessed the classification performance of TMS parameters in the differential diagnosis of common neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer disease (AD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We performed a multicenter study enrolling patients referred to 4 dementia centers in Italy, in accordance with the Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy. All patients underwent TMS assessment at recruitment (index test), with application of reference clinical criteria, to predict different neurodegenerative disorders. The investigators who performed the index test were masked to the results of the reference test and all other investigations. We trained and tested a random forest classifier using 5‐fold cross‐validation. The primary outcome measures were the classification accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score of TMS in differentiating each neurodegenerative disorder.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A total of 694 participants were included, namely 273 patients diagnosed as AD, 67 as DLB, and 207 as FTD, and 147 healthy controls (HC). A series of 3 binary classifiers was employed, and the prediction model exhibited high classification accuracy (ranging from 0.89 to 0.92), high precision (0.86–0.92), high recall (0.93–0.98), and high F1 scores (0.89–0.95) in differentiating each neurodegenerative disorder.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TMS is a noninvasive procedure that reliably and selectively distinguishes AD, DLB, FTD, and HC, representing a useful additional screening tool to be used in clinical practice. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epidemiological research in multiple sclerosis (MS) has mainly been performed in socioeconomically and ethnically limited populations; influences on MS risk have not been studied in prospectively collected non‐White populations. We set out to study the influence of previously described MS risk factors in an ethnically diverse population.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A nested case–control study was created using primary care records of &amp;gt;1 million individuals, &amp;gt;50% of whom identify as Black, Asian, and Minority Ethnic (BAME). MS cases were compared to an age‐ and sex‐matched control cohort (1:4), and to a large unmatched cohort. Odds ratios (ORs) of disease were determined according to exposure of interest, and a multivariate model including all exposures was created. Potential pairwise interactions were considered where both indicated a significant effect.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A total of 1,344 confirmed MS cases were included. MS OR in blacks aged &amp;lt;40 years was 1.15 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.81–1.62) compared to whites. MS odds in BAME current (OR = 1.71, 95% CI = 1.24–2.31) and ex‐smokers (OR = 2.83, 95% CI = 2.14–3.72) were considerably higher than in Whites (OR = 1.09, 95% CI = 0.88–1.34; OR = 1.44, 95% CI = 1.19–1.74, respectively). Prior infectious mononucleosis was associated with increased odds of MS in Blacks (OR = 4.94, 95% CI = 1.23–17.89). An increase in MS odds was seen in the least‐deprived quintile (OR = 2.46, 95% CI = 1.40–4.24), but no effect across deprived quintiles was seen.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cohort provides novel data on factors potentially driving MS susceptibility in a diverse population, one‐third of whom live in poverty. Environmental exposures have differential risk across ethnicity. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The lateral parabrachial nucleus, medial parabrachial nucleus, vestibular nuclei complex, and medullary viscero-sensory-motor (VSM) nuclei complex (the latter including among others the solitary nucleus, vagus nerve nucleus, and hypoglossal nucleus) are anatomically and functionally connected brainstem gray matter structures that convey signals across multiple modalities between the brain and the spinal cord to regulate vital bodily functions. It is remarkably difficult to precisely extrapolate the location of these nuclei from ex vivo atlases to conventional 3 Tesla in vivo images; thus, a probabilistic brainstem template in stereotaxic neuroimaging space in living humans is needed. We delineated these nuclei using single-subject high contrast 1.1 mm isotropic resolution 7 Tesla MRI images. After precise coregistration of nuclei labels to stereotaxic space, we generated a probabilistic template of their anatomical locations. Finally, we validated the nuclei labels in the template by assessing their inter-rater agreement, consistency across subjects and volumes. We also performed a preliminary comparison of their location and microstructural properties to histologic sections of a postmortem human brainstem specimen. In future, the resulting probabilistic template of these brainstem nuclei in stereotaxic space may assist researchers and clinicians in evaluating autonomic, vestibular and VSM nuclei structure, function and connectivity in living humans using conventional 3 Tesla MRI scanners.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Alpha-synuclein (α-syn) is localized in cellular organelles of most neurons, but many of its physiological functions are only partially understood. α-syn accumulation is associated with Parkinson’s disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and multiple system atrophy as well as other synucleinopathies; however, the exact pathomechanisms that underlie these neurodegenerative diseases remain elusive. In this review, we describe what is known about α-syn function and pathophysiological changes in different cellular structures and organelles, including what is known about its behavior as a prion-like protein. We summarize current knowledge of α-syn and its pathological forms, covering its effect on each organelle, including aggregation and toxicity in different model systems, with special interest on the mitochondria due to its relevance during the apoptotic process of dopaminergic neurons. Moreover, we explore the effect that α-syn exerts by interacting with chromatin remodeling proteins that add or remove histone marks, up-regulate its own expression, and resume the impairment that α-syn induces in vesicular traffic by interacting with the endoplasmic reticulum. We then recapitulate the events that lead to Golgi apparatus fragmentation, caused by the presence of α-syn. Finally, we report the recent findings about the accumulation of α-syn, indirectly produced by the endolysosomal system. In conclusion, many important steps into the understanding of α-syn have been made using in vivo and in vitro models; however, the time is right to start integrating observational studies with mechanistic models of α-syn interactions, in order to look at a more complete picture of the pathophysiological processes underlying α-synucleinopathies.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;It has been suggested that cholinergic neurons shape the oscillatory activity of the thalamocortical (TC) network in behavioral and electrophysiological experiments. However, theoretical modeling demonstrating how cholinergic neuromodulation of thalamocortical rhythms during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep might occur has been lacking. In this paper, we first develop a novel computational model (TC-ACH) by incorporating a cholinergic neuron population (CH) into the classical thalamo-cortical circuitry, where connections between populations are modeled in accordance with existing knowledge. The neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACH) released by neurons in CH, which is able to change the discharge activity of thalamocortical neurons, is the primary focus of our work. Simulation results with our TC-ACH model reveal that the cholinergic projection activity is a key factor in modulating oscillation patterns in three ways: (1) transitions between different patterns of thalamocortical oscillations are dramatically modulated through diverse projection pathways; (2) the model expresses a stable spindle oscillation state with certain parameter settings for the cholinergic projection from CH to thalamus, and more spindles appear when the strength of cholinergic input from CH to thalamocortical neurons increases; (3) the duration of oscillation patterns during NREM sleep including K-complexes, spindles, and slow oscillations is longer when cholinergic input from CH to thalamocortical neurons becomes stronger. Our modeling results provide insights into the mechanisms by which the sleep state is controlled, and provide a theoretical basis for future experimental and clinical studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Head-direction cells have been found in several areas in the mammalian brains. The firing rate of an ideal head-direction cell reaches its peak value only when the animal's head points in a specific direction, and this preferred direction stays the same regardless of spatial location. In this paper we combine mathematical analytical techniques and numerical simulations to fully analyze the equilibrium states of a generic ring attractor network, which is a widely used modeling framework for the head-direction system. Under specific conditions, all solutions of the ring network are bounded, and there exists a Lyapunov function that guarantees the stability of the network for any given inputs, which may come from multiple sources in the biological system, including self-motion information for inertially based updating and landmark information for calibration. We focus on the first few terms of the Fourier series of the ring network to explicitly solve for all possible equilibrium states, followed by a stability analysis based on small perturbations. In particular, these equilibrium states include the standard single-peaked activity pattern as well as double-peaked activity pattern, whose existence is unknown but has testable experimental implications. To our surprise, we have also found an asymmetric equilibrium activity profile even when the network connectivity is strictly symmetric. Finally we examine how these different equilibrium solutions depend on the network parameters and obtain the phase diagrams in the parameter space of the ring network.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The unique combination of small size, translucency, and powerful genetic tools makes larval zebrafish a uniquely useful vertebrate system to investigate normal and pathological brain structure and function. While functional connectivity can now be assessed by optical imaging (via fluorescent calcium or voltage reporters) at the whole-brain scale, it remains challenging to systematically determine structural connections and identify connectivity changes during development or disease. To address this, we developed Tracer with Restricted Anterograde Spread (TRAS), a novel vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-based neural circuit labeling approach. TRAS makes use of replication-incompetent VSV (VSVΔG) and a helper virus (lentivirus) to enable anterograde transneuronal spread between efferent axons and their direct postsynaptic targets but restricts further spread to downstream areas. We integrated TRAS with the Z-Brain zebrafish 3D atlas for quantitative connectivity analysis and identified targets of the retinal and habenular efferent projections, in patterns consistent with previous reports. We compared retinofugal connectivity patterns between wild-type and down syndrome cell adhesion molecule-like 1 (dscaml1) mutant zebrafish and revealed differences in topographical distribution. These results demonstrate the utility of TRAS for quantitative structural connectivity analysis that would be valuable for detecting novel efferent targets and mapping connectivity changes underlying neurological or behavioral deficits.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Methamphetamine (meth) can greatly damage the prefrontal cortex of the brain and trigger dysfunction of the cognitive control loop, which triggers not only drug dependence but also emotional disorders. The imbalance between the cognitive and emotional systems will lead to crossmodal emotional deficits. Until now, the negative impact of meth dependence on crossmodal emotional processing has not received attention. Therefore, the present study firstly examined the differences in crossmodal emotional processing between healthy controls and meth dependents (MADs) and then investigated the role of visual- or auditory-leading cues in the promotion of crossmodal emotional processing. Experiment 1 found that MADs made a visual–auditory integration disorder for fearful emotion, which may be related to the defects in information transmission between the auditory and auditory cortex. Experiment 2 found that MADs had a crossmodal disorder pertaining to fear under visual-leading cues, but the fearful sound improved the detection of facial emotions for MADs. Experiment 3 reconfirmed that, for MADs, A-leading cues could induce crossmodal integration immediately more easily than V-leading ones. These findings provided sufficient quantitative indicators and evidences that meth dependence was associated with crossmodal integration disorders, which in turn was associated with auditory-leading cues that enhanced the recognition ability of MADs for complex emotions (all results are available at: https://osf.io/x6rv5/). These results provided a better understanding for individuals using drugs in order to enhance the cognition for the complex crossmodal emotional integration.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are currently no definitive disease‐modifying therapies for traumatic brain injury (TBI). In this study, we present a strong therapeutic candidate for TBI, immunomodulatory nanoparticles (IMPs), which ablate a specific subset of hematogenous monocytes (hMos). We hypothesized that prevention of infiltration of these cells into brain acutely after TBI would attenuate secondary damage and preserve anatomic and neurologic function.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IMPs, composed of US Food and Drug Administration–approved 500nm carboxylated‐poly(lactic‐co‐glycolic) acid, were infused intravenously into wild‐type C57BL/6 mice following 2 different models of experimental TBI, controlled cortical impact (CCI), and closed head injury (CHI).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IMP administration resulted in remarkable preservation of both tissue and neurological function in both CCI and CHI TBI models in mice. After acute treatment, there was a reduction in the number of immune cells infiltrating into the brain, mitigation of the inflammatory status of the infiltrating cells, improved electrophysiologic visual function, improved long‐term motor behavior, reduced edema formation as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging, and reduced lesion volumes on anatomic examination.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our findings suggest that IMPs are a clinically translatable acute intervention for TBI with a well‐defined mechanism of action and beneficial anatomic and physiologic preservation and recovery. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate β‐amyloid and tau depositions using Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) positron emission tomography (PET) and AV1451 tau PET imaging in aging multiple sclerosis (MS) patients.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients with MS (n = 16) and controls (n = 80) matched for age, sex, and &lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt; ε4 status from the population‐based Mayo Clinic Study of Aging who underwent PiB PET imaging were studied. Of these individuals, 12 patients with MS and 60 matching controls also underwent AV1451 tau PET. Cortical PiB and AV1451 standard uptake value ratios (SUVrs) from the entire cortex and previously determined Alzheimer disease (AD) signature regions in the same population were calculated for group comparisons and testing for associations with age.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AD signature PiB SUVr (odds ratio [OR] [95% confidence interval (CI)] = 0.52 [0.27–0.98], &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.044), total cortical PiB SUVr (OR [95% CI] = 0.52 [0.28–0.99], &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.048), and the frequency of abnormal PiB SUVrs (OR [95% CI] = 0.10 [0.01–0.90], &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.040) were lower in MS than controls. Although AD‐signature and total cortical AV1451 SUVrs were not different between the groups, the frequency of abnormal AV1451 SUVrs was higher (OR [95% CI] = 10.65 [1.10–103.35], &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.041) in MS than controls. The association of AD signature PiB SUVr with age was steeper in the controls compared to patients with MS (estimate [95% CI] = −0.14 [−0.023 to −0.006], &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.002). Similarly, the association of total cortical PiB SUVr with age was steeper in the controls compared to patients with MS (estimate [95% CI] = −0.13 [−0.021 to −0.005], &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.002). There was no difference in the association of AV1451 SUVr findings with age between the MS patients and controls.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although both β‐amyloid and tau are biomarkers of cognitive aging and AD, cortical β‐amyloid deposition was lower in MS than age‐matched controls, suggesting that some aspect of MS pathobiology retards the accumulation of β‐amyloid but not the accumulation of tau.

 &lt;p&gt;Quality assessment of diffusion MRI (dMRI) data is essential prior to any analysis, so that appropriate pre-processing can be used to improve data quality and ensure that the presence of MRI artifacts do not affect the results of subsequent image analysis. Manual quality assessment of the data is subjective, possibly error-prone, and infeasible, especially considering the growing number of consortium-like studies, underlining the need for automation of the process. In this paper, we have developed a deep-learning-based automated quality control (QC) tool, QC-Automator, for dMRI data, that can handle a variety of artifacts such as motion, multiband interleaving, ghosting, susceptibility, herringbone, and chemical shifts. QC-Automator uses convolutional neural networks along with transfer learning to train the automated artifact detection on a labeled dataset of ∼332,000 slices of dMRI data, from 155 unique subjects and 5 scanners with different dMRI acquisitions, achieving a 98% accuracy in detecting artifacts. The method is fast and paves the way for efficient and effective artifact detection in large datasets. It is also demonstrated to be replicable on other datasets with different acquisition parameters.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Diffusible ions (Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Cl&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;) are vital for healthy function of all cells, especially brain cells. Unfortunately, the diffusible nature of these ions renders them difficult to study with traditional microscopy in situ within ex vivo brain tissue sections. This mini-review examines the recent progress in the field, using direct elemental mapping techniques to study ion homeostasis during normal brain physiology and pathophysiology, through measurement of ion distribution and concentration in ex vivo brain tissue sections. The mini-review examines the advantages and limitations of specific techniques: proton induced X-ray emission (PIXE), X-ray fluorescence microscopy (XFM), secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), laser-ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS), and the sample preparation requirements to study diffusible ions with these methods.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Animal whole-brain functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) provides a non-invasive window into brain activity. A collection of associated methods aims to replicate observations made in humans and to identify the mechanisms underlying the distributed neuronal activity in the healthy and disordered brain. Animal fMRI studies have developed rapidly over the past years, fueled by the development of resting-state fMRI connectivity and genetically encoded neuromodulatory tools. Yet, comparisons between sites remain hampered by lack of standardization. Recently, we highlighted that mouse resting-state functional connectivity converges across centers, although large discrepancies in sensitivity and specificity remained. Here, we explore past and present trends within the animal fMRI community and highlight critical aspects in study design, data acquisition, and post-processing operations, that may affect the results and influence the comparability between studies. We also suggest practices aimed to promote the adoption of standards within the community and improve between-lab reproducibility. The implementation of standardized animal neuroimaging protocols will facilitate animal population imaging efforts as well as meta-analysis and replication studies, the gold standards in evidence-based science.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Neural processing of sounds in the dorsal and ventral streams of the (human) auditory cortex is optimized for analyzing fine-grained temporal and spectral information, respectively. Here we use a Wilson and Cowan firing-rate modeling framework to simulate spectro-temporal processing of sounds in these auditory streams and to investigate the link between neural population activity and behavioral results of psychoacoustic experiments. The proposed model consisted of two core (A1 and R, representing primary areas) and two belt (Slow and Fast, representing rostral and caudal processing respectively) areas, differing in terms of their spectral and temporal response properties. First, we simulated the responses to amplitude modulated (AM) noise and tones. In agreement with electrophysiological results, we observed an area-dependent transition from a temporal (synchronization) to a rate code when moving from low to high modulation rates. Simulated neural responses in a task of amplitude modulation detection suggested that thresholds derived from population responses in core areas closely resembled those of psychoacoustic experiments in human listeners. For tones, simulated modulation threshold functions were found to be dependent on the carrier frequency. Second, we simulated the responses to complex tones with missing fundamental stimuli and found that synchronization of responses in the Fast area accurately encoded pitch, with the strength of synchronization depending on number and order of harmonic components. Finally, using speech stimuli, we showed that the spectral and temporal structure of the speech was reflected in parallel by the modeled areas. The analyses highlighted that the Slow stream coded with high spectral precision the aspects of the speech signal characterized by slow temporal changes (e.g., prosody), while the Fast stream encoded primarily the faster changes (e.g., phonemes, consonants, temporal pitch). Interestingly, the pitch of a speaker was encoded both spatially (i.e., tonotopically) in Slow area and temporally in Fast area. Overall, performed simulations showed that the model is valuable for generating hypotheses on how the different cortical areas/streams may contribute toward behaviorally relevant aspects of auditory processing. The model can be used in combination with physiological models of neurovascular coupling to generate predictions for human functional MRI experiments.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Recent research in neuroscience indicates the importance of tripartite synapses and gliotransmission mediated by astrocytes in neuronal system modulation. Although the astrocyte and neuronal network functions are interrelated, they are fundamentally different in their signaling patterns and, possibly, the time scales at which they operate. However, the exact nature of gliotransmission and the effect of the tripartite synapse function at the network level are currently elusive. In this paper, we propose a computational model of interactions between an astrocyte network and a neuron network, starting from tripartite synapses and spanning to a joint network level. Our model focuses on a two-dimensional setup emulating a mixed in vitro neuron-astrocyte cell culture. The model depicts astrocyte-released gliotransmitters exerting opposing effects on the neurons: increasing the release probability of the presynaptic neuron while hyperpolarizing the post-synaptic one at a longer time scale. We simulated the joint networks with various levels of astrocyte contributions and neuronal activity levels. Our results indicate that astrocytes prolong the burst duration of neurons, while restricting hyperactivity. Thus, in our model, the effect of astrocytes is homeostatic; the firing rate of the network stabilizes to an intermediate level independently of neuronal base activity. Our computational model highlights the plausible roles of astrocytes in interconnected astrocytic and neuronal networks. Our simulations support recent findings in neurons and astrocytes in vivo and in vitro suggesting that astrocytic networks provide a modulatory role in the bursting of the neuronal network.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Complex environments provide structured yet variable sensory inputs. To best exploit information from these environments, organisms must evolve the ability to anticipate consequences of new stimuli, and act on these predictions. We propose an evolutionary path for neural networks, leading an organism from reactive behavior to simple proactive behavior and from simple proactive behavior to induction-based behavior. Based on earlier in-vitro and in-silico experiments, we define the conditions necessary in a network with spike-timing dependent plasticity for the organism to go from reactive to proactive behavior. Our results support the existence of specific evolutionary steps and four conditions necessary for embodied neural networks to evolve predictive and inductive abilities from an initial reactive strategy.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Microglia (MG) are the first cells to react to the abnormal incoming signals that follow an injury of sensory nerves and play a critical role in the development and maintenance of neuropathic pain, a common sequel of nerve injuries. Here we present population data on cell number, soma size, and length of processes of MG in the caudal division of the spinal trigeminal nucleus (Sp5C) in control mice and at the peak of microgliosis (7 days) following unilateral transection of the infraorbital nerve (IoN). The study is performed combining several bias- and assumption-free imaging and stereological approaches with different immunolabeling procedures, with the objective of tackling some hard problems that often hinder proper execution of MG morphometric studies. Our approach may easily be applied to low-density MG populations, but also works, with limited biases, in territories where MG cell bodies and processes form dense meshworks. In controls, and contralaterally to the deafferented side, MG cell body size and shape and branching pattern matched well the descriptions of “resting” or “surveillant” MG described elsewhere, with only moderate intersubject variability. On the superficial laminae of the deafferented side, however, MG displayed on average larger somata and remarkable diversity in shape. The number of cells and the length of MG processes per mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; increased 5 and 2.5 times, respectively, indicating a net 50% decrease in the mean length of processes per cell. By using specific immunolabeling and cell sorting of vascular macrophages, we found only a negligible fraction of these cells in Sp5C, with no differences between controls and deafferented animals, suggesting that blood-borne monocytes play at most a very limited role in the microgliosis occurring following sensory nerve deafferentation. In sum, here we present reliable morphometric data on MG in control and deafferented trigeminal nuclei using efficient methods that we propose may equally be applied to any morphometric population analysis of these cells under different physiological or pathological conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

This relationship between the gut microbiota and the brain is pivotal for the development of the newborn, which receives its commensal microbiota at birth; dysbiosis may result in altered neurodevelopment. The hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis is actively involved in the stress response but is undeveloped in the newborn. Here, we describe how changes in the commensal microbiota influence the normal development of the HPA axis and review recent findings describing the essential crosstalk between the gut microbiota and the HPA axis and suggesting a role for the maternal and commensal microbiota in the development of the HPA axis and of the stress response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The spillover effect of brand scandals commonly exists, and this effect will damage the image of the company, industry or even country in which the scandal occurred. Most previous studies on the brand scandal spillover effect have mainly focused on the corporate and industry levels. However, with the development of brand internalization and media technology, the spillover effect at the country level is becoming increasingly common. In the current study, we conducted an event-related potentials study to explore the spillover effect of brand scandals on the country level as well as its underlying neural basis. Specifically, we compared consumers’ attitudes toward countries of origin with different stereotypes during different types of brand scandals. When a competence scandal took place in a competence stereotype country, a larger P2 mean amplitude was elicited compared to a warmth stereotype country. When a morality scandal took place in a warmth stereotype country, a larger LPP mean amplitude was induced compared to a competence stereotype country. We explain the current results based on expectancy violations theory. When competence scandals take place in competence stereotype countries, there will be a greater degree of violation of expectations compared with that in warmth stereotype countries, which leads to a negative evaluation of the country of origin. When morality scandals take place in warmth stereotype countries, people had a stronger negative emotional arousal when morality scandals happened in the warmth stereotype country.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Space generally overshadows time in the construction of theories in cognitive neuroscience. In this paper, we pivot from the spatial axes to the temporal, analyzing fMRI image series to reveal structures in time rather than space. To determine affinities among global brain patterns at different times, core concepts in network analysis (derived from graph theory) were applied temporally, as relations among brain images at every time point during an fMRI scanning epoch. To explore the temporal structures observed through this adaptation of network analysis, data from 180 subjects in the Human Connectome Project were examined, during two experimental conditions: passive movie viewing and rest. The temporal brain, like the spatial brain, exhibits a modular structure, where “modules” are intermittent (distributed in time). These temporal entities are here referred to as themes. Short sequences of themes – motifs – were studied in sequences from 4 to 11 s in length. Many motifs repeated at constant intervals, and are therefore rhythmic; rhythms, converted to frequencies, were often harmonic. We speculate that the structure and interaction of these global oscillations underwrites the capacity to experience and navigate a world which is both recognizably stable and noticeably changing at every moment – a temporal world. In its temporal structure, this brain-constituted world resembles music.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Brain computer interfaces (BCI) for the rehabilitation of motor impairments exploit sensorimotor rhythms (SMR) in the electroencephalogram (EEG). However, the neurophysiological processes underpinning the SMR often vary over time and across subjects. Inherent intra- and inter-subject variability causes covariate shift in data distributions that impede the transferability of model parameters amongst sessions/subjects. Transfer learning includes machine learning-based methods to compensate for inter-subject and inter-session (intra-subject) variability manifested in EEG-derived feature distributions as a covariate shift for BCI. Besides transfer learning approaches, recent studies have explored psychological and neurophysiological predictors as well as inter-subject associativity assessment, which may augment transfer learning in EEG-based BCI. Here, we highlight the importance of measuring inter-session/subject performance predictors for generalized BCI frameworks for both normal and motor-impaired people, reducing the necessity for tedious and annoying calibration sessions and BCI training.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The resting state fMRI time series appears to have cyclic patterns, which indicates presence of cyclic interactions between different brain regions. Such interactions are not easily captured by pre-established resting state functional connectivity methods including zero-lag correlation, lagged correlation, and dynamic time warping distance. These methods formulate the functional interaction between different brain regions as similar temporal patterns within the time series. To use information related to temporal ordering, cyclicity analysis has been introduced to capture pairwise interactions between multiple time series. In this study, we compared the efficacy of cyclicity analysis with aforementioned similarity-based techniques in representing individual-level and group-level information. Additionally, we investigated how filtering and global signal regression interacted with these techniques. We obtained and analyzed fMRI data from patients with tinnitus and neurotypical controls at two different days, a week apart. For both patient and control groups, we found that the features generated by cyclicity and correlation (zero-lag and lagged) analyses were more reliable than the features generated by dynamic time warping distance in identifying individuals across visits. The reliability of all features, except those generated by dynamic time warping, improved as the global signal was regressed. Nevertheless, removing fluctuations &amp;gt;0.1 Hz deteriorated the reliability of all features. These observations underscore the importance of choosing appropriate preprocessing steps while evaluating different analytical methods in describing resting state functional interactivity. Further, using different machine learning techniques including support vector machines, discriminant analyses, and convolutional neural networks, our results revealed that the manifestation of the group-level information within all features was not sufficient enough to dissociate tinnitus patients from controls with high sensitivity and specificity. This necessitates further investigation regarding the representation of group-level information within different features to better identify tinnitus-related alternation in the functional organization of the brain. Our study adds to the growing body of research on developing diagnostic tools to identify neurological disorders, such as tinnitus, using resting state fMRI data.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
