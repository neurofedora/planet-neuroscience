 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drug resistant epilepsy causes great danger in clinical and still lacks effective treatments.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, we used multifaceted approaches combining electrophysiology, optogenetics and chemogenetics in a classic phenytoin resistant epilepsy model to reveal the key target of subicular pyramidal neurons in phenytoin resistance.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;In vivo&lt;/i&gt; neural recording showed that the firing rate of pyramidal neurons in the subiculum, but not other hippocampal subregions, could not be inhibited by phenytoin in phenytoin resistant rats. Selective inhibition of subicular pyramidal neurons by optogenetics or chemogenetics reversed phenytoin resistance, while selective activation of subicular pyramidal neurons induced phenytoin resistance. Moreover, long‐term low frequency stimulation at the subiculum, which is clinically feasible, significantly inhibited the subicular pyramidal neurons and reversed phenytoin resistance. Further, &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; electrophysiology revealed that off‐target of phenytoin on sodium channels of subicular pyramidal neurons were involved in the phenytoin resistance, and clinical neuroimage data suggested the volume of the subiculum in drug‐resistant patients was related with the usage of sodium channel inhibitors.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These results highlight that the subicular pyramidal neurons may be a key “switch” control of drug resistant epilepsy and represent a new potential target for precise treatments.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Mechanical sensitization is one of the most difficult clinical pain problems to treat. However, the molecular and genetic bases of mechanical nociception are unclear. Here we develop a &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; model of mechanical nociception to investigate the ion channels and signaling pathways that regulate mechanical nociception. We fabricated von Frey filaments that span the subthreshold to high noxious range for &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; larvae. Using these, we discovered that pressure (force/area), rather than force per se, is the main determinant of aversive rolling responses to noxious mechanical stimuli. We demonstrated that the RTK PDGF/VEGF receptor (Pvr) and its ligands (Pvfs 2 and 3) are required for mechanical nociception and normal dendritic branching. Pvr is expressed and functions in class IV sensory neurons, whereas Pvf2 and Pvf3 are produced by multiple tissues. Constitutive overexpression of Pvr and its ligands or inducible overexpression of Pvr led to mechanical hypersensitivity that could be partially separated from morphological effects. Genetic analyses revealed that the Piezo and Pain ion channels are required for mechanical hypersensitivity observed upon ectopic activation of Pvr signaling. PDGF, but not VEGF, peptides caused mechanical hypersensitivity in rats. Pharmacological inhibition of VEGF receptor Type 2 (VEGFR-2) signaling attenuated mechanical nociception in rats, suggesting a conserved role for PDGF and VEGFR-2 signaling in regulating mechanical nociception. VEGFR-2 inhibition also attenuated morphine analgesic tolerance in rats. Our results reveal that a conserved RTK signaling pathway regulates baseline mechanical nociception in flies and rats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Hypersensitivity to touch is poorly understood and extremely difficult to treat. Using a refined &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; model of mechanical nociception, we discovered a conserved VEGF-related receptor tyrosine kinase signaling pathway that regulates mechanical nociception in flies. Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of VEGF receptor Type 2 signaling in rats causes analgesia and blocks opioid tolerance. We have thus established a robust, genetically tractable system for the rapid identification and functional analysis of conserved genes underlying mechanical pain sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/30/6001?rss=1"/>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Cortical spreading depression (CSD) is a wave of neuronal depolarization thought to underlie migraine aura. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a potent vasodilator involved in migraine pathophysiology. Evidence for functional connectivity between CSD and CGRP has triggered scientific interest in the possibility that CGRP antagonism may disrupt vascular responses to CSD and the ensuing plasma protein extravasation (PPE). Using imaging tools that allow us to generate continuous, live, high-resolution views of spatial and temporal changes that affect arteries and veins in the dura and pia, we determined the extent to which CGRP contributes to the induction of arterial dilatation or PPE by CSD in female rats, and how these events are affected by the anti-CGRP monoclonal antibody (anti-CGRP-mAb) fremanezumab. We found that the CSD-induced brief dilatation and prolonged constriction of pial arteries, prolonged dilatation of dural arteries and PPE are all unaffected by fremanezumab, whereas the brief constriction and prolonged dilatation of pial veins are affected. In comparison, although CGRP infusion gave rise to the expected dilatation of dural arteries, which was effectively blocked by fremanezumab, it did not induce dilatation in pial arteries, pial veins, or dural veins. It also failed to induce PPE. Regardless of whether the nociceptors become active before or after the induction of arterial dilatation or PPE by CSD, the inability of fremanezumab to prevent them suggests that these events are not mediated by CGRP, a conclusion with important implications for our understanding of the mechanism of action of anti-CGRP-mAbs in migraine prevention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The current study identifies fundamental differences between two commonly used models of migraine, CSD induction and systemic CGRP infusion. It raises the possibility that conclusions drawn from one model may not be true or relevant to the other. It sharpens the need to accept the view that there is more than one truth to migraine pathophysiology and that it is unlikely that one theory will explain all types of migraine headache or the mechanisms of action of drugs that prevent it. Regarding the latter, it is concluded that not all vascular responses in the meninges are born alike and, consequently, that drugs that prevent vascular dilatation through different molecular pathways may have different therapeutic outcomes in different types of migraine.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Failure of anti-amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) therapies against Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by high amounts of the peptide in the brain, raised the question of the physiological role of Aβ released at low concentrations in the healthy brain. To address this question, we studied the presynaptic and postsynaptic mechanisms underlying the neuromodulatory action of picomolar amounts of oligomeric Aβ&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt; (oAβ&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt;) on synaptic glutamatergic function in male and female mice. We found that 200 pm oAβ&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt; induces an increase of frequency of miniature EPSCs and a decrease of paired pulse facilitation, associated with an increase in docked vesicle number, indicating that it augments neurotransmitter release at presynaptic level. oAβ&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt; also produced postsynaptic changes as shown by an increased length of postsynaptic density, accompanied by an increased expression of plasticity-related proteins such as cAMP-responsive element binding protein phosphorylated at Ser133, calcium-calmodulin-dependent kinase II phosphorylated at Thr286, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor, suggesting a role for Aβ in synaptic tagging. These changes resulted in the conversion of early into late long-term potentiation through the nitric oxide/cGMP/protein kinase G intracellular cascade consistent with a cGMP-dependent switch from short- to long-term memory observed &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; after intrahippocampal administration of picomolar amounts of oAβ&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt;. These effects were present upon extracellular but not intracellular application of the peptide and involved α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. These observations clarified the physiological role of oAβ&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt; in synaptic function and memory formation providing solid fundamentals for investigating the pathological effects of high Aβ levels in the AD brains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; High levels of oligomeric amyloid-β&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt; (oAβ&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt;) induce synaptic dysfunction leading to memory impairment in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, at picomolar concentrations, the peptide is needed to ensure long-term potentiation (LTP) and memory. Here, we show that extracellular 200 pm oAβ&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations increase neurotransmitter release, number of docked vesicles, postsynaptic density length, and expression of plasticity-related proteins leading to the conversion of early LTP into late LTP and of short-term memory into long-term memory. These effects require α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and are mediated through the nitric oxide/cGMP/protein kinase G pathway. The knowledge of Aβ function in the healthy brain might be useful to understand the causes leading to its increase and detrimental effect in AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Attention can be subdivided into several components, including alertness and spatial attention. It is believed that the behavioral benefits of attention, such as increased accuracy and faster reaction times, are generated by an increase in neural activity and a decrease in neural variability, which enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of task-relevant neural populations. However, empirical evidence regarding attention-related changes in neural variability in humans is extremely rare. Here we used EEG to demonstrate that trial-by-trial neural variability was reduced by visual cues that modulated alertness and spatial attention. Reductions in neural variability were specific to the visual system and larger in the contralateral hemisphere of the attended visual field. Subjects with higher initial levels of neural variability and larger decreases in variability exhibited greater behavioral benefits from attentional cues. These findings demonstrate that both alertness and spatial attention modulate neural variability and highlight the importance of reducing/quenching neural variability for attaining the behavioral benefits of attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Attention is thought to improve perception by increasing the signal-to-noise ratio of the neuronal populations that encode the attended stimulus. Signal-to-noise ratio can be enhanced by increasing neural response (signal) and/or by reducing neural variability (noise). The ability of attention to increase neural responses has been studied extensively, but the effects of attention on neural variability have rarely been examined in humans. Here, we demonstrate that modulating different components of attention, including alertness and spatial attention, reduces neural variability in humans. Furthermore, we show that subjects with larger reductions in neural variability exhibit greater behavioral benefits from attention. These results demonstrate that reduction of neural variability is a fundamental feature of attentional processes in humans with clear behavioral importance.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/30/5966?rss=1"/>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;The middle temporal gyrus (MTG) has been shown to be recruited during the processing of words, but also during the observation of actions. Here we investigated how information related to words and gestures is organized along the MTG. To this aim, we measured the BOLD response in the MTG to video clips of gestures and spoken words in 17 healthy human adults (male and female). Gestures consisted of videos of an actress performing object-use pantomimes (iconic representations of object-directed actions; e.g., playing guitar), emblems (conventional gestures, e.g., thumb up), and meaningless gestures. Word stimuli (verbs, nouns) consisted of video clips of the same actress pronouncing words. We found a stronger response to meaningful compared with meaningless gestures along the whole left and large portions of the right MTG. Importantly, we observed a gradient, with posterior regions responding more strongly to gestures (pantomimes and emblems) than words and anterior regions showing a stronger response to words than gestures. In an intermediate region in the left hemisphere, the response was significantly higher to words and emblems (i.e., items with a greater arbitrariness of the sign-to-meaning mapping) than to pantomimes. These results show that the large-scale organization of information in the MTG is driven by the input modality and may also reflect the arbitrariness of the relationship between sign and meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Here we investigated the organizing principle of information in the middle temporal gyrus, taking into consideration the input-modality and the arbitrariness of the relationship between a sign and its meaning. We compared the middle temporal gyrus response during the processing of pantomimes, emblems, and spoken words. We found that posterior regions responded more strongly to pantomimes and emblems than to words, whereas anterior regions responded more strongly to words than to pantomimes and emblems. In an intermediate region, only in the left hemisphere, words and emblems evoked a stronger response than pantomimes. Our results identify two organizing principles of neural representation: the modality of communication (gestural or verbal) and the (arbitrariness of the) relationship between sign and meanings.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/30/5949?rss=1"/>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Diacylglycerol lipase-α (DAGL-α), the principal biosynthetic enzyme of the endogenous cannabinoid 2-arachidonylglycerol (2-AG) on neurons, plays a key role in CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptor-mediated synaptic plasticity and hippocampal neurogenesis, but its contribution to global hippocampal-mediated processes remains unknown. Thus, the present study examines the role that DAGL-α plays on LTP in hippocampus, as well as in hippocampal-dependent spatial learning and memory tasks, and on the production of endocannabinoid and related lipids through the use of complementary pharmacologic and genetic approaches to disrupt this enzyme in male mice. Here we show that DAGL-α gene deletion or pharmacological inhibition disrupts LTP in CA1 of the hippocampus but elicits varying magnitudes of behavioral learning and memory deficits in mice. In particular, &lt;i&gt;DAGL&lt;/i&gt;-α&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice display profound impairments in the Object Location assay and Morris Water Maze (MWM) acquisition engaging in nonspatial search strategies. In contrast, WT mice administered the DAGL-α inhibitor DO34 show delays in MWM acquisition and reversal learning, but no deficits in expression, extinction, forgetting, or perseveration processes in this task, as well as no impairment in Object Location. The deficits in synaptic plasticity and MWM performance occur in concert with decreased 2-AG and its major lipid metabolite (arachidonic acid), but increases of a 2-AG diacylglycerol precursor in hippocampus, PFC, striatum, and cerebellum. These novel behavioral and electrophysiological results implicate a direct and perhaps selective role of DAGL-α in the integration of new spatial information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Here we show that genetic deletion or pharmacologic inhibition of diacylglycerol lipase-α (DAGL-α) impairs hippocampal CA1 LTP, differentially disrupts spatial learning and memory performance in Morris water maze (MWM) and Object Location tasks, and alters brain levels of endocannabinoids and related lipids. Whereas &lt;i&gt;DAGL&lt;/i&gt;-α&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice exhibit profound phenotypic spatial memory deficits, a DAGL inhibitor selectively impairs the integration of new information in MWM acquisition and reversal tasks, but not memory processes of expression, extinction, forgetting, or perseveration, and does not affect performance in the Objection Location task. The findings that constitutive or short-term DAGL-α disruption impairs learning and memory at electrophysiological and selective &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; levels implicate this enzyme as playing a key role in the integration of new spatial information.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Epidemiological studies indicate that insulin resistance (IR), a hallmark of type 2 diabetes, is associated with an increased risk of major depression. Here, we demonstrated that male mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) exhibited peripheral metabolic impairments reminiscent of IR accompanied by elevated circulating levels of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), whereas both parameters were normalized by chronic treatment with metformin (Met). Given the role of BCAAs in the regulation of tryptophan influx into the brain, we then explored the activity of the serotonin (5-HT) system. Our results indicated that HFD-fed mice displayed impairment in the electrical activity of dorsal raphe 5-HT neurons, attenuated hippocampal extracellular 5-HT concentrations and anxiety, one of the most visible and early symptoms of depression. On the contrary, Met stimulated 5-HT neurons excitability and 5-HT neurotransmission while hindering HFD-induced anxiety. Met also promoted antidepressant-like activities as observed with fluoxetine. In light of these data, we designed a modified HFD in which BCAA dietary supply was reduced by half. Deficiency in BCAAs failed to reverse HFD-induced metabolic impairments while producing antidepressant-like activity and enhancing the behavioral response to fluoxetine. Our results suggest that Met may act by decreasing circulating BCAAs levels to favor serotonergic neurotransmission in the hippocampus and promote antidepressant-like effects in mice fed an HFD. These findings also lead us to envision that a diet poor in BCAAs, provided either alone or as add-on therapy to conventional antidepressant drugs, could help to relieve depressive symptoms in patients with metabolic comorbidities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Insulin resistance in humans is associated with increased risk of anxiodepressive disorders. Such a relationship has been also found in rodents fed a high-fat diet (HFD). To determine whether insulin-sensitizing strategies induce anxiolytic- and/or antidepressant-like activities and to investigate the underlying mechanisms, we tested the effects of metformin, an oral antidiabetic drug, in mice fed an HFD. Metformin reduced levels of circulating branched-chain amino acids, which regulate tryptophan uptake within the brain. Moreover, metformin increased hippocampal serotonergic neurotransmission while promoting anxiolytic- and antidepressant-like effects. Moreover, a diet poor in these amino acids produced similar beneficial behavioral property. Collectively, these results suggest that metformin could be used as add-on therapy to a conventional antidepressant for the comorbidity between metabolic and mental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The human PFC has been associated more with meta-perceptual as opposed to meta-memory decisions from correlational neuroimaging investigations. Recently, metacognitive abilities have also been shown to be causally dependent upon anterior and dorsal PFC in nonhuman primate lesion studies. Two studies, using postdecision wagering paradigms and reversible inactivation, challenged this meta-perceptual versus meta-memory notion and showed that dorsal and anterior prefrontal areas are associated with metamemory for experienced objects and awareness of ignorance, respectively. Causal investigations are important but scarce; nothing is known, for example, about the causal contributions of prefrontal subregions to spatial metamemory. Here, we investigated the effects of dorsal versus ventral PFC lesions on two-alternative forced-choice spatial discrimination tasks in male macaque monkeys. Importantly, we were rigorous in approach and applied three independent but complementary indices used to quantify individual animals' metacognitive ability (&quot;Type II sensitivity&quot;) by two variants of &lt;i&gt;meta-d'/d'&lt;/i&gt; and phi coefficient (). Our results were consistent across indices: while neither lesions to superior dorsolateral PFC nor orbitofrontal cortex impaired spatial recognition performance, only monkeys with superior dorsolateral PFC lesions were impaired in meta-accuracy. Together with the observation that the same orbitofrontal cortex lesioned monkeys were impaired in updating rule value in a Wisconsin Card Sorting Test analog, we therefore document a functional double-dissociation between these two PFC regions. Our study presents important causal evidence that other dimensions, namely, domain-specific processing (e.g., spatial vs nonspatial metamemory), also need considerations in understanding the functional specialization in the neural underpinnings of introspection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; This study demonstrates macaque monkeys' metacognitive capability of introspecting its own memory success is causally dependent on intact superior dorsolateral prefrontal cortices but not the orbitofrontal cortices. Combining neurosurgical techniques on monkeys and state-of-the-art measures of metacognition, we affirm a critical role of the PFC in supporting spatial meta-recognition memory and delineate functional specificity within PFC for distinct elements of metacognition.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The speed of motor reaction to an external stimulus varies substantially between individuals and is slowed in aging. However, the neuroanatomical origins of interindividual variability in reaction time (RT) remain unclear. Here, we combined a cognitive model of RT and a biophysical compartment model of diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) to characterize the relationship between RT and microstructure of the corticospinal tract (CST) and the optic radiation (OR), the primary motor output and visual input pathways associated with visual-motor responses. We fitted an accumulator model of RT to 46 female human participants' behavioral performance in a simple reaction time task. The non-decision time parameter (&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;er&lt;/sub&gt;) derived from the model was used to account for the latencies of stimulus encoding and action initiation. From multi-shell DWI data, we quantified tissue microstructure of the CST and OR with the neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) model as well as the conventional diffusion tensor imaging model. Using novel skeletonization and segmentation approaches, we showed that DWI-based microstructure metrics varied substantially along CST and OR. The &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;er&lt;/sub&gt; of individual participants was negatively correlated with the NODDI measure of the neurite density in the bilateral superior CST. Further, we found no significant correlation between the microstructural measures and mean RT. Thus, our findings suggest a link between interindividual differences in sensorimotor speed and selective microstructural properties in white-matter tracts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; How does our brain structure contribute to our speed to react? Here, we provided anatomically specific evidence that interindividual differences in response speed is associated with white-matter microstructure. Using a cognitive model of reaction time (RT), we estimated the non-decision time, as an index of the latencies of stimulus encoding and action initiation, during a simple reaction time task. Using an advanced microstructural model for diffusion MRI, we estimated the tissue properties and their variations along the corticospinal tract and optic radiation. We found significant location-specific correlations between the microstructural measures and the model-derived parameter of non-decision time but not mean RT. These results highlight the neuroanatomical signature of interindividual variability in response speed along the sensorimotor pathways.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The striatum comprises of multiple functional territories involved with multilevel control of behavior. Disinhibition of different functional territories leads to territory-specific hyperkinetic and hyperbehavioral symptoms. The ventromedial striatum, including the nucleus accumbens (NAc) core, is typically associated with limbic input but was historically linked to high-level motor control. In this study, performed in female Long–Evans rats, we show that the NAc core directly controls motor behavior on multiple timescales. On the macro-scale, following NAc disinhibition, the animals manifested prolonged hyperactivity, expressed as excessive normal behavior, whereas on the micro-scale multiple behavior transitions occurred, generating short movement segments. The underlying striatal network displayed population-based local field potential transient deflections (LFP spikes) whose rate determined the magnitude of the hyperactivity and whose timing corresponded to unitary behavioral transition events. Individual striatal neurons preserved normal baseline activity and network interactions following the disinhibition, maintaining the normal encoding of behavioral primitives and forming a sparse link between the LFP spikes and single neuron activity. Disinhibition of this classically limbic territory leads to profound motor changes resembling hyperactivity and attention deficit. These behavioral and neuronal results highlight the direct interplay on multiple timescales between different striatal territories during normal and pathological conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is a key part of the striatal limbic territory. In the current study we show that this classically limbic area directly controls motor behavior on multiple timescales. Focal disinhibition of the NAc core in freely behaving rats led to macro-scale hyperactivity and micro-scale behavioral transitions, symptoms typically associated with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. The behavioral changes were encoded by the striatal LFP signal and single-unit spiking activity in line with the neuronal changes observed during tic expression following disinhibition of the striatal motor territory. These results point to the need to extend the existing parallel functional pathway concept of basal ganglia function to include the study of limbic-motor cross-territory interactions in both health and disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Rodents are the most commonly studied model system in neuroscience, but surprisingly few studies investigate the natural sensory stimuli that rodent nervous systems evolved to interpret. Even fewer studies examine neural responses to these natural stimuli. Decades of research have investigated the rat vibrissal (whisker) system in the context of direct touch and tactile stimulation, but recent work has shown that rats also use their whiskers to help detect and localize airflow. The present study investigates the neural basis for this ability as dictated by the mechanical response of whiskers to airflow. Mechanical experiments show that a whisker's vibration magnitude depends on airspeed and the intrinsic shape of the whisker. Surprisingly, the direction of the whisker's vibration changes as a function of airflow speed: vibrations transition from parallel to perpendicular with respect to the airflow as airspeed increases. Recordings from primary sensory trigeminal ganglion neurons show that these neurons exhibit responses consistent with those that would be predicted from direct touch. Trigeminal neuron firing rate increases with airspeed, is modulated by the orientation of the whisker relative to the airflow, and is influenced by the whisker's resonant frequencies. We develop a simple model to describe how a population of neurons could leverage mechanical relationships to decode both airspeed and direction. These results open new avenues for studying vibrissotactile regions of the brain in the context of evolutionarily important airflow-sensing behaviors and olfactory search. Although this study used only female rats, all results are expected to generalize to male rats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The rodent vibrissal (whisker) system has been studied for decades in the context of direct tactile sensation, but recent work has indicated that rats also use whiskers to help localize airflow. Neural circuits in somatosensory regions of the rodent brain thus likely evolved in part to process airflow information. This study investigates the whiskers' mechanical response to airflow and the associated neural response. Airspeed affects the magnitude of whisker vibration and the response magnitude of whisker-sensitive primary sensory neurons in the trigeminal ganglion. Surprisingly, the direction of vibration and the associated directionally dependent neural response changes with airspeed. These findings suggest a population code for airflow speed and direction and open new avenues for studying vibrissotactile regions of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Columnar structure is a basic unit of the brain, but the mechanism underlying its development remains largely unknown. The medulla, the largest ganglion of the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; visual center, provides a unique opportunity to reveal the mechanisms of 3D organization of the columns. In this study, using N-cadherin (Ncad) as a marker, we reveal the donut-like columnar structures along the 2D layer in the larval medulla that evolves to form three distinct layers in pupal development. Column formation is initiated by three core neurons, R8, R7, and Mi1, which establish distinct concentric domains within a column. We demonstrate that Ncad-dependent relative adhesiveness of the core columnar neurons regulates their relative location within a column along a 2D layer in the larval medulla according to the differential adhesion hypothesis. We also propose the presence of mutual interactions among the three layers during formation of the 3D structures of the medulla columns.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Neural circuit development involves the coordinated growth and guidance of axons. During this process, axons encounter many different cues, but how these cues are integrated and translated into growth is poorly understood. In this study, we report that receptor signaling does not follow a linear path but changes dependent on developmental stage and coreceptors involved. Using developing chicken embryos of both sexes, our data show that calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR), a G-protein-coupled receptor important for regulating calcium homeostasis, regulates neurite growth in two distinct ways. First, when signaling in isolation, CaSR promotes growth through the PI3-kinase-Akt pathway. At later developmental stages, CaSR enhances tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB)/BDNF-mediated neurite growth. This enhancement is facilitated through a switch in the signaling cascade downstream of CaSR (i.e., from the PI3-kinase-Akt pathway to activation of GSK3α Tyr279). TrkB and CaSR colocalize within late endosomes, cotraffic and coactivate GSK3, which serves as a shared signaling node for both receptors. Our study provides evidence that two unrelated receptors can integrate their individual signaling cascades toward a nonadditive effect and thus control neurite growth during development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; This work highlights the effect of receptor coactivation and signal integration in a developmental setting. During embryonic development, neurites grow toward their targets guided by cues in the extracellular environment. These cues are sensed by receptors at the surface that trigger intracellular signaling events modulating the cytoskeleton. Emerging evidence suggests that the effects of guidance cues are diversified, therefore expanding the number of responses. Here, we show that two unrelated receptors can change the downstream signaling cascade and regulate neuronal growth through a shared signaling node. In addition to unraveling a novel signaling pathway in neurite growth, this research stresses the importance of receptor coactivation and signal integration during development of the nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

In this work, we present 3 patients with SMA type 0 who survived &amp;gt;1 year and presented diffuse and progressive brain abnormalities on magnetic resonance imaging, which are not usually seen in patients with SMA.

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Plasticity after stroke is a complex phenomenon initiated by the functional
reorganization of the brain, especially in the perilesional tissue. At
macroscales, the reestablishment of segregation within the affected hemisphere
and interhemispheric integration has been extensively documented in the
reconfiguration of brain networks. However, the local connection mechanisms
generating such global network changes are still largely unknown as well as
their potential to better predict the outcome of patients. To address this
question, time must be considered as a formal variable of the problem and not
just a simple repeated observation. Here, we hypothesize that the temporal
formation of basic connection blocks such as intermodule edges and intramodule
triangles would be sufficient to determine the large-scale brain reorganization
after stroke. To test our hypothesis, we adopted a statistical approach based
on temporal exponential random graph models (tERGMs). First, we validated the
overall performance on synthetic time-varying networks simulating the
reconfiguration process after stroke. Then, using longitudinal functional
connectivity measurements of resting-state brain activity, we showed that both
the formation of triangles within the affected hemisphere and interhemispheric
links are sufficient to reproduce the longitudinal brain network changes from 2
weeks to 1 year after the stroke. Finally, we showed that these temporal
connection mechanisms are over-expressed in the subacute phase as compared to
healthy controls and predicted the chronic language and visual outcome
respectively in patients with subcortical and cortical lesions, whereas static
approaches failed to do so. Our results indicate the importance of considering
time-varying connection properties when modeling dynamic complex systems and
provide fresh insights into the network mechanisms of stroke recovery.

 &lt;p&gt;The human connectome has become the very frequent subject of study of
brain-scientists, psychologists, and imaging experts in the last decade. With
diffusion magnetic resonance imaging techniques, unified with advanced data
processing algorithms, today we are able to compute braingraphs with several
hundred, anatomically identified nodes and thousands of edges, corresponding to
the anatomical connections of the brain. The analysis of these graphs without
refined mathematical tools is hopeless. These tools need to address the high
error rate of the MRI processing workflow, and need to find structural causes
or at least correlations of psychological properties and cerebral connections.
Until now, structural connectomics was only rarely able identifying such causes
or correlations. In the present work, we study the frequent neighbor sets of
the most deeply investigated brain area, the hippocampus. By applying the
Frequent Network Neighborhood mapping method, we identified frequent
neighbor-sets of the hippocampus, which may influence numerous psychological
parameters, including intelligence-related ones. We have found neighbor sets,
which have significantly higher frequency in subjects with high-scored Penn
Matrix tests, and with low-scored Penn Word Memory tests. Our study utilizes
the braingraphs, computed from the imaging data of the Human Connectome
Project's 414 subjects, each with 463 anatomically identified nodes.

 &lt;p&gt;Stroke-induced disturbances of large-scale cortical networks are known to be
associated with the extent of motor deficits. We argue that identifying brain
networks representative of motor behavior in the resting brain would provide
significant insights for current neurorehabilitation approaches. Particularly,
we aim to investigate the global configuration of brain rhythms and their
relation to motor skill, instead of learning performance as broadly studied. We
empirically approach this problem by conducting a three-dimensional physical
space visuomotor learning experiment during electroencephalographic (EEG) data
recordings with thirty-seven healthy participants. We demonstrate that
across-subjects variations in average movement smoothness as the quantified
measure of subjects' motor skills can be predicted from the global
configuration of resting-state EEG alpha-rhythms (8-14 Hz) recorded prior to
the experiment. Importantly, this neural signature of motor skill was found to
be orthogonal to (independent of) task -- as well as to learning-related
changes in alpha-rhythms, which we interpret as an organizing principle of the
brain. We argue that disturbances of such configurations in the brain may
contribute to motor deficits in stroke, and that reconfiguring stroke patients'
brain rhythms by neurofeedback may enhance post-stroke neurorehabilitation.

 &lt;p&gt;The theory of communication through coherence (CTC) proposes that brain
oscillations reflect changes in the excitability of neurons, and therefore the
successful communication between two oscillating neural populations depends not
only on the strength of the signal emitted but also on the relative phases
between them. More precisely, effective communication occurs when the emitting
and receiving populations are properly phase locked so the inputs sent by the
emitting population arrive at the phases of maximal excitability of the
receiving population. To study this setting, we consider a population rate
model consisting of excitatory and inhibitory cells modelling the receiving
population, and we perturb it with a time-dependent periodic function modelling
the input from the emitting population. We consider the stroboscopic map for
this system and compute numerically the fixed and periodic points of this map
and their bifurcations as the amplitude and the frequency of the perturbation
are varied. From the bifurcation diagram, we identify the phase-locked states
as well as different regions of bistability. We explore carefully the dynamics
emphasizing its implications for the CTC theory. In particular, we study how
the input gain depends on the timing between the input and the inhibitory
action of the receiving population. Our results show that naturally an optimal
phase locking for CTC emerges, and provide a mechanism by which the receiving
population can implement selective communication. Moreover, the presence of
bistable regions, suggests a mechanism by which different communication regimes
between brain areas can be established without changing the structure of the
network

 &lt;p&gt;This paper suggests a statistical framework for describing the relations
between the physical and conceptual entities of a brain-like model. In
particular, features and concept instances are put into context. This may help
with understanding or implementing a similar model. The paper suggests that
features are in fact the wiring. With this idea, the actual length of the
connection is important, because it is related to firing rates and neuron
synchronization. The paper then suggests that concepts are neuron groups that
link features and concept instances are the signals from those groups.
Therefore, features become the static framework of the interconnected neural
system and concepts are combinations of these, as determined by the external
stimulus and the neural synaptic strengths. Along with this statistical model,
it is possible to propose a simplified design for a neuron, based on an action
potential and variable output signal. A strong comparison with Hebbian theory
is then proposed, with some test results to support the theory.

 Top-down, feedback projections account for a large portion of all connections between neurons in the thalamocortical system, yet their precise role remains the subject of much discussion. A large number of studies has focused on investigating how sensory information is transformed across hierarchically-distributed processing stages in a feedforward fashion, and computational models have shown that purely feedforward artificial neural networks can even outperform humans in pattern classification tasks. What is then the functional role of feedback connections? Several key roles have been identified, ranging from attentional modulation to, crucially, conscious perception. Specifically, most of the major theories on consciousness postulate that feedback connections would play an essential role in enabling sensory information to be consciously perceived. Consequently, it follows that their efficacy in modulating target regions should drastically decrease in nonconscious brain states (non-REM sleep, anesthesia) compared to conscious ones (wakefulness), and also in instances when a given sensory stimulus is not perceived compared to when it is. Until recently, however, this prediction could only be tested with correlative experiments, due to the lack of techniques to selectively manipulate and measure the activity of feedback pathways. In this paper we will review the most recent literature on the functions of feedback connections across brain states and based on the presence or absence of perception. We will focus on experiments studying mismatch negativity, a phenomenon which has been hypothesized to rely on top-down modulation but which persists during nonconscious states. While feedback modulation is generally dampened in nonconscious states and enhanced when perception occurs, there are clear deviations from this rule. As we will discuss, this may pose a challenge to most theories of consciousness, and possibly require a change in how the level of consciousness in supposedly nonconscious states is assessed.</content>

 The numbers and strengths of synapses in the brain change throughout development, and even into adulthood, as synaptic inputs are added, eliminated, and refined in response to ongoing neural activity. A number of experimental techniques can assess these changes, including single- cell electrophysiological recording which offers measurements of synaptic inputs with high temporal resolution. Coupled with electrical stimulation, photoactivatable opsins, and caged compounds, to facilitate fine spatiotemporal control over release of neurotransmitters, electrophysiological recordings allow for precise dissection of presynaptic and postsynaptic mechanisms of action. Here, we discuss the strengths and pitfalls of various techniques commonly used to analyze synapses, including miniature excitatory/inhibitory postsynaptic currents, evoked release, and optogenetic stimulation. Together, these techniques can provide multiple lines of convergent evidence to generate meaningful insight into the emergence of circuit connectivity and maturation. A full understanding of potential caveats and alternative explanations for findings is essential to avoid data misinterpretation.</content>

 To evaluate the contribution of the DNA methylation and DNA demethylation pathways in retinal development, we studied DNA methylation in retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) and retinal neurons using a combination of whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) data obtained in our study and WGBS data collected from previous studies. The data was analyzed using Hidden Markov Model- and change point-based methods to identify methylome states in different segments of the studied genomes following genome annotation. We found that promoters of rod and cone phototransduction genes and rod photoreceptor genes, but not genes required for the development and function of other retinal phenotypes, were highly methylated in DNA isolated from human and murine fetal retinas (which mostly contain RPCs) and postnatal murine RPCs. While these highly methylated genomic regions were inherited by non-photoreceptor phenotypes during RPC differentiation, the methylation of these promoters was significantly reduced during RPC differentiation into photoreceptors and accompanied by increased expression of these genes. Our analysis of DNA methylation during embryogenesis revealed low methylation levels in genomic regions containing photoreceptor genes at the inner cell mass stage, but a sharp increase in methylation at the epiblast stage, which remained the same later on (except for DNA demethylation in photoreceptors). Thus, our data suggest that the DNA demethylation pathway is required for photoreceptor phenotypes in the developing retina. Meanwhile, the role of the DNA methylation and DNA demethylation pathways during RPC differentiation into non-photoreceptor retinal phenotypes might be less important.</content>

 Status epilepticus (SE, a prolonged seizure activity) leads to reactive astrogliosis and astroglial apoptosis in the regional specific manners, independent of hemodynamics. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP1) activity is relevant to these distinct astroglial responses. Since various regulatory signaling molecules beyond PARP1 activity may be involved in the distinct astroglial response to SE, it is noteworthy to explore the roles of protein kinases in PARP1-mediated reactive astrogliosis and astroglial apoptosis following SE, albeit at a lesser extent. In the present study, inhibitions of protein kinase C (PKC), AKT and extracellular signal-related kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2), but not calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), attenuated CA1 reactive astrogliosis accompanied by reducing PARP1 activity following SE, respectively. However, inhibition of AKT and ERK1/2 deteriorated SE-induced dentate astroglial loss concomitant with the diminished PARP1 activity. Following SE, PKC- and AKT inhibitors diminished phosphoprotein enriched in astrocytes of 15 kDa (PEA15)-S104 and -S116 phosphorylations in CA1 astrocytes, but not in dentate astrocytes, respectively. Inhibitors of PKC, AKT and ERK1/2 also abrogated SE-induced nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)-S311 and -S468 phosphorylations in CA1 astrocytes. In contrast, both AKT and ERK1/2 inhibitors enhanced NF-κB-S468 phosphorylation in dentate astrocytes. Furthermore, PARP1 inhibitor aggravated dentate astroglial loss following SE. AKT inhibition deteriorated dentate astroglial loss and led to CA1 astroglial apoptosis following SE, which were ameliorated by AKT activation. These findings suggest that activities of PARP1, PEA15 and NF-κB may be distinctly regulated by PKC, AKT and ERK1/2, which may be involved in regional specific astroglial responses following SE.</content>

 α5 subunit containing GABA type A receptors (GABAARs) have long been an enigmatic receptor subtype of interest due to their specific brain distribution, unusual surface localization and key role in synaptic plasticity, cognition and memory. These receptors are uniquely positioned to sculpt both the developing and mature hippocampal circuitry due to high overall expression and a distinct peak during the critical synapse formation period during the second postnatal week. Unlike the majority of other GABAARs, they exhibit both receptor clustering at extrasynaptic sites via interactions with the radixin scaffold as well as synaptic sites via gephyrin, thus contributing respectively to tonic currents and synaptic GABAergic neurotransmission. α5 GABAAR signaling can be altered in neurodevelopmental disorders including autism and mental retardation and by inflammation in CNS injury and disease. Due to the unique physiology and pharmacology of α5 GABAARs, drugs targeting these receptors are being developed and tested as treatments for neurodevelopmental disorders, depression, schizophrenia, and mild cognitive impairment. This review focuses on advances in understanding how the α5 subunit contributes to GABAAR neurobiology. In particular I discuss both recent insights and remaining knowledge gaps for the functional role of these receptors, pathologies associated with α5 GABAAR dysfunction, and the effects and potential therapeutic uses of α5 receptor subtype targeted drugs.</content>

 In the present study, we conducted microarray gene expression profiling to explore the direction of differentiation of human amnion epithelial cells (hAECs) treated with rosmarinic acid (RA).  hAECs have several clinical advantages over other types of stem cells, including availability, low immunogenicity, low rejection rate, nontumorigenecity, and less ethical constraint. On the other hand, RA is a phenolic compound having several health benefits, including neuroprotective and antidepressant-like activities. In this study, hAECs were isolated from discarded term placenta and were treated with 20 μM RA for seven days. Microarray gene expression profiling was conducted for three biological replicates of RA-treated and untreated control cells on day 0 and day 7. Gene set enrichment analysis, and gene annotation and pathway analysis were conducted using online data mining tools GSEA and DAVID. Gene expression profiling showed that RA treatment biased hAECs towards ectodermal lineage progression, regulated transcription factors involved in neuronal differentiation, regulated neural specific epigenetic modifiers and several extracellular signaling pathways of neural induction, and significantly inhibited Notch signaling pathway. Gene expression profiling of RA-treated hAECs reveals for the first time a potential role of RA in neural induction and neuronal differentiation of hAECs. Having a naturally occurring compound as differentiation inducer as well as a readily available source of stem cells would have great advantages for the cell-based therapies. Findings from our genome-wide analysis could provide a foundation for further in-depth investigation.</content>

 There is a pressing need to further our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the depression symptoms in patients with post-stroke depression (PSD) in order to inform targeted therapeutic approaches. While previous research has demonstrated a reorganization in the functional brain network of PSD, it remains uncertain whether or not it also occurs in the structural brain network. We therefore aim to investigate the structural brain network of patients with PSD as compared to post-stroke non-depression (PSND) patients. In addition, our research considers the relationship between network metrics and functional measurements. Thirty-one PSD patients and twenty-three PSND patients were recruited. All patients underwent MRI and functional assessments, including the Barthel Index, Mini-Mental State Examination, and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD). Diffusion tensor imaging was used to construct the structural brain network and to conduct the subsequent graph theoretical analysis. Network measures were computed and compared between PSD and PSND patients. Associations between functional assessments and network measures were studied as well. We successfully detected increased global and local efficiency in patients with PSD. Regions with disrupted local connections were located primarily in the cognitive and limbic systems. More importantly, PSD patients’ global and regional network measures were associated with depression severity, as measured by HAMD. These findings suggest that disrupted global and local network topologies might contribute to PSD patients’ depression symptoms. Therefore, connectome-based network measures could be potential bio-markers for evaluating stroke patients’ depression levels.</content>

 Recent studies have demonstrated the close relationship between the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and resting state functional connectivity changes in the normal healthy people. However, little is known about the different parameters changes of the most vulnerable regions in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, we collected resting-state perfusion and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data including 40 AD patients and 30 healthy controls. By using voxel wise arterial spin labeling (ASL) perfusion, we firstly identified several regions of the altered rCBF in the AD patients. And then, by using resting state fMRI analysis including amplitude low frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and seed based functional connectivity, we explored the changes of the functional activities and connectivities based on the identified rCBF regions. We extracted the cognitive related parameters and search for the sensitive biomarker to differentiate the AD and normal controls. As the results, compared with controls, the AD patients showed distinct disruption of rCBF, which were mainly located in the left posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), left and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), left inferior parietal lobule (IPL), right middle temporal gyrus (MTG), left middle occipital gyrus (MOG), and left precuneus (PCu). ALFF was performed based on the seven regions identified by the ASL method, AD patients showed significantly decreased ALFF in left PCC, left IPL, right MTG, left MOG, and left PCu and increased ALFF in the bilateral DLPFC. We constitute the network based on the seven regions and found the decreased connectivity among the identified regions in the AD patients, predicting to the disruption of the default mode network (DMN), executive control network (ECN) and visual network (VN). Furthermore, these abnormal parameters are closely correlated with cognitive performances in the AD patients. We combined the rCBF and ALFF value of PCC/PCu as biomarker to differciate the two groups and reached the sensitivity of 85.3% and speciﬁcity of 88.5%. Conclusively, our findings suggested that disrupted regional cerebral blood flow, functional activity and connectivity in specific cognitive related regions in Alzheimer’s disease, which can be used as the valuable imaging biomarker for the diagnosis of AD.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Neurodegenerative diseases are among the leading causes of disability and death worldwide. The disease-related socioeconomic burden is expected to increase with the steadily increasing life expectancy. In spite of decades of clinical and basic research, most strategies designed to manage degenerative brain diseases are palliative. This is not surprising as neurodegeneration progresses “silently” for decades before symptoms are noticed. Importantly, conceptual models with heuristic value used to study neurodegeneration have been constructed retrospectively, based on signs and symptoms already present in affected patients; a circumstance that may confound causes and consequences. Hence, innovative, paradigm-shifting views of the etiology of these diseases are necessary to enable their timely prevention and treatment.
Here, we outline four alternative views, not mutually exclusive, on different etiological paths towards neurodegeneration. First, we propose neurodegeneration as being a secondary outcome of a primary cardiovascular cause with vascular pathology disrupting the vital homeostatic interactions between the vasculature and the brain resulting in cognitive impairment, dementia, and cerebrovascular events such as stroke. Second, we suggest that the persistence of senescent cells in neuronal circuits may favor, together with systemic metabolic diseases, neurodegeneration to occur. Third, we argue that neurodegeneration may start in response to altered body and brain trophic interactions established via the hardwire that connects peripheral targets with central neuronal structures or by means of extracellular vesicle-mediated communication. Lastly, we elaborate on how lifespan body dysbiosis may be linked to the origin of neurodegeneration. We highlight the existence of bacterial products that modulate the gut-brain axis causing neuroinflammation and neuronal dysfunction.
As a concluding section, we end by recommending research avenues to investigate these etiological paths in the future. This think that this requires an integrated, interdisciplinary conceptual research approach based on the investigation of multimodal aspects of physiology and pathophysiology. It involves utilizing proper conceptual models, experimental animal units, and identifying currently unused opportunities derived from human data. Overall, the proposed etiological paths and experimental recommendations will be important guidelines for future cross-discipline research to overcome the translational roadblock and to develop causative treatments for neurodegenerative diseases.</content>

 Abstract
Background and objective: Low Intensity Transcranial Ultrasound Stimulation (TUS) is a new form of non-invasive brain modulation with promising data; however, systematic reviews on the brain modulatory effects of TUS on both animals and humans have not been well conducted. We aimed to conduct a systematic review on the studies using the TUS to modulate the brain functions and associated behavioral changes in both animals and humans. 
Methods: A literature search for published studies in the past 10 years was conducted. Two authors independently reviewed the relevant articles. Data were extracted and qualitatively summarized. Quality of studies was assessed by the SYRCLE’s risk of bias tool for preclinical studies or PEDro scale for clinical studies. 
Results: A total of 24 animal studies (506 animals) and 11 human studies (213 subjects) were included. Findings based on most animal studies demonstrated the excitatory or suppressive modulatory effects of ultrasonic stimulations on motor cortex, somatosensory cortex, thalamus, prefrontal cortex, auditory and visual areas. Brain modulatory effects also were found among healthy human subjects in seven studies and two clinical studies suggested TUS may result in potential benefits on patients with disorder of consciousness or chronic pain. The safety concerns of TUS seem to be minor based on the human studies. 
Conclusions: TUS appears to be a viable technique in modulating the brain functions; however, research on TUS is still in its early stages, especially in human studies. Parameters need to be optimized before launching systematic investigations in humans.</content>

 Aim: To assess changes in the developmental trajectory of corticospinal tracts maturation in children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy (HCP). 
Methods: Neuroimaging data were obtained from 36 children with HCP for both the more affected and less affected hemispheres, and, for purposes of direct comparison, between groups, 15 typically developing children. With diffusion tensor imaging, we estimated the mean fractional anisotropy, axial diffusivity, mean diffusivity, and radial diffusivity of the corticospinal tract, parameters indicative of factors including myelination and axon density. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was performed as a neurophysiologic measure of corticospinal tract integrity and organization. Resting motor threshold was obtained per hemisphere, per patient.
Results: We observed a significant axial diffusivity and mean diffusivity developmental trajectory, both of which were inversely related to age (decrease in axial diffusivity and diffusivity corresponding to increased age) in both hemispheres of typically developing children (p&amp;lt;0.001). This maturation process was absent in both more affected and less affected hemispheres of children with HCP. Additionally, the TMS-derived previously established resting motor threshold developmental trajectory was preserved in the less affected hemisphere of children with HCP (n=26; p&amp;lt;0.0001) but this trajectory was absent in the more affected hemisphere. 
Conclusions: Corticospinal tract maturation arrests in both hemispheres of children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy, possibly reflecting perinatal disruption of corticospinal tract myelination and axonal integrity.</content>

 Transplantation of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) is a promising therapy for ischemic stroke. Previously, we had reported that the secondary degeneration occurred in the ipsilateral substantia nigra (SN) after permanent distal branch of middle cerebral artery occlusion (dMCAO) in Sprague-Dawley rats. However, whether BMSCs have neurorestorative effects on the secondary damage in the SN after focal cerebral infarction has not known. In this study, rats were subjected to dMCAO followed by intravenous administration of BMSCs 1 day later. We found that transplanted BMSCs survived and migrated to cortical infarct areas and ipsilateral SN. Furthermore, BMSCs promoted neurogenesis through proliferation and differentiation in the SN after dMCAO. Rats implanted with BMSCs showed significant improvement in their performance of modified neurological severity scores and adhesive-removal test. Engrafted BMSCs enhanced survival of dopaminergic neuron, reduced gliosis in the ipsilateral SN, and increased contents of dopamine (DA) and its metabolites in the ipsilateral striatum after dMCAO. With pseudorabies virus-152 as a retrograde tracer, we also demonstrated that BMSCs could effectively enhance the cortico-striatum-nigral connections. These results suggest that BMSCs transplantation exerts neurorestorative effects after cortical infarction through promoting endogenous neurogenesis, increasing contents of DA and its metabolites, alleviating the secondary neuronal damage in the SN, enhancing the cortico-striatum-nigral projections pathway, and finally improving the neurological functional outcome.</content>

 Restoration of neuronal connectivity after lesion of the central nervous system, such as spinal cord injury, is one of the biggest challenges in modern medicine. In particular, the accumulation of axon growth inhibitory factors at the site of injury constitutes a major obstacle to structural and thus functional repair. We previously investigated a group of prenylflavonoids derived from hops for their capacity to promote neuroregeneration and identified a molecule called ENDF1 that was very potent to enhance regrowth and branching of neurites from dorsal root ganglion neurons in culture on growth promoting substrates. In the present study, we investigated ENDF1's capacity to promote regeneration of rat dorsal root ganglion neurons in vitro in the presence of three main components of the extracellular matrix acting as axon growth inhibitors: Semaphorin3A, EphrinA4 and mixed chondroitin sulphate proteoglycans. We report that ENDF1 application significantly promoted the percentages of sensory neurons able to regrow their neurites regardless of the presence of those inhibitors, and this to an extent similar to the one obtained after NGF treatment. Moreover, ENDF1 strongly enhanced the total neurite length and the complexity of neurites extending from neurons challenged with axon growth inhibitors. Importantly, although the impact of NGF and ENDF1 on the regeneration of neurons was similar, the regenerative activity of ENDF1 was not compromised by an inhibitor of the NGF receptor TrkA (GW441756), indicating that ENDF1 and NGF act through different signaling pathways.</content>

 Here, we describe a cost-effective setup for targeted photoconversion of fluorescent signals into electron dense ones. This approach has offered invaluable insights in the morphology and function of fine neuronal structures. The technique relies on the localised oxidation of diaminobenzidine (DAB) mediated by excited fluorophores. This paper includes a detailed description of how to build a simple photoconversion setup that can increase reliability and throughput of this well-established technique. The system described here, is particularly well-suited for thick neuronal tissue, where light penetration and oxygen diffusion may be limiting DAB oxidation. To demonstrate the system, we use Correlative Light and Electron Microscopy (CLEM) to visualise functionally-labelled individual synaptic vesicles released onto an identified layer 5 neuron in an acute cortical slice. The setup significantly simplifies the photoconversion workflow, increasing the depth of photoillumination, improving the targeting of the region of interest and reducing the time required to process each individual samples. We have tested this setup extensively for the photoconversion of FM 1-43FXand Lucifer Yellowboth excited at 473nm. In principle, the system can be adapted to any dye or nanoparticle able to oxidize DAB when excited by a specific light wavelength.</content>

 Background: To study the extent that neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) influence the cognitive and functional decline in frontotemporal degeneration (FTD) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). 
Methods: We assessed the progression of NPS and their influence on cognitive and functional progression in a group of FTD [n=36] and AD patients [n=47] at two different stages of the disease (2.5 years). A standardized scale was used to assess NPS - Columbia University Scale for Psychopathology in Alzheimer’s Disease (CUSPAD), which tracks different symptoms including depression, psychotic symptoms, as well as sleep, and conduct problems. In addition, in a subsample of patients (AD n=14 and FTD n= 14), we analyzed another group of NPS by using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). Cognitive declines were tracked by using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), the Mini-mental state examination (MMSE); and functionality was tracked by using the Lawton scale and the Barthel Index. 
Results: The presence of NPS impacts cognitive and functional decline in both groups of patients 2.5 years after disease onset. However, we observed a dissociable profile of the affectation of NPS in each group. In the AD group, results indicate that the progression of depressive symptoms and sleep problems predict cognitive and functional decline. In contrast, the progression of a mixed group of NPS including conduct problems and delusions predict cognitive and functional decline in FTD. 
Conclusion: The presence of NPS have a critical impact on the prediction of cognitive decline in FTD and AD patients after 2.5 years of disease progression. Our results demonstrate the importance of assessing different types of NPS in neurodegenerative disorders which in turn, predict disease progression.  Future studies should assess the role of NPS in predicting different neurocognitive pathways and in neurodegeneration.

 The central processing pathways of the human olfactory system are not fully understood. The olfactory bulb projects directly to a number of cortical brain structures, but the distinct networks formed by projections from each of these structures to the rest of the brain have not been well-defined. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging and k-means clustering to parcellate human primary olfactory cortex into clusters based on whole-brain functional connectivity patterns. Resulting clusters accurately corresponded to anterior olfactory nucleus, olfactory tubercle, and frontal and temporal piriform cortices, suggesting dissociable whole-brain networks formed by the subregions of primary olfactory cortex. This result was replicated in an independent data set. We then characterized the unique functional connectivity profiles of each subregion, producing a map of the large-scale processing pathways of the human olfactory system. These results provide insight into the functional and anatomical organization of the human olfactory system.</content>

 The epithelial anion transporter SLC26A9 contributes to airway surface hydration and gastric acid production. Colocalizing with CFTR, SLC26A9 has been proposed as a target for the treatment of cystic fibrosis. To provide molecular details of its transport mechanism, we present cryo-EM structures and a functional characterization of murine Slc26a9. These structures define the general architecture of eukaryotic SLC26 family members and reveal an unusual mode of oligomerization which relies predominantly on the cytosolic STAS domain. Our data illustrates conformational transitions of Slc26a9, supporting a rapid alternate-access mechanism which mediates uncoupled chloride transport with negligible bicarbonate or sulfate permeability. The characterization of structure-guided mutants illuminates the properties of the ion transport path, including a selective anion binding site located in the center of a mobile module within the transmembrane domain. This study thus provides a structural foundation for the understanding of the entire SLC26 family and potentially facilitates their therapeutic exploitation.</content>

 Humans and other animals base important decisions on estimates of number, and intraparietal cortex is thought to provide a crucial substrate of this ability. However, it remains debated whether an independent neuronal processing mechanism underlies this 'number sense' or whether number is instead judged indirectly on the basis of other quantitative features. We performed high-resolution 7 Tesla fMRI while adult human volunteers attended either to the numerosity or an orthogonal dimension (average item size) of visual dot arrays. Along the dorsal visual stream, numerosity explained a significant amount of variance in activation patterns, above and beyond non-numerical dimensions. Its representation was selectively amplified and progressively enhanced across the hierarchy when task relevant. Our results reveal a sensory extraction mechanism yielding information on numerosity separable from other dimensions already at early visual stages and suggest that later regions along the dorsal stream are most important for explicit manipulation of numerical quantity.</content>

 &lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Seeing familiar faces prompts the recall of diverse kinds of person-related knowledge. How this information is encoded within the well-characterized face-/person-selective network remains an outstanding question. In this functional magnetic resonance imaging study, participants rated famous faces in 10 tasks covering 5 domains of person knowledge (social, episodic, semantic, physical, and nominal). Comparing different cognitive domains enabled us to 1) test the relative roles of brain regions in specific cognitive processes and 2) apply a multivariate network-level representational similarity analysis (NetRSA) to gain insight into underlying system-level organization. Comparing across cognitive domains revealed the importance of multiple domains in most regions, the importance of social over nominal knowledge in the anterior temporal lobe, and the functional subdivision of the temporoparietal junction into perceptual superior temporal sulcus and knowledge-related angular gyrus. NetRSA revealed a strong divide between regions implicated in ``default-mode” cognition and the fronto-lateral elements that coordinated more with ``core” perceptual components (fusiform/occipital face areas and posterior superior temporal sulcus). NetRSA also revealed a taxonomy of cognitive processes, with semantic retrieval being more similar to episodic than nominal knowledge. Collectively, these results illustrate the importance of coordinated activity of the person knowledge network in the instantiation of the diverse cognitive capacities of this system.&lt;/span&gt;</content>

 Default network regions appear to integrate information over time windows of 30 seconds or more during narrative listening. Does this long-timescale capability require the hippocampus? Amnesic behavior suggests that the hippocampus may not be needed for online processing when input is continuous and semantically rich: amnesics can participate in conversations and tell stories spanning minutes, and when tested immediately on recently heard prose their performance is relatively preserved. We hypothesized that default network regions can integrate the semantically coherent information of a narrative across long time windows, even in the absence of the hippocampus. To test this prediction, we measured BOLD activity in the brain of a hippocampal amnesic patient (D. A.) and healthy control participants while they listened to a seven-minute narrative. The narrative was played either in its intact form, or as a paragraph-scrambled version, which has been previously shown to interfere with the long-range temporal dependencies in default network activity. In the intact story condition, D. A.'s moment-by-moment BOLD activity spatial patterns were similar to those of controls in low-level auditory cortex as well as in some high-level default network regions (including lateral and medial posterior parietal cortex). Moreover, as in controls, D. A.'s response patterns in medial and lateral posterior parietal cortex were disrupted when paragraphs of the story were presented in a shuffled order, suggesting that activity in these areas did depend on information from 30 seconds or more in the past. Together, these results suggest that some default network cortical areas can integrate information across long timescales, even in the absence of the hippocampus.</content>

 Depending on environmental demands, humans can learn and exploit multiple concurrent sets of stimulus-response associations. Mechanisms underlying the learning of such task-sets remain unknown. Here we investigate the hypothesis that task-set learning relies on unsupervised chunking of stimulus-response associations that occur in temporal proximity. We examine behavioral and neural data from a task-set learning experiment using a network model. We first show that task-set learning can be achieved provided the timescale of chunking is slower than the timescale of stimulus-response learning. Fitting the model to behavioral data confirmed this expectation and led to specific predictions linking chunking and task-set retrieval that were borne out by behavioral performance and reaction times. Comparing the model activity with BOLD signal allowed us to identify neural correlates of task-set retrieval in a functional network involving ventral and dorsal prefrontal cortex, with the dorsal system preferentially engaged when retrievals are used to improve performance.</content>

 Acquiring a foreign language is challenging for many adults. Yet certain individuals choose to acquire sometimes dozens of languages, and often just for fun. Is there something special about the minds and brains of such polyglots? Using robust individual-level markers of language activity, measured with fMRI, we compared native language processing in polyglots versus matched controls. Polyglots (n=17, including 9 hyper-polyglots with proficiency in 10-55 languages) used fewer neural resources to process language: their activations were smaller in both magnitude and extent. This difference was spatially and functionally selective: the groups were similar in their activation of two other brain networks - the multiple demand network and the default mode network. We hypothesize that the activation reduction in the language network is experientially driven, such that the acquisition and use of multiple languages makes language processing generally more efficient. However, genetic and longitudinal studies will be critical to distinguish this hypothesis from the one whereby polyglots' brains already differ at birth or early in development. This initial characterization of polyglots' language network opens the door to future investigations of the cognitive and neural architecture of individuals who gain mastery of multiple languages, including changes in this architecture with linguistic experiences.</content>

 Enhancing stress resilience could protect against stress-induced psychiatric disorders in at-risk populations. We and others have previously reported that (R,S)-ketamine acts as a resilience enhancing drug (e.g., prophylactic) against stress when administered 1 week before stress. While we have shown that the selective 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) (serotonin) reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) fluoxetine (Flx) is ineffective as a prophylactic, it remains to be determined if other serotonergic drugs could be effective prophylactics. Here, we hypothesized that serotonin 4 receptor (5-HT4R) agonists could be prophylactic against fear, depressive-like, and/or anxiety-like behavior. We tested if three 5-HT4R agonists with varying affinity (e.g., partial or selective agonists) could protect against stress in two mouse strains by utilizing a chronic corticosterone (CORT) administration or a contextual fear conditioning (CFC) paradigm. Mice were administered RS-67,333, prucalopride, or PF-04995274 at varying doses and then 1 week later were subjected to chronic CORT or CFC. Chronic administration of RS-67,333, but not Flx was efficacious as a prophylactic against CORT in C57BL/6NTac mice. A single injection of RS-67,333 attenuated learned fear in male, but not female 129S6/SvEv mice. RS-67,333 was ineffective against stress-induced depressive-like behavior in the forced swim test (FST). A single injection of either prucalopride or PF-04995274 attenuated learned fear and decreased stress-induced depressive-like behavior. These data show that in addition to (R,S)-ketamine, 5-HT4R agonists are also effective prophylactics against stress, suggesting that the 5-HT4R may be a novel target for prophylactic drug development.</content>

 BACKGROUND: Females are more likely than males to develop major depressive disorder (MDD) after exposure to stress. We previously reported that the administration of (R,S)-ketamine before stress can prevent stress-induced depressive-like behavior in male mice but have yet to assess efficacy in female mice or for other compounds, such as the metabolites of (R,S)-ketamine. METHODS: We administered (R,S)-ketamine or its metabolites (2R,6R)-hydroxynorketamine ((2R,6R)-HNK) and (2S,6S)-HNK at various doses 1 week before one of a number of stressors, including contextual fear conditioning (CFC), learned helplessness (LH), and chronic immobilization stress (CIS), in male and female 129S6/SvEv mice. To examine the interaction between ovarian hormones and stress resilience, female mice also underwent ovariectomy surgery (OVX) and a hormone replacement protocol prior to drug administration. RESULTS: (R,S)-ketamine and (2S,6S)-HNK, but not (2R,6R)-HNK, attenuated learned fear in male mice. (R,S)-ketamine and (2R,6R)-HNK, but not (2S,6S)-HNK, significantly reduced stress-induced depressive-like behavior in male and female mice. (R,S)-ketamine and (2R,6R)-HNK) were prophylactically effective at a lower dose (10 mg/kg and 0.025 mg/kg, respectively) in female mice than in male mice (30 mg/kg and 0.075 mg/kg, respectively). Moreover, ovarian-derived hormones were necessary and sufficient for prophylaxis in female mice. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that prophylactics against stress-induced depressive-like behavior can be developed in a sex-specific manner and that ovarian hormones mediate prophylactic efficacy in females. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the prophylactic efficacy of the metabolites of (R,S)-ketamine in male and female mice.</content>

 Physiology and behaviour are controlled by neuropeptide signalling systems comprising peptide ligands and cognate receptors. Molecular phylogenetics combined with experimental identification of neuropeptide-receptor pairs has revealed that many neuropeptide signalling systems originated in the urbilaterian common ancestor of protostomes and deuterostomes. Neuropeptide-Y/neuropeptide-F (NPY/NPF)-type signalling is one such example, whereas NPY/NPF-related short-NPF (sNPF)-type signalling has hitherto only been identified in protostomes. Here we report the discovery of a neuropeptide (pQDRSKAMQAERTGQLRRLNPRF-NH2) that is the ligand for an sNPF-type receptor in a deuterostome, the starfish Asterias rubens (Phylum Echinodermata). Informed by phylogenetic analysis of sequence data, we conclude that the paralogous NPY/NPF-type and sNPF-type signalling systems originated in Urbilateria but NPY/NPF-type signalling was lost in echinoderms. Furthermore, we present evidence that sNPF-type peptides are orthologs of vertebrate prolactin-releasing peptides. Our findings demonstrate the importance of experimental studies on echinoderms for reconstructing the evolutionary history of neuropeptide signalling systems.</content>

 Real life choices often require that we draw inferences about the value of options based on structured, schematic knowledge about their utility for our current goals. Other times, value information may be retrieved directly from a specific prior experience with an option. In an fMRI experiment, we investigated the neural systems involved in retrieving and assessing information from different memory sources to support value-based choice. Participants completed a task in which items could be conferred positive or negative value based on schematic associations (i.e. schema value), or learned directly from experience with deterministic feedback (i.e. episodic value). We found that ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) activity correlated with the influence of both episodic- and schema-based values on participants' decisions. Connectivity between vmPFC and middle temporal cortex also tracked the inferred value of items based on schematic associations on the first presentation of ingredients, prior to any feedback. In contrast, the striatum responded to participants' willingness to bet on ingredients as a function of the unsigned strength of their episodic memory for those ingredients' values. These results argue that striatum and vmPFC play distinct roles in memory-based value judgment and decision-making. Specifically, the vmPFC assesses the value of options based on information inferred from schematic knowledge and retrieved from episodic memory, while the striatum controls a decision to act on options based on the strength of retrieved episodic information.</content>

		<content type="html">
 A controversy exists over the roles of frontal and posterior cortices in mediating consciousness and unconsciousness. Disruption of posterior cortex during sleep appears to suppress the contents of dreaming, yet activation of frontal cortex appears necessary for perception and can reverse unconsciousness under anesthesia. We used anesthesia to study how regional cortical disruption, mediated by slow wave modulation of broadband activity, changes during unconsciousness in humans. We found that broadband slow-wave modulation enveloped posterior cortex when subjects initially became unconscious, but later encompassed both frontal and posterior cortex when subjects were more deeply anesthetized and likely unarousable. Our results suggest that unconsciousness under anesthesia comprises several distinct shifts in brain state that disrupt the contents of consciousness distinct from arousal and awareness of those contents.</content>

		<content type="html">
 The extent of the networks that control the genesis and modulation of hippocampal sharp-wave ripples (SPW-Rs), which are involved in memory consolidation, remains incompletely understood. Here, we performed a detailed in vivo analysis of single cell firing in the lateral supramammillary nucleus (lSuM) during theta and slow oscillations, including SPW-Rs, in anesthetized rats. We classified neurons as SPW-R-active and SPW-R unchanged according to whether or not they increased their firing during SPW-Rs. We show that lSuM SPW-R-active neurons increase their firing prior SPW-Rs peak power and prior hippocampal pyramidal cell activation. Moreover, lSuM SPW-R-active neurons show increased firing activity during theta and slow oscillations as compared to unchanged-neurons. SPW-R-active neurons are more active during high peak power SPW-Rs, whereas SPW-R-unchanged neurons are more active during long SPW-Rs. These results suggest that a sub-population of lSuM neurons can interact with the hippocampus during SPW-Rs, raising the possibility that the lSuM may modulate memory consolidation.</content>

 Transient oscillations in the network activity upon sensory stimulation have been reported in different sensory areas. These evoked oscillations are the generic response of networks of excitatory and inhibitory neurons (EI-networks) to a transient external input. Recently, it has been shown that this resonance property of EI-networks can be exploited for communication in modular neuronal networks by enabling the transmission of sequences of synchronous spike volleys (&quot;pulse packets&quot;), despite the sparse and weak connectivity between the modules. The condition for successful transmission is that the pulse packet (PP) intervals match the period of the modules' resonance frequency. Hence, the mechanism was termed communication through resonance (CTR). This mechanism has three sever constraints, though. First, it needs periodic trains of PPs, whereas single PPs fail to propagate. Second, the inter-PP interval needs to match the network resonance. Third, transmission is very slow, because in each module, the network resonance needs to build-up over multiple oscillation cycles. Here, we show that, by adding appropriate feedback connections to the network, the CTR mechanism can be improved and the aforementioned constraints relaxed. Specifically, we show that adding feedback connections between two upstream modules, called the resonance pair, in an otherwise feedforward modular network can support successful propagation of a single PP throughout the entire network. The key condition for successful transmission is that the sum of the forward and backward delays in the resonance pair matches the resonance frequency of the network modules. The transmission is much faster, by more than a factor of two, than in the original CTR mechanism. Moreover, it distinctly lowers the threshold for successful communication by synchronous spiking in modular networks of weakly coupled networks. Thus, our results suggest a new functional role of bidirectional connectivity for the communication in cortical area networks.</content>

 When reaching to a visual target, humans need to transform the spatial target representation into the coordinate system of their moving arm. It has been shown that increased demands in such coordinate transformations, for instance when the head is rolled toward one shoulder, lead to higher movement variability and influence movement decisions. However, it is unknown whether the brain incorporates such added variability to adjust movements when it is necessary. We designed an obstacle avoidance task in which participants had to reach to a visual target without colliding with an obstacle. We introduced different coordinate transformation demands by varying head roll (straight, 30{degrees} clockwise and 30{degrees} counterclockwise). In agreement with previous studies, we observed that the reaching variability increased when the head was tilted. In addition, participants systematically changed their obstacle avoidance behavior with head roll. In particular, they changed the preferred direction of passing the obstacle and increased the error margins indicated by stronger movement curvature. Indeed, reaching movements did not differ in the number of collisions between the head roll and the head straight conditions. These results suggest that the brain takes the added movement variability during head roll into account and compensates for it by adjusting the reaching trajectories.</content>

As antimicrobial resistance increases, it is crucial to develop new treatment strategies to counter the emerging threat. In this paper, we consider combination therapies involving conventional antibiotics and debridement, coupled with a novel anti-adhesion therapy, and their use in the treatment of antimicrobial resistant burn wound infections. Our models predict that anti-adhesion–antibiotic–debridement combination therapies can eliminate a bacterial infection in cases where each treatment in isolation would fail. Antibiotics are assumed to have a bactericidal mode of action, killing bacteria, while debridement involves physically cleaning a wound (e.g. with a cloth); removing free bacteria. Anti-adhesion therapy can take a number of forms. Here we consider adhesion inhibitors consisting of polystyrene microbeads chemically coupled to a protein known as multivalent adhesion molecule 7, an adhesin which mediates the initial stages of attachment of many bacterial species to host cells. Adhesion inhibitors competitively inhibit bacteria from binding to host cells, thus rendering them susceptible to removal through debridement. An ordinary differential equation model is developed and the antibiotic-related parameters are fitted against new &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; data gathered for the present study. The model is used to predict treatment outcomes and to suggest optimal treatment strategies. Our model predicts that anti-adhesion and antibiotic therapies will combine synergistically, producing a combined effect which is often greater than the sum of their individual effects, and that anti-adhesion–antibiotic–debridement combination therapy will be more effective than any of the treatment strategies used in isolation. Further, the use of inhibitors significantly reduces the minimum dose of antibiotics required to eliminate an infection, reducing the chances that bacteria will develop increased resistance. Lastly, we use our model to suggest treatment regimens capable of eliminating bacterial infections within clinically relevant timescales.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/SQI4Hedh_e8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) has changed the way we regard evolution. Instead of waiting for the next generation to establish new traits, especially bacteria are able to take a shortcut via HGT that enables them to pass on genes from one individual to another, even across species boundaries. The tool Daisy offers the first HGT detection approach based on read mapping that provides complementary evidence compared to existing methods. However, Daisy relies on the acceptor and donor organism involved in the HGT being known. We introduce DaisyGPS, a mapping-based pipeline that is able to identify acceptor and donor reference candidates of an HGT event based on sequencing reads. Acceptor and donor identification is akin to species identification in metagenomic samples based on sequencing reads, a problem addressed by metagenomic profiling tools. However, acceptor and donor references have certain properties such that these methods cannot be directly applied. DaisyGPS uses MicrobeGPS, a metagenomic profiling tool tailored towards estimating the genomic distance between organisms in the sample and the reference database. We enhance the underlying scoring system of MicrobeGPS to account for the sequence patterns in terms of mapping coverage of an acceptor and donor involved in an HGT event, and report a ranked list of reference candidates. These candidates can then be further evaluated by tools like Daisy to establish HGT regions. We successfully validated our approach on both simulated and real data, and show its benefits in an investigation of an outbreak involving Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus data.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/efbsFNCMjHE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Neuroscience models come in a wide range of scales and specificity, from mean-field rate models to large-scale networks of spiking neurons. There are potential trade-offs between simplicity and realism, versatility and computational speed. This paper is about large-scale cortical network models, and the question we address is one of scalability: would scaling down cell density impact a network’s ability to reproduce cortical dynamics and function? We investigated this problem using a previously constructed realistic model of the monkey visual cortex that is true to size. Reducing cell density gradually up to 50-fold, we studied changes in model behavior. Size reduction without parameter adjustment was catastrophic. Surprisingly, relatively minor compensation in synaptic weights guided by a theoretical algorithm restored mean firing rates and basic function such as orientation selectivity to models 10-20 times smaller than the real cortex. Not all was normal in the reduced model cortices: intracellular dynamics acquired a character different from that of real neurons, and while the ability to relay feedforward inputs remained intact, reduced models showed signs of deficiency in functions that required dynamical interaction among cortical neurons. These findings are not confined to models of the visual cortex, and modelers should be aware of potential issues that accompany size reduction. Broader implications of this study include the importance of homeostatic maintenance of firing rates, and the functional consequences of feedforward versus recurrent dynamics, ideas that may shed light on other species and on systems suffering cell loss.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/pIYdVbiLCUQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Developmental system drift is a likely mechanism for the origin of hybrid incompatibilities between closely related species. We examine here the detailed mechanistic basis of hybrid incompatibilities between two allopatric lineages, for a genotype-phenotype map of developmental system drift under stabilising selection, where an organismal phenotype is conserved, but the underlying molecular phenotypes and genotype can drift. This leads to number of emergent phenomenon not obtainable by modelling genotype or phenotype alone. Our results show that: 1) speciation is more rapid at smaller population sizes with a characteristic, Orr-like, power law, but at large population sizes slow, characterised by a sub-diffusive growth law; 2) the molecular phenotypes under weakest selection contribute to the earliest incompatibilities; and 3) pair-wise incompatibilities dominate over higher order, contrary to previous predictions that the latter should dominate. The population size effect we find is consistent with previous results on allopatric divergence of transcription factor-DNA binding, where smaller populations have common ancestors with a larger drift load because genetic drift favours phenotypes which have a larger number of genotypes (higher sequence entropy) over more fit phenotypes which have far fewer genotypes; this means less substitutions are required in either lineage before incompatibilities arise. Overall, our results indicate that biophysics and population size provide a much stronger constraint to speciation than suggested by previous models, and point to a general mechanistic principle of how incompatibilities arise the under stabilising selection for an organismal phenotype.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/LCizs-nbjwE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 As animals forage for food and water or evade predators, they must rapidly decide what visual features in the environment deserve attention. In vertebrates, this visuomotor computation is implemented within the neural circuits of the optic tectum (superior colliculus in mammals). However, the mechanisms by which tectum decides whether to...&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/iqvcifmpU3E&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Critical brain hypothesis has been intensively studied both in experimental
and theoretical neuroscience over the past two decades. However, some important
questions still remain: (i) What is the critical point the brain operates at?
(ii) What is the regulatory mechanism that brings about and maintains such a
critical state? (iii) The critical state is characterized by scale-invariant
behavior which is seemingly at odds with definitive brain oscillations? In this
work we consider a biologically motivated model of Izhikevich neuronal network
with chemical synapses interacting via spike-timingdependent plasticity (STDP)
as well as axonal time delay. Under generic and physiologically relevant
conditions we show that the system is organized and maintained around a
synchronization transition point as opposed to an activity transition point
associated with an absorbing state phase transition. However, such a state
exhibits experimentally relevant signs of critical dynamics including
scale-free avalanches with finite-size scaling as well as branching ratios.
While the system displays stochastic oscillations with highly correlated
fluctuations, it also displays dominant frequency modes seen as sharp peaks in
the power spectrum. The role of STDP as well as time delay is crucial in
achieving and maintaining such critical dynamics, while the role of inhibition
is not as crucial. In this way we provide definitive answers to all three
questions posed above. We also show that one can achieve supercritical or
subcritical dynamics if one changes the average time delay associated with
axonal conduction.

 &lt;p&gt;During the last two decades, various models have been proposed for fish
collective motion. These models are mainly developed to decipher the biological
mechanisms of social interaction between animals. They consider very simple
homogeneous unbounded environments and it is not clear that they can simulate
accurately the collective trajectories. Moreover when the models are more
accurate, the question of their scalability to either larger groups or more
elaborate environments remains open. This study deals with learning how to
simulate realistic collective motion of collective of zebrafish, using
real-world tracking data. The objective is to devise an agent-based model that
can be implemented on an artificial robotic fish that can blend into a
collective of real fish. We present a novel approach that uses Quality
Diversity algorithms, a class of algorithms that emphasise exploration over
pure optimisation. In particular, we use CVT-MAP-Elites, a variant of the
state-of-the-art MAP-Elites algorithm for high dimensional search space.
Results show that Quality Diversity algorithms not only outperform classic
evolutionary reinforcement learning methods at the macroscopic level (i.e.
group behaviour), but are also able to generate more realistic biomimetic
behaviours at the microscopic level (i.e. individual behaviour).

 &lt;p&gt;Deep neural network (DNN) models for computer vision are now capable of
human-level object recognition. Consequently, similarities in the performance
and vulnerabilities of DNN and human vision are of great interest. Here we
characterize the response of the VGG-19 DNN to images of the Scintillating Grid
visual illusion, in which white dots are perceived to be partially black. We
observed a significant deviation from the expected monotonic relation between
VGG-19 representational dissimilarity and dot whiteness in the Scintillating
Grid. That is, a linear increase in dot whiteness leads to a non-linear
increase and then, remarkably, a decrease (non-monotonicity) in
representational dissimilarity. In control images, mostly monotonic relations
between representational dissimilarity and dot whiteness were observed.
Furthermore, the dot whiteness level corresponding to the maximal
representational dissimilarity (i.e. onset of non-monotonic dissimilarity)
matched closely with that corresponding to the onset of illusion perception in
human observers. As such, the non-monotonic response in the DNN is a potential
model correlate for human illusion perception.

 &lt;p&gt;Memory and forgetting constitute two sides of the same coin, and although the
first has been rigorously investigated, the latter is often overlooked. A
number of experiments under the realm of psychology and experimental
neuroscience have described the properties of forgetting in humans and animals,
showing that forgetting exhibits a power-law relationship with time. These
results indicate a counter-intuitive property of forgetting, namely that old
memories are more stable than younger ones. We have devised a phenomenological
model that is based on the principle of retroactive interference, driven by a
multi-dimensional valence measure for acquired memories. The model has only one
free integer parameter and can be solved analytically. We performed recognition
experiments with long streams of words were performed, resulting in a good
match to a five-dimensional version of the model.

 &lt;p&gt;Learning to produce spatiotemporal sequences is a common task the brain has
to solve. While many sequential behaviours differ superficially, the underlying
organization of the computation might be similar. The way the brain learns
these tasks remains unknown as current computational models do not typically
use realistic biologically-plausible learning. Here, we propose a model where a
spiking recurrent network drives a read-out layer. Plastic synapses follow
common Hebbian learning rules. The dynamics of the recurrent network is
constrained to encode time while the read-out neurons encode space. Space is
then linked with time through Hebbian learning. Here we demonstrate that the
model is able to learn spatiotemporal dynamics on a timescale that is
behaviorally relevant. Learned sequences are robustly replayed during a regime
of spontaneous activity.

 &lt;p&gt;Recently, steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)-based brain-computer
interface (BCI) has attracted much attention due to its high information
transfer rate (ITR) and increasing number of targets. However, the performance
of SSVEP-based methods in terms of accuracy and time length required for target
detection can be improved. We propose a new canonical correlation analysis
(CCA)-based method to integrate subject-specific models and subject-independent
information and enhance BCI performance. To optimize hyperparameters for
CCA-based model of a specific subject, we propose to use training data of other
subjects. An ensemble version of the proposed method is also developed and used
for a fair comparison with ensemble task-related component analysis (TRCA). A
publicly available 35-subject SSVEP benchmark dataset is used to evaluate
different methods. The proposed method is compared with TRCA and extended CCA
methods as reference methods. The performance of the methods is evaluated using
classification accuracy and ITR. Offline analysis results show that the
proposed method reaches highest ITR compared with TRCA and extended CCA. Also,
the proposed method significantly improves performance of extended CCA in all
conditions and TRCA for time windows greater than 0.3 s. In addition, the
proposed method outperforms TRCA for low number of training blocks and
electrodes. This study illustrates that adding subject-independent information
to subject-specific models can improve the performance of SSVEP-based BCIs.

 &lt;p&gt;Whole-brain computational modeling based on structural connectivity has shown
great promise in successfully simulating fMRI BOLD signals with temporal
co-activation patterns that are highly similar to empirical functional
connectivity patterns during resting state. Importantly, previous studies have
shown that spontaneous fluctuations in co-activation patterns of distributed
brain regions have an inherent dynamic nature with regard to the frequency
spectrum of intrinsic brain oscillations. In this modeling study, we introduced
frequency dynamics into a system of coupled oscillators, where each oscillator
represents the local mean-field model of a brain region. We first showed that
the collective behavior of interacting oscillators reproduces previously shown
features of brain dynamics. Second, we examined the effect of simulated lesions
in gray matter by applying an in silico perturbation protocol to the brain
model. We present a new approach to map the effects of vulnerability in brain
networks and introduce a measure of regional hazardousness based on mapping of
the degree of divergence in a feature space

 &lt;p&gt;Many real-world data sets, especially in biology, are produced by complex
nonlinear dynamical systems. In this paper, we focus on brain calcium imaging
(CaI) of different organisms (zebrafish and rat), aiming to build a model of
joint activation dynamics in large neuronal populations, including the whole
brain of zebrafish. We propose a new approach for capturing dynamics of
temporal SVD components that uses the coupled (multivariate) van der Pol (VDP)
oscillator, a nonlinear ordinary differential equation (ODE) model describing
neural activity, with a new parameter estimation technique that combines
variable projection optimization and stochastic search. We show that the
approach successfully handles nonlinearities and hidden state variables in the
coupled VDP. The approach is accurate, achieving 0.82 to 0.94 correlation
between the actual and model-generated components, and interpretable, as VDP's
coupling matrix reveals anatomically meaningful positive (excitatory) and
negative (inhibitory) interactions across different brain subsystems
corresponding to spatial SVD components. Moreover, VDP is comparable to (or
sometimes better than) recurrent neural networks (LSTM) for (short-term)
prediction of future brain activity; VDP needs less parameters to train, which
was a plus on our small training data. Finally, the overall best predictive
method, greatly outperforming both VDP and LSTM in short- and long-term
predictive settings on both datasets, was the new hybrid VDP-LSTM approach that
used VDP to simulate large domain-specific dataset for LSTM pretraining; note
that simple LSTM data-augmentation via noisy versions of training data was much
less effective.

 Cortical synapse organization supports a range of dynamic states on multiple spatial and temporal scales, from synchronous slow wave activity (SWA), characteristic of deep sleep or anesthesia, to fluctuating, asynchronous activity during wakefulness (AW). Such dynamic diversity poses a challenge for producing efficient large-scale simulations that embody realistic metaphors of short- and long-range synaptic connectivity. In fact, during SWA and AW different spatial extents of the cortical tissue are active in a given timespan and at different levels, which implies a wide variety of loads of local computation and communication. A balanced evaluation of simulation performance and robustness should therefore include tests of a variety of cortical dynamic states. Here, we demonstrate performance scaling of our proprietary Distributed and Plastic Spiking Neural Networks (DPSNN) simulation engine in both SWA and AW for bi-dimensional grids of neural populations, which reflects the modular organization of the cortex. We explored networks up to 192x192 modules, each composed of 1250 integrate-and-fire neurons with spike-frequency adaptation, and exponentially decaying inter-modular synaptic connectivity with varying spatial decay constant. For the largest networks the total number of synapses was over 70 billion. The execution platform included up to 64 dual-socket nodes, each socket mounting 8 Intel Xeon Haswell processor cores @ 2.40GHz clock. Network initialization time, memory usage, and execution times showed good scaling performances from 1 to 1024 processes, implemented using the standard Message Passing Interface (MPI) protocol. We achieved simulation speeds of between 2.3x10^9 and 4.1x10^9 synaptic events per second for both cortical states in the explored range of inter-modular interconnections.</content>

 GABAA receptor-mediated currents shift from excitatory to inhibitory during postnatal brain development in rodents. A postnatal increase in KCC2 protein expression is considered to be the sole mechanism controlling the developmental onset of hyperpolarizing synaptic transmission, but here we identify a key role for KCC2 phosphorylation in the developmental EGABA shift. Preventing phosphorylation of KCC2 in vivo at either residue serine 940 (S940), or at residues threonine 906 and threonine 1007 (T906/T1007), delayed or accelerated the postnatal onset of KCC2 function, respectively. Several models of neurodevelopmental disorders including Rett syndrome, Fragile X and Down’s syndrome exhibit delayed postnatal onset of hyperpolarizing GABAergic inhibition, but whether the timing of the onset of hyperpolarizing synaptic inhibition during development plays a role in establishing adulthood cognitive function is unknown; we have used the distinct KCC2-S940A and KCC2-T906A/T1007A knock-in mouse models to address this issue. Altering KCC2 function resulted in long-term abnormalities in social behavior and memory retention. Tight regulation of KCC2 phosphorylation is therefore required for the typical timing of the developmental onset of hyperpolarizing synaptic inhibition, and it plays a fundamental role in the regulation of adulthood cognitive function.</content>

 Visual perception is most often studied as a “passive” process in which an observer fixates steadily at point in space so that stimuli can be delivered to the system with spatial precision. Analysis of neuronal signals related to vision is generally keyed to stimulus onset, stimulus movement, etc.; i.e., events external to the observer. In natural “active” vision however, information is systematically acquired by using eye movements including rapid (saccadic) eye movements, as well as smooth ocular pursuit of moving objects and slower drifts. Here we consider the use of alternating saccades and fixations to gather information from a visual scene. In this Perspective we note that active saccadic sampling behavior imposes robust temporal patterning on the activity of neuron ensembles and large-scale neural dynamics throughout the brain’s visual pathways whose mechanistic effects on information processing are not yet fully understood. The spatio-temporal sequence of eye movements elicits a succession of temporally predictable quasi-rhythmic sensory inputs, whose encoding is enhanced by entrainment of low frequency oscillations to the rate of eye movements. Review of the pertinent findings underscores the fact that temporal coordination between motor and visual cortices is critical for understanding neural dynamics of active vision and posits that phase entrainment of neuronal oscillations plays a mechanistic role in this process.</content>

 Tissue perfusion is a necessary condition for vessel survival that can be compromised under ischemic conditions. Following stroke, delayed effects of early brain reperfusion on the vascular substrate necessary for remodelling, perfusion and maintenance of proper peri-lesional hemodynamics are unknown. Such aspects of ischemic injury progression may be critical for neurological recovery in stroke patients. This study aims to describe the impact of early, non-thrombolytic reperfusion on the vascular brain component and its potential contribution to tissue remodelling and long-term functional recovery beyond the acute phase after stroke in 3-month-old male C57bl/6 mice.  Permanent (pMCAO) and transient (60 min, tMCAO) brain ischemia mouse models were used for characterizing the effect of early, non-thrombolytic reperfusion on the brain vasculature. Analysis of different vascular parameters (vessel density, proliferation, degeneration and perfusion) revealed that, while early middle cerebral artery recanalisation was not sufficient to prevent sub-acute vascular degeneration within the ischemic brain regions, brain reperfusion promoted a secondary wave of vascular remodelling in the peri-lesional regions, which led to improved perfusion of the ischemic boundaries and late-phase neurological recovery.  This study concluded that acute, non-thrombolytic artery recanalisation following stroke favours late-phase vascular remodelling and improves peri-lesional perfusion, contributing to secondary functional recovery.</content>

 Paraffin embedding is widely used in microscopic imaging for preparing biological specimens. However, owing to significant fluorescence quenching during the embedding process, it is not compatible with fluorescent-labeling techniques, such as transgenic and viral labeling using green fluorescent protein (GFP). Here we investigated the quenching mechanism and optimized the embedding process to improve the preservation of fluorescence intensity. The results showed that dehydration is the main reason of fluorescence quenching during paraffin embedding, caused by full denaturation of GFP molecules in ethyl alcohol. To evaluate fluorescent and morphological preservation, we modified the embedding process using tertiary butanol (TBA) instead of ethyl alcohol. Fluorescence intensity following TBA dehydration increased 12.08-fold of that observed in the traditional method. We obtained uniform fluorescence maintenance throughout the whole mouse brain, while the continuous apical dendrites, spines, and axon terminals were shown evenly within the cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala. Moreover, we embedded a whole rat brain labeled with AAV in the prelimbic cortex (Prl). With the axon terminals in different areas, such as the caudate putamen, thalamus, and pyramidal tract, the results showed a continuous tract of Prl neurons throughout the whole brain. Meanwhile, this method was suitable to tdTomota labeled samples. These findings indicated this modified embedding method could be compatible with GFP and provides a potential turning point for applications in the fluorescent labeling of samples.</content>

 Objective: To investigate the potential regional homogeneity (ReHo) brain activity changes in patients with corneal ulcer (CU) and their possible relationship with clinical symptoms. 
Materials and methods: 40 patients with CU (26 men and 14 women), and 40 healthy controls (HCs) (26 men and 14 women) closely matched in age, sex and weight underwent resting-state functional MRI scans respectively. The ReHo method was applied to evaluate synchronous neural activity changes. Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC curve) was used to show high test-retest stability and high degree of sensitivity and specificity.. We utilized the correlation analysis to calculate the relationship between the average ReHo signal values in different brain areas and the clinical symptoms in CU patients.
Results: Compared with the HCs, CU patients had significantly increased ReHo values in right cerebellum posterior lobe, left cerebellum posterior lobe, left inferior temporal gyrus, right lingual gyrus, left middle frontal gyrus, left angular gyrus, left cingulate gyrus, right angular gyrus and bilateral superior frontal gyrus，and decreased ReHo values in right anterior cingulate and left precentral gyrus. ROC curve analysis of each brain regions showed the accuracy of AUC was perfect except the right cerebellum posterior lobe. Nevertheless, there was no clear evidence of prominent relevance between the average ReHo values in brain areas and the clinical symptoms. 
Conclusion: CU caused dysfunctional adaption in different brain areas, which including relatively increased values and decreased values. This finding may help us take a further step in exploring the underlying pathologic mechanisms of CU.</content>

 Resting-state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI) is a common method for mapping functional brain networks. However, estimation of these networks is affected by the presence of a common global systemic noise, or global signal (GS). Previous studies have shown that the common preprocessing steps of removing the GS may create spurious correlations between brain regions. In this paper, we decompose fMRI signals into 5 spatial and 3 temporal intrinsic mode functions (SIMF and TIMF, respectively) by means of the empirical mode decomposition (EMD), which is an adaptive data-driven method widely used to analyze non-linear and non-stationary phenomena. For each SIMF, functional connectivity matrices were computed by means of the Pearson correlation between TIMFs of different brain areas. Thus, instead of a single connectivity matrix, we obtained 5*3 = 15 functional connectivity matrices. Given the high correlation and global efficiency values of the connectivity matrices related to the low spatial maps (SIMF3, SIMF4, and SIMF5), our results suggest that these maps can be considered as spatial global signal masks. Thus, by summing up the first two SIMFs extracted from the fMRI signals, we have automatically excluded the GS  which is now voxel-specific. We compared the performance of our method with the conventional GS regression and to the results when the GS was not removed. While the correlation pattern identified by the other methods suffers from a low level of precision in identifying the correct brain network connectivity, our approach demonstrated expected connectivity patterns for the default mode network and task-positive network.</content>

 Dynamic gain and loss of synapses is fundamental to healthy brain function. While Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) treatment strategies have largely focussed on beta-amyloid and tau protein pathologies, the synapse itself may also be a critical endpoint to consider regarding disease modification.  Disruption of mechanisms of neuronal plasticity, eventually resulting in a net loss of synapses, is implicated as an early pathological event in AD.  Synaptic dysfunction therefore may be a final common biological mechanism linking protein pathologies to disease symptoms.  This review summarises evidence supporting the idea of early neuroplastic deficits being prevalent in AD. Changes in synaptic density can occur before overt neurodegeneration and should not be considered to uniformly decrease over the course of the disease.  Instead, synaptic levels are influenced by an interplay between processes of degeneration and atrophy, and those of maintenance and compensation at regional and network levels.  How these neuroplastic changes are driven by amyloid and tau pathology are varied.  A mixture of direct effects of amyloid and tau on synaptic integrity, as well as indirect effects on processes such as inflammation and neuronal energetics are likely to be at play here.  Focussing on the synapse and mechanisms of neuroplasticity as therapeutic opportunities in AD raises some important conceptual and strategic issues regarding translational research, and how preclinical research can inform clinical studies.  Nevertheless, substrates of neuroplasticity represent an emerging complementary class of drug target that would aim to normalise synapse dynamics and restore cognitive function in the AD brain.</content>

 Simulations of electrical activity of networks of morphologically detailed neuron models allow for a better understanding of the brain. State-of-the-art simulations describe the dynamics of ionic currents and biochemical processes within branching topological representations of the neurons. Acceleration of such simulation is possible in the weak scaling limit by modelling neurons as indivisible computation units and increasing the computing power. Strong scaling and simulations close to biological time are difficult, yet required for the study of synaptic plasticity and other use cases requiring simulation of neurons for long periods of time. Current methods rely on parallel Gaussian elimination, computing triangulation and substitution of many branches simultaneously.
Existing limitations are: (a) high heterogeneity of compute time per neuron leads to high computational load imbalance; and (b) difficulty in providing a computation model that fully utilises the computing resources on distributed multi-core architectures with Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) capabilities.

To address these issues, we present a strategy that extracts flow-dependencies between parameters of the ODEs and the algebraic solver of individual neurons. Based on the resulting dependencies map, we provide three techniques for memory, communication, and computation reorganization that yield a load-balanced distributed asynchronous execution. The new computation model distributes datasets and balances computational workload across a distributed memory space, exposing a tree-based parallelism of neuron topological structure, an embarrassingly parallel execution model of neuron subtrees, and a SIMD acceleration of subtree state updates.

The capabilities of our methods are demonstrated on a prototype implementation developed on the core compute kernel of the NEURON scientific application, built on the HPX runtime system for the ParalleX execution model. Our implementation yields a fully-asynchronous  distributed and parallel simulation that accelerates single neuron to medium-sized neural networks. Benchmark results display better strong scaling properties, finer-grained parallelism, and lower time to solution compared to the state of the art, on a wide range of distributed multi-core compute architectures.</content>

 We propose event-related cortical sources estimation from subject-independent electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings for motor imagery brain computer interface (BCI). By using wavelet-based maximum entropy on the mean (wMEM), task-specific EEG channels are selected to predict right hand and right foot sensorimotor tasks, employing spatial pattern analysis with and without covariance estimation regularization. EEG from five healthy individuals (Dataset IVa, BCI Competition III) were evaluated by a cross-subject paradigm. Prediction performance was evaluated via a two-layer feed-forward neural network, where the classifier was trained and tested by data from two subjects independently. The highest mean prediction accuracy achieved by using subject-pair (ay-al) specific selected EEG channels was on average (90:36+/-5:59) and outperformed that achieved by using all available channels (83:21+/-12:26). Significant improvements in performance suggest a role of wMEM for channel selection in BCI. Spatially projected cortical sources may be useful for capturing inter-subject associative sensorimotor brain dynamics and pave the way towards subject-independent BCI.</content>

 Professional pride is a positive emotion that includes self-reflection or evaluation and attitude toward one’s own occupational group. Uniforms can encourage the wearer to have professional pride. The current study aimed to elucidate the neural basis of professional pride using an experimental task related to the self in uniform and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The person-adjective matching task, in which a participant or other in uniform or casual wear was presented with positive and negative words, was used for scanning fMRI. Imaging data from 21 adults who had an occupation requiring a uniform were analyzed to identify the main and interaction effects of individual (self vs. other), clothes (uniform vs. casual wear), and valence (positive vs. negative). Identified brain activities were correlated with psychological scales including the Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale and Group Environment Questionnaire. Whole brain analyses found that the interaction between individual and clothes was present in multiple regions such as the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, left middle and inferior temporal gyri, left posterior superior temporal sulcus, right temporoparietal junction, left lingual gyrus, left calcarine cortex, right insula, left caudate, and right putamen. In particular, activities in the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, left calcarine cortex, and right putamen in the self/uniform condition were positively correlated with several psychological scales. These results suggest that professional pride may be represented through multiple brain networks related to empathy, reward, and emotion regulation as well as the theory-of-mind network. The neural basis of professional pride is closely related to positive self-evaluation and group cohesion.</content>

 Converging results suggest that perception is controlled by rhythmic processes in the brain. In the auditory domain, neuroimaging studies show that the perception of sounds is shaped by rhythmic activity prior to the stimulus, and electrophysiological recordings have linked delta and theta band activity to the functioning of individual neurons. These results have promoted theories of rhythmic modes of listening and generally suggest that the perceptually relevant encoding of acoustic information is structured by rhythmic processes along auditory pathways. A prediction from this perspective  ̶  which so far has not been tested  ̶  is that such rhythmic processes also shape how acoustic information is combined over time to judge extended soundscapes. The present study was designed to directly test this prediction. Human participants judged the overall change in perceived frequency content in temporally extended (1.2 to 1.8 s) soundscapes, while the perceptual use of the available sensory evidence was quantified using psychophysical reverse correlation. Model-based analysis of individual participant’s perceptual weights revealed a rich temporal structure, including linear trends, a U-shaped profile tied to the overall stimulus duration, and importantly, rhythmic components at the time scale of 1 to 2Hz. The collective evidence found here across four versions of the experiment supports the notion that rhythmic processes operating on the delta time scale structure how perception samples temporally extended acoustic scenes.</content>

 Understanding how neurons arrange themselves into neural networks that result in behaviors is a major goal in neuroscience. Most theoretical and experimental efforts have focused on a top-down approach which seeks to identify neuronal correlates of behaviors. This has been accomplished by effectively mapping specific behaviors to distinct neural patterns or by creating computational models that produce a desired behavioral outcome. Nonetheless, these approaches, have only implicitly considered the fact that neural tissue, like any other physical system, is subjected to several restrictions and boundaries of operations. 
	Here, we proposed a new, bottom-up conceptual paradigm: The Energy Homeostasis Principle, where the balance between energy income, expenditure, and availability are the key parameters in determining the dynamics of neuronal phenomena found from molecular to behavioral levels. Neurons display high energy consumption relative to other cells, with metabolic consumption of the brain representing 20% of the whole-body oxygen uptake, which contrasts with this organ representing only 2% of the body weight. Also, neurons have specialized surrounding tissue that provides the necessary energy which in the case of the central nervous system, is provided by astrocytes. Moreover, and unlike other cell types with high energy demands such as muscle cells, neurons have a strict aerobic metabolism. These facts indicate that neurons are highly sensitive to energy limitations with Gibb’s free energy dictating the direction of all cellular metabolic processes. From this activity, the largest energy is by far, expended by action potentials and post-synaptic potentials, therefore, plasticity can be reinterpreted on their energy context. Consequently, neurons, through their synapses, would impose energy demands over post-synaptic neurons in a close loop-manner, modulating the dynamics of local circuits. Therefrom, energy dynamics end up impacting the homeostatic mechanisms of neuronal networks. Furthermore, local energy management emerges also as a neural population property, where most of the energy expenses are triggered by sensory or other modulatory input. Local energy management in neurons may be sufficient to explain the emergence of behavior, enabling the assessment of which and how properties arise in neural circuits. Importantly, the Energy Homeostasis Principle proposal is also readily testable in simple neuronal networks.</content>

 Background: The brain is protected by the blood-brain barrier (BBB), constituted by endothelial cells supported by pericytes and astrocytes. In Alzheimer’s Disease a dysregulation of the BBB occurs since the early phases of the disease leading to an increased access of solutes and immune cells that can participate to the central inflammatory response. Here we investigated whether astrocytes may influence endothelial-leukocytes interaction in the presence of amyloid-β (Aβ). Methods: We used an in vitro BBB model, where endothelial cells, cultured alone or with astrocytes were exposed for 5 h to Aβ, both under resting or inflammatory conditions (TNFα and IFNγ), to evaluate endothelial barrier properties, as well as transendothelial migration of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Results: In the co-culture model, barrier permeability to solutes was increased by all treatments, but migration was only observed in inflammatory conditions and was prevented by Aβ treatment. On the contrary, in endothelial monocultures, Aβ induced leukocytes migration under resting conditions and did not modify that induced by inflammatory cytokines. In endothelial astrocyte co-cultures, a low molecular weight isoform of the adhesion molecule ICAM-1, important to allow interaction with PBMCs, was increased after 5 h exposure to inflammatory cytokines, an effect that was prevented by Aβ. This modulation by Aβ was not observed in endothelial monocultures. In addition, endothelial expression of β-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III (Gnt-III), responsible for the formation of the low molecular weight ICAM-1 isoform, was enhanced in inflammatory conditions, but negatively modulated by Aβ only in the co-culture model. miR-200b, increased in astrocytes following Aβ treatment and may represent one of the factors involved in the control of Gnt-III expression. Conclusions: These data point out that, at least in the early phases of Aβ exposure, astrocytes play a role in the modulation of leucocytes migration through the endothelial layer.</content>

 It is now widely accepted that glia cells and gamma-aminobutyric acidergic (GABA) interneurons dynamically regulate synaptic transmission and neuronal activity in time and space. This paper presents a biophysical model that captures the interaction between an astrocyte cell, a GABA interneuron and pre/postsynaptic neurons. Specifically, GABA released from a GABA interneuron triggers in astrocytes the release of calcium (Ca^(2+)) from the endoplasmic reticulum via the inositol 1, 4, 5-trisphosphate (IP_3) pathway. This results in gliotransmission which elevates the presynaptic transmission probability rate (PR) causing weight potentiation and a gradual increase in postsynaptic neuronal firing, which eventually stabilises. However, by capturing the complex interactions between IP_3, generated from both GABA and the 2-arachidonyl glycerol (2-AG) pathway, and PR, this paper shows that this interaction not only gives rise to an initial weight potentiation phase but also this phase is followed by postsynaptic bursting behaviour. Moreover, the model will show that there is a presynaptic frequency range over which burst firing can occur. The proposed model offers a novel cellular level mechanism that may underpin both seizure-like activity and neuronal synchrony across different brain regions.</content>

 Primary cultures of glial and endothelial cells are important tools for basic and translational neuroscience research. Primary cell cultures are usually generated from rodent brain although considerable differences exist between human and rodent glia and endothelial cells. Because many translational research projects aim to identify mechanisms that eventually lead to diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to target human diseases, glia, and endothelial cultures are needed that better reflect the human central nervous system (CNS). Pig brain is easily accessible and, in many aspects, close to the human brain. We established an easy and cost-effective method to isolate and culture different primary glial and endothelial cells from adult pig brain. Oligodendrocyte, microglia, astrocyte and endothelial primary cell cultures were generated from the same brain tissue and grown for up to 8 weeks. Primary cells showed lineage-specific morphology and expressed specific markers with a purity ranging from 60 to 95%. Cultured oligodendrocytes myelinated neurons and microglia secreted tumor necrosis factor alpha when induced with lipopolysaccharide. Endothelial cells showed typical tube formation when grown on Matrigel. Astrocytes enhanced survival of co-cultured neurons and were killed by Aquaporin-4 antibody positive sera from patients with Neuromyelitis optica. In summary, we established a new method for primary oligodendrocyte, microglia, endothelial and astrocyte cell cultures from pig brain that provide a tool for translational research on human CNS diseases.</content>

 Sensorimotor gating refers to the ability to filter incoming sensory information in a stimulus-laden environment and disruption of this physiological process has been documented in psychiatric disorders characterized by cognitive aberrations. Lack of efficacious medications to treat sensorimotor gating perturbations signifies the need to elucidate molecular mechanisms for therapeutic intervention. Notably, we recently reported a role for purinergic P2X4 receptors (P2X4Rs) in regulation of sensorimotor gating using prepulse inhibition (PPI) of acoustic startle reflex. P2X4Rs are ion channels gated by adenosine-5’-triphosphate (ATP).  Ivermectin (IVM) induced PPI deficits in C57BL/6J mice in a P2X4R-specific manner. Furthermore, mice deficient in P2X4Rs [P2X4R knockout (KO)] exhibited PPI deficits that were alleviated by dopamine (DA) receptor antagonists demonstrating an interaction between P2X4Rs and DA receptors in PPI regulation. On the basis of these findings, we hypothesized that increased DA neurotransmission underlies IVM-mediated PPI deficits. To test this hypothesis, we measured the effects of D1 and D2 receptor antagonists, SCH 23390 and raclopride respectively and D1 agonist, SKF 82958 on IVM-mediated PPI deficits. To gain mechanistic insights, we investigated the interaction between IVM and dopaminergic drugs on signaling molecules linked to PPI regulation in the ventral striatum. SCH 23390 significantly attenuated the PPI disruptive effects of IVM to a much greater degree than that of raclopride. SKF 82958 failed to potentiate IVM-mediated PPI disruption. At the molecular level, modulation of D1 receptors altered IVM’s effects on dopamine and cyclic-AMP regulated phosphoprotein of 32kDa (DARPP-32) phosphorylation. IVM interacted with the DA receptors antagonists in regulation Ca2+/calmodulin kinase IIα (CaMKIIα) phosphorylation, but not its downstream target, neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS). Current findings suggest an involvement for D1 and D2 receptors in IVM-mediated PPI disruption via modulation of DARPP-32. Taken together, the findings suggest that stimulation of P2X4Rs can lead to DA hyperactivity and disruption of information processing, implicating P2X4Rs as a novel drug target for treatment of psychiatric disorders characterized by sensorimotor gating deficits.</content>

 Glutathione (GSH) is the most abundant intracellular antioxidant. GSH depletion leads to oxidative stress and neuronal damage in the central nervous system (CNS). In mice, the acute systemic inhibition of GSH synthesis by L-buthionine-S-R-sulfoximine (BSO) triggers a protective response and a subsequent increase in the CNS GSH content. This response might be modulated by a peripheral increment of circulating nerve growth factor (NGF). NGF is an important activator of antioxidant pathways mediated by tropomyosin-related kinase receptor A (TrkA). Here, we report that peripheral administration of BSO increased plasma NGF levels. Additionally, BSO increased NGF levels and activated the NGF/TrkA/Akt pathway in striatal neurons. Moreover, the response in the striatum included an increased transcription of nrf2, gclm, lat1, eaac1, and xct, all of which are involved in antioxidant responses, and L-cys/L-cys2 and glutamate transporters. Using antibody against NGF confirmed that peripheral NGF activated the NGF/TrkA/Akt/Nrf2 pathway in the striatum and subsequently increased the transcription of gclm, nrf2, lat1, eaac1, and xct. These results provide evidence that the reduction of peripheral GSH pools increases peripheral NGF circulation that orchestrates a neuroprotective response in the CNS, at least in the striatum, through the NGF/TrkA/Akt/Nrf2 pathway</content>

		<content type="html">
 Background: The modality effect plays the central role in learning and memory functions. Retrieval failure constitutes a common memory impairment that occurs among patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, little knowledge exists about the relation between modality effect and delayed recall impairment in PD. The primary goal of this study was to compare delayed free recall performance between three different memory modalities (verbal, visual, and cross visual-verbal) in a sample of non-demented patients with mild PD progression. The secondary goal was to explore the frequency of deficient performance on the basis of normative comparisons on each of the three delayed free-recall measures. Method: A total of 71 non-demented patients with mild Parkinson’s disease progression were recruited for the administration of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT), the Rey Osterrieth Complex Figure Test (ROCFT), and the Greek Version of Face-Name Associative Memory Examination (GR-FNAME12). Results: The percentages of deficient-performances for the three delayed free recall measures were 45.1% (32/71), 39.4% (28/71) and 31% (22/71) for the GR-FNAME12, ROFCT and RAVLT, respectively. The results indicated no significant difference between performances of the GR-FNAME12 and ROCFT, both of which were significantly lower than performance on the RAVLT. Conclusions: In conclusion, delayed free recall appears to be more severely affected in the cross visual-verbal and visual memory modalities than in verbal-memory modalities in the early phase of PD progression.</content>

 These days the important role of retinoids in adult brain functionality and homeostasis is well accepted and has been proven by genomic as well as non-genomic mechanisms. In the healthy brain, numerous biological processes e.g. cell proliferation, neurogenesis, dendritic spine formation as well as modulation of the immune system have been attributed to retinoid signaling.  This, together with the finding that retinoid metabolism is impaired in Alzheimer’s disease, led to preclinical and early clinical testing of natural and synthetic retinoids as innovative pharmaceuticals with multifactorial properties. Acitretin, an aromatic retinoid, was found to exert anti-amyloidogenic effect in mouse models for Alzheimer’s disease as well as in human patients by stimulating the alpha-secretase ADAM10. The lipophilic drug was already demonstrated to easily pass the blood brain barrier after i.p. administration and increased nest building capability in the 5xFAD mouse model. Additionally, we analyzed the immune-modulatory capacity of acitretin via a  multiplex array in the 5xFAD mouse model and evaluated some of our findings in human CSF derived from a pilot study  using acitretin. Although several serum analytes did not display changes, IL-6 was found to be significantly increased in both - mouse and human neural material. This demonstrates that acitretin exerts an immune stimulatory effect – besides the alpha-secretase induction – which could impact the alleviation of learning and memory disabilities observed in the mouse model.</content>

 Although the neural mechanism supporting episodic recollection has been well characterized in younger adults, exactly how recollection is supported in older adults remains unclear. The electrophysiological correlate of recollection – the parietal retrieval success effect – for example, has been shown to be sensitive to both the amount of information recollected and the accuracy of remembered information in younger adults. To date, there is mixed evidence that parietal effect also scales with the amount of information remembered in older adults whilst there is little evidence that the same mechanism is sensitive to the accuracy of recollected information. Here, we address one potential concern when investigating Event Related Potentials (ERPs) among older adults – namely, the greater potential for single trial latency variability to smear and reduces the amplitudes of averaged ERPs. We apply a well-established algorithm for correcting single trial latency variability, Residual Iteration Decomposition Analysis (RIDE), to investigate whether the parietal retrieval success effect among older adults is sensitive to retrieval accuracy. Our results reveal that, similar to younger adults, older adult parietal retrieval success effects scale with the accuracy of recollected information – i.e., is greater in magnitude when recollected information is of high accuracy, reduced in magnitude when accuracy is low, and entirely absent when guessing. The results help clarify the functional significance of the neural mechanism supporting recollection in older adults whilst also highlighting the potential issues with interpreting average ERPs in older adult populations.</content>

 The light environment greatly impacts human alertness, mood, and cognition by both acute regulation of physiology and indirect alignment of circadian rhythms. These processes require the melanopsin-expressing intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs), but the relevant downstream brain areas involved remain elusive. ipRGCs project widely in the brain, including to the central circadian pacemaker, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). Here we show that body temperature and sleep responses to acute light exposure are absent after genetic ablation of all ipRGCs except a subpopulation that projects to the SCN. Furthermore, by chemogenetic activation of the ipRGCs that avoid the SCN, we show that these cells are sufficient for acute changes in body temperature. Our results challenge the idea that the SCN is a major relay for the acute effects of light on non-image forming behaviors and identify the sensory cells that initiate light’s profound effects on body temperature and sleep.</content>

 Active targeting and specific drug delivery to parenchymal liver cells is a promising strategy to treat various liver disorders. Here, we modified synthetic lipid-based nanoparticles with targeting peptides derived from the hepatitis B virus large envelope protein (HBVpreS) to specifically target the sodium-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP; &lt;i&gt;SLC10A1&lt;/i&gt;) on the sinusoidal membrane of hepatocytes. Physicochemical properties of targeted nanoparticles were optimized and NTCP-specific, ligand-dependent binding and internalization was confirmed &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. The pharmacokinetics and targeting capacity of selected lead formulations was investigated &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; using the emerging zebrafish screening model. Liposomal nanoparticles modified with 0.25 mol% of a short myristoylated HBV derived peptide, &lt;i&gt;i.e.&lt;/i&gt; Myr‑HBVpreS2-31, showed an optimal balance between systemic circulation, avoidance of blood clearance, and targeting capacity. Pronounced liver enrichment, active NTCP‑mediated targeting of hepatocytes and efficient cellular internalization were confirmed in mice by &lt;sup&gt;111&lt;/sup&gt;In gamma scintigraphy and fluorescence microscopy demonstrating the potential use of our hepatotropic, ligand-modified nanoparticles.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Development of pharmacotherapies that promote remyelination are a high priority for multiple sclerosis (MS) due to their potential for neuroprotection and restoration of function through repair of demyelinated lesions. A novel preparation of clean-surfaced, faceted gold nanocrystals demonstrated robust remyelinating activity in response to demyelinating agents in both chronic cuprizone and acute lysolecithin rodent animal models. Furthermore, oral delivery of gold nanocrystals improved motor functions of cuprizone-treated mice in both open field and kinematic gait studies. Gold nanocrystal treatment of oligodendrocyte precursor cells in culture resulted in oligodendrocyte maturation and expression of key myelin differentiation markers. Additional in vitro data demonstrated that these gold nanocrystals act via a novel energy metabolism pathway involving the enhancement of key indicators of aerobic glycolysis. In response to gold nanocrystals, co-cultured central nervous system cells exhibited elevated levels of the redox coenzyme nicotine adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), elevated total ATP levels, elevated extracellular lactate levels, and upregulation of myelin-synthesis related genes, collectively resulting in functional myelin generation. Based on these preclinical studies, clean-surfaced, faceted gold nanocrystals represent a novel remyelinating therapeutic for multiple sclerosis.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Sleep is pivotal for the consolidation of memories [1]. According to two-stage accounts, experiences are temporarily stored in the hippocampus and gradually translocated to neocortical sites during non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep [2,3]. Mechanistically, information transfer is thought to rely on interactions between thalamocortical spindles and hippocampal ripples. In particular, spindles may open precisely-timed communication channels, across which reactivation patterns may travel between the hippocampus and cortical target sites when ripples occur. To test this hypothesis, we first derived time-frequency representations (TFRs) in hippocampus (HIPP) and at scalp electrode Cz (neocortex, NC) time-locked to individual hippocampal ripple events. Compared to matched ripple-free intervals, results revealed a concurrent increase in spindle power both in HIPP and NC. As revealed by coherence analysis, hippocampal-neocortical coupling was indeed enhanced in the spindle band around ripples. Finally, we examined the directionality of spindle coupling and observed a strong driving effect from NC to HIPP. Specifically, ~250 ms prior to the HIPP ripple, NC spindles emerge and entrain HIPP spindles. Both regions then remain synchronised until ~500 ms after the ripple. Consistent with recent rodent work, these findings suggest that active consolidation is initiated by neocortex and draws on neocortical-hippocampal-neocortical reactivation loops [4], with a role of sleep spindles in mediating this process.</content>

		<content type="html">
 The human brain is a patchwork of different functionally specialized areas. What determines this functional organization of cortex? One hypothesis is that innate connectivity patterns shape functional organization by setting up a scaffold upon which functional specialization can later take place. We tested this hypothesis here by asking whether the visual word form area (VWFA), an experience-driven region that only becomes selective to visual words after gaining literacy, was already connected to proto language networks in neonates scanned within one week of birth. We found that neonates showed adult-like functional connectivity, and observed that i) the VWFA connected more strongly with frontal and temporal language regions than regions adjacent to these language regions (e.g., frontal attentional demand, temporal auditory regions), and ii) language regions connected more strongly with the putative VWFA than other adjacent ventral visual regions that also show foveal bias (e.g. fusiform face area, FFA). Object regions showed similar connectivity with language areas as the VWFA but not with face areas in neonates, arguing against prior hypotheses that the region that becomes the VWFA starts out with a selectivity for faces. These data suggest that the location of the VWFA is earmarked at birth due to its connectivity with the language network, providing novel evidence that innate connectivity instructs the later refinement of cortex.</content>

 Following its evoked release, extracellular dopamine (DA) levels are stringently controlled by presynaptic reuptake, mediated by the cocaine-sensitive dopamine (DA) transporter (DAT). Multiple DAT coding variants have been identified in DA-related neuropsychiatric disorders, illustrating the critical role that DAT plays to maintain DAergic homeostasis. DAT is dynamically regulated by endocytic trafficking. Protein kinase C (PKC) activation accelerates DAT internalization and acutely diminishes DAT surface expression. In cell lines, PKC-stimulated DAT endocytosis requires both Ack1 inactivation, which releases a DAT-specific endocytic brake, and the neuronal GTPase, Rit2, which binds DAT. However, it is unknown whether PKC-stimulated DAT endocytosis in DAergic terminals requires Rit2, or whether there are region- or sex-dependent differences in Rit2-dependent DAT trafficking. Moreover, the intrinsic determinants that mediate the DAT-Rit2 interaction are undefined, as are the mechanisms through which Rit2 controls PKC-stimulated DAT endocytosis. Here, we leveraged an AAV-mediated approach to conditionally knockdown Rit2 in vivo in DAergic neurons, and found that Rit2 was required for steady state DAT surface expression and PKC-stimulated DAT internalization, with marked sex- and region-specific differences. FRET and surface pulldown studies in cell lines revealed that PKC activation drives DAT-Rit2 surface dissociation, and the DAT N-terminus is required for both DAT-Rit2 dissociation and stimulated DAT internalization in response to PKC activation. Finally, we found that Rit2 and Ack1 independently converge on DAT to facilitate PKC-stimulated DAT endocytosis. Together, our data provide greater insight into mechanisms that mediate PKC-regulated DAT internalization, and reveal striking region- and sex-specific differences in PKC-stimulated DAT trafficking in bona fide DAergic terminals.</content>

		<content type="html">
 The &quot;core language network&quot; consists of left temporal and frontal regions that are selectively engaged in linguistic processing. Whereas the functional differences across these regions have long been debated, many accounts propose distinctions in terms of representational grain-size - e.g., words vs. sentences - or processing time-scale, i.e., operating on local linguistic features vs. larger spans of input. Indeed, the topography of language regions appears to overlap with a cortical hierarchy reported by Lerner et al. (2011) wherein mid-posterior temporal regions are sensitive to low-level features of speech, surrounding areas - to word-level information, and inferior frontal areas - to sentence-level information and beyond. However, the correspondence between the language network and this hierarchy of &quot;temporal receptive windows&quot; (TRWs) is difficult to establish because the precise anatomical locations of language regions vary across individuals. To directly test this correspondence, we first identified language regions in each participant with a task-based localizer, which confers high functional resolution to the study of TRWs (traditionally based on stereotactic coordinates); then, we characterized regional TRWs on with the naturalistic story listening paradigm of Lerner et al. (2011), which augments task-based characterizations of the language network by more closely resembling comprehension &quot;in the wild&quot;. We find no region-by-TRW interactions across temporal and inferior frontal regions, which are all sensitive to both word-level and sentence-level information. Therefore, the language network as a whole constitutes a unique stage of information integration within a broader cortical hierarchy.</content>

 Humans can rapidly and flexibly coordinate their movements with external stimuli. Theoretical considerations suggest that this flexibility can be understood in terms of how sensory responses reconfigure the neural circuits that control movements. However, because external stimuli can occur at unexpected times, it is unclear how the corresponding sensory inputs can be used to exert flexible control over the ongoing activity of recurrent neural circuits. Here, we tackle this problem in the domain of sensorimotor timing and develop a circuit-level model that provides insight into how the brain coordinates movement times with expected and unexpected temporal events. The model consists of two interacting modules, a motor planning module that controls movement times and a sensory anticipation module that anticipates external events. Both modules harbor a reservoir of latent dynamics and their interaction forms a control system whose output is adjusted adaptively to minimize timing errors. We show that the model's output matches human behavior in a range of tasks including time interval production, periodic production, synchronization/continuation, and Bayesian time interval reproduction. These results demonstrate how recurrent interactions in a simple and modular neural circuit could create the dynamics needed to control temporal aspects of behavior.</content>

 The zebrafish pineal organ is a photoreceptive structure containing two main neuronal populations (photoreceptors and projections neurons). Here we describe a new pineal cell type that harbors both characteristics of projection neurons and photoreceptors. Indeed, a subpopulation of projection neurons expresses the melanopsin gene opn4xa suggesting photoreceptive properties. This population of hybrid cell fates, share a similar behaviour regarding dependency for BMP and Notch signalling pathways with classical non-photosensitive projection neurons (PNs) suggesting they are closer to the PN population. We describe two distinct types of activity within PNs: an achromatic LIGHT OFF activity in opn4xa- PNs and a LIGHT ON activity elicited by green and blue light in opn4xa+ PNs. Altogether the discovery and characterization of opn4xa+ PNs suggest a previously unanticipated heterogeneity in the projection neuron population.</content>

 Higher levels of visual processing are progressively more invariant to low-level visual factors such as contrast. Although this invariance trend has been well documented for simple stimuli like gratings and lines, it is difficult to characterize such invariances in images with naturalistic complexity. Here, we use a generative image model based on a hierarchy of learned visual features - a Generative Adversarial Network - to constrain image manipulations to remain within the vicinity of the manifold of natural images. This allows us to quantitatively characterize visual discrimination behaviour for naturalistically complex, non-linear image manipulations. We find that human tuning to such manipulations has a factorial structure. The first factor governs image contrast with discrimination thresholds following a power law with an exponent between 0.5 and 0.6, similar to contrast discrimination performance for simpler stimuli. A second factor governs image content with approximately constant discrimination thresholds throughout the range of images studied. These results support the idea that human perception factors out image contrast relatively early on, allowing later stages of processing to extract higher level image features in a stable and robust way.</content>

 Neuronal types in the central nervous system differ dramatically in their resilience to injury or insults. Here we studied the selective resilience of mouse retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) following optic nerve crush (ONC), which severs their axons and leads to death of ~80% of RGCs within 2 weeks. To identify expression programs associated with differential resilience, we first used single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) to generate a comprehensive molecular atlas of 46 RGC types in adult retina. We then tracked their survival after ONC, characterized transcriptomic, physiological, and morphological changes that preceded degeneration, and identified genes selectively expressed by each type. Finally, using loss- and gain-of-function assays in vivo, we showed that manipulating some of these genes improved neuronal survival and axon regeneration following ONC. This study provides a systematic framework for parsing type-specific responses to injury, and demonstrates that differential gene expression can be used to reveal molecular targets for intervention.</content>

Humans can easily describe, imagine, and, crucially, &lt;i&gt;predict&lt;/i&gt; a wide variety of behaviors of liquids—splashing, squirting, gushing, sloshing, soaking, dripping, draining, trickling, pooling, and pouring—despite tremendous variability in their material and dynamical properties. Here we propose and test a computational model of how people perceive and predict these liquid dynamics, based on coarse approximate simulations of fluids as collections of interacting particles. Our model is analogous to a “game engine in the head”, drawing on techniques for interactive simulations (as in video games) that optimize for efficiency and natural appearance rather than physical accuracy. In two behavioral experiments, we found that the model accurately captured people’s predictions about how liquids flow among complex solid obstacles, and was significantly better than two alternatives based on simple heuristics and deep neural networks. Our model was also able to explain how people’s predictions varied as a function of the liquids’ properties (e.g., viscosity and stickiness). Together, the model and empirical results extend the recent proposal that human physical scene understanding for the dynamics of rigid, solid objects can be supported by approximate probabilistic simulation, to the more complex and unexplored domain of fluid dynamics.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HdFwenUGB3I&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

In recent years, increasing associations between microRNAs (miRNAs) and human diseases have been identified. Based on accumulating biological data, many computational models for potential miRNA-disease associations inference have been developed, which saves time and expenditure on experimental studies, making great contributions to researching molecular mechanism of human diseases and developing new drugs for disease treatment. In this paper, we proposed a novel computational method named Ensemble of Decision Tree based MiRNA-Disease Association prediction (EDTMDA), which innovatively built a computational framework integrating ensemble learning and dimensionality reduction. For each miRNA-disease pair, the feature vector was extracted by calculating the statistical measures, graph theoretical measures, and matrix factorization results for the miRNA and disease, respectively. Then multiple base learnings were built to yield many decision trees (DTs) based on random selection of negative samples and miRNA/disease features. Particularly, Principal Components Analysis was applied to each base learning to reduce feature dimensionality and hence remove the noise or redundancy. Average strategy was adopted for these DTs to get final association scores between miRNAs and diseases. In model performance evaluation, EDTMDA showed AUC of 0.9309 in global leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) and AUC of 0.8524 in local LOOCV. Additionally, AUC of 0.9192+/-0.0009 in 5-fold cross validation proved the model’s reliability and stability. Furthermore, three types of case studies for four human diseases were implemented. As a result, 94% (Esophageal Neoplasms), 86% (Kidney Neoplasms), 96% (Breast Neoplasms) and 88% (Carcinoma Hepatocellular) of top 50 predicted miRNAs were confirmed by experimental evidences in literature.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/NTml9lcjzb8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Intrinsic disorder is more abundant in eukaryotic than prokaryotic proteins. Methods predicting intrinsic disorder are based on the amino acid sequence of a protein. Therefore, there must exist an underlying difference in the sequences between eukaryotic and prokaryotic proteins causing the (predicted) difference in intrinsic disorder. By comparing proteins, from complete eukaryotic and prokaryotic proteomes, we show that the difference in intrinsic disorder emerges from the linker regions connecting Pfam domains. Eukaryotic proteins have more extended linker regions, and in addition, the eukaryotic linkers are significantly more disordered, 38% vs. 12-16% disordered residues. Next, we examined the underlying reason for the increase in disorder in eukaryotic linkers, and we found that the changes in abundance of only three amino acids cause the increase. Eukaryotic proteins contain 8.6% serine; while prokaryotic proteins have 6.5%, eukaryotic proteins also contain 5.4% proline and 5.3% isoleucine compared with 4.0% proline and ≈ 7.5% isoleucine in the prokaryotes. All these three differences contribute to the increased disorder in eukaryotic proteins. It is tempting to speculate that the increase in serine frequencies in eukaryotes is related to regulation by kinases, but direct evidence for this is lacking. The differences are observed in all phyla, protein families, structural regions and type of protein but are most pronounced in disordered and linker regions. The observation that differences in the abundance of three amino acids cause the difference in disorder between eukaryotic and prokaryotic proteins raises the question: Are amino acid frequencies different in eukaryotic linkers because the linkers are more disordered or do the differences cause the increased disorder?&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/VF5f6giyZIo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

The collection of immunoglobulin genes in an individual’s germline, which gives rise to B cell receptors via recombination, is known to vary significantly across individuals. In humans, for example, each individual has only a fraction of the several hundred known V alleles. Furthermore, the currently-accepted set of known V alleles is both incomplete (particularly for non-European samples), and contains a significant number of spurious alleles. The resulting uncertainty as to which immunoglobulin alleles are present in any given sample results in inaccurate B cell receptor sequence annotations, and in particular inaccurate inferred naive ancestors. In this paper we first show that the currently widespread practice of aligning each sequence to its closest match in the full set of IMGT alleles results in a very large number of spurious alleles that are not in the sample’s true set of germline V alleles. We then describe a new method for inferring each individual’s germline gene set from deep sequencing data, and show that it improves upon existing methods by making a detailed comparison on a variety of simulated and real data samples. This new method has been integrated into the partis annotation and clonal family inference package, available at https://github.com/psathyrella/partis, and is run by default without affecting overall run time.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/XWDkjKZG-o0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Alternative transcript isoforms are common in tumors and act as potential drivers of cancer. Mechanisms determining altered isoform expression include somatic mutations in splice regulatory sites or altered splicing factors. However, since DNA methylation is known to regulate transcriptional isoform activity in normal cells, we predicted the highly dysregulated patterns of DNA methylation present in cancer also affect isoform activity. We analyzed DNA methylation and RNA-seq isoform data from 18 human cancer types and found frequent correlations specifically within 11 cancer types. Examining the top 25% of variable methylation sites revealed that the location of the methylated CpG site in a gene determined which isoform was used. In addition, the correlated methylation-isoform patterns classified tumors into known subtypes and predicted distinct protein functions between tumor subtypes. Finally, methylation-correlated isoforms were enriched for oncogenes, tumor suppressors, and cancer-related pathways. These findings provide new insights into the functional impact of dysregulated DNA methylation in cancer and highlight the relationship between the epigenome and transcriptome.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/fcxHiY8fFgU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 ABSTRACT&lt;p&gt;Many experimental approaches require housing rodents in individual cages, including in epilepsy research. However, rats and mice are social animals; and individual housing constitutes a stressful situation. The goal of the present study was to determine the effects of individual housing as compared to conditions maintaining social contact on stress markers and epilepsy. Control male mice socially housed during pretest and then transferred to individual cages for six weeks displayed anhedonia, increased anxiety and biological markers of stress as compared to pretest values or mice kept socially housed during six weeks. Pilocarpine-treated mice housed together showed increased levels of anhedonia, anxiety and stress markers as well as decreased cognitive performance as compared to the control group. The differences were more significant in pilocarpine-treated mice housed individually. Anxiety correlated linearly with cognitive performance and stress markers independently of the experimental conditions. In the male rat pilocarpine model, seizures were sixteen times more frequent in singly housed animals as compared to animals kept in pairs. Daily interactions with an experimenter in otherwise singly housed animals was sufficient to produce results identical to those found in animals kept in pairs. We propose that social isolation produces a severe phenotype in terms of stress and seizure frequency as compared to animals maintaining social contact (at least in these two models), a factor that needs to be taken into account for data interpretation, in particular for preclinical studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Many experimental approaches require housing rodents in individual cages, a stressful condition for social animals, even in an enriched environment context. Using the pilocarpine model of epilepsy in rats and mice, we report that singly housing animals develop a more severe phenotype in terms of stress and epilepsy as compared to animals maintaining social contact. We propose that social isolation adds a degree of complexity for the interpretation of data, which may be particularly relevant for preclinical studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract&lt;p&gt;The paraventricular hypothalamus (PVH) regulates stress, feeding behaviors and other homeostatic processes, but whether PVH also drives defensive states remains unknown. Here we showed that photostimulation of PVH neurons in mice elicited escape jumping, a typical defensive behavior. We mapped PVH outputs that densely terminate in the ventral midbrain area, and found that activation of the PVH-&amp;gt;ventral midbrain (vMB) circuit produced profound defensive behavioral changes, including escape jumping, hiding, hyperlocomotion, and learned aversion. Electrophysiological recordings showed excitatory post-synaptic input onto ventral midbrain neurons via PVH fiber activation, and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; studies demonstrated that glutamate transmission from PVH-&amp;gt;vMB was required for the evoked behavioral responses. Photostimulation of PVH-&amp;gt;vMB fibers induced cFos expression mainly in non-dopaminergic neurons. Using a dual optogenetic-chemogenetic strategy, we further revealed that escape jumping and hiding were partially contributed by the activation of midbrain glutamatergic neurons. Taken together, our work unveils a hypothalamic-vMB circuit that encodes defensive properties, which may be implicated in normal stress-induced defensive responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Paraventricular hypothalamus (PVH) neurons are known to be involved in various homeostatic regulation. Despite the known activation of PVH neurons by various stresses, whether these neurons are directly involved in defensive behaviors during stressful events is not clear. This study reveals a direction projection from PVH to ventral midbrain (vMB) regions. Acute activation of either PVH neurons or specific PVH-&amp;gt;vMB projections elicited stress, escape jumping, hiding and learned aversion, all related to defensive behaviors, which was partially contributed by midbrain glutamatergic neurons. Our study thus identifies a previously unknown role for the PVH-&amp;gt;vMB neural pathway in promoting a defensive behavioral program.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to older Caucasians, older African Americans have higher risks of developing Alzheimer disease (AD) and lower cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tau biomarker levels. It is not known whether tau‐related differences begin earlier in life or whether race modifies other AD‐related biomarkers such as inflammatory proteins.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We performed multiplex cytokine analysis in a healthy middle‐aged cohort with family history of AD (n = 68) and an older cohort (n = 125) with normal cognition (NC), mild cognitive impairment, or AD dementia. After determining baseline interleukin (IL)‐9 level and AD‐associated IL‐9 change to differ according to race, we performed immunohistochemical analysis for proteins mechanistically linked to IL‐9 in brains of African Americans and Caucasians (n = 38), and analyzed postmortem IL‐9–related gene expression profiles in the publicly available Mount Sinai cohort (26 African Americans and 180 Caucasians).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to Caucasians with NC, African Americans with NC had lower CSF tau, p‐Tau&lt;sub&gt;181&lt;/sub&gt;, and IL‐9 levels in both living cohorts. Conversely, AD was only correlated with increased CSF IL‐9 levels in African Americans but not Caucasians. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed perivascular, neuronal, and glial cells immunoreactive to IL‐9, and quantitative analysis in independent US cohorts showed AD to correlate with molecular changes (upstream differentiation marker and downstream effector cell marker) of IL‐9 upregulation only in African Americans but not Caucasians.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baseline and AD‐associated IL‐9 differences between African Americans and Caucasians point to distinct molecular phenotypes for AD according to ancestry. Genetic and nongenetic factors need to be considered in future AD research involving unique populations. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The substantial clinical improvement in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients treated with mechanical thrombectomy (MT), combined with the poor response of proximal intracranial occlusions to intravenous thrombolysis (IVT), led to questions regarding the utility of bridging therapy (BT; IVT followed by MT) compared to direct mechanical thrombectomy (dMT) for AIS patients with large vessel occlusion (LVO).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We aimed to investigate the comparative safety and efficacy of BT and dMT in AIS patients. We included all observational studies and post hoc analyses from randomized controlled clinical trials that provided data on the outcomes of AIS patients with LVO stratified by IVT treatment status prior to MT.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified 38 eligible observational studies (11,798 LVO patients, mean age = 68 years, 56% treated with BT). In unadjusted analyses, BT was associated with a higher likelihood of 3‐month functional independence (odds ratio [OR] = 1.52, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.32–1.76), 3‐month functional improvement (common OR [cOR] for 1‐point decrease in modified Rankin Scale score = 1.52, 95% CI = 1.18–1.97), early neurological improvement (OR = 1.21, 95% CI = 1.83–1.76), successful recanalization (OR = 1.22, 95% CI = 1.02–1.46), and successful recanalization with ≤2 device passes (OR = 2.28, 95% CI = 1.43–3.64) compared to dMT. BT was also related to a lower likelihood of 3‐month mortality (OR = 0.64, 95% CI = 0.57–0.73). In the adjusted analyses, BT was independently associated with a higher likelihood of 3‐month functional independence (adjusted OR = 1.55, 95% CI = 1.26–1.91) and lower odds of 3‐month mortality (adjusted OR = 0.80, 95% CI = 0.66–0.97) compared to dMT. The two groups did not differ in functional improvement (adjusted cOR = 1.24, 95% CI = 0.89–1.74) or symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (adjusted OR = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.61–1.25).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BT appears to be associated with improved functional independence without evidence for safety concerns, compared to dMT, for AIS patients with LVO. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Task-based modeling with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) has emerged as a
popular way to infer the computational function of different brain regions.
These models are quantitatively assessed by comparing the low-dimensional
neural representations of the model with the brain, for example using canonical
correlation analysis (CCA). However, the nature of the detailed neurobiological
inferences one can draw from such efforts remains elusive. For example, to what
extent does training neural networks to solve common tasks uniquely determine
the network dynamics, independent of modeling architectural choices? Or
alternatively, are the learned dynamics highly sensitive to different model
choices? Knowing the answer to these questions has strong implications for
whether and how we should use task-based RNN modeling to understand brain
dynamics. To address these foundational questions, we study populations of
thousands of networks, with commonly used RNN architectures, trained to solve
neuroscientifically motivated tasks and characterize their nonlinear dynamics.
We find the geometry of the RNN representations can be highly sensitive to
different network architectures, yielding a cautionary tale for measures of
similarity that rely representational geometry, such as CCA. Moreover, we find
that while the geometry of neural dynamics can vary greatly across
architectures, the underlying computational scaffold---the topological
structure of fixed points, transitions between them, limit cycles, and
linearized dynamics---often appears universal across all architectures.

 &lt;p&gt;Brain lesions, including stroke and tumours, have a high degree of
variability in terms of location, size, intensity and form, making automatic
segmentation difficult. We propose an improvement to existing segmentation
methods by exploiting the bilateral quasi-symmetry of healthy brains, which
breaks down when lesions are present. Specifically, we use nonlinear
registration of a neuroimage to a reflected version of itself (&quot;reflective
registration&quot;) to determine for each voxel its homologous (corresponding) voxel
in the other hemisphere. A patch around the homologous voxel is added as a set
of new features to the segmentation algorithm. To evaluate this method, we
implemented two different CNN-based multimodal MRI stroke lesion segmentation
algorithms, and then augmented them by adding extra symmetry features using the
reflective registration method described above. For each architecture, we
compared the performance with and without symmetry augmentation, on the SISS
Training dataset of the Ischemic Stroke Lesion Segmentation Challenge (ISLES)
2015 challenge. Using affine reflective registration improves performance over
baseline, but nonlinear reflective registration gives significantly better
results: an improvement in Dice coefficient of 13 percentage points over
baseline for one architecture and 9 points for the other. We argue for the
broad applicability of adding symmetric features to existing segmentation
algorithms, specifically using nonlinear, template-free methods.

 &lt;p&gt;Recent work has sought to understand the behavior of neural networks by
comparing representations between layers and between different trained models.
We examine methods for comparing neural network representations based on
canonical correlation analysis (CCA). We show that CCA belongs to a family of
statistics for measuring multivariate similarity, but that neither CCA nor any
other statistic that is invariant to invertible linear transformation can
measure meaningful similarities between representations of higher dimension
than the number of data points. We introduce a similarity index that measures
the relationship between representational similarity matrices and does not
suffer from this limitation. This similarity index is equivalent to centered
kernel alignment (CKA) and is also closely connected to CCA. Unlike CCA, CKA
can reliably identify correspondences between representations in networks
trained from different initializations.

		<content type="html">
 Upon membrane depolarization, the KCNQ1 potassium channel opens at the intermediate (IO) and activated (AO) states of the stepwise voltage sensing domain (VSD) activation. In the heart, KCNQ1 associates with KCNE1 subunits to form I&lt;sub&gt;Ks&lt;/sub&gt; channels that regulate heart rhythm. KCNE1 suppresses the IO state so that the I&lt;sub&gt;Ks&lt;/sub&gt; channel opens only to the AO state. Here, we tested modulations of human KCNQ1 channels by an activator ML277 in &lt;i&gt;Xenopus &lt;/i&gt;oocytes. It exclusively changes the pore opening properties of the AO state without altering the IO state, but does not affect VSD activation. These observations support a distinctive mechanism responsible for the VSD-pore coupling at the AO state that is sensitive to ML277 modulation. ML277 provides insights and a tool to investigate the gating mechanism of KCNQ1 channels, and our study reveals a new strategy for treating long QT syndrome by specifically enhancing the AO state of native I&lt;sub&gt;Ks&lt;/sub&gt; currents.</content>

 Neural progenitors undergo temporal patterning to generate diverse neurons in a chronological order. This process is well-studied in the developing &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; brain and conserved in mammals. During larval stages, intermediate neural progenitors (INPs) serially express Dichaete (D), grainyhead (Grh) and eyeless (Ey/Pax6), but how the transitions are regulated is not precisely understood. Here, we developed a method to isolate transcriptomes of INPs in their distinct temporal states to identify a complete set of temporal patterning factors. Our analysis identifies odd-paired (opa), as a key regulator of temporal patterning. Temporal patterning is initiated when the SWI/SNF complex component Osa induces D and its repressor Opa at the same time but with distinct kinetics. Then, high Opa levels repress D to allow Grh transcription and progress to the next temporal state. We propose that Osa and its target genes opa and D form an incoherent feedforward loop (FFL) and a new mechanism allowing the successive expression of temporal identities.</content>

 Social interactions have a major impact on well-being. While many individuals actively seek social situations, others avoid them, at great cost to their private and professional life. The neural mechanisms underlying individual differences in social approach or avoidance tendencies are poorly understood. Here we estimated people's subjective value of engaging in a social situation. In each trial, more or less socially anxious participants chose between an interaction with a human partner providing social feedback and a monetary amount. With increasing social anxiety, the subjective value of social engagement decreased; amygdala BOLD response during decision-making and when experiencing social feedback increased; ventral striatum BOLD response to positive social feedback decreased; and connectivity between these regions during decision-making increased. Amygdala response was negatively related to the subjective value of social engagement. These findings suggest a relation between trait social anxiety / social avoidance and activity in a subcortical network during social decision-making.</content>

 Glucocorticoid receptors (GR) have diverse functions relevant to maintenance of homeostasis and adaptation to environmental challenges. Understanding the importance of tissue-specific GR function in physiology and behavior has been hampered by near-ubiquitous localization in brain and body. Here we use CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to create a conditional &lt;i&gt;GR&lt;/i&gt; knockdown in Sprague Dawley rats. To test the impact of cell- and region-specific &lt;i&gt;GR&lt;/i&gt; knockdown on physiology and behavior, we targeted &lt;i&gt;GR&lt;/i&gt; knockdown to output neurons of the prelimbic cortex. Prelimbic knockdown of &lt;i&gt;GR&lt;/i&gt; in females caused deficits in acquisition and extinction of fear memory during auditory fear conditioning, whereas males exhibited enhanced active-coping behavior during forced swim. Our data support the utility of this conditional knockdown rat to afford high-precision knockdown of &lt;i&gt;GR&lt;/i&gt; across a variety of contexts, ranging from neuronal depletion to circuit-wide manipulations, leveraging the behavioral tractability and enhanced brain size of the rat as a model organism.</content>

Recent work has begun to elucidate the vascular and neural mechanisms underlying the BOLD signal. The dilatory response is distributed throughout the vascular network. Arteries actively dilate within a second following neural activity increases, while venous distensions are passive and have a time course that last tens of seconds. Vasodilation, and thus local blood flow, is controlled by the activity of both neurons and astrocytes via multiple different pathways. The relationship between sensory-driven neural activity and the vascular dynamics in sensory areas are well-captured with a linear convolution model. However, depending on the behavioral state or brain region, the coupling between neural activity and hemodynamic signals can be weak or even inverted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maternal autoantibodies are a risk factor for impaired brain development in the offspring. Antibodies (AB) against the NR1 (GluN1) subunit of the &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;‐Methyl‐D‐Aspartate‐receptor (NMDAR) are among the most frequently diagnosed anti‐neuronal surface AB, yet little is known about effects on fetal development during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We established a murine model of &lt;i&gt;in utero&lt;/i&gt; exposure to human recombinant NR1 and isotype‐matched non‐reactive control (CTL) ABs. Pregnant C57BL/6J mice were intraperitoneally injected on embryonic days 13 and 17 each with 240 μg of human monoclonal AB. Offspring were investigated for acute and chronic effects on NMDAR function, brain development and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transferred NR1 AB enriched in the fetus and bound to synaptic structures in the fetal brain. Density of NMDAR was considerably reduced (up to ‐49.2%) and electrophysiological properties altered, reflected by decreased amplitudes of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents in young neonates (‐34.4%). NR1 AB‐treated animals displayed increased early postnatal mortality (+27.2%), impaired neurodevelopmental reflexes, altered blood pH and reduced bodyweight. During adolescence and adulthood, animals showed hyperactivity (+27.8% median activity over 14 days), lower anxiety and impaired sensorimotor gating. NR1 AB caused long‐lasting neuropathological effects also in aged mice (10 months), such as reduced volumes of cerebellum, midbrain and brainstem.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data collectively support a model in which asymptomatic mothers can harbor low‐level pathogenic human NR1 AB that are diaplacentally transferred causing neurotoxic effects on neonatal development. Thus, AB‐mediated network changes may represent a – potentially treatable – neurodevelopmental congenital brain disorder contributing to lifelong neuropsychiatric morbidity in affected children.&lt;/p&gt;

Exposure to the environmental toxin β-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA) is linked to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), but its disease-promoting mechanism remains unknown. We propose that incorporation of BMAA into the ALS-linked protein Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) upon translation promotes protein misfolding and aggregation, which has been linked to ALS onset and progression. Using molecular simulation and predictive energetic computation, we demonstrate that substituting any serine with BMAA in SOD1 results in structural destabilization and aberrant dynamics, promoting neurotoxic SOD1 aggregation. We propose that translational incorporation of BMAA into SOD1 is directly responsible for its toxicity in neurodegeneration, and BMAA modification of SOD1 may serve as a biomarker of ALS.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/5Ymu5r0qzrg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

The olfactory system faces the difficult task of identifying an enormous variety of odors independent of their intensity. Primacy coding, where the odor identity is encoded by the receptor types that respond earliest, might provide a compact and informative representation that can be interpreted efficiently by the brain. In this paper, we analyze the information transmitted by a simple model of primacy coding using numerical simulations and statistical descriptions. We show that the encoded information depends strongly on the number of receptor types included in the primacy representation, but only weakly on the size of the receptor repertoire. The representation is independent of the odor intensity and the transmitted information is useful to perform typical olfactory tasks with close to experimentally measured performance. Interestingly, we find situations in which a smaller receptor repertoire is advantageous for discriminating odors. The model also suggests that overly sensitive receptor types could dominate the entire response and make the whole array useless, which allows us to predict how receptor arrays need to adapt to stay useful during environmental changes. Taken together, we show that primacy coding is more useful than simple binary and normalized coding, essentially because the sparsity of the odor representations is independent of the odor statistics, in contrast to the alternatives. Primacy coding thus provides an efficient odor representation that is independent of the odor intensity and might thus help to identify odors in the olfactory cortex.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/AhDU8Jjko68&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

To gain insights into complex biological processes, genome-scale data (e.g., RNA-Seq) are often overlaid on biochemical networks. However, many networks do not have a one-to-one relationship between genes and network edges, due to the existence of isozymes and protein complexes. Therefore, decisions must be made on how to overlay data onto networks. For example, for metabolic networks, these decisions include (1) how to integrate gene expression levels using gene-protein-reaction rules, (2) the approach used for selection of thresholds on expression data to consider the associated gene as “active”, and (3) the order in which these steps are imposed. However, the influence of these decisions has not been systematically tested. We compared 20 decision combinations using a transcriptomic dataset across 32 tissues and showed that definition of which reaction may be considered as active (i.e., reactions of the GEM with a non-zero expression level after overlaying the data) is mainly influenced by thresholding approach used. To determine the most appropriate decisions, we evaluated how these decisions impact the acquisition of tissue-specific active reaction lists that recapitulate organ-system tissue groups. These results will provide guidelines to improve data analyses with biochemical networks and facilitate the construction of context-specific metabolic models.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/IGf3Mi8gFB0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Neurons in different layers of sensory cortex generally have different functional properties. But what determines firing rates and tuning properties of neurons in different layers? Orientation selectivity in primary visual cortex (V1) is an interesting case to study these questions. Thalamic projections essentially determine the preferred orientation of neurons that receive direct input. But how is this tuning propagated though layers, and how can selective responses emerge in layers that do not have direct access to the thalamus? Here we combine numerical simulations with mathematical analyses to address this problem. We find that a large-scale network, which just accounts for experimentally measured layer and cell-type specific connection probabilities, yields firing rates and orientation selectivities matching electrophysiological recordings in rodent V1 surprisingly well. Further analysis, however, is complicated by the fact that neuronal responses emerge in a dynamic fashion and cannot be directly inferred from static neuroanatomy, as some connections tend to have unintuitive effects due to recurrent interactions and strong feedback loops. These emergent phenomena can be understood by linearizing and coarse-graining. In fact, we were able to derive a low-dimensional linear dynamical system effectively describing stimulus-driven activity layer by layer. This low-dimensional system explains layer-specific firing rates and orientation tuning by accounting for the different gain factors of the aggregate system. Our theory can also be used to design novel optogenetic stimulation experiments, thus facilitating further exploration of the interplay between connectivity and function.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/GwHAvWDsFQ8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Replicating recombinant vector vaccines consist of a fully competent viral vector backbone engineered to express an antigen from a foreign transgene. From the perspective of viral replication, the transgene is not only dispensable but may even be detrimental. Thus vaccine revertants that delete or inactivate the transgene may evolve to dominate the vaccine virus population both during the process of manufacture of the vaccine as well as during the course of host infection. A particular concern is that this vaccine evolution could reduce its antigenicity—the immunity elicited to the transgene. We use mathematical and computational models to study vaccine evolution and immunity. These models include evolution arising during the process of manufacture, the dynamics of vaccine and revertant growth, plus innate and adaptive immunity elicited during the course of infection. Although the selective basis of vaccine evolution is easy to comprehend, the immunological consequences are not. One complication is that the opportunity for vaccine evolution is limited by the short period of within-host growth before the viral population is cleared. Even less obvious, revertant growth may only weakly interfere with vaccine growth in the host and thus have a limited effect on immunity to vaccine. Overall, we find that within-host vaccine evolution can sometimes compromise vaccine immunity, but only when the extent of evolution during vaccine manufacture is severe, and this evolution can be easily avoided or mitigated.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/iikrlkzvo2Q&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Adverse drug effects (ADEs) are one of the leading causes of death in developed countries and are the main reason for drug recalls from the market, whereas the ADEs that are associated with action on the cardiovascular system are the most dangerous and widespread. The treatment of human diseases often requires the intake of several drugs, which can lead to undesirable drug-drug interactions (DDIs), thus causing an increase in the frequency and severity of ADEs. An evaluation of DDI-induced ADEs is a nontrivial task and requires numerous experimental and clinical studies. Therefore, we developed a computational approach to assess the cardiovascular ADEs of DDIs. This approach is based on the combined analysis of spontaneous reports (SRs) and predicted drug-target interactions to estimate the five cardiovascular ADEs that are induced by DDIs, namely, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, ventricular tachycardia, cardiac failure, and arterial hypertension. We applied a method based on least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression to SRs for the identification of interacting pairs of drugs causing corresponding ADEs, as well as noninteracting pairs of drugs. As a result, five datasets containing, on average, 3100 potentially ADE-causing and non-ADE-causing drug pairs were created. The obtained data, along with information on the interaction of drugs with 1553 human targets predicted by PASS Targets software, were used to create five classification models using the Random Forest method. The average area under the ROC curve of the obtained models, sensitivity, specificity and balanced accuracy were 0.837, 0.764, 0.754 and 0.759, respectively. The predicted drug targets were also used to hypothesize the potential mechanisms of DDI-induced ventricular tachycardia for the top-scoring drug pairs. The created five classification models can be used for the identification of drug combinations that are potentially the most or least dangerous for the cardiovascular system.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6gyKtQNeIjM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 Abstract&lt;p&gt;Breathing requires precise control of respiratory muscles to ensure adequate ventilation. Neurons within discrete regions of the brainstem produce oscillatory activity to control the frequency of breathing. Less is understood about how spinal and pontomedullary networks modulate the activity of respiratory motor neurons to produce different patterns of activity during different behaviors (i.e. during exercise, coughing, swallowing, vocalizing, or at rest) or following disease or injury. Here, we use a chemogenetic approach to inhibit the activity of glutamatergic V2a neurons in the brainstem and spinal cord of neonatal and adult mice to assess their potential roles in respiratory rhythm generation and patterning respiratory muscle activity. Using whole body plethysmography, we show that V2a neuron function is required in neonatal mice to maintain the frequency and regularity of respiratory rhythm. However, silencing V2a neurons in adult mice increases respiratory frequency and ventilation, without affecting regularity. Thus, the excitatory drive provided by V2a neurons is less critical for respiratory rhythm generation in adult compared to neonatal mice. In addition, we used simultaneous electromyography recordings of the diaphragm and extradiaphragmatic respiratory muscles in conscious adult mice to examine the role of V2a neurons in patterning respiratory muscle activity. We find that silencing V2a neurons activates extradiaphragmatic respiratory muscles at rest, when they are normally inactive, with little impact on diaphragm activity. Thus, our results indicate that V2a neurons participate in a circuit that serves to constrain the activity of extradiaphragmatic respiratory muscles so that they are active only when needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Extradiaphragmatic respiratory muscles are crucial for increasing ventilation during exercise or following disease and injury, yet the neural mechanisms that ensure that they are recruited only when needed are not known. By silencing the activity of V2a neurons we reveal an important role for these neurons in preventing extradiaphragmatic respiratory muscle activity at rest. Unlike in neonatal mice, silencing V2a neurons in adult mice does not disrupt respiratory rhythm generation or have a major impact on diaphragm activity. Our results support the feasibility of targeting V2a containing circuits to control extradiaphragmatic muscles without impairing respiratory rhythm generation to treat patients with neuromuscular disease or spinal cord injury.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract&lt;p&gt;Sphingomyelin (SM) supports brain myelination, a process closely associated with cognitive maturation. The presence of SM in breast milk suggests a role in infant nutrition, however, little is known about SM contribution to healthy cognitive development. We investigated the link between early life dietary SM, later cognitive development and myelination using an exploratory observational study of neurotypical children. SM levels were quantified in infant nutrition products fed in the first 3 months of life and associated with myelin content (brain MRI) as well as cognitive development (Mullen Scales of Early Learning).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Higher levels of SM were significantly associated with higher rates of change in verbal development in the first 2 years of life (r=0.65, P&amp;lt;0.001), as well as, higher levels of myelin content at 12-24 months, delayed onset and/or more prolonged rates of myelination in different brain areas. Second, we explored mechanisms of action using in vitro models (Sprague Dawley rat pups). In vitro data showed SM treatment resulted in increased proliferation (P=0.0133 and P=0.0434 at 4 and 10 days in vitro (DIV)), maturation (P=0.467 at 4 days DIV) and differentiation (P=0.0123 and P=0.0369 at 4 and 10 DIV) of oligodendrocyte precursor cells, as well as increased axon myelination (P=0.0005 at 32 DIV).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings indicate an impact of dietary SM on cognitive development in healthy children, potentially modulated by oligodendrocytes and increased axon myelination. Future research should include randomized controlled trials to substantiate efficacy of SM for cognitive benefits together with preclinical studies examining SM bioavailability and brain uptake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; The presences of sphingomyelin (SM) in breast milk suggests it has an important role in infant nutrition. Ways of measuring SM in milk are only recently developed, meaning little is known about its role in brain development. In this study, we used two approaches to explore this further. First, we investigated the link between early life SM obtained from the diet with later brain development and brain structure in a group of healthy children. Second, we examined the mechanism behind these effects using experimental models of brain development. Our findings in children indicate a positive impact of SM on brain development supported by experimental models. Future studies need to investigate further to build on the findings of our preliminary work.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract&lt;p&gt;The localization of distinct landmarks plays a crucial role in encoding new spatial memories. In mammals, this function is performed by hippocampal neurons that sparsely encode an animal’s location relative to surrounding objects. Similarly, the dorsal lateral pallium (DL) is essential for spatial learning in teleost fish. The DL of weakly electric gymnotiform fish receives both electrosensory and visual input from the preglomerular nucleus (PG), which has been hypothesized to encode the temporal sequence of electrosensory or visual landmark/food encounters. Here, we show that DL neurons in the &lt;i&gt;Apteronotid&lt;/i&gt; fish and in the &lt;i&gt;Carassius auratus&lt;/i&gt; (goldfish) have a hyperpolarized resting membrane potential combined with a high and dynamic spike threshold that increases following each spike. Current-evoked spikes in DL cells are followed by a strong small-conductance calcium-activated potassium channel (SK) mediated after-hyperpolarizing potential (AHP). Together, these properties prevent high frequency and continuous spiking. The resulting sparseness of discharge and dynamic threshold suggest that DL neurons meet theoretical requirements for generating spatial memory engrams by decoding the landmark/food encounter sequences encoded by PG neurons. Thus, DL neurons in teleost fish may provide a promising, simple system to study the core cell and network mechanisms underlying spatial memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; To our knowledge, this is first study of the intrinsic physiology of teleost pallial (DL) neurons. Their biophysical properties demonstrate that DL neurons are sparse coders with a dynamic spike threshold leading us to suggest that they can transform time-stamped input into spatial location during navigation. The concept of local attractors (bumps) that potentially move ‘across’ local recurrent networks has been prominent in the neuroscience theory literature. We propose that the relatively simple and experimentally accessible DL of teleosts may be the best preparation to examine this idea experimentally and to investigate the properties of local (excitatory) recurrent networks whose cells are endowed with, e.g., slow spike threshold adaptation dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract&lt;p&gt;Local field potential (LFP) oscillations are primarily shaped by the superposition of postsynaptic currents. Hippocampal LFP oscillations in the 25-50 Hz range (‘slow gamma’) are proposed to support memory retrieval independent of other frequencies. However, theta harmonics extend up to 48 Hz, necessitating a study to determine if these oscillations are fundamentally the same. We compared the spectral analysis methods of wavelet, ensemble empirical-mode decomposition (EEMD), and Fourier transform. EEMD, as previously applied, failed to account for the theta harmonics. Depending on analytical parameters selected, wavelet may convolve over high-order theta harmonics due to the variable time-frequency atoms, creating the appearance of a broad 25-50 Hz rhythm. As an illustration of this issue, wavelet and EEMD depicted ‘slow gamma’ in a synthetic dataset that only contained theta and its harmonics. Oscillatory transience cannot explain the difference in approaches as Fourier decomposition identifies ripples triggered to epochs of high-power, 120-250 Hz events. When Fourier is applied to high power, 25-50 Hz events, only theta harmonics are resolved. This analysis challenges the identification of the &quot;slow gamma&quot; rhythm as a unique fundamental hippocampal oscillation. While there may be instances in which &quot;slow gamma&quot; is present in the rat hippocampus, the analysis presented here shows that unless care is exerted in the application of EEMD and wavelet techniques, the results may be misleading, in this case misrepresenting theta harmonics. Moreover, it is necessary to reconsider the characteristics that define a fundamental hippocampal oscillation as well as theories based on multiple independent gamma bands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Fourier, Wavelet and ensemble empirical-mode decomposition (EEMD) converge on conflicting representations of the same time series. Fourier reveals theta harmonics whereas wavelet and EEMD have identified a &quot;slow gamma&quot; oscillation. In a comparison of spectral decomposition methods, we find that wavelet and EEMD give the erroneous impression of a &quot;slow gamma&quot; band. Fourier decomposition does not display any spectral deviation that is indicative of &quot;slow gamma&quot;. These data emphasize the importance of multiple analytical approaches with well-understood parameters when decomposing LFP in relation to behavior. On a fundamental level, our analysis points to an imprecise definition of a fundamental rhythm, requiring a reconsideration of both characteristics that define a hippocampal oscillation as well as theories based on multiple gamma bands.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

Evidence that cortical neural activity unfolds as a sequence of metastable states is accumulating at fast pace. Metastable activity occurs both in response to an external stimulus and during ongoing, self-generated activity. These spontaneous metastable states are increasingly found to subserve internal representations that are not locked to external triggers, including states of deliberations, attention and expectation. Moreover, decoding stimuli or decisions via metastable states can be carried out trial-by-trial. Focusing on metastability will allow us to shift our perspective on neural coding from traditional concepts based on trial-averaging to models based on dynamic ensemble representations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent theoretical work has started to characterize the mechanistic origin and potential roles of metastable representations. In this article we review recent findings on metastable activity, how it may arise in biologically realistic models, and its potential role for representing internal states as well as relevant task variables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

A wealth of behavioral, electrophysiological and imaging studies shed light on these processes, typically with synthesized sounds having regular temporal structure.

 &lt;p&gt;Perfusion MRI is an important modality in many brain imaging protocols, since
it probes cerebrovascular changes in aging and many diseases; however, it may
not be always available. Here we introduce a method that seeks to estimate
regional perfusion properties using spectral information of resting-state
functional MRI (rsfMRI) via machine learning. We used pairs of rsfMRI and
arterial spin labeling (ASL) images from the same elderly individuals with
normal cognition (NC; n = 45) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI; n = 26), and
built support vector machine models aiming to estimate regional cerebral blood
flow (CBF) from the rsfMRI signal alone. This method demonstrated higher
associations between the estimated CBF and actual CBF (ASL-CBF) at the total
lobar gray matter (r = 0.40; FDR-p = 1.9e-03), parietal lobe (r = 0.46, FDR-p =
8e-04), and occipital lobe (r = 0.35; FDR-p = 0.01) using rsfMRI signals of
frequencies [0.01-0.15] Hertz compared to frequencies [0.01-0.10] Hertz and
[0.01-0.20] Hertz, respectively. We further observed significant associations
between the estimated CBF and actual CBF in 24 regions of interest (p &amp;lt; 0.05),
with the highest association observed in the superior parietal lobule (r =
0.50, FDR-p = 0.002). Moreover, the estimated CBF at superior parietal lobule
showed significant correlation with the mini-mental state exam (MMSE) score (r
= 0.27; FDR-p = 0.04) and decreased in MCI with lower MMSE score compared to NC
group (FDR-p = 0.04). Overall, these results suggest that the proposed
framework can obtain estimates of regional perfusion from rsfMRI, which can
serve as surrogate perfusion measures in the absence of ASL.

 &lt;p&gt;Collective motion is found in various animal systems, active suspensions and
robotic or virtual agents. This is often understood using high level models
that directly encode selected empirical features, such as co-alignment and
cohesion. Can these features be shown to emerge from an underlying, low-level
principle? We find that they emerge naturally under Future State Maximisation
(FSM). Here agents perceive a visual representation of the world around them,
such as might be recorded on a simple retina, and then move to maximise the
number of different visual environments that they expect to be able to access
in the future. Such a control principle may confer evolutionary fitness in an
uncertain world by enabling agents to deal with a wide variety of future
scenarios. The collective dynamics that spontaneously emerge under FSM resemble
animal systems in several qualitative aspects, including cohesion, co-alignment
and collision suppression, none of which are explicitly encoded in the model. A
multi-layered neural network trained on simulated trajectories is shown to
represent a heuristic mimicking FSM. Similar levels of reasoning would seem to
be accessible under animal cognition, demonstrating a possible route to the
emergence of collective motion in social animals directly from the control
principle underlying FSM. Such models may also be good candidates for encoding
into possible future realisations of artificial &quot;intelligent&quot; matter, able to
sense light, process information and move.

 &lt;p&gt;The Wilson-Cowan equations represent a landmark in the history of
computational neuroscience. Among the insights Wilson and Cowan offered for
neuroscience, they crystallized an approach to modeling neural dynamics and
brain function. Although their iconic equations are used in various guises
today, the ideas that led to their formulation and the relationship to other
approaches are not well known. Here, we give a little context to some of the
biological and theoretical concepts that lead to the Wilson-Cowan equations and
discuss how to extend beyond them.

 Using a high resolution in situ hybridization technique we have measured PIEZO1, PIEZO2 and TRPV1 transcripts in mouse dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons.   Consistent with previous studies, PIEZO2 transcripts were highly expressed in most DRG neurons, including the largest diameter neurons implicated in mediating touch and proprioception.  In contrast, PIEZO1 transcripts were selectively expressed in smaller diameter DRG neurons, which are implicated in mediating nociception.  Moreover, neurons expressing PIEZO1 were distinct from those neurons that strongly expressed TRPV1, one of the channels implicated in heat-nociception.   Using an in vivo functional test for the selective expression, we found that Yoda1, a PIEZO1-specific agonist, induced a mechanical hyperalgesia that displayed a significantly prolonged time course compared with that induced by capsaicin, a TRPV1-specific agonist.  Taken together, our results indicate that PIEZO1 should be considered a potential candidate for the long sought channel mediating mechano-nociception.</content>

 Older adults commonly report difficulty understanding speech, particularly in adverse listening environments. These communication difficulties may exist in the absence of peripheral hearing loss. Older adults, both with normal hearing and with hearing loss, demonstrate temporal processing deficits that affect speech perception. The purpose of the present study is to investigate aging, cognition, and neural processing factors that may lead to deficits on perceptual tasks that rely on phoneme identification based on a temporal cue – vowel duration. A better understanding of the neural and cognitive impairments underlying temporal processing deficits could lead to more focused aural rehabilitation for improved speech understanding for older adults with normal hearing. 
This investigation was conducted in younger (YNH) and older normal-hearing (ONH) participants who completed three measures of cognitive functioning known to decline with age: working memory, processing speed, and inhibitory control. To evaluate perceptual and neural processing of auditory temporal contrasts, identification functions for the contrasting word-pair WHEAT and WEED were obtained on a nine-step continuum of vowel duration, and frequency-following responses (FFRs) and cortical auditory-evoked potentials (CAEPs) were recorded to the two endpoints of the continuum. Multiple linear regression analyses were conducted to determine the cognitive, peripheral, and/or central mechanisms that may contribute to perceptual performance. 
YNH participants demonstrated higher cognitive functioning on all three measures compared to ONH participants. The slope of the identification function was steeper in YNH than in ONH participants, suggesting a clearer distinction between the contrasting words in the YNH participants. FFRs revealed better response waveform morphology and more robust phase-locking in YNH compared to ONH participants. ONH participants also exhibited earlier latencies for CAEP components compared to the YNH participants. Linear regression analyses revealed that cortical processing significantly contributed to the variance in perceptual performance in the WHEAT/WEED identification functions. These results suggest that reduced neural precision contributes to age-related speech perception difficulties that arise from temporal processing deficits.</content>

 Previous study has proved the specific role of prefrontal-parietal network in the rapid goal-directed chunking (RGDC), which could dissociate the prefrontal activity from the working memory demand or encoding difficulty. However, it remains unknown how the prefrontal and parietal cortices collaborate to accomplish RGDC. A novel experiment design using Chinese characters as materials wad conduced with eighteen undergraduate students (9 females, mean age = 22.4 years) while recoding electroencephalogram (EEG). The radical-level chunking, accomplished in a timely stringent way, made a strict contrast with the stroke-level chunking whose cognitive brain processing were far less coherent due to the irregular and unpredictable chunking procedure. Comparing to the stoke-level chunking, RGDC like radical-level chunking showed an early increase of gamma band synchronization over parietal and occipital cortices, followed by enhanced power in the beta-gamma band (25-38 Hz) over frontal areas in the regular versus irregular chunking conditions. We suggest that the posterior rhythmic activities in the gamma band may underlie the processes that are directly associated with perceptual manipulations of chunking, while the subsequent beta-gamma activation over frontal area appears to reflect the reinforcement of the selected rules over alternative options, which would differentiate goal-directed chunking from chunking processes accomplished in a more implicit manner.</content>

 A hand mental rotation task (HMRT) is a task wherein a person judges whether an image of a rotated hand is of the right or left hand. Two performance strategies are expected to come into play when performing these tasks: a visual imagery (VI) strategy, in which an image is mentally rotated, and a motor imagery (MI) strategy, in which the movement of a person’s own hand is simulated. Although elderly people generally take some time to perform these tasks, ability differs greatly between individuals. The present study hypothesizes that there is a relationship between differences in task performance strategy and performance ability, and it compares performance strategy among elderly people divided into groups with a short mental rotation time and a long mental rotation time. In response to images of the palm, both groups displayed a medial-lateral effect in which responses were faster for images where the third finger was rotated toward the midline of the body than images rotated in the opposite direction, and we inferred that an MI strategy was primarily employed. Meanwhile, in response to images of the back of the hand, a medial-lateral effect was also observed in the group with a long mental rotation time and not in the group with the shortest mental rotation time (VI strategy). These results suggest that different strategies for performing HMRT tasks are used by elderly people with a short mental rotation time and those with a long mental rotation time.</content>

 The impact of traumatic brain injury (TBI) on procedural memory has received significantly less attention than declarative memory. Although to date studies on procedural memory have yielded mixed findings, many rehabilitation protocols (e.g., errorless learning) rely on the procedural memory system, and assume that it is relatively intact. The aim of the current study was to determine whether individuals with TBI are impaired on a task of procedural memory as a group, and to examine the presence of individual differences in performance. We administered to a sample of 36 individuals with moderate-severe TBI and 40 healthy comparisons (HC) the rotary pursuit (RP) task, and then examined their rate of learning, as well as their retention of learning. Our analyses revealed that while individuals with TBI spent a significantly shorter amount of time on target as a group, they did not retain significantly less procedural learning, and as a group their rate of learning was not different from HCs. However, there were high individual differences in both groups, indicating that some individuals might not be able to take advantage of treatment methods designed to leverage intact procedural memory system. Future work is needed to better assess and characterize procedural memory in individuals with TBI across a larger battery of tasks in experimental and clinical setting as memory and learning status may predict rehabilitation success.</content>

 In working memory (WM), the ability to concurrently integrate different types of information and maintain or manipulate them promotes the flow of ongoing tasks. WM is a key component of normal human cognition. In this study, we applied a combined voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) analysis to investigate the relationship between the ability of object and spatial working memory (WM), and regional gray matter density (GMD), as well as intrinsic functional connectivity. The VBM analysis showed a positive correlation between the individual difference of object WM and GMD in the right middle occipital gyrus (MOG) and the left superior temporal gyrus (STG), which are responsible for coding object information and processing the shape of an object. The individual difference of the spatial WM was positively related to GMD in the right middle frontal gyrus (MFG) located in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), which confirmed that it is an important region for memory stores and maintains WM spatial representations. Further functional connectivity analysis revealed that the individual difference of object WM was significantly correlated with the rsFC of right intraparietal sulcus (IPS) – left postcentral gyrus (PostCG)/right precentral gyrus (PreCG)/left supplementary motor area (SMA). Whereas the capacity of spatial WM was significantly associated with the FC strength of left dlPFC – left precuneus, right dlPFC – right MFG, and left superior frontal sulcus (SFS) – left SMA/ right inferior parietal lobe (IPL). Our findings suggested that object WM is associated with the structure and functional organization of the brain regions involved in the ventral pathway (occipital - temporal regions) and the capacity of spatial WM is related to the dorsal pathway (frontal - parietal regions).</content>

 Neuroanatomy suggests that adjacent neocortical neurons share a similar set of afferent synaptic inputs, as opposed to neurons localized to different areas of the neocortex. In the present study, we made simultaneous single-electrode patch clamp recordings from two or three adjacent neurons in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) of the ketamine-xylazine anesthetized rat in vivo to study the correlation patterns in their spike firing during both spontaneous and sensory-evoked activity. One difference with previous studies of pairwise neuronal spike firing correlations was that here we identified several different quantifiable parameters in the correlation patterns by which different pairs could be compared. The questions asked were if the correlation patterns between adjacent pairs were similar and if there was a relationship between the degree of similarity and the layer location of the pairs. In contrast, our results show that for putative pyramidal neurons within layer III and within layer V, each pair of neurons is to some extent unique in terms of their spiking correlation patterns. Interestingly, our results also indicated that these correlation patterns did not substantially alter between spontaneous and evoked activity. Our findings are compatible with the view that the synaptic input connectivity to each neocortical neuron is at least in some aspects unique. A possible interpretation is that plasticity mechanisms, which could either be initiating or be supported by transcriptomic differences, tend to differentiate rather than harmonize the synaptic weight distributions between adjacent neurons of the same type.</content>

 Connections in nervous systems are disproportionately concentrated on a small subset of neural elements that act as
network hubs. Hubs have been found across different of species and scales ranging from C.elegans to mouse, rat, cat,
macaque and human, suggesting a role for genetic influences. The recent availability of brain-wide gene expression
atlases provides new opportunities for mapping the transcriptional correlates of large-scale network-level phenotypes.
Here we review studies that use these atlases to investigate gene expression patterns associated with hub connectivity in

 Canonical epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation, histone modification and chromatin remodeling, play a role in numerous life processes, particularly neurodevelopment. Epigenetics explains the development of cells in an organism with the same DNA sequence into different cell types with various functions. However, previous studies on epigenetics have are only focused on the chromatin level. Recently, epigenetic modifications of RNA, which mainly include 6-methyladenosine (m6A), pseudouridine, 5-methylcytidine (m5C), inosine (I), 2’-O-ribosemethylation, and 1-methyladenosine (m1A), have gained increasing attention.Circular RNAs (circRNAs), which are a type of noncoding RNA without a 5’ cap or 3’ poly (A) tail, are abundantly found in the brain and might respond to and regulate synaptic function. Also, circRNAs have various functions, such as microRNA sponge, regulation of gene transcription and interaction with RNA binding protein.In addition, circRNAs are methylated by N6-methyladenosine (m6A). In this review, we discuss the crucial roles of epigenetic modifications of circRNAs, such as m6A, in the genesis and development of neurons and in synaptic function and plasticity. Thus, this type of changes in circRNAs might be a therapeutic target in central nervous system (CNS) disorders and could aid the diagnosis and treatment of these disorders.</content>

 &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium falciparum &lt;/i&gt;actin, apart from its role in erythrocyte invasion, is implicated in endocytosis, cytokinesis and inheritance of the chloroplast-like organelle - the apicoplast. However, the inability to visualise filamentous actin (F-actin) dynamics, a limitation we recently overcame for &lt;i&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/i&gt; (Periz et al, 2017), restricted characterisation of both F-actin and actin regulatory proteins. Here, we expressed and validated actin-binding chromobodies as F-actin-sensors in &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium falciparum &lt;/i&gt;and characterised &lt;i&gt;in-vivo &lt;/i&gt;actin dynamics. F-actin could be chemically modulated, and genetically disrupted upon conditionally deleting &lt;i&gt;actin-1&lt;/i&gt;. In a comparative approach, we demonstrate that Formin-2, a predicted nucleator of F-actin, is responsible for apicoplast inheritance in both &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/i&gt;, and additionally mediates efficient cytokinesis in &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium&lt;/i&gt;. Finally, time-averaged local intensity measurements of F-actin in &lt;i&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/i&gt; conditional mutants revealed molecular determinants of spatiotemporally regulated F-actin flow. Together, our data indicate that Formin-2 is the primary F-actin nucleator during apicomplexan intracellular growth, mediating multiple essential functions.</content>

 Single-cell transcriptomes are established by transcription factors (TFs), which determine a cell's gene-expression complement. Post-transcriptional regulation of single-cell transcriptomes, and the RNA binding proteins (RBPs) responsible, are more technically challenging to determine, and combinatorial TF-RBP coordination of single-cell transcriptomes remains unexplored. We used fluorescent reporters to visualize alternative splicing in single &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; neurons, identifying complex splicing patterns in the neuronal kinase &lt;i&gt;sad-1&lt;/i&gt;. Most neurons express both isoforms, but the ALM mechanosensory neuron expresses only the exon-included isoform, while its developmental sister cell the BDU neuron expresses only the exon-skipped isoform. A cascade of three cell-specific TFs and two RBPs are combinatorially required for &lt;i&gt;sad-1&lt;/i&gt; exon inclusion. Mechanistically, TFs combinatorially ensure expression of RBPs, which interact with &lt;i&gt;sad-1&lt;/i&gt; pre-mRNA. Thus a combinatorial TF-RBP code controls single-neuron &lt;i&gt;sad-1&lt;/i&gt; splicing. Additionally, we find ‘phenotypic convergence,’ previously observed for TFs, also applies to RBPs: different RBP combinations generate similar splicing outcomes in different neurons.</content>

 The fitness effects of synonymous mutations, nucleotide changes that do not alter the encoded amino acid, have often been assumed to be neutral, but a growing body of evidence suggests otherwise. We used site-directed mutagenesis coupled with direct measures of competitive fitness to estimate the distribution of fitness effects among synonymous mutations for a gene under directional selection and capable of adapting via synonymous nucleotide changes. Synonymous mutations had highly variable fitness effects, both deleterious and beneficial, resembling those of nonsynonymous mutations in the same gene. This variation in fitness was underlain by changes in transcription linked to the creation of internal promoter sites. A positive correlation between fitness and the presence of synonymous substitutions across a phylogeny of related Pseudomonads suggests these mutations may be common in nature. Taken together, our results provide the most compelling evidence to date that synonymous mutations with non-neutral fitness effects may in fact be commonplace.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Manipulating feeding circuits in freely moving animals is challenging, in part because the timing of sensory inputs is affected by the animal's behavior. To address this challenge in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila, &lt;/i&gt;we developed the Sip-Triggered Optogenetic Behavior Enclosure ('STROBE'). The STROBE is a closed-looped system for real-time optogenetic activation of feeding flies, designed to evoke neural excitation coincident with food contact. We previously demonstrated the STROBE's utility in probing the valence of fly sensory neurons (Jaeger et al., 2018). Here we provide a thorough characterization of the STROBE system, demonstrate that STROBE-driven behavior is modified by hunger and the presence of taste ligands, and find that mushroom body dopaminergic input neurons and their respective post-synaptic partners drive opposing feeding behaviors following activation. Together, these results establish the STROBE as a new tool for dissecting fly feeding circuits and suggest a role for mushroom body circuits in processing naïve taste responses.</content>

Many insects navigate by integrating the distances and directions travelled on an outward path, allowing direct return to the starting point. Fundamental to the reliability of this process is the use of a neural compass based on external celestial cues. Here we examine how such compass information could be reliably computed by the insect brain, given realistic constraints on the sky polarisation pattern and the insect eye sensor array. By processing the degree of polarisation in different directions for different parts of the sky, our model can directly estimate the solar azimuth and also infer the confidence of the estimate. We introduce a method to correct for tilting of the sensor array, as might be caused by travel over uneven terrain. We also show that the confidence can be used to approximate the change in sun position over time, allowing the compass to remain fixed with respect to ‘true north’ during long excursions. We demonstrate that the compass is robust to disturbances and can be effectively used as input to an existing neural model of insect path integration. We discuss the plausibility of our model to be mapped to known neural circuits, and to be implemented for robot navigation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ZopicHSnpqw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Identified neurons and the networks they compose produce stereotypical, albeit individually unique, activity across members of a species. We propose, for a motor circuit driven by a central pattern generator (CPG), that the uniqueness derives mainly from differences in synaptic strength rather than from differences in intrinsic membrane conductances. We studied a dataset of recordings from six leech (&lt;i&gt;Hirudo&lt;/i&gt; sp.) heartbeat control networks, containing complete spiking activity patterns from inhibitory premotor interneurons, motor output spike patterns, and synaptic strength patterns to investigate the source of uniqueness. We used a conductance-based multicompartmental motor neuron model to construct a bilateral motor circuit model, and controlled it by playing recorded input spike trains from premotor interneurons to generate output inhibitory synaptic patterns similar to experimental measurements. By generating different synaptic conductance parameter sets of this circuit model, we found that relative premotor synaptic strengths impinging onto motor neurons must be different across individuals to produce animal-specific output burst phasing. Obtaining unique outputs from each individual’s circuit model did not require different intrinsic ionic conductance parameters. Furthermore, changing intrinsic conductances failed to compensate for modified synaptic strength patterns. Thus, the pattern of synaptic strengths of motor neuron inputs is critical for the phasing of this motor circuit and can explain individual differences. When intrinsic conductances were allowed to vary, they exhibited the same conductance correlations across individuals, suggesting a motor neuron &quot;type&quot; required for proper network function. Our results are general and may translate to other systems and neuronal networks that control output phasing.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Navigating through natural environments requires localizing objects along three distinct spatial axes. Information about position along the horizontal and vertical axes is available from an object’s position on the retina, while position along the depth axis must be inferred based on second-order cues such as the disparity between the images cast on the two retinae. Past work has revealed that object position in two-dimensional (2D) retinotopic space is robustly represented in visual cortex and can be robustly predicted using a multivariate encoding model, in which an explicit axis is modeled for each spatial dimension. However, no study to date has used an encoding model to estimate a representation of stimulus position in depth. Here, we recorded BOLD fMRI while human subjects viewed a stereoscopic random-dot sphere at various positions along the depth (&lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt;) and the horizontal (&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;) axes, and the stimuli were presented across a wider range of disparities (out to ~40 arcmin) compared to previous neuroimaging studies. In addition to performing decoding analyses for comparison to previous work, we built encoding models for depth position and for horizontal position, allowing us to directly compare encoding between these dimensions. Our results validate this method of recovering depth representations from retinotopic cortex. Furthermore, we find convergent evidence that depth is encoded most strongly in dorsal area V3A.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAT) with clopidogrel plus aspirin has been suggested by American Heart Association/American Stroke Association guidelines for minor stroke (MS) and transient ischemic attack (TIA) patients. The purpose of this study was to find the potential subgroups that benefit from DAT. We aimed to compare the efficacy of clopidogrel–aspirin therapy with that of aspirin therapy in MS/TIA patients stratified by CYP2C19 genotype and risk profiles.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CYP2C19 loss‐of‐function allele (LoFA) carriers were defined as patients with LoFA of either *2 or *3. Low‐ and high‐risk profile was defined as Essen Stroke Risk Score (ESRS) &amp;lt;3 and ≥3, respectively. Stroke recurrence at 1 year was considered primary outcome.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of a total 2,933 MS/TIA patients, there were 1,726 (58.8%) LoFA carriers and 1,068 (36.4%) patients at high risk (ESRS ≥3). No significant difference for stroke recurrence between the clopidogrel–aspirin group and aspirin alone group was found in LoFA carriers (11.2% vs 13.3%, hazard ratio [HR] = 0.83, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.64~1.09). In stratified analyses by CYP2C19 genotype and ESRS, HRs (95% CIs) of the clopidogrel–aspirin therapy for stroke recurrence were 1.00 (0.70~1.42), 0.63 (0.41~0.97), 0.62 (0.40~0.96), and 0.52 (0.31~0.88) among subgroups of LoFA carriers at low risk, LoFA carriers at high risk, LoFA noncarriers at low risk, and LoFA noncarriers at high risk, respectively, with &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.021 for interaction.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, LoFA carriers do not benefit from DAT, but there is significant benefit for LoFA carriers who are at high risk. The benefit of clopidogrel in Chinese MS/TIA patients depends on CYP2C19 genotype and risk profile. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;In the mammalian brain, newly acquired memories depend on the hippocampus for
maintenance and recall, but over time the neocortex takes over these functions,
rendering memories hippocampus-independent. The process responsible for this
transformation is called systems memory consolidation. However, reactivation of
a well-consolidated memory can trigger a temporary return to a
hippocampus-dependent state, a phenomenon known as systems memory
reconsolidation. The neural mechanisms underlying systems memory consolidation
and reconsolidation are not well understood. Here, we propose a neural model
based on well-documented mechanisms of synaptic plasticity and stability and
describe a computational implementation that demonstrates the model's ability
to account for a range of findings from the systems consolidation and
reconsolidation literature. We derive several predictions from the
computational model, and suggest experiments that may put them to the test.

 Here, we review the neural circuit bases of habits, compulsions, and addictions, behaviors which are all characterized by relatively automatic action performance. We discuss relevant studies primarily from the rodent literature, and describe how major headway has been made in identifying the brain regions and neural cell types whose activity is modulated during the acquisition and performance of these automated behaviors. The dorsal striatum and cortical inputs to this structure have emerged as key players in the wider basal ganglia circuitry encoding behavioral automaticity, and changes in the activity of different neuronal cell-types in these brain regions have been shown to co-occur with the formation of these automatic behaviors. We highlight how disordered functioning of these neural circuits can result in neuropsychiatric disorders, such as OCD and drug addiction. Finally, we discuss how the next phase of research in the field may benefit from integration of approaches for access to cells based on their genetic makeup, activity, connectivity and precise anatomical location.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Sensory modulation disorder (SMD) affects sensory processing across single or multiple sensory systems. The sensory over-responsivity (SOR) subtype of SMD is manifested clinically as a condition in which non-painful stimuli are perceived as abnormally irritating, unpleasant, or even painful. Moreover, SOR interferes with participation in daily routines and activities, co-occurs with daily pain hyper-sensitivity, and reduces quality of life due to bodily pain. 
Laboratory behavioral studies have confirmed abnormal pain perception, as demonstrated by hyperalgesia and an enhanced lingering painful sensation, in children and adults with SMD. Advanced quantitative sensory testing has revealed the mechanisms of altered pain processing in SOR whereby despite the existence of normal peripheral sensory processing, there is enhanced facilitation of pain transmitting pathways along with preserved but delayed inhibitory pain modulation. These findings point to central nervous system involvement as the underlying mechanism of pain hypersensitivity in SOR. Based on the mutual central processing of both non-painful and painful sensory stimuli, we suggest shared mechanisms such as cortical hyper-excitation, an excitatory-inhibitory neuronal imbalance, and sensory modulation alterations. This is supported by novel findings indicating that SOR is a risk factor and comorbidity of chronic non-neuropathic pain disorders. 
This is the first review to summarize current empirical knowledge investigating SMD and pain, a sensory modality not yet part of the official SMD realm. We propose a neurophysiological mechanism-based model for the interrelation between pain and SMD. Embracing the pain domain could significantly contribute to the understanding of this condition’s pathogenesis and how it manifests in daily life, as well as suggesting the basis for future potential mechanism-based therapies.</content>

 Electroencephalography (EEG) data can be used to decode an attended speech source in normal-hearing (NH) listeners using high-density EEG caps, as well as around-the-ear EEG devices. The technology may find application in identifying the target speaker in a cocktail party like scenario and steer speech enhancement algorithms in cochlear implants (CIs). However, the worse spectral resolution and the electrical artifacts introduced by a CI may limit the applicability of this approach to CI users. 
The goal of this study was to investigate whether selective attention can be decoded in CI users using an around-the-ear EEG system (cEEGrid). The performances of high-density cap EEG recordings and cEEGrid EEG recordings were compared in a selective attention paradigm using an envelope tracking algorithm. Speech from two audio books was presented through insert earphones to NH listeners and via direct audio cable to the CI users. 10 NH listeners and 10 bilateral CI users participated in the study. Participants were instructed to attend to one out of the two concurrent speech streams while data were recorded by a 96-channel scalp EEG and an 18-channel cEEGrid setup simultaneously. Reconstruction performance was evaluated by means of parametric correlations between the reconstructed speech and both, the envelope of the attended and the unattended speech stream. 
Results confirm the feasibility to decode selective attention by means of single-trial EEG data in NH and CI users using a high-density EEG. All NH listeners and 9 out 10 CI achieved high decoding accuracies. The cEEGrid was successful in decoding selective attention in 5 out of 10 NH listeners. The same result was obtained for CI users.</content>

 Numerous studies have demonstrated that boys throw balls faster, farther and more accurately than girls. This is largely due to well-known anatomical and muscle physiological differences that play a central role in overarm throwing. With the objective to understand the potential contribution of coordinative aspects in this gender difference, this large cross-sectional study examined a simplified forearm throw that eliminated the physical advantages of male individuals. As hypothesized, the gender disparity disappeared, but only in the age groups younger than 20 years. Two fine-grained spatiotemporal metrics displayed a similar age-dependent gender disparity. As throwing experience did not explain this age-dependency, the results are discussed in the context of spatial abilities and video game experience, both more pronounced in males. In contrast, a measure of intrinsic rhythmicity developed over successive throws did not reveal any gender differences, speaking to the fundamental tendency in humans to fall into rhythmic patterns. This computational study was performed in a large cohort in the context of an outreach activity, demonstrating that robust quantitative measures can also be obtained in less controlled environments. The findings also alert that motor neuroscience may need to pay more attention to gender differences.</content>

 Biological membranes show lateral and transverse asymmetric lipid distribution. Cholesterol localizes in both hemilayers, but in the external one it is mostly condensed in lipid-ordered microdomains (raft domains), together with saturated phosphatidyl lipids and sphingolipids (including sphingomyelin and glycosphingolipids). Membrane asymmetries induce special membrane biophysical properties and behave as signals for several physiological and/or pathological processes. Alzheimer´s disease (AD) is associated with a perturbation in different membrane properties. Amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles of tau protein together with neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration are the most characteristic cellular changes observed in this disease. The extracellular presence of Aβ peptides forming senile plaques, , together with soluble oligomeric species of Aβ, are considered the major cause of the synaptic dysfunction of AD. The association between Aβ peptide and membrane lipids has been extensively studied. It has been postulated that cholesterol content and cholesterol distribution condition Aβ production and posterior accumulation in membranes and, hence, cell dysfunction. Several lines of evidence suggest that Aβ partitions in the cell membrane and accumulates mostly in raft domains, the site where the cleavage of the precursor AβPP by β- and γ- secretase is also thought to occur. The main consequence of the pathogenesis of AD is the disruption of the cholinergic pathways in the cerebral cortex and in the basal forebrain. In parallel, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor has been extensively related to membrane properties. Since its transmembrane domain exhibits extensive contacts with the surrounding lipids, the acetylcholine receptor function is conditioned by its lipid microenvironment. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor is present in high-density clusters in the cell membrane where it localizes mainly in lipid-ordered domains. Perturbations of sphingomyelin or cholesterol composition alter acetylcholine receptor location. Therefore, Aβ processing, Aβ partitioning and acetylcholine receptor location and function can be manipulated by changes in membrane lipid biophysics. Understanding these mechanisms should provide insights into new therapeutic strategies for prevention and/or treatment of AD. Here, we discuss the implications of lipid-protein interactions at the cell membrane level in Alzheimer’s disease (AD).</content>

		<content type="html">
 Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia. The onset and progression of this pathology are correlated with several changes in the brain, including the formation of extracellular aggregates of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptide and the intracellular accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein. In addition, dysregulated neuronal plasticity, synapse loss, and a reduction in cellular energy metabolism have also been described. Canonical Wnt signaling has also been shown to be downregulated in AD. Remarkably, we showed previously that the in vivo inhibition of Wnt signaling accelerates the appearance of AD markers in transgenic (Tg) and wild-type (WT) mice. Additionally, we found that Wnt signaling stimulates energy metabolism, which is critical for the ability of Wnt to promote the recovery of cognitive function in AD. Therefore, we hypothesized that activation of canonical Wnt signaling in a presymptomatic transgenic animal model of AD would improve some symptoms. To explore the latter, we used a transgenic mouse model (J20 Tg) with mild AD phenotype expression (high levels of amyloid aggregates) and studied the effect of andrographolide (ANDRO), an activator of canonical Wnt signaling. We found that presymptomatic administration of ANDRO in J20 Tg mice prevented the reduction in cellular energy metabolism markers. Moreover, treated animals showed improvement in cognitive performance. At the synaptic level, J20 Tg animals showed severe deficiencies in presynaptic function as determined by electrophysiological parameters, all of which were completely restored to normal by ANDRO administration. Finally, an analysis of hippocampal synaptosomes by electron microscopy revealed that the length of synapses was restored with ANDRO treatment. Altogether, these data support the idea that the activation of canonical Wnt signaling during presymptomatic stages could represent an interesting pharmacological strategy to delay the onset of AD</content>

 Brain tissue contains autofluorescing elements that potentially impede accurate identification of neurons when visualized with fluorescent microscopy. Age-related accumulation of molecules with autofluorescent properties, such as lipofuscin, can possess spectral profiles that invade the typical emission range of fluorophores commonly utilized in fluorescent microscopy. The traditional method for accounting for this native fluorescence is to apply lipophilic dyes that are able to sequester these unwanted signals. While effective, such dyes can present a range of problems including the obstruction of fluorescent probe emissions. The present study utilizes aged primate midbrain tissue stained for tyrosine hydroxylase and calbindin to investigate an image processing approach for removing autofluorescence utilizing spectral imaging and linear unmixing. This technique is then compared against the traditional, dye-based autofluorescence sequestration method using Sudan Black B (SBB). Spectral imaging and linear unmixing yielded significantly higher cell numbers than SBB treatment. This finding suggests that computational approaches for removing autofluorescence in neural tissue are both viable and preferential to dye-based approaches for estimation of cell body numbers.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Acid-sensing ion channels have important functions in physiology and pathology, but the molecular composition of acid-activated chloride channels had remained unclear. We now used a genome-wide siRNA screen to molecularly identify the widely expressed acid-sensitive outwardly-rectifying anion channel PAORAC/ASOR. ASOR is formed by TMEM206 proteins which display two transmembrane domains (TMs) and are expressed at the plasma membrane. Ion permeation-changing mutations along the length of TM2 and at the end of TM1 suggest that these segments line ASOR’s pore. While not belonging to a gene family, TMEM206 has orthologs in probably all vertebrates. Currents from evolutionarily distant orthologs share activation by protons, a feature essential for ASOR’s role in acid-induced cell death. TMEM206 defines a novel class of ion channels. Its identification will help to understand its physiological roles and the diverse ways by which anion-selective pores can be formed.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is known to mediate glutamate excitotoxicity in neurological diseases. However, how ROS burdens can influence neural circuit integrity remains unclear. Here, we investigate the impact of excitotoxicity induced by depletion of &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; Eaat1, an astrocytic glutamate transporter, on locomotor central pattern generator (CPG) activity, neuromuscular junction architecture, and motor function. We show that glutamate excitotoxicity triggers a circuit-dependent ROS feedback loop to sculpt the motor system. Excitotoxicity initially elevates ROS to inactivate cholinergic interneurons, consequently changing CPG output activity to overexcite motor neurons and muscles. Remarkably, tonic motor neuron stimulation boosts muscular ROS, gradually dampening muscle contractility to feedback-enhance ROS accumulation in the CPG circuit and subsequently exacerbate circuit dysfunction. Ultimately, excess premotor excitation of motor neurons promotes ROS-activated stress signaling to alter neuromuscular junction architecture. Collectively, our results reveal that excitotoxicity-induced ROS can perturb motor system integrity by a circuit-dependent mechanism.</content>

 Coral reefs are some of the most important and ecologically diverse marine environments. At the base of the reef ecosystem are dinoflagellate algae, which live symbiotically within coral cells. Efforts to understand the relationship between alga and coral have been greatly hampered by the lack of an appropriate dinoflagellate genetic transformation technology. By making use of the plasmid-like fragmented chloroplast genome, we have introduced novel genetic material into the dinoflagellate chloroplast genome. We have shown that the introduced genes are expressed and confer the expected phenotypes. Genetically modified cultures have been grown for 1 year with subculturing, maintaining the introduced genes and phenotypes. This indicates that cells continue to divide after transformation and that the transformation is stable. This is the first report of stable chloroplast transformation in dinoflagellate algae.</content>

		<content type="html">
 TMEM16F is activated by elevated intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;,&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;and functions as a small-conductance ion channel and as a phospholipid scramblase. In contrast to its paralogs, the TMEM16A/B calcium-activated chloride channels, mouse TMEM16F has been reported as a cation-, anion-, or non-selective ion channel, without a definite conclusion. Starting with the Q559K mutant that shows no current rundown and less outward rectification in excised patch, we found that the channel shifted its ion selectivity in response to the change of intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration, with an increased permeability ratio of Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; to Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (P&lt;sub&gt;Cl-&lt;/sub&gt;/P&lt;sub&gt;Na+&lt;/sub&gt;) at a higher Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; level. The gradual shift of relative ion permeability did not correlate with the channel activation state. Instead, it was indicative of an alteration of electrostatic field in the permeation pathway. The dynamic change of ion selectivity suggests a charge-screening mechanism for TMEM16F ion conduction, and it provides hints to the study of TMEM16F physiological functions.</content>

 &lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Whether auditory processing of speech relies on reference to the articulatory motor information of speaker remains elusive. Here, we addressed this issue under a two-brain framework. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was applied to record the brain activities of speakers when telling real-life stories and later of listeners when listening to the audio recordings of these stories. Based on between-brain seed-to-voxel correlation analyses, we revealed that neural dynamics in listeners’ auditory temporal cortex are temporally coupled with the dynamics in the speaker’s larynx/phonation area. Moreover, the coupling response in listener’s left auditory temporal cortex follows the hierarchical organization for speech processing, with response lags in A1+, STG/STS, and MTG increasing linearly. Further, listeners showing greater coupling responses understand the speech better. When comprehension fails, such interbrain auditory-articulation coupling vanishes substantially. These findings suggest that a listener’s auditory system and a speaker’s articulatory system are inherently aligned during naturalistic verbal interaction, and such alignment is associated with high-level information transfer from the speaker to the listener. Our study provides reliable evidence supporting that references to the articulatory motor information of speaker facilitate speech comprehension under a naturalistic scene.&lt;/span&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy Type 1 (HSAN1) is a rare autosomal dominantly inherited neuropathy, clinically characterized by a loss of distal peripheral sensory and motoneuronal function. Mutations in subunits of serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) have been linked to the majority of HSAN1 cases. SPTs catalyze the condensation of l-serine with palmitoyl-CoA, the first committed and rate-limiting step in &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; sphingolipid biosynthesis. Despite extensive investigation, the molecular pathogenesis of HSAN1 remains controversial. Here, we established a &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt;) model of HSAN1 by generating a &lt;i&gt;sptl-1(c363g&lt;/i&gt;) mutation, encoding SPTL-1(C121W) and equivalent to human SPTLC1&lt;sup&gt;C133W&lt;/sup&gt;, at the &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; genomic locus through CRISPR. The &lt;i&gt;sptl-1(c363g&lt;/i&gt;) homozygous mutants exhibited the same larval lethality and epithelial polarity defect as observed in &lt;i&gt;sptl-1(RNAi&lt;/i&gt;) animals, suggesting a loss-of-function effect of the SPTL-1(C121W) mutation. &lt;i&gt;sptl-1(c363g)&lt;/i&gt;/+ heterozygous mutants displayed sensory dysfunction with concomitant neuronal morphology and axon-dendrite polarity defects, demonstrating that the &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; model recapitulates characteristics of the human disease. &lt;i&gt;sptl-1(c363g&lt;/i&gt;)-derived neuronal defects were copied in animals with defective sphingolipid biosynthetic enzymes downstream of SPTL-1, including ceramide glucosyltransferases, suggesting that SPTLC1&lt;sup&gt;C133W&lt;/sup&gt; contributes to the HSAN1 pathogenesis by limiting the production of complex sphingolipids, including glucosylceramide. Overexpression of SPTL-1(C121W) led to similar epithelial and neuronal defects and to reduced levels of complex sphingolipids, specifically glucosylceramide, consistent with a dominant-negative effect of SPTL-1(C121W) that is mediated by loss of this downstream product. Genetic interactions between SPTL-1(C121W) and components of directional trafficking in neurons suggest that the neuronal polarity phenotype could be caused by glycosphingolipid-dependent defects in polarized vesicular trafficking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The symptoms of inherited metabolic diseases are often attributed to the accumulation of toxic intermediates or byproducts, no matter whether the disease-causing enzyme participates in a biosynthetic or a degradation pathway. By showing that the phenotypes observed in a &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; model of HSAN1 disease could be caused by loss of a downstream product (glucosylceramide) rather than the accumulation of a toxic byproduct, our work provides new insights into the origins of the symptoms of inherited metabolic diseases while expanding the repertoire of sphingolipid functions, specifically, of glucosylceramides. These findings not only have their most immediate relevance for neuroprotective treatments for HSAN1, they may also have implications for a much broader range of neurologic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is characterized by neuronal loss in the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain. Here, we provide the first evidence of striking morphological alterations in dentate granule cells (DGCs) of FTD patients and in a mouse model of the disease, Tau&lt;sup&gt;VLW&lt;/sup&gt; mice. Taking advantage of the fact that the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) gives rise to newborn DGCs throughout the lifetime in rodents, we used RGB retroviruses to study the temporary course of these alterations in newborn DGCs of female Tau&lt;sup&gt;VLW&lt;/sup&gt; mice. In addition, retroviruses that encode either PSD95:GFP or Syn:GFP revealed striking alterations in the afferent and efferent connectivity of newborn Tau&lt;sup&gt;VLW&lt;/sup&gt; DGCs, and monosynaptic retrograde rabies virus tracing showed that these cells are disconnected from distal brain regions and local sources of excitatory innervation. However, the same cells exhibited a predominance of local inhibitory innervation. Accordingly, the expression of presynaptic and postsynaptic markers of inhibitory synapses was markedly increased in the DG of Tau&lt;sup&gt;VLW&lt;/sup&gt; mice and FTD patients. Moreover, an increased number of neuropeptide Y-positive interneurons in the DG correlated with a reduced number of activated egr-1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; DGCs in Tau&lt;sup&gt;VLW&lt;/sup&gt; mice. Finally, we tested the therapeutic potential of environmental enrichment and chemoactivation to reverse these alterations in mice. Both strategies reversed the morphological alterations of newborn DGCs and partially restored their connectivity in a mouse model of the disease. Moreover, our data point to remarkable morphological similarities between the DGCs of Tau&lt;sup&gt;VLW&lt;/sup&gt; mice and FTD patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; We show, for the first time to our knowledge, that the population of dentate granule cells is disconnected from other regions of the brain in the neurodegenerative disease frontotemporal dementia (FTD). These alterations were observed in FTD patients and in a mouse model of this disease. Moreover, we tested the therapeutic potential of two strategies, environmental enrichment and chemoactivation, to stimulate the activity of these neurons in mice. We found that some of the alterations were reversed by these therapeutic interventions.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Chronic pain is a serious debilitating disease for which effective treatment is still lacking. Acid-sensing ion channel 1a (ASIC1a) has been implicated in nociceptive processing at both peripheral and spinal neurons. However, whether ASIC1a also contributes to pain perception at the supraspinal level remains elusive. Here, we report that ASIC1a in ACC is required for thermal and mechanical hypersensitivity associated with chronic pain. ACC-specific genetic deletion or pharmacological blockade of ASIC1a reduced the probability of cortical LTP induction and attenuated inflammatory thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia in male mice. Using cell type-specific manipulations, we demonstrate that ASIC1a in excitatory neurons of ACC is a major player in cortical LTP and pain behavior. Mechanistically, we show that ASIC1a tuned pain-related cortical plasticity through protein kinase C -mediated increase of membrane trafficking of AMPAR subunit GluA1 in ACC. Importantly, postapplication of ASIC1a inhibitors in ACC reversed previously established nociceptive hypersensitivity in both chronic inflammatory pain and neuropathic pain models. These results suggest that ASIC1a critically contributes to a higher level of pain processing through synaptic potentiation in ACC, which may serve as a promising analgesic target for treatment of chronic pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Chronic pain is a debilitating disease that still lacks effective therapy. Ion channels are good candidates for developing new analgesics. Here, we provide several lines of evidence to support an important role of cortically located ASIC1a channel in pain hypersensitivity through promoting long-term synaptic potentiation in the ACC. Our results indicate a promising translational potential of targeting ASIC1a to treat chronic pain.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The accumulation of misfolded proteins is a common pathological feature of many neurodegenerative disorders, including synucleinopathies such as Parkinson's disease (PD), which is characterized by the presence of α-synuclein (α-syn)-containing Lewy bodies. However, although recent studies have investigated α-syn accumulation and propagation in neurons, the molecular mechanisms underlying α-syn transmission have been largely unexplored. Here, we examined a monogenic form of synucleinopathy caused by loss-of-function mutations in lysosomal ATP13A2/PARK9. These studies revealed that lysosomal exocytosis regulates intracellular levels of α-syn in human neurons. Loss of PARK9 function in patient-derived dopaminergic neurons disrupted lysosomal Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; homeostasis, reduced lysosomal Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; storage, increased cytosolic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, and impaired lysosomal exocytosis. Importantly, this dysfunction in lysosomal exocytosis impaired α-syn secretion from both axons and soma, promoting α-syn accumulation. However, activation of the lysosomal Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channel transient receptor potential mucolipin 1 (TRPML1) was sufficient to upregulate lysosomal exocytosis, rescue defective α-syn secretion, and prevent α-syn accumulation. Together, these results suggest that intracellular α-syn levels are regulated by lysosomal exocytosis in human dopaminergic neurons and may represent a potential therapeutic target for PD and other synucleinopathies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease linked to the accumulation of α-synuclein (α-syn) in patient neurons. However, it is unclear what the mechanism might be. Here, we demonstrate a novel role for lysosomal exocytosis in clearing intracellular α-syn and show that impairment of this pathway by mutations in the PD-linked gene ATP13A2/PARK9 contributes to α-syn accumulation in human dopaminergic neurons. Importantly, upregulating lysosomal exocytosis by increasing lysosomal Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; levels was sufficient to rescue defective α-syn secretion and accumulation in patient neurons. These studies identify lysosomal exocytosis as a potential therapeutic target in diseases characterized by the accumulation of α-syn, including PD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Technological advances in 2-Photon Laser Scanning Microscopy (2P-LSM) have allowed novel insights into in vivo immune response in a variety of tissue microenvironments. While imaging of peripheral tissues has provided an abundance of data with regards to immune cell dynamics, central nervous system (CNS) imaging is comparatively inhibited by tissue accessibility and manipulation. Despite these limitations, the results of dynamic intravital neuro-immune imaging thus far have provided foundational insights into basic CNS biology. Utilizing a combination of intravital and ex vivo 2P-LSM we have observed novel pathways allowing immune cells, stromal cells, cancer cells and proteins to communicate between the CNS parenchyma and peripheral vasculature. Similar to what has been reported in the intestinal tract, we have visualized myeloid cells extend dendritic processes across the blood brain barrier (BBB) into pial blood vessels. Furthermore, transient vessel leaks seen during systemic inflammation provide opportunities for cellular protein to be exchanged between the periphery and CNS. These insights provide new, visual information regarding immune surveillance and antigen presentation within the CNS. Furthermore, when combining intravital 2P-LSM and microfluidic devices complexed with mathematical modeling, we are gaining new insights into the intravascular behavior of circulating immune cells. This new knowledge into the basic mechanisms by which cells migrate to and interact with the CNS provide important considerations for the design of neuroelectric devices that have the potential to connect the peripheral-neural microenvironments in a unique, artificial interface.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Parallel fiber (PF) synapses show pronounced and lasting facilitation during bursts of high-frequency activity. They typically connect to their target neurons via a single active zone (AZ), harboring few release sites (~2-8) with moderate initial vesicular release probability (~0.2-0.4). In light of these biophysical characteristics it seems surprising that PF synapses can sustain facilitation during high-frequency periods of tens of action potentials (APs). Recent findings suggest an increase in the number of occupied release sites due to ultra-rapid (~180 s-1), Ca2+ dependent recruitment of synaptic vesicles (SVs) from replenishment sites as major presynaptic mechanism of this lasting facilitation. On the molecular level, Synaptotagmin 7 or Munc13s have been suggested to be involved in mediating facilitation at PF synapses. The recruitment of SVs from replenishment sites appears to be reversible on a slower time-scale, thereby, explaining that PF synapses rapidly depress and ultimately become silent during low-frequency activity. Hence, PF synapses show high-frequency facilitation but low-frequency depression. This behavior is explained by regulation of the number of occupied release sites at the AZ by AP frequency.</content>

 Schwann cells are exquisitely sensitive to the elasticity of their environment and their differentiation and capacity to myelinate depend on the transduction of mechanical stimuli by YAP and TAZ.  YAP/TAZ, in concert with other transcription factors, regulate several pathways including lipid and sterol biosynthesis as well as extracellular matrix receptor expression such as integrins and G-proteins.  Yet, the characterization of the signaling downstream YAP/TAZ in Schwann cells is incomplete.  Myelin sheath production by Schwann cell coincides with rapid up-regulation of numerous transcription factors. Here we show that ablation of YAP/TAZ alters the expression of transcription regulators known to regulate Schwann cell myelin gene transcription and differentiation.  Furthermore, we link YAP/TAZ to two DNA binding proteins, Cc2d1b and Purβ, which have no described roles in myelinating glial cells.  We demonstrate that silencing of either Cc2d1b or Purβ limits the formation of myelin segments.  These data provide a deeper insight into the myelin gene transcriptional network and the role of YAP/TAZ in myelinating glial cells.</content>

 Two-pore domain K+ (K2P) channels generate K+ leak current, which serves a vital role in controlling and modulating neuronal excitability. This diverse family of K+ channels exhibit distinct expression and function across neuronal tissues. TWIK-related spinal cord K+ channel (TRESK) is a K2P channel with a particularly enriched role in sensory neurons and in vivo pain pathways. Here, we explored the role of TRESK across molecularly distinct sensory neuron populations and assessed its contribution to different sensory modalities. We found TRESK mRNA only in select populations of C- and A-δ nociceptors, in addition to low threshold D-hair afferents. Neurons from mice in which TRESK has been ablated demonstrated marked hyperexcitability, which was amplified under inflammatory challenge. Detailed behavioural phenotyping of TRESK knockout mice revealed specific deficits in somatosensory processing of noxious and non-noxious stimuli. These results demonstrate novel roles of TRESK in somatosensory processing and offer important information to those wishing to target the channel for therapeutic means.</content>

 A growing body of evidence supports the close relationship between major depressive disorder (MDD), a severe psychiatric disease more common among women than men, and alterations of the immune/inflammatory system. However, despite the large number of studies aimed at understanding the molecular bases of this association, a lack of information exists on the potential crosstalk between systems known to be involved in depression and components of the inflammatory response, especially with respect to sex differences.
Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a neurotrophin with a well-established role in MDD etiopathology: it is altered in depressed patients as well as in animal models of the disease and its changes are restored by antidepressant drugs. Interestingly, this neurotrophin is also involved in the inflammatory response. Indeed, it can be secreted by microglia, the primary innate immune cells in the central nervous system whose functions may be in turn regulated by BDNF.
With these premises, in this study we investigated the reciprocal impact of BDNF and the immune system by evaluating the neuroinflammatory response in male and female BDNF-heterozygous mutant mice acutely treated with the cytokine-inducer lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Specifically, we assessed the potential insurgence of an LPS-induced sickness behavior as well as changes of inflammatory mediators in the mouse hippocampus and frontal cortex, with respect to both genotype and sex.
We found that the increased inflammatory response induced by LPS in the brain of male mice was independentby the genotype, whereas in the female it was restricted to the heterozygous mice with no changes in the wild-type group, suggestive of a role for BDNF in the sex-dependent effect of the inflammatory challenge.
Considering the involvement of both BDNF and neuroinflammation in several psychiatric diseases and the diverse incidence of such pathologies in males and females, a deeper investigation of the mechanisms underlying their interaction may have a critical translational relevance.</content>

 Neurodevelopmental disorders represent a challenging biological and medical problem due to their genetic and phenotypic complexity. In many cases, we lack the comprehensive understanding of disease mechanism necessary for targeted therapeutic development. One key component that could improve both mechanistic understanding and clinical trial design is reliable molecular biomarkers. Presently, no objective biological markers exist to evaluate most neurodevelopmental disorders.  Here we discuss how systems biology and 'omic' approaches could address the mechanistic and biomarker limitations in these afflictions. We present heuristic principles for testing the potential of systems biology to identify mechanisms and biomarkers of disease in the example of Rett syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by a well-defined monogenic defect in MECP2. We propose that such an approach can not only aid in monitoring clinical disease severity, but can also provide a measure of target engagement in clinical trials. By deepening our understanding of the “big picture” of systems biology, this path could even help generate hypotheses for drug development programs, hopefully resulting in new treatments for these devastating conditions.</content>

 Sensory processing disorder (SPD), a developmental regulatory condition characterized by marked under- or over-responsivity to non-noxious sensory stimulation, is a common but poorly understood disorder that can profoundly affect mood, cognition, social behavior and adaptive life skills. Little is known about the etiology and neural underpinnings. Clinical research indicates that children with SPD show greater prevalence of difficulties in complex cognitive behavior including working memory, behavioral flexibility, and regulation of sensory and affective functions, which are related to prefrontal cortex (PFC), striatal, and midbrain regions. Neuroimaging may provide insight into mechanisms underlying SPD, and animal experiments provide important evidence that is not available in human studies. Rhesus monkeys (N = 73) were followed over a 20-year period from birth into old age. We focused on a single sensory modality, the tactile system, measured at 5-7 years, because of its critical importance for nourishment, attachment, and social reward in development. Positron emission tomography imaging was conducted at ages 12-18 years to quantify the availability of the D1 and D2 subtypes of the DA receptor (D1R and D2R), and the DA transporter (DAT). Heightened tactile responsivity was related to (a) elevated D1R in PFC overall, including lateral, ventrolateral, medial, anterior cingulate (aCg), frontopolar, and orbitofrontal (OFC) subregions, as well as nucleus accumbens (Acb), (b) reduced D2R in aCg, OFC, and substantia nigra / ventral tegmental area, and (c) elevated DAT in putamen. These findings suggest a mechanism by which DA pathways may be altered in SPD. These pathways are associated with reward processing and pain regulation, providing top-down regulation of sensory and affective processes. The balance between top-down cognitive control in the PFC-Acb pathway and bottom-up motivational function of the VTA-Acb-PFC pathway is critical for successful adaptive function. An imbalance in these two systems might explain DA-related symptoms in children with SPD, including reduced top-down regulatory function and exaggerated responsivity to stimuli. These results provide more direct evidence that SPD may involve altered DA receptor and transporter function in PFC, striatal, and midbrain regions. More work is needed to extend these results to humans.</content>

		<content type="html">
 The lateralization of neuronal processing underpinning hearing, speech, language, and music is widely studied, vigorously debated, and still not understood in a satisfactory manner. One set of hypotheses focuses on the temporal structure of perceptual experience and links auditory cortex asymmetries to underlying differences in neural populations with differential temporal sensitivity (e.g. ideas advanced by Zatorre et al. 20021; Poeppel 20032). The Asymmetric Sampling in Time theory (AST; Poeppel 20032), builds on cytoarchitectonic differences between auditory cortices and predicts that modulation frequencies within the range of, roughly, the syllable rate, are more accurately tracked by the right hemisphere. To date, this conjecture is reasonably well supported, since - while there is some heterogeneity in the reported findings - the predicted asymmetrical entrainment has been observed in various experimental protocols. Here, we show that under specific processing demands, the rightward dominance disappears. We propose an enriched and modified version of the asymmetric sampling hypothesis in the context of speech. Recent work (Rimmele et al. 20183) proposes two different mechanisms to underlie the auditory tracking of the speech envelope: one derived from the intrinsic oscillatory properties of auditory regions; the other induced by top-down signals coming from other non-auditory regions of the brain. We propose that under non-speech listening conditions, the intrinsic auditory mechanism dominates and thus, in line with AST, entrainment is rightward lateralized, as is widely observed. However, (i) depending on individual brain structural/functional differences, and/or (ii) in the context of specific speech listening conditions, the relative weight of the top-down mechanism can increase. In this scenario, the typically observed auditory sampling asymmetry (and its rightward dominance) diminishes or vanishes.</content>

 Background: Multi-site MRI studies are often necessary for recruiting sufficiently-sized samples when studying rare conditions. However, they require pooling data from multiple scanners into a single data set, and therefore it is critical to evaluate the variability of quantitative MRI measures within and across scanners used in multi-site studies. The aim of this study was to evaluate the reproducibility of structural and diffusion weighted MRI measurements acquired on seven scanners at five medical centers as part of the Tuberous Sclerosis Complex Autism Center of Excellence Research Network (TACERN) multisite study. 

Methods: The American College of Radiology phantom was imaged monthly to measure reproducibility of signal intensity and uniformity within and across seven 3T scanners from General Electric, Philips, and Siemens vendors. One healthy adult male volunteer was imaged repeatedly on all seven scanners under the TACERN structural and diffusion weighted protocol (5 b=0 s/mm2 and 30 b=1000 s/mm2) over a period of 5 years (age 22-27 years). Reproducibility of inter- and intra-scanner brain segmentation volumes and diffusion tensor imaging metrics fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) within white matter regions was quantified with coefficient of variation.  

Results: ACR Phantom signal intensity and uniformity were similar across scanners and changed little over time, with a mean intra-scanner coefficient of variation of 3.6% and 1.8%, respectively. The mean inter- and intra-scanner coefficients of variation of brain structure volumes derived from T1-weighted images of the human phantom were 3.3% and 1.1%, respectively. The mean inter- and intra-scanner coefficients of variation of FA in white matter regions were 4.5% and 2.5%, while the mean inter- and intra-scanner coefficients of variation of MD in white matter regions were 5.4% and 1.5%. 

Conclusions: Our results suggest that volumetric and diffusion tensor imaging measurements are highly reproducible between and within scanners and provide typical variation amplitudes that can be used as references to interpret future findings in the TACERN network.</content>

 Erythropoietin (EPO) not only is a hormone that promotes erythropoiesis but also has a neuroprotective effect on hypoxic neurons related with their known antiapoptotic action. In a focal brain-hypoxia model, our group have previously demonstrated that recombinant-human EPO (rHu-Epo) can protect neurons with a Hypoxia Inducible Factor 1 (HIF-1) expression of EPO-receptor (EPO-R) and P-glycoprotein (P-gp). We and others also have reported that repetitive seizures can mimic a hypoxic-like condition by HIF-1nuclear translocationand high neuronal expression P-gp. Here, we document not only that excitotoxic stress can also induce the expression of EPO-R, but rHu-EPO can reverse the P-gp transport activity under the mentioned hypoxic-like conditions. A single status epilepticus (SE) of twenty minutes was induced in adult rats using the lithium-pilocarpine model. In vitro, primary cultures of neurons were briefly exposed to an excitotoxic concentration of glutamate (300 µM), while cultured astroglial-cells were treated for 6h with 0.3 mM of CoCl2, and later, the inhibitory effect of increased concentrations of rHu-Epo on Rhodamine 123 (Rho-123) P-gp dependent efflux was assayed. The specific P-gp blocker Tariquidar (1 µM) or saline, were used as positive or negative inhibitory controls respectively. SE promoted high co-expression of P-gp and EPO-R in cortical neurons and astrocytes. In vitro, neurons treated with glutamic acid exhibited nuclear translocation of HIF-1 and NFB and high overexpression P-gp and EPO-R. In cultured astroglial-cells treated with CoCl2, rHu-Epo recovered significantly the Rho-123 retention in a similar way of tariquidar. Our results confirm that convulsive stress promotes nuclear translocations of HIF- and NFkB transcription factors with a concomitant induction of neuronal expression of P-gp and EPO-R, suggesting that convulsive stress could mimic a hypoxic condition without oxygen deprivation. Furthermore, we demonstrate for the first time that rHu-Epo can inhibit the Rho-123 efflux activity. All these data suggest that EPO/EPO-R system stimulation could play a central role not only in brain cell protection after different stress signals, but also it could reverse the pharmacoresistant phenotype in refractory epilepsy as well as in other pharmacoresistant hypoxic brain diseases simultaneously expressing EPO-R and P-gp.</content>

 Synaptic modification in cortical structures underlies the acquisition of novel information that results in learning and memory formation.  In the adult dentate gyrus, circuit remodeling is boosted by the generation of new granule cells (GCs) that contribute to specific aspects of memory encoding. These forms of plasticity decrease in the aging brain, where both the rate of adult neurogenesis and the speed of morphological maturation of newly-generated neurons decline. In the young-adult brain, a brief novel experience accelerates the integration of new neurons. The extent to which such degree of plasticity is preserved in the aging hippocampus remains unclear. In this work, we characterized the time course of functional integration of adult-born GCs in middle-aged mice. We performed whole-cell recordings in developing GCs from Ascl1CreERT2;CAGfloxStopTom mice and found a late onset of functional excitatory synaptogenesis, which occurred at 4 weeks (vs. 2 weeks in young-adult mice). Overall mature excitability and maximal glutamatergic connectivity were achieved at 10 weeks. In contrast, large mossy fiber boutons (MFBs) in CA3 displayed mature morphological features including filopodial extensions at 4 weeks, suggesting that efferent connectivity develops faster than afference. Notably, new GCs from aging mice exposed to enriched environment for 7 days showed an advanced degree of maturity at 3 weeks, revealed by the high frequency of excitatory postsynaptic responses, complex dendritic trees, and large size of MFBs with filopodial extensions. These findings demonstrate that adult-born neurons act as sensors that transduce behavioral stimuli into major network remodeling in the aging brain.</content>

 Epilepsy is a serious neurological disorder and characterized by recurrent and unprovoked seizures. A critical pathological factor in the seizure genesis is neuronal loss. Until now, apart from the known regulatory cell death pathways, the newest one is ferroptosis, a newly discovered type of cell death with the features of iron accumulation and excessive production of lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS). In our present work, it was illustrated that ferroptosis occurred in murine models of pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) kindling and pilocarpine (Pilo)-induced seizures. In both of these two seizure models, treatment with ferroptosis inhibitor ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1) efficiently alleviated seizures. This was through elevated levels of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and glutathione (GSH) as well as inhibitions of lipid degradation product including 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) and malonaldehyde (MDA), iron accumulation and PTGS2 mRNA in hippocampus. It is concluded that ferroptosis is involved in the seizure genesis in PTZ- and Pilo-treated mice, and suppression of ferroptosis mitigates PTZ kindling and Pilo-induced seizures in mice.</content>

 Migraine is a highly disabling disease characterized by recurrent pain.Despite an intensive effort, mechanisms of migraine pathophysiology,  still represent an unsolved issue. Evidences from both animals and humans studies suggest that migraine is characterized by hyperresponsivity or hyperexcitability of sensory cortices, especially the visual cortex. This phenomenon, in turn, may affect multisensory processing. Indeed, migraineurs present with an abnormal, reduced, perception of the Sound-induced Flash Illusion (SiFI), a crossmodal illusion that relies on optimal integration of visual and auditory stimuli by the occipital visual cortex. Decreasing visual cortical excitability with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can increase the SiFI in healthy subjects.
Moving from these issues , we applied cathodal tDCS over the visual cortex of migraineurs, with and without aura, in order to decrease cortical excitability and thus physiologically restoring the perception of a reliable SiFI. Differently from our expectations tDCS was unable to reliably modulate SiFI in migraine. The chronic, relatively excessive, visual cortex hyperexcitability, , featuring the migraineur brain, may render tDCS ineffective for restoring multisensory processing in this disease.</content>

 Background: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a neuropsychiatric affective disorder that can develop after traumatic life-events. Exposure-based therapy is currently one of the most effective treatments for PTSD. However, exposure to traumatic stimuli is so aversive that a significant number of patients drop-out of therapy during the course of treatment. Among various attempts to develop novel therapies that bypass such aversiveness, neurofeedback appears promising. With neurofeedback, patients can unconsciously self-regulate brain activity via real-time monitoring and feedback of the EEG or fMRI signals. With conventional neurofeedback methods, however, it is difficult to induce neural representation related to specific trauma because the feedback is based on the neural signals averaged within specific brain areas. To overcome this difficulty, novel neurofeedback approaches such as Decoded Neurofeedback (DecNef) might prove helpful. Instead of the average BOLD signals, DecNef allows patients to implicitly regulate multivariate voxel patterns of the BOLD signals related with feared stimuli.  Here, we review recent advances in application of neurofeedback to PTSD treatments, including the DecNef. This review is intended to be informative for neuroscientists in general as well as practitioners planning to use neurofeedback as a therapeutic strategy for PTSD. 
Methods:  Follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, a systematic review was conducted to compare DecNef effect with those of conventional EEG/fMRI-based neurofeedback on PTSD amelioration. To elucidate the possible mechanisms of DecNef on fear reduction, we mathematically modeled the effects of exposure-based and counter conditioning separately and applied it to the data obtained from past DecNef studies. Finally, we conducted DecNef on four PTSD patients.
Results: Our mathematical model suggested that exposure is the key component for DecNef effects in the past studies. Following DecNef a significant reduction of PTSD severity was observed. This effect was comparable to those reported for conventional neurofeedback approach. 
Conclusions: Although a much larger number of participants will be needed in future, DecNef could be a promising therapy that bypasses the unpleasantness of conscious exposure associated with conventional therapies for fear related disorders, including PTSD.</content>

 HIV-1 associated neuropathy is the most common neurological complication of HIV, with debilitating pain affecting the quality of life. HIV-1 gp120 plays an important role in the pathogenesis of HIV neuropathy via direct neurotoxic effects or indirect pro-inflammatory responses. Studies have shown that gp120-induced release of mediators from Schwann cell induce CCR5-dependent DRG neurotoxicity; However, CCR5 antagonists failed to improve pain in HIV infected individual. Thus, there is an urgent need for better understanding its pathogenesis and developing effective therapeutic strategies. Because lysosomal exocytosis in Schwann cells is an indispensable process for regulating myelination and demyelination, we determined the extent to which gp120 affected lysosomal exocytosis in human Schwann cells. We demonstrated that gp120 promoted the movement of lysosomes towards plasma membrane, induced lysosomal exocytosis, and increased the release of ATP into the extracellular media. Mechanistically, we demonstrated lysosome de-acidification, and activation of P2X4 and VNUT to underlie gp120-induced lysosome exocytosis. Functionally, we demonstrated that gp120-induced lysosome exocytosis and release of ATP from Schwann cell lead to increase in intracellular calcium and generation of cytosolic reactive oxygen species in DRG neurons. Our results suggest that gp120-induced lysosome exocytosis and the release of ATP from Schwann cells affect DRG neurons function and contribute to pathogenesis of HIV-1 associated neuropathy.</content>

 Alzheimer ’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia in the elderly, which is characterized by progressive cognitive impairment. Neuritic plaques, neurofibrillary tangles and neuronal loss are the major neuropathological hallmarks in AD brains. TMP21 is a key molecule for protein trafficking in cells. Growing evidence indicated indicates that TMP21 is dysregulated in AD, which plays a pivotal role in neuritic plaque formation. Therefore, we aim to review the dysregulation of TMP21 in AD, the role of TMP21 in neuritic plaque formation and underlying mechanisms. Moreover, the potential role of TMP21 in neurofibrillary tangle formation, synaptic impairment and neuronal loss is discussed. It will provide an outlook into the potential of regulating TMP21 as a therapeutic approach for AD treatment.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Huntington disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disease characterized by a clinical triad of motor, psychiatric and cognitive symptoms. HD is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the gene encoding the huntingtin protein. Homozygosity for the HD-causing mutation is extremely rare; thus, the majority of HD patients express the mutant huntingtin protein in addition to reduced levels of the non-pathogenic huntingtin protein. Deficits in synaptic plasticity, including hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP), have been identified in various mouse models of HD and are thought to contribute to the debilitating cognitive symptoms associated with the disease. However, the bulk of these studies used N-terminal fragment or homozygous knock-in mouse models of HD at symptomatic ages, and our understanding of the onset and progression of synaptic plasticity deficits in the HD brain is lacking. To better understand the time-course of synaptic plasticity deficits in HD, as well as the impact of heterozygous and homozygous huntingtin mutations, we quantified basal synaptic connectivity, presynaptic release probability, presynaptically-mediated post-tetanic potentiation (PTP) and postsynaptically-mediated LTP at presymptomatic, early symptomatic and late symptomatic ages in heterozygous and homozygous Q175FDN knock-in HD mice. Our results demonstrate clear age-dependent effects of the HD-causing mutation on both short and long-term plasticity that generally emerge earlier in homozygous mice. Interestingly, deficits in presynaptic short-term plasticity were more closely linked to disease progression than deficits in postsynaptic long-term potentiation, and heterozygous mice were more susceptible to an LTP deficit when induced by high frequency stimulation compared to theta burst stimulation. To the best of our knowledge, the present study represents the most thorough characterization to date of the onset and progression of hippocampal synaptic plasticity deficits in a mouse model of HD, and should prove valuable to future studies exploring cellular mechanisms underlying the debilitating cognitive decline in HD.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Proper axonal growth and guidance is essential for neuron differentiation and development.  Abnormal neuronal development due to genetic or epigenetic influences can contribute to neurological and mental disorders such as Down syndrome, Rett syndrome and autism. Identification of the molecular targets that promote proper neuronal growth and differentiation may restore structural and functional neuroplasticity and thus improve functional performance in neurodevelopmental disorders. Using differentiated human neuronal progenitor cells (NPCs) derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), the present study demonstrated that, in early stages differentiation of human NPCs, neuron-targeted overexpression constitutively active Rac1 (Rac1CA) and constitutively active Cdc42 (Cdc42CA) enhance expression of P-Cav-1, T-Cav-1 and P-cofilin and increases axonal growth. Similarly, neuron-targeted over-expression of Cav-1 (termed SynCav1) also increases axonal development by increased axon length and volume. Moreover, inhibition of Cav-1(Y14A) phosphorylation blunts Rac1/Cdc42-mediated axonal growth and differentiation of human NPCs, and SynCav1(Y14A)-treated NPCs exhibited blunted axonal growth. These results suggest that: 1) P-Cav-1 is necessary for proper axonal growth during early stages of neuronal differentiation, 2) SynCav1-mediated axonal growth is dependent upon Cav-1 phosphorylation, 3) Rac1/Cdc42CA-mediated neuronal growth may in part be dependent upon P-Cav-1.  In conclusion, Cav-1 phosphorylation is essential for axonal growth during early stage of human neuronal differentiation.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Background/Aims: 
Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) is induced by chronic deficit of brain perfusion, contributes to a persistent or progressive cognitive dysfunction, which is characterized by diverse neuropathological manifestations. There are currently no effective medications available. White matter damage (WMD) and cortical neuron death may be caused by CCH, which are related to cognitive impairment, while the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. In the study, a database of the transcriptome level was built to determine potential biomarkers in cortex of CCH.
Methods: CCH was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats by permanent occlusion of the bilateral common carotid arteries. Rats were randomly divided into three groups: Sham-operated group (n=24), the 4th and 8th week of CCH groups (total=56, n=28 for each group). Cognitive function was evaluated using the Morris water maze task. WMD and neuron damage were detected using diffusion tensor imaging and histological analysis, respectively. Western blotting analysis of various markers was used to examine neuronal death. Whole-transcriptome microarray was performed to assess mRNA, circRNA, and lncRNA expression profiles at 4th and 8th weeks after CCH. Diversified bioinformatic tools were performed to analyse and predict the key biological processes and signaling pathways of differentially expressed RNAs and co-expressed potential target genes. Co-expression networks of mRNA-circRNA-miRNA and lncRNA-mRNA were constructed.
Results: Compared to the sham group, cognitive impairment, disintegration of white matter, blood-brain barrier damage and neuron death were induced by CCH. Neuron death including apoptosis and necroptosis might occur in the cortex of CCH. We constructed the regulatory networks of whole-transcriptomic including differentially expressed mRNAs, circRNAs, and lncRNAs, and related biological functions and pathways involved in neurological disease, cell death and survival, energy and metabolism, et al. Our results also indicated that Cyr61 mRNA may play a role in the CCH-related cortical neuronal death. 
Conclusion: WMD and cortical neuronal death are worthy of attention in the pathogenesis of CCH. Additionally, the present results provide potential evidence at the whole-transcription level for CCH, offering candidate biomarkers and therapeutic targets.</content>

 The anatomical organization of distinct regions in the insect brain often reflects their functions. In the present study, the brain structure of A. lucorum was examined by using immunolabeling and three-dimensional reconstruction. The results revealed the location and volume of prominent neuropils, such as the antennal lobes, optic lobes, anterior optic tubercles, central body, lateral accessory lobes, mushroom lobes, and distinct tritocerebral neuropils. As expected, this brain is similar to that of other insects. One exception, however, is that the antennal lobes were found to be the most prominent neuropils. Their size relative to the entire brain is the largest among all insect species studied so far. In contrast, the calyx, a region getting direct input from the antennal lobe, has a smaller size relative to the brain than that of other species. These findings may suggest that olfaction plays an essential role for A. lucorum.</content>

 When sentence processing taxes verbal working memory, comprehension difficulties arise. This is specifically the case when processing resources decline with advancing adult age. Such decline likely affects the encoding of sentences into working memory, which constitutes the basis for successful comprehension. To assess age differences in encoding-related electrophysiological activity, we recorded the electroencephalogram from three age groups (24, 43, 65 years). Using an auditory sentence comprehension task, age differences in encoding-related oscillatory power were examined with respect to the accuracy of the given response. That is, the difference in oscillatory power between correctly and incorrectly encoded sentences, yielding subsequent memory effects (SME), was compared across age groups. Across age groups, we observed an age-related SME inversion in the alpha band from a power decrease in younger adults to a power increase in older adults. We suggest that this SME inversion underlies age-related comprehension difficulties. With alpha being commonly linked to inhibitory processes, this shift may reflect a change in the cortical inhibition–disinhibition balance. A cortical disinhibition may imply enriched sentence encoding in younger adults. In contrast, resource limitations in older adults may necessitate an increase in cortical inhibition during sentence encoding to avoid an information overload. Overall, our findings tentatively suggest that age-related comprehension difficulties are associated with alterations to the electrophysiological dynamics subserving general higher cognitive functions.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Postoperative cognitive decline (POCD) is a significant complication of surgery in elderly patients. Emerging researches showed that long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) may play a critical role in the pathogenesis of POCD. Here we aimed to identify potential key lncRNAs involved in the development of POCD. LncRNA and mRNA expression profiles in hippocampal tissues from POCD and control mice were analyzed by microarray assay. Gene ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses were conducted to probe the functions of dysregulated genes. Then, important factors of the mainly affected biological processes were measured in the hippocampus. Correlated coding-noncoding co-expression (CNC) networks were constructed. Finally, the potential key pairs of lncRNA and target mRNA implicated in POCD were probed. Our results showed that a total of 868 differentially expressed lncRNAs and 690 expressed mRNAs were identified. GO and KEGG analyses indicated that the differentially expressed genes were mainly associated with inflammatory and apoptotic signaling pathways. Surgery-induced inflammatory cytokines and apoptosis were significantly increased in hippocampal tissues of aged mice. In CNC network analysis, we found that LncRNA uc009qbj.1 was negatively correlated with apoptosis-associated gene Vrk2 level. LncRNA ENSMUST00000174338 correlated positively with expression of the inflammation and apoptosis-associated gene Smad7. LncRNA NONMMUT00000123687 mediated gene expression by binding the inflammation-regulated transcription factor Meis2. Our results suggested that these potential key lncRNAs and mRNAs may play a vital role in the development of POCD through mediating neuronal inflammation or apoptosis.</content>

		<content type="html">
 It has been demonstrated that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) can regulate the transcription of its target gene, insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) , and thus enhance the expression of the IDE protein. The protein can degrade β amyloid (Aβ), a core pathological product of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). PPARγ can also regulate the transcription of other target gene, β-amyloid cleavage enzyme 1 (BACE1), and thus inhibit the expression of the BACE1 protein. BACE1 can hydrolyze amyloid precursor protein (APP), the precursor of Aβ. In adipose tissue, PPARγ agonists can inhibit the phosphorylation of PPARγ by inhibiting cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5), which in turn affects the expression of target genes regulated by PPARγ. PPARγ agonists may also exert inhibitory effects on the phosphorylation of PPARγ in the brain, thereby affecting the expression of the aforementioned PPARγ target genes and reducing Aβ levels. The present study confirmed this hypothesis by showing that PPARγ agonist pioglitazone attenuated the neuronal apoptosis of primary rat hippocampal neurons induced by Aβ1-42, downregulated CDK5 expression, weakened the binding of CDK5 to PPARγ, reduced PPARγ phosphorylation, increased the expression of PPARγ and IDE, decreased the expression of BACE1, reduced APP production, and downregulated intraneuronal Aβ1-42 levels. These effects were inhibited by the PPARγ antagonist GW9662. After CDK5 silencing with CDK5 shRNA, the above effect of pioglitazone was not observed, except when upregulating the expression of PPARγ in Aβ1-42 treated neurons. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that pioglitazone could inhibit the phosphorylation of PPARγ in vitro by inhibiting CDK5 expression, which in turn affected the expression of PPARγ target genes Ide and Bace1, thereby promoting Aβ degradation and reducing Aβ production. This reduced Aβ levels in the brain, thereby exerting neuroprotective effects in an AD model.</content>

 Alzheimer’s disease (AD), which afflicts an estimated 20 million people worldwide, is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly and constitutes the fourth leading cause of death in the developed world. The major neuropathological features of AD are synaptic and neuronal degeneration and the presence of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. The main protein component of the amyloid plaques is the amyloid-beta peptide (Aβ). Accumulation of Aβ in the brain of AD patients is thought to be central in the pathogenesis of AD. During the last decade, it has become been clear that the synaptic loss and neuronal degeneration underlying early cognitive impairments are caused by small aggregates termed Aβ oligomers.
The blood brain barrier (BBB) is a layer of tightly packed cells that normally regulates the entry of substances into the brain, whiles maintains the removal of toxic molecules from brain to blood. Alzheimer ́s patients and research models evidence BBB impairment and dysfunction accompanying AD. It is not clearly understood if Aβ clearance through the BBB is affected in AD and whether this dynamic is affected by an impaired peripheral clearance due to other non-neurological pathological conditions. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), is a spectrum of liver disorders characterized by accumulation of fat in the liver accompanied by varying degrees of inflammation and hepatocyte injury. In the last decade, NAFLD has been the focus of intense research due of its pandemic reach (estimated prevalence between 20 and 30% of the general population). This review summarizes the current state of the literature linking NAFLD and Alzheimer ́s disease, highlighting the role of the major Aβ efflux and clearance player - the LRP1 receptor- which is abundantly expressed in liver, brain, and vasculatures.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Episodic memory is the capacity to encode, store, and retrieve information of specific past events. Several studies have shown that decline in episodic memory accompanies aging, but most of these studies assessed memory performance through intentional learning. In this approach, the individuals deliberately acquire knowledge. Yet, another method to evaluate episodic memory performance - receiving less attention by the research community - is incidental learning. Here, participants do not explicitly intent to learn. Incidental learning becomes increasingly important over the lifespan, since people spent less time in institutions where intentional learning is required (e.g., school, university, or at work). Yet, we know little how incidental learning impacts episodic memory performance in advanced age. Likewise, the neural mechanisms underlying incidental learning in older age remain largely unknown. 
Thus, the immediate goal of this review was to summarize the existing literature on how incidental learning changes with age and how neural mechanisms map onto these age-related changes. We considered behavioural as well as neuroimaging studies using incidental learning paradigms (alone or in combination with intentional learning) to assess episodic memory performance in elderly adults. We conducted a systematic literature search on the Medline/PubMed, Cochrane and OVID SP databases and searched the reference lists of articles. The search yielded 238 studies, of which 27 concerned incidental learning and episodic memory in older adults.
In sum, these studies suggest that aging particularly affects episodic memory after incidental learning for cognitively demanding tasks. Monitoring deficits in older adults might account for these findings since cognitively demanding tasks need increased attentional resources. On a neuronal level, dysregulation of the default-mode-network mirrors monitoring deficits, with an attempt to compensate through increased frontal activity. Future (neuroimaging) studies should systematically evaluate retrieval tasks with diverging cognitive load and consider the influence of attention and executive functions in more detail.</content>

 To effectively promote life-long health and resilience against — for example — neurodegenerative diseases, evidence-based recommendations must acknowledge the complex multidimensionality not only of the diseases but also of personal lifestyle. In a straightforward descriptive and heuristic framework, 50+ potential lifestyle factors cluster around diet (D), education (E), exercise (E) and purpose (P), unveiling their many relationships across domains and scales. The resulting systematics and its visualization might be a small but helpful step towards the development of more comprehensive, interdisciplinary models of lifestyle-dependent risk and resilience and a means to explain the opportunities and limitations of preventive measures to the public and other stakeholders. Most importantly, this perspective onto the subject implies that not all lifestyle factors are created equal but that there is a hierarchy of values and needs that influences the success of life-style based interventions.</content>

 The bacterial flagellar motor is a molecular machine that can rotate the flagellar filament at high speed. The rotation is generated by the stator-rotor interaction, coupled with an ion flux through the torque-generating stator. Here we employed cryo-electron tomography to visualize the intact flagellar motor in the Lyme disease spirochete, &lt;i&gt;Borrelia burgdorferi&lt;/i&gt;. By analyzing the motor structures of wild-type and stator-deletion mutants, we not only localized the stator complex &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt;, but also revealed the stator-rotor interaction at an unprecedented detail. Importantly, the stator-rotor interaction induces a conformational change in the flagella C-ring. Given our observation that a non-motile mutant, in which proton flux is blocked, cannot generate the similar conformational change, we propose that the proton-driven torque is responsible for the conformational change required for flagellar rotation.</content>

 Previously we described direct cellular interactions between microglia and AKT1+ brain tumour cells in zebrafish (Chia et al., 2018). However, it was unclear how these interactions were initiated: it was also not clear if they had an impact on the growth of tumour cells. Here, we show that neoplastic cells hijack mechanisms that are usually employed to direct microglial processes towards highly active neurons and injuries in the brain. We show that AKT1+ cells possess dynamically regulated high intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; levels. Using a combination of live imaging, genetic and pharmacological tools we show that these Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients stimulate ATP mediated interactions with microglia. Interfering with Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+ &lt;/sup&gt;levels, inhibiting ATP release and CRISPR mediated mutation of the &lt;i&gt;p2ry12&lt;/i&gt; locus abolishes these interactions. Finally, we show that reducing the number of microglial interactions significantly impairs the proliferation of neoplastic AKT1 cells. In conclusion, neoplastic cells repurpose the endogenous neuron to microglia signalling mechanism via P2ry12 activation to promote their own proliferation.</content>

		<link href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/40593"/>
		<id>https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.40593</id>

		<content type="html">
 Emerging evidence indicates the role of amino acid metabolism in sleep regulation. Here we demonstrate sleep-promoting effects of dietary threonine (SPET) in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;. Dietary threonine markedly increased daily sleep amount and decreased the latency to sleep onset in a dose-dependent manner. High levels of synaptic GABA or pharmacological activation of metabotropic GABA receptors (GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;-R) suppressed SPET. By contrast, synaptic blockade of GABAergic neurons or transgenic depletion of GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;-R in the ellipsoid body R2 neurons enhanced sleep drive non-additively with SPET. Dietary threonine reduced GABA levels, weakened metabotropic GABA responses in R2 neurons, and ameliorated memory deficits in plasticity mutants. Moreover, genetic elevation of neuronal threonine levels was sufficient for facilitating sleep onset. Taken together, these data define threonine as a physiologically relevant, sleep-promoting molecule that may intimately link neuronal metabolism of amino acids to GABAergic control of sleep drive via the neuronal substrate of sleep homeostasis.</content>

The dynamics of tumor progression is driven by multiple factors, which can be exogenous to the tumor (microenvironment) or intrinsic (genetic, epigenetic or due to intercellular interactions). While tumor heterogeneity has been extensively studied on the level of cell genetic profiles or cellular composition, tumor morphological diversity has not been given as much attention. The limited analysis of tumor morphophenotypes may be attributed to the lack of accurate models, both experimental and computational, capable of capturing changes in tumor morphology with fine levels of spatial detail. Using a three-dimensional, agent-based, lattice-free computational model, we generated a library of multicellular tumor organoids, the experimental analogues of in vivo tumors. By varying three biologically relevant parameters—cell radius, cell division age and cell sensitivity to contact inhibition, we showed that tumor organoids with similar growth dynamics can express distinct morphologies and possess diverse cellular compositions. Taking advantage of the high-resolution of computational modeling, we applied the quantitative measures of compactness and accessible surface area, concepts that originated from the structural biology of proteins. Based on these analyses, we demonstrated that tumor organoids with similar sizes may differ in features associated with drug effectiveness, such as potential exposure to the drug or the extent of drug penetration. Both these characteristics might lead to major differences in tumor organoid’s response to therapy. This indicates that therapeutic protocols should not be based solely on tumor size, but take into account additional tumor features, such as their morphology or cellular packing density.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/NReL99flWN4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Once biological systems are modeled by regulatory networks, the next step is to include external stimuli, which model the experimental possibilities to affect the activity level of certain network’s nodes, in a mathematical framework. Then, this framework can be interpreted as a mathematical optimal control framework such that optimization algorithms can be used to determine external stimuli which cause a desired switch from an initial state of the network to another final state. These external stimuli are the intervention points for the corresponding biological experiment to obtain the desired outcome of the considered experiment. In this work, the model of regulatory networks is extended to controlled regulatory networks. For this purpose, external stimuli are considered which can affect the activity of the network’s nodes by activation or inhibition. A method is presented how to calculate a selection of external stimuli which causes a switch between two different steady states of a regulatory network. A software solution based on Jimena and Mathworks Matlab is provided. Furthermore, numerical examples are presented to demonstrate application and scope of the software on networks of 4 nodes, 11 nodes and 36 nodes. Moreover, we analyze the aggregation of platelets and the behavior of a basic T-helper cell protein-protein interaction network and its maturation towards Th0, Th1, Th2, Th17 and Treg cells in accordance with experimental data.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/b4KwTp2lFtg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

While concepts stemming from network science provide a valuable starting point, the interpretation of graph-theoretic structures and measures can be highly dependent on the dynamics associated to the network. Properties that are quite meaningful for linear dynamics, such as random walk and network flow models, may be of limited relevance in the neuroscience setting. Theoretical and computational neuroscience are playing a vital role in understanding the relationship between network connectivity and the nonlinear dynamics associated to neural networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

 Abstract&lt;p&gt;The cytoarchitecture of a neuron is very important in defining morphology and ultrastructure. Though there is a wealth of information on the molecular components that make and regulate these ultrastructures, there is a dearth of understanding of how these changes occur or how they affect neurons in health and disease. Recent advances in nanoscale imaging which resolve cellular structures at the scale of tens of nanometres below the limit of diffraction enable us to understand these structures in fine detail. However, automated analysis of these images is still in its infancy. Towards this goal, attempts have been made to automate the detection and analysis of the cytoskeletal organization of microtubules. To date, evaluation of the nanoscale organization of filamentous actin (F-actin) in neuronal compartments remains challenging. Here, we present an objective paradigm for analysis which adopts supervised learning of nanoscale images of F-actin network in excitatory synapses, obtained by single molecule based super-resolution light microscopy. We have used the proposed analysis to understand the heterogeneity in the organization of F-actin in dendritic spines of primary neuronal cultures from rodents. Our results were validated using ultrastructural data obtained from Platinum Replica Electron Microscopy. The automated analysis approach was used to differentiate the heterogeneity in the nanoscale organization of F-actin in primary neuronal cultures from wild type and a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer’s Disease (APP&lt;sub&gt;Swe&lt;/sub&gt;/PS1E9).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; Organization of F-actin in dendritic spines is known to be important in maintaining the structure and function of excitatory synapses. Multicolour super-resolution microscopy enables us to have better insights into its organization in health and disease. Here, we have combined novel methods for the analysis of nanoscale images of F-actin network using segmentation with pattern recognition based on supervised learning. This automated approach was validated using Platinum Replica Electron Microscopy images of F-actin organization in dendritic spines. Furthermore, we have explored the differences in the nanoscale F-actin network in wild type and transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer's disease using this novel approach.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract&lt;p&gt;We investigated the calcium dynamics of dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons using transgenic mice to target expression of the genetically encoded calcium indicator (GECI), GCaMP6s, to a subset of neurons containing parvalbumin, a calcium-binding protein present in proprioceptors and low-threshold mechanoreceptors. This study provides the first analysis of GECI calcium transient parameters from large-diameter DRG neurons. Our approach generated calcium transients of consistent shape and time-course, with quantifiable characteristics. Four parameters of calcium transients were determined to vary independently from each other and thus are likely influenced by different calcium-regulating mechanisms: peak amplitude, rise time, decay time, and recovery time. Pooled analysis of 188 neurons demonstrated unimodal distributions, providing evidence that parvalbumin-positive DRG neurons regulate calcium similarly as a population despite their differences in size, electrical properties, and functional sensitivities. Calcium transients increased in size with elevated extracellular calcium, longer trains of action potentials, and higher stimulation frequencies. Rise time and decay time increased with the addition of the selective SERCA blocker, thapsigargin, while peak amplitude and recovery time remained the same. When elevating bath pH to 8.8 to block PMCA, all measured parameters significantly increased. These results illustrate that GECI calcium transients provide sufficient resolution to detect changes in electrical activity and intracellular calcium concentration, as well as discern information about the activity of specific subclasses of calcium regulatory mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; This study bridges two research fields by applying calcium imaging and transgenic mouse approaches to address, for the first time, questions relevant to motor system scientists regarding proprioceptive neuron physiology. We characterize the average parameters of calcium transients from parvalbumin-positive DRG neurons at a population level, and describe the diversity in calcium dynamics between cells, animals, and sexes. In addition to providing a detailed analysis of parvalbumin-positive neuron calcium homeostasis, the application of calcium imaging in this study expands the repertoire of tools available to electrophysiologists investigating proprioceptive function.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract&lt;p&gt;Brain oscillations from electro-encephalogram (EEG) and magneto-encephalogram (MEG) shed light on neurophysiological mechanisms of human behavior. However, to extract information on cortical processing, researchers have to rely on source localization methods that can be very broadly classified into current density estimates such as exact low resolution electromagnetic tomography (eLORETA), minimum norm estimates (MNE) and beamformers such as Dynamic Imaging of Coherent Sources (DICS) and Linearly Constrained Minimum Variance (LCMV). These algorithms produce a distributed map of brain activity underlying sustained and transient responses during neuroimaging studies of behavior. On the other hand, there are very few comparative analyses that evaluates the &quot;ground truth detection&quot; capabilities of these methods. The current article evaluates the reliability in estimation of sources of spectral event generators in the cortex using a two-pronged approach. First, simulated EEG data with point dipoles and distributed dipoles are used to validate the accuracy and sensitivity of each one of these methods of source localization. The abilities of the techniques were tested by comparing the localization error, focal width, false positive ratios while detecting already known location of neural activity generators under varying signal to noise ratios. Second, empirical EEG data during auditory steady state responses (ASSR) in human participants were used to compare the distributed nature of source localization. All methods were successful in recovery of point sources in favorable signal to noise scenarios and could achieve high hit rates if false positives are ignored. Interestingly, focal activation map is generated by LCMV and DICS when compared to eLORETA while control of false positives is much superior in eLORETA. Subsequently drawbacks and strengths of each method are highlighted with a detailed discussion on how to choose a technique based on empirical requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; State-of-the-art methods of source localization techniques, e.g., current density methods, minimum norm estimates and beamformers report distributed brain activity patterns that are often not in consensus for a putative task. This article offers ground truth validation of these techniques in the context of different kind of source detections, e.g, determining the sources underlying key events (evoked potentials) and steady state brain oscillations (band limited brain activity). The broader goal is to help cognitive neuroscientists select the most effective source localization technique that is in sync with the signal processing needs required for targeting a specific question.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 The promises of nanomedicine are extensive. Graphene, the first true two-dimensional material to exist in isolation, is the type of new nanomaterial that results in interest for novel biomedical applications. From Michael Chrichton’s tragic protagonist in The Terminal Man to the recent growth in start-up companies seeking to transfer consciousness, the fictive present and future call to mind visions of devices that enable neural interfacing and control. Although these ideas may create questions as to ethics for neuroscience in the future, the current state-of-the-art for implanted devices is far more limited in scope. Progress in brain-computer interfaces holds great promise for patients following stroke (Ramos-Murguialday, Broetz et al. 2013), to control prosthetic limbs (Hochberg, Serruya et al. 2006, Donoghue, Nurmikko et al. 2007) , with the motor degeneration characteristic of Parkinson’s disease (Little, Pogosyan et al. 2013), and for a variety of other disorders and diseases (Chaudhary, Birbaumer et al. 2016). Graphene may be poised for incorporation into such devices. As the presence of graphene becomes more widespread and commonplace across the biomedical sciences, the relatively larger body of work detailing the biological effects of carbon nanotubes may serve as a template guiding the utility of graphene for biological applications (Kostarelos, Bianco et al. 2009). 
Graphene-based materials for interfacing with the peripheral nervous system have been reviewed elsewhere (Domínguez-Bajo, González-Mayorga et al. 2017). We instead focus on new directions for application to the central nervous system. This review is limited to preclinical applications, although graphene and graphene-based devices may someday advance to clinical implementation.  We begin with an overview of graphene manufacturing advances, applications to hybrid materials systems as well as drug delivery strategies. This is followed by an overview of work performed with non-murine models.  Finally, the interaction of graphene with murine neural systems, both in vivo and in-vitro is examined.  Despite a sizable body of work, to date there remain many unresolved questions as to cytotoxicity and the mechanisms underlying the graphene-cellular interaction that must be addressed moving forward.</content>

 In today’s society it becomes increasingly important to assess which non-human and non-verbal beings possess consciousness. This review aims to delineate criteria for consciousness especially in animals, while also taking into account intelligent artifacts. First, we circumscribe what we mean with “consciousness” and describe key features of subjective experience: qualitative richness, situatedness, intentionality and interpretation, integration and the combination of dynamic and stabilizing properties. We argue that consciousness has a biological function, which is to present the subject with a multimodal, situational survey of the surrounding world and body, subserving complex decision-making and goal-directed behavior. This survey reflects the brain’s capacity for internal modelling of external events underlying changes in sensory state. Next, we follow an inside-out approach: how can the features of conscious experience, correlating to mechanisms inside the brain, be logically coupled to externally observable (‘outside’) properties? Instead of proposing criteria that would each define a “hard” threshold for consciousness, we outline six indicators: (i) goal-directed behavior and model-based learning, (ii) anatomic and physiological substrates for generating integrative multimodal representations, (iii) psychometrics and meta-cognition, (iv) episodic memory, (v) susceptibility to illusions and multistable perception, and (vi) specific visuospatial behaviors. Rather than emphasizing a particular indicator as being decisive, we propose that the consistency amongst these indicators can serve to assess consciousness in particular species. The integration of scores on the various indicators yields an overall, graded criterion for consciousness, somewhat comparable to the Glasgow Coma Scale for unresponsive patients. When considering theoretically derived measures of consciousness, it is argued that their validity should not be assessed on the basis of a single quantifiable measure, but requires cross-examination across multiple pieces of evidence, including the indicators proposed here. Current intelligent machines, including deep learning neural networks and agile robots, are not indicated to be conscious yet. Instead of assessing machine consciousness by a brief Turing-type of test, evidence for it may gradually accumulate when we study machines ethologically and across time, considering multiple behaviors that require flexibility, improvisation, spontaneous problem-solving and the situational conspectus typically associated with conscious experience.</content>

 Maintaining Ca2+ homeostasis in lymphatic fluids is necessary for proper hearing. Despite its significance, the mechanisms that maintain the cochlear lymphatic Ca2+ concentrations within a certain range are not fully clarified. We investigated the functional expression of calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR), which plays a pivotal role in sensing extracellular Ca2+ concentrations. Western blotting for CaSR revealed an approximately 130-kDa protein expression in cochlear tissue extracts and immunohistochemical analysis revealed its expression specifically in type I fibrocytes in the spiral ligament, fibrocytes in the supralimbal and limbal regions, the epithelium of the osseous spiral lamina, and the smooth muscle cells of the spiral modiolar arteries. Ca2+ imaging demonstrated that extracellular Ca2+ increased the levels of intracellular Ca2+ in CaSR-expressing fibrocytes in the spiral ligament, and that this was suppressed by the CaSR inhibitor, NPS2143. Furthermore, hearing thresholds were moderately elevated by intracochlear application of the CaSR inhibitors NPS2143 and calhex231, across a range of frequencies (8-32 kHz). These results demonstrate the functional expression of CaSR in the cochlear perilymphatic compartment. In addition, the elevated hearing thresholds that are achieved by inhibiting CaSR suggest this is a required mechanism for normal hearing, presumably by sensing perilymphatic Ca2+ to stabilize Ca2+ concentrations within a certain range. These results provide novel insight into the mechanisms regulating Ca2+ homeostasis in the cochlea and provide a new perspective on cochlear physiology.</content>

 The remarkable physiology of the electric eel (Electrophorus electricus) made it one of the first model species in science.  It was pivotal for understanding animal electricity in the 1700’s, was investigated by Humboldt and Faraday in the 1800’s, was leveraged to isolate the acetylcholine receptor in the 20th century, and has inspired the design of new power sources and provided insights to electric organ evolution in the 21st century.  And yet few studies have investigated the electric eel’s behavior.  This review focuses on a series of recently discovered behaviors that evolved alongside the eel’s extreme physiology.  Eels use their high-voltage electric discharge to remotely control prey by transcutaneously activating motor neurons.  Hunting eels use this behavior in two different ways. When prey have been detected, eels use high-voltage to cause immobility by inducing sustained, involuntary muscle contractions.  On the other hand, when prey are hidden, eels often use brief pulses to induce prey twitch, which causes a water movement detected by the eel’s mechanoreceptors.  Once grasped in the eel’s jaws, difficult prey are often subdued by sandwiching them between the two poles (head and tail) of the eel’s powerful electric organ.  The resulting concentration of the high-voltage discharge, delivered at high-rates, causes involuntary fatigue in prey muscles. This novel strategy for inactivating muscles is functionally analogous to poisoning the neuromuscular junction with venom.  For self-defense, electric eels leap from the water to directly electrify threats, efficiently activating nociceptors to deter their target.  The latter behavior supports a legendary account by Alexander von Humboldt who described a battle between electric eels and horses in 1800.  Finally, electric eels use high-voltage not only as a weapon, but also to efficiently track fast moving prey with active electroreception.  In conclusion, remarkable behaviors go hand in hand with remarkable physiology.</content>

 Neurodegenerative diseases have mainly been associated with neuronal death. Recent investigations have shown that astroglia may modulate neuroinflammation in the early and late stages of the disease. [11C]Deuterodeprenyl ([11C]DED) is a tracer that has been used for reactive astrocyte detection in Alzheimer’s disease, Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, among others, with some limitations. To develop a new radiotracer for detecting astrocytosis and overcoming associated difficulties, we recently reported the synthesis of a sulfonamide derivative of Sulforhodamine 101 (SR101), labelled with 18F, namely SR101 N-(3-[18F]Fluoropropyl) sulfonamide ([18F]2B-SRF101). The red fluorescent dye SR101 has been used as a specific marker of astroglia in the neocortex of rodents using in vivo models. In the present work we performed a biological characterisation of the new tracer including biodistribution and micro-PET/computed tomography (CT) images. PET/CT studies with [11C]DED were also done to compare with [18F]2B-SRF101 in order to assess its potential as an astrocyte marker.
Biodistribution studies with [18F]2B-SRF101 were carried out in C57BL6J black and transgenic (3xTg) mice. A hepatointestinal metabolization as well as the pharmacokinetic profile were determined, showing appropriate characteristics to become a PET diagnostic agent.  Dynamic PET/CT studies were carried out with [18F]2B-SRF101 and [11C]DED to evaluate the distribution of both tracers in the brain. 

A significant difference in [18F]2B-SRF101 uptake was especially observed in the cortex and hippocampus, and it was higher in 3xTg mice than it was in the control group. These results suggested that [18F]2B-SRF101 is a promising candidate for more extensive evaluation as an astrocyte tracer. 

The difference observed for [18F]2B-SRF101 was not found in the case of [11C]DED. The comparative studies between [18F]2B-SRF101 and [11C]DED suggest that both tracers have different roles as astrocytosis markers in this animal model, and could provide different and complementary information at the same time. In this way, by means of a multitracer approach, useful information could be obtained for the staging of the disease.</content>

 Background and purpose: Previous neuroimaging studies have demonstrated T2D-related brain structural and functional changes that are partly associated with cognitive decline. However, less is known about the underlying mechanisms. Chronic hyperglycemia and microvascular complications are the two of most important risk factors related to cognitive decline in diabetes. Cerebral small vessel diseases (CSVDs), such as those defined by lacunar infarcts, white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) and microhemorrhages, are also associated with an increased risk of cognitive decline and dementia. In this study, we examined brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) changes in patients in the early stages of T2D without CSVDs to focus on glucose metabolism factors and avoid the interference of vascular risk factors on T2D-related brain damage.
Methods: T2D patients with disease durations of less than five years and without any signs of CSVDs (n＝34) were compared with healthy control subjects (n＝24). Whole-brain region-based functional connectivity was analyzed with network-based statistics (NBS), and brain surface morphology was examined. In addition, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was conducted for all subjects.
Results: At the whole-brain region-based functional connectivity level, thirty-three functional connectivities were changed in T2D patients relative to those in controls, mostly manifested as hyperconnectivities and mainly located between the sensory-motor network and auditory network. Some of the connectivities were positively correlated with blood glucose level, insulin resistance, and MoCA scores in the T2D group. The network-level analysis also showed between-network hyperconnectivity in T2D patients but no significant changes in within-network connectivity. In addition, there were no significant differences in MoCA scores or brain morphology measures, including cortical thickness, surface area, mean curvature, and gray/white matter volume, between the two groups.
Conclusion: The findings indicate that brain hyperconnectivity occurs in the early stages of T2D without CSVDs before the presence of significant brain morphology change and cognitive decline, which may be a neuroimaging basis for predicting cognitive decline in early T2D patients.</content>

 As the third cause of death and cognitive decline in industrialized countries, stroke is a major burden for society. Vascular risks factors such as hypertension and diabetes are involved in most stroke patients, aggravate stroke severity, but are still poorly taken into account in preclinical studies. Microangiopathy and sustained inflammation are exacerbated, likely explaining the severity of stroke in those patients. We sought to demonstrate that intravenous administration of human adipose derived-mesenchymal stem cells (hADMSC) that have immunomodulatory properties, could accelerate sensorimotor recovery, prevent long-term spatial memory and promote neurogenesis, in diabetic or hypertensive mice subjected to permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAo). Diabetic (streptozotocin IP) or hypertensive (L-NAME per os) male C57Bl6 mice subjected to pMCAo, were treated by hADMSC (500,000 cells IV) 2 days post stroke. Infarct volume, neurogenesis microglial/macrophage density, T-lymphocytes density, astrocytes density and vessel density were monitored 7 days after cells injection and at 6 weeks. Neurological sensorimotor deficit and spatial memory were assessed until six weeks post stroke. Whatever the vascular risk factor, hADMSC showed no effect on functional recovery/cognitive decline prevention at short or long-term assessment, nor significantly modified neurogenesis microglial/macrophage, T-lymphocytes, astrocytes and vessel density. This work is part of a European program (H2020, RESSTORE). We discuss the discrepancy of our results with those obtained in rats and the importance of timing, source and type of cells according to the species that is considered. A comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms preventing recovery should help for successful clinical translation but first could allow identifying good and bad responders to cell therapy in stroke.</content>

 Guillain Barré Syndrome (GBS) is an autoimmune disorder caused by the immune system damaging the peripheral nervous system. Increasing evidence suggest that inflammatory cytokines are important mediators for the onset and progression of GBS. A number of clinical studies have demonstrated elevated levels of Th1, Th2 and Th17 related cytokines in the patients with GBS, but results were inconsistent across studies.  Therefore, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies comparing cerebrospinal fluid and peripheral blood inflammatory cytokine levels between the patients with GBS and healthy individuals. The database search identified 30 studies encompassing 1302 GBS patients and 1073 controls to be included. The random-effects meta-analysis demonstrated that blood tumor necrosis factor-ɑ (Hedges g,1.544; 95% CI, 0.923-2.165; p &amp;lt; 0.001), interleukin-1β (IL-1β; Hedges g, 0.678; 95% CI, 0.183-1.172; p = 0.007), IL-6 (Hedges g, 0.630; 95% CI, 0.100 -1.160; p = 0.02), IL-4 (Hedges g, 0.822; 95% CI, 0.220-1.423; p = 0.007 ), IL-17 (Hedges g, 1.452; 95% CI, 0.331-2.573; p = 0.011), interferon-γ (Hedges g,1.104; 95% CI, 0.490-1.719; p &amp;lt; 0.001) and C-reactive protein (Hedges g, 0.909; 95% CI, 0.453-1.365; p &amp;lt; 0.001) levels were significantly increased in the patients with GBS when compared with controls. In contrast, the blood IL-10 and TGF-β levels were not significantly associated with GBS. Furthermore, the meta-analysis found that cerebrospinal fluid IL-17 levels were significantly associated with GBS (Hedges g, 1.882; 95% CI, 0.104-3.661; p = 0.038). Taken together, our results clarified the circulating inflammatory cytokine profile in the patients with GBS, and revealed that Th1, Th2 and Th17 related cytokines were highly elevated in the GBS patients, and suggesting the potential of these cytokines to be used as biomarkers for GBS.</content>

 Adolescence is a unique period in which higher cognition develops to adult-level, while plasticity of neuron and behavior is at one of its peak. Yet, cognitive training studies for adolescents has been sparse and neural correlates of the training effects yet to be established. This study investigated the effects of multicomponent training of cognitive control (MTCC) in order to examine whether the training enhanced adolescents' cognitive control ability and if the effects were generalizable to other cognitive domains. Cognitive control refers to the ability to adjust a series of thoughts and behaviors in correspondence to an internal goal, and involves inhibition, working memory, shifting, and dual tasking as subcomponents. The participants were middle school students (aged 11–14) and randomly assigned to either a training group or an active control group. The training group performed 30 minutes of MTCC per day for six weeks. To identify the training effects, we examined the cognitive performance, regional gray matter, and their relationship. The training group showed modest improvement in a visuospatial fluid intelligence test (Block Design) after MTCC, which was not significant after correcting for multiple comparisons. In addition, the training effect on the gray matter volume (time × group interaction) was observed in the right inferior cortex (rIFC). While the control group showed a typical reduction in the rIFC volume, the training group showed a relative increase in the homologous region. The relative change in rIFC volume was associated with the change in Stroop performance. These results imply that MTCC may affect brain structure relevant to inhibitory control process.</content>

 In EEG measurements, processing of periodic sounds in the ascending auditory pathway generates the frequency-following response (FFR) phase-locked to the fundamental frequency (F0) and its harmonics of a sound. We measured FFRs to the steady-state (vowel) part of syllables /ba/ and /aw/ occurring in binaural rapid streams of speech sounds as frequently repeating standard syllables or as infrequent (p = .2) deviant syllables among standard /wa/ syllables. Our aim was to study whether concurrent active phonological processing affects early processing of irrelevant speech sounds reflected by FFRs to these sounds. To this end, during syllable delivery, our healthy adult participants performed tasks involving written letters delivered on a computer screen in a rapid stream. The stream consisted of vowel letters written in red, infrequently occurring consonant letters written in the same color, and infrequently occurring vowel letters written in blue. In the phonological task, the participants were instructed to press a response key to the consonant letters differing phonologically but not in color from the frequently occurring red vowels, whereas in the non-phonological task, they were instructed to respond to the vowel letters written in blue differing only in color from the frequently occurring red vowels. We observed that the phonological task enhanced responses to deviant /ba/ syllables but not responses to deviant /aw/ syllables. This suggests that active phonological task performance may enhance processing of such small changes in irrelevant speech sounds as the 30-ms difference in the initial formant-transition time between the otherwise identical syllables /ba/ and /wa/ used in the present study.</content>

 Real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging neurofeedback (rtfMRI-NF) is a prospective tool to enhance the emotion regulation capability of participants and to alleviate their emotional disorders. The hippocampus is a key brain region in the emotional brain network and plays a significant role in social cognition and emotion processing in the brain. However, few studies have focused on the emotion NF of the hippocampus. This study investigated the feasibility of NF training of healthy participants to self-regulate the activation of the hippocampus and assessed the effect of rtfMRI-NF on the hippocampus before and after training. Twenty-six right-handed healthy volunteers were randomly assigned to the experimental group receiving hippocampal rtfMRI-NF (n = 13) and the control group (CG) receiving rtfMRI-NF from the intraparietal sulcus rtfMRI-NF (n = 13) and completed a total of 4 NF runs. The hippocampus and the intraparietal sulcus were defined based on the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) standard template, and NF signal was measured as a percent signal change relative to the baseline obtained by averaging the fMRI signal for the preceding 20 s long rest block. NF signal (percent signal change) was updated every 2 s and was displayed on the screen. The amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation and regional homogeneity values were calculated to evaluate the effects of NF on spontaneous neural activity in resting state fMRI. A standard general linear model (GLM) analysis was separately conducted for each fMRI NF run. Results showed that the activation of hippocampus increased after 4 NF training runs. The hippocampal activity of the experiment group participants was higher than that of the CG. They also showed elevated hippocampal activity and the greater amygdala-hippocampus connectivity. The anterior temporal lobe, parahippocampal gyrus, hippocampus, and amygdala of brain regions associated with emotional processing were activated during training. We presented a proof-of-concept study using rtfMRI-NF for hippocampus up-regulation in the recall of positive autobiographical memories. The current study may provide a new method to regulate our emotions and can potentially be applied to the clinical treatment of emotional disorders.</content>

 The brain networks underlying human multiple-cue judgment, the judgment of a continuous criterion based on multiple cues, have been examined in a few recent studies, and the ventral precuneus has been found to be a key region. Specifically, activation differences in ventral precuneus (as measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging, fMRI) has been linked to an exemplar-based judgment process, where judgments are based on memory for previous similar cases. What aspects of exemplar-based judgment ventral precuneus supports is however poorly understood. Ventral precuneus is a brain region important for various episodic memory processes, where increased engagement of this region together with the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and the medial temporal lobes (MTL) during learning have been linked to retrieval success. Several alternatives are plausible, for example that reduced brain activity in ventral precuneus during learning to make exemplar-based judgments could reflect reduced needs for visuo-spatial attention as a function of learning to master the task. The present study used fMRI during a multiple-cue judgment task to gain novel neurocognitive evidence informative for the link between learning-related activity changes in ventral precuneus and exemplar-based judgment. Participants (N = 27) spontaneously learned to make judgments during fMRI, in a multiple-cue judgment task specifically designed to induce exemplar-based processing. Contrasting brain activity during late learning to early learning indeed revealed higher activity in ventral precuneus, the bilateral MTL and the vmPFC. Activity in the ventral precuneus and the vmPFC was found to parametrically increase between each judgment event, and activity levels in the ventral precuneus predicted performance after learning. These results are interpreted such that the ventral precuneus supports the aspects of exemplar-based processes that are related to episodic memory, tentatively by building and retrieving memory representations for judgment.</content>

 The reduction of neuronal responses to repeated stimulus presentation occurs in many sensory neurons, also in the inferior colliculus of birds. Response adaptation plays a role in perceptual auditory phenomena like the precedence effect. The cellular mechanisms that cause response adaptation are not well described. Adaptation must be explicable by changes in the activity of input neurons, short-term synaptic plasticity of the incoming connections, excitability changes of the neuron under consideration or influences of inhibitory or modulatory network connections. Using whole-cell recordings in acute brain slices of the embryonic chicken brain we wanted to understand the intrinsic and synaptic contributions to adaptation in the core of the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus. We described two neuron types in the chicken ICCc based on their action potential firing patterns: Phasic/onset neurons showed strong intrinsic adaptation but recovered more rapidly. Tonic/sustained firing neurons had weaker adaptation but often had additional slow components of recovery from adaptation. Chicken ICCc neurons received mostly mixed AMPA- and NMDA-type glutamatergic synaptic inputs. In the majority of ICCc neurons the input synapses underwent short-term depression. With a simulation of the putative population output activity of the chicken ICCc we showed that the different adaptation profiles of the neuron classes could shift the emphasize of stimulus encoding from transients at long intervals to ongoing parts at short intervals. Thus we report here that description of biophysical and synaptic properties can help to explain adaptive phenomena in central auditory neurons.</content>

 Hearing loss is the most common sensory impairment in humans and currently disables 466 million people across the world. Congenital deafness affects at least one in 500 newborns, and over 50% are hereditary in nature. To date, existing pharmacologic therapies for genetic and acquired etiologies of deafness are severely limited. With the advent of modern sequencing technologies, there is a vast compendium of growing genetic alterations that underlie human hearing loss, which can be targeted by therapeutics such as gene therapy. Recently, there has been tremendous progress in the development of gene therapy vectors to treat sensorineural hearing loss in animal models in vivo. Nevertheless, significant hurdles remain before such technologies can be translated towards clinical use. These include addressing the blood-labyrinth barrier (BLB), engineering more specific and effective delivery vehicles, improving surgical access, and validating novel targets. In this review, we both highlight recent progress and outline challenges associated with in vivo gene therapy for human sensorineural hearing loss.</content>

 ANNINE-6 and ANNINE-6plus are voltage-sensitive dyes that when combined with two-photon microscopy are ideal for recording of neuronal voltages in vivo, in both bulk loaded tissue and the dendrites of single neurons. Here, we describe in detail but for a broad audience the voltage sensing mechanism of fast voltage-sensitive dyes, with a focus on ANNINE dyes, and how voltage imaging can be optimized with one-photon and two-photon excitation. Under optimized imaging conditions the key strengths of ANNINE dyes are their high sensitivity (0.5%/mV), neglectable bleaching and phototoxicity, a linear response to membrane potential, and a temporal resolution which is only limited by the imaging speed. ANNINE dyes in combination with two-photon microscopy allow depth-resolved voltage imaging in bulk loaded tissue to study average membrane voltage oscillations and sensory responses. Alternatively, if ANNINE-6plus is applied internally, supra and sub threshold voltage changes can be recorded from dendrites of single neurons in awake animals. Interestingly, in our experience ANNINE-6plus labelling is impressively stable in vivo, such that voltage imaging from single Purkinje neuron dendrites can be performed for two weeks after a single electroporation of the neuron. Finally, to maximize their potential for neuroscience studies, voltage imaging with ANNINE dyes and two-photon microscopy can be combined with electrophysiological recording, calcium imaging, and/or pharmacology, even in awake animals.</content>

 Etiology of neuropsychiatric disorders is complex, involving multiple factors that can affect the type and severity of symptoms. Although precise causes are far from being identified, allergy or other forms of hypersensitivity to dietary ingredients have been implicated in triggering or worsening of behavioral and emotional symptoms, especially in patients suffering from depression, anxiety, attention-deficit hyperactivity, and/or autism. Among such ingredients, cow’s milk, along with wheat gluten, is commonly suspected. However, the contributory role of cow’s milk in these disorders has not been elucidated due to insufficient pathophysiological evidence. In the present study, we therefore investigated neuroinflammatory changes that are associated with behavioral abnormality using a non-anaphylactic mouse model of cow’s milk allergy. Male and female C57BL/6J mice were subjected to a 5-week oral sensitization procedure without or with a major milk allergen, beta-lactoglobulin (BLG). All mice were challenged with BLG and their anxiety- and depression-associated behaviors were subsequently assessed during the 6th and 7th weeks. We found that BLG-sensitized male mice exhibited significantly increased anxiety- and depression-like behavior although they did not display anaphylactic reactions when challenged with BLG. Female behavior was not noticeably affected by BLG sensitization. Upon examination of the small intestines, reduced immunoreactivity to occludin was detected in the ileal mucosa of BLG-sensitized mice although the transcriptional expression of this tight-junction protein was not significantly altered when measured by quantitative RT-PCR. On the other hand, the expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) in the ileal mucosa was significantly elevated in BLG-sensitized mice, suggesting the sensitization had resulted in intestinal inflammation. Inflammatory responses were also detected in the brain of BLG-sensitized mice, determined by the hypertrophic morphology of GFAP-immunoreactive astrocytes. These reactive astrocytes were particularly evident near the blood vessels in the midbrain region, resembling the perivascular barrier previously reported by others in experimental autoimmune encephalitis mouse models. Interestingly, increased levels of TNFα was also found in this region. Taken together, our results demonstrated that BLG sensitization elicits inflammatory responses in the intestine and brain without overt anaphylactic signs of milk allergy, signifying food allergy as a potential pathogenic factor of neuropsychiatric disorders.</content>

 Glycyrrhizic acid (GA) is a major component in the root and rhizomes of licorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra), which have been used as an herbal medicine, because of its anti-inflammatory activity. GA is known as an inhibitor of high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), which in involved in the pathogenesis of various inflammatory diseases including inner retinal neuropathy. In this study, we examined the effect of GA in a mouse model of retinal degeneration (RD), the leading cause of blindness. RD was induced by exposure to a blue light-emitting diode (LED). In functional assessment, scotopic electroretinography showed that the amplitudes of both a- and b-waves were significantly reduced in RD mice (P &amp;lt; 0.05), whereas they were significantly increased in GA-treated RD mice (P &amp;lt; 0.05), compared to those in non-treated RD animals. In histological assessment, GA treatment preserved the outer nuclear layer where photoreceptors reside and reduced photoreceptor cell death. GA-treated retinas showed significantly reduced expression of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, CCL2 and 6, iNOS, and COX-2 (P &amp;lt; 0.05), compared to that in non-treated retinas. Immunohistochemistry showed that Iba-1 and GFAP expression was markedly reduced in GA-treated retinas, indicating decreased glial response, retinal stress and inflammation. Interestingly, HMGB1 expression was reduced in non-treated RD retinas whereas GA increased its expression. These results demonstrate that GA reduces retinal inflammation by inhibiting HMGB1 release from photoreceptors in blue LED-induced RD and preserves retinal structure and function, suggesting that GA may have potential as a medication for the treatment of RD.</content>

 At the beginning of the XX century, in view of the growing international recognition of Santiago Ramón y Cajal, the Spanish authorities took some important steps to support Cajal´s scientific work. This recognition peaked in 1906, when Camillo Golgi and Santiago Ramón y Cajal shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. The Spanish government provided Cajal a state-of-the-art laboratory in Madrid to allow him to continue with his research and they funded salaries to pay his first tenured collaborators, the number of which increased further after the creation of the Junta para Ampliación de Estudios -JAE. The JAE was an organism set up to help promising researchers develop their careers in different ways, thereby contributing to the development of science in Spain. Although largely forgotten or relatively unknown, there has been a recent revival in the recognition of the school that developed around Cajal, collectively referred to as the Spanish Neurological School (or colloquially, as the Cajal School or School of Madrid). Almost all Cajal’s collaborators were men, although a limited number of female scientists spent part of their careers at the heart of the Cajal School. Here we discuss these women and their work in the laboratory in Madrid. We have tracked the careers of Laura Forster (from Australia/United Kingdom), Manuela Serra, María Soledad Ruiz-Capillas and María Luisa Herreros (all Spanish), through their scientific publications, both in the journal founded by Cajal and elsewhere, and from other documentary sources. To complete the picture, we also outline the careers of other secondary figures that contributed to the production and running of Cajal’s laboratory in Madrid. We show here that the dawn of Spanish neuroscience included a number of contributions from female researchers who to date, have received little recognition.</content>

 Reversible formation of PHF-like phosphorylated tau an early feature of Alzheimer´s disease (AD) was previously shown to occur in torpor during hibernation of Syrian hamsters. Here, we tackled the question to what extend hibernating Syrian hamsters can serve as a model for for the early stage of AD. During early AD  , anosmia, the loss of olfactory function, is a common and typical feature. We, thus, investigated tau phosphorylation, synaptic plasticity and behavioral physiology of the olfactory system during hibernation. Tau was phosphorylated on several AD -relevant epitopes, and distribution of PHF-like phosphorylated tau in the olfactory bulb was quite similar to what is seen in AD. Tau phosphorylation was not associated with a destabilization of microtubules or actin filaments and did not lead to fibril formation. Previously we observed a transient spine reduction in pyramidal cells in the hippocampus, which is correlated to the distribution of phosphorylated tau. Consistently, in the olfactory bulb the granule cells, which are devoid of phosphorylated tau, do not show a reduction in their spines. Contrary to previous reports no reduction in synaptic proteins was observed. However, when the effect of hibernation on olfactory memory was tested using a two odor discrimination task, non-hibernating animals showed a significant preference for the odor presented with a food reward, whereas hibernating animals did not. We conclude that hibernation is associated with a specific olfactory memory deficit, which might not be attributed to the formation of PHF-like phosphorylated tau within the olfactory bulb. We discuss a possible involvement of modulatory input provided by cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain, which are affected by hibernation.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Introduction: The loss of nigrosome-1 which is also referred to as the swallow tail sign (STS) in T2* weighted iron-sensitive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has recently emerged as a new biomarker for idiopathic Parkinson’s disease (IPD). However, consistent recognition of the STS is difficult due to individual variations and different imaging parameters. Radiomics might have the potential to overcome these shortcomings. Therefore, we chose to explore whether radiomic features of nigrosome-1 of substantia nigra (SN) based on quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) could help to differentiate IPD patients from healthy controls (HCs).
Methods: Three-dimensional multi-echo gradient-recalled echo images (0.86×0.86×1.00 mm3) were obtained at 3.0 T MRI for QSM in 87 IPD patients and 77 HCs. Regions of interest (ROIs) of the SN below the red nucleus were manually drawn on both sides, and subsequently, volumes of interest (VOIs) were segmented (these ROIs included 4 1mm slices). Then, 105 radiomic features (including 18 histogram features, 13 shape features, 74 texture features) of bilateral VOIs in the two groups were extracted. Forty features were selected according to the ensemble feature selection method which combined analysis of variance, random forest and recursive feature elimination. The selected features were further utilized to distinguish IPD patients from HC using SVM classifier with 10 rounds of 3-fold cross-validation. Finally, the representative features were analyzed using an unpaired t-test with Bonferroni correction and correlated with the UPDRS-III scores.
Results: The classification results from SVM were: area under curve (AUC): 0.96±0.02; accuracy: 0.88±0.03; sensitivity: 0.89±0.06; and specificity: 0.87±0.07. Five representative features were selected to show their detailed difference between IPD patients and HCs: 10 Percentile and Median in IPD patients were higher than those in HCs (all p&amp;lt;0.00125), while, GLRLM-Long Run Low Gray Level Emphasis, GLSZM-Gray Level Non-Uniformity and volume (all p&amp;lt;0.00125) in IPD patients were lower than those in HCs. The 10 percentile was positively correlated with UPDRS-III score (r=0.35, p=0.001).
Conclusion: Radiomic features of nigrosome-1 region of SN based on QSM could be useful in the diagnosis of IPD and could serve as a surrogate marker for the STS.</content>

 Identifying older adults at risk for memory impairment is an important goal for initiating early treatment and prevention strategies. We examined the resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) of older and younger adults before and after cognitive effort as a marker for subsequent memory decline, focusing on the connectivity between the left anterior hippocampus (laHC) and the posterior hippocampi (pHC). Results showed that for younger adults, post-effort increases in laHC-pHC connectivity were related to increases in connectivity between the laHC and the hubs of the default mode network. However, for older adults, post-effort increases in the RSFC of laHC-pHC were related to decreases in the connectivity of the laHC and right precentral gyrus. Thus, the correlation between intra-HC and inter-HC RSFC was altered with cognitive effort and aging. Importantly, older adults who had lower post-effort RSFC between the laHC and the pHC demonstrated a decline in an episodic memory 2 years later. Hence, the change in intra-HC RSFC following cognitive effort was able to predict subsequent memory function with aging in our sample.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Background: Performing cognitive and motor tasks simultaneously interferes with gait performance and may lead to falls in elderly individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Executive function, which seems to play a key role in dual-task gait performance, can be improved by combined physical and cognitive training. Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to assist rehabilitation, and its effect on physical and cognitive function requires further investigation. The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of VR-based physical and cognitive training on executive function and dual-task gait performance in elderly individuals with MCI, as well as to compare VR-based physical and cognitive training with traditional combined physical and cognitive training.
Method: Thirty-four community-dwelling older adults with MCI were randomly assigned into either a VR-based physical and cognitive training (VR) group or a combined traditional physical and cognitive training (CPC) group for 36 sessions over 12 weeks. Outcome measures included executive function (Stroop color and word test (SCWT) and trail making test (TMT) A and B), gait performance (gait speed, stride length, and cadence) and dual-task cost (DTC). Gait performance was evaluated during single-task walking, walking while performing serial subtraction (cognitive dual task), and walking while carrying a tray (motor dual task).
Results: Both groups showed significant improvements on the SCWT and single-task and motor dual-task gait performance measures. However, only the VR group showed improvements in cognitive dual-task gait performance and the DTC of cadence. Moreover, the VR group showed better performance than the CPC group in the TMT-B and DTC of cadence. Conclusion: A 12-week VR-based physical and cognitive training program led to significant improvements in dual-task gait performance in elderly individuals with MCI, which may be attributed to improvements in executive function.</content>

 While walking was once thought to be a highly automated process, it requires higher-level cognition with older age. Like other cognitive tasks, it also becomes further challenged with increased cognitive load (e.g., the addition of an unrelated dual task) and often results in poorer performance (e.g., slower speed). It is not well known, however, how intrinsic neural network communication relates to walking speed, nor to this “cost” to gait performance; i.e., “dual-task cost”. The current study investigates the relationship between network connectivity, using resting-state functional MRI (fMRI), and individual differences in older adult walking speed. Fifty participants (35 female; 84±4.5 years) from the MOBILIZE Boston Study cohort underwent an MRI protocol and completed a gait assessment during two conditions: walking quietly at a preferred pace and while concurrently performing a serial subtraction task. Within and between neural network connectivity measures were calculated from resting-state fMRI and were correlated with walking speeds and the dual-task cost (i.e., the percent change in speed between conditions). Among the fMRI correlates, faster walking was associated with increased connectivity between motor and cognitive networks and decreased connectivity between limbic and cognitive networks. Smaller dual-task cost was associated with increased connectivity within the motor network and increased connectivity between the ventral attention and executive networks. These findings support the importance of both motor network integrity as well as inter-network connectivity amongst higher-level cognitive networks in older adults’ ability to maintain mobility, particularly under dual-task conditions.</content>

We developed a whole-circulation computational model by integrating a transmission line (TL) model describing vascular wave transmission into the established CircAdapt platform of whole-heart mechanics. In the present paper, we verify the numerical framework of our TL model by benchmark comparison to a previously validated pulse wave propagation (PWP) model. Additionally, we showcase the integrated CircAdapt–TL model, which now includes the heart as well as extensive arterial and venous trees with terminal impedances. We present CircAdapt–TL haemodynamics simulations of: 1) a systemic normotensive situation and 2) a systemic hypertensive situation. In the TL–PWP benchmark comparison we found good agreement regarding pressure and flow waveforms (relative errors ≤ 2.9% for pressure, and ≤ 5.6% for flow). CircAdapt–TL simulations reproduced the typically observed haemodynamic changes with hypertension, expressed by increases in mean and pulsatile blood pressures, and increased arterial pulse wave velocity. We observed a change in the timing of pressure augmentation (defined as a late-systolic boost in aortic pressure) from occurring after time of peak systolic pressure in the normotensive situation, to occurring prior to time of peak pressure in the hypertensive situation. The pressure augmentation could not be observed when the systemic circulation was lumped into a (non-linear) three-element windkessel model, instead of using our TL model. Wave intensity analysis at the carotid artery indicated earlier arrival of reflected waves with hypertension as compared to normotension, in good qualitative agreement with findings in patients. In conclusion, we successfully embedded a TL model as a vascular module into the CircAdapt platform. The integrated CircAdapt–TL model allows detailed studies on mechanistic studies on heart-vessel interaction.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/UNJWOrlegmc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Here we put forward a mathematical model describing the response of low-grade (WHO grade II) oligodendrogliomas (LGO) to temozolomide (TMZ). The model describes the longitudinal volumetric dynamics of tumor response to TMZ of a cohort of 11 LGO patients treated with TMZ. After finding patient-specific parameters, different therapeutic strategies were tried computationally on the ‘in-silico twins’ of those patients. Chemotherapy schedules with larger-than-standard rest periods between consecutive cycles had either the same or better long-term efficacy than the standard 28-day cycles. The results were confirmed in a large trial of 2000 virtual patients. These long-cycle schemes would also have reduced toxicity and defer the appearance of resistances. On the basis of those results, a combination scheme consisting of five induction TMZ cycles given monthly plus 12 maintenance cycles given every three months was found to provide substantial survival benefits for the in-silico twins of the 11 LGO patients (median 5.69 years, range: 0.67 to 68.45 years) and in a large virtual trial including 2000 patients. We used 220 sets of experiments in-silico to show that a clinical trial incorporating 100 patients per arm (standard intensive treatment versus 5 + 12 scheme) could demonstrate the superiority of the novel scheme after a follow-up period of 10 years. Thus, the proposed treatment plan could be the basis for a standardized TMZ treatment for LGO patients with survival benefits.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ffiqDJUGTq4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 Abstract&lt;p&gt;Although TWIK-related spinal cord K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (TRESK) channel is expressed in all primary afferent neurons in trigeminal ganglia (TG) and dorsal root ganglia (DRG), whether TRESK activity regulates trigeminal pain processing is still not established. Dominant-negative TRESK mutations are associated with migraine but not with other types of pain in humans, suggesting that genetic TRESK dysfunction preferentially affects the generation of trigeminal pain, especially headache. Using TRESK global knockout mice as a model system, we found that loss of TRESK in all TG neurons selectively increased the intrinsic excitability of small-diameter nociceptors, especially those that do not bind to isolectin B4 (IB4&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;). Similarly, loss of TRESK resulted in hyper-excitation of the small IB4&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; dural afferent neurons but not those that bind to IB4 (IB4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;). Compared with wild-type littermates, both male and female TRESK knockout mice exhibited more robust trigeminal nociceptive behaviors, including headache-related behaviors; whereas their body and visceral pain responses were normal. Interestingly, neither the total persistent outward current nor the intrinsic excitability was altered in adult TRESK knockout DRG neurons, which may explain why genetic TRESK dysfunction is not associated with body and/or visceral pain in humans. We reveal for the first time that, among all primary afferent neurons, TG nociceptors are the most vulnerable to the genetic loss of TRESK. Our findings indicate that endogenous TRESK activity regulates trigeminal nociception, likely through controlling the intrinsic excitability of TG nociceptors. Importantly, we provide evidence that genetic loss of TRESK significantly increases the likelihood of developing headache.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; TRESK K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel is expressed in all primary afferent neurons in trigeminal ganglia (TG) and dorsal root ganglia (DRG), but dominant-negative TRESK mutations are only associated with migraine but not with other types of pain in humans. In TRESK global knockout mice, we found that ubiquitous loss of TRESK selectively increased the intrinsic excitability of small-diameter TG nociceptors without affecting DRG neuronal excitability. Compared with wild-type littermates, TRESK knockout mice exhibited more robust trigeminal pain, especially headache-related behaviors; whereas their body and visceral pain responses were normal. This recapitulates the clinical manifestations of human TRESK mutations. Our results indicate that endogenous TRESK activity regulates trigeminal nociception, and genetic loss of TRESK significantly increases the likelihood of developing headache.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Neuroimaging MRI data in scientific research is increasingly pooled, but the reliability of such studies may be hampered by the use of different hardware elements. This might introduce bias, for example when cross-sectional studies pool data acquired with different head coils, or when longitudinal clinical studies change head coils halfway. In the present study, we aimed to estimate this possible bias introduced by using different head coils to create awareness and to avoid misinterpretation of results. We acquired, with both an 8 channel and 32 channel head coil, T1-weighted, diffusion tensor imaging and resting state fMRI images at 3T MRI (Philips Achieva) with stable acquisition parameters in a large group of cognitively healthy participants (n=77). Standard analysis methods, i.e. voxel-based morphometry, tract-based spatial statistics and resting state functional network analyses, were used in a within-subject design to compare 8 and 32 channel head coil data. Signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) for both head coils showed similar ranges, although the 32 channel SNR profile was more homogeneous. Our data demonstrates specific patterns of grey and white matter volume differences between head coils, related to altered image contrast and therefore, altered tissue segmentation. White matter connectivity (fractional anisotropy and diffusivity measures) showed hemispherical dependent differences between head coils, and functional connectivity in resting state networks was higher using the 32 channel head coil in posterior cortical areas. This study shows that, even when acquisition protocols are harmonized, the results of standardized analysis models can be severely affected by the use of different head coils. Researchers should be aware of this when combining multiple neuroimaging MRI datasets, to prevent coil-related bias and avoid misinterpretation of their findings.</content>

 Abstract&lt;p&gt;HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) remain prevalent and are aggravated by µ-opioid use. We have previously shown that morphine and other µ-opioids may contribute to HAND by inhibiting the homeostatic and neuroprotective chemokine receptor CXCR4 in cortical neurons, and this novel mechanism depends on upregulation of the protein ferritin heavy chain (FHC). Here, we examined the cellular events and potential mechanisms involved in morphine-mediated FHC upregulation using rat cortical neurons of either sex in vitro and in vivo. Morphine dose-dependently increased FHC protein levels in primary neurons through µ-opioid receptor (µOR) and Gαi-protein signaling. Cytoplasmic FHC levels were significantly elevated, but nuclear FHC levels and FHC gene expression were unchanged. Morphine-treated rats also displayed increased FHC levels in layer 2/3 neurons of the prefrontal cortex. Importantly, both in vitro and in vivo FHC upregulation was accompanied by loss of mature dendritic spines, which was also dependent on µOR and Gαi-protein signaling. Moreover, morphine upregulated ferritin light chain (FLC), a component of the ferritin iron storage complex, suggesting that morphine altered neuronal iron metabolism. Indeed, prior to FHC upregulation, morphine increased cytoplasmic labile iron levels as a function of decreased endolysosomal iron. In line with this, chelation of endolysosomal iron (but not extracellular iron) blocked morphine-induced FHC upregulation and dendritic spine reduction, whereas iron overloading mimicked the effect of morphine on FHC and dendritic spines. Overall, these data demonstrate that iron mediates morphine-induced FHC upregulation and consequent dendritic spine deficits and implicate endolysosomal iron efflux to the cytoplasm in these effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Clinical studies suggest that opioid use exacerbates HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), but the mechanisms by which opioids contribute to HAND are not completely understood. This work demonstrates that morphine reduces the density of mature dendritic spines of cortical neurons through a novel mechanism involving neuronal iron metabolism. We showed that morphine induces efflux of endolysosomal iron to the cytoplasm, resulting in a post-transcriptional upregulation of ferritin heavy chain (FHC). FHC upregulation inhibits the homeostatic and neuroprotective CXCL12/CXCR4 chemokine signaling axis, producing dendritic spine deficits. Importantly, morphine’s actions on FHC and dendritic spines are blocked by chelation of endolysosomal iron, suggesting that endolysosomal iron stores are key components of dendritic injury in opioid using HAND patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 ABSTRACT&lt;p&gt;Magnocellular neuroendocrine cells of the hypothalamus play a critical role in the regulation of fluid and electrolyte homeostasis. They undergo a dramatic structural and functional plasticity under sustained hyperosmotic conditions, including an increase in afferent glutamatergic synaptic innervation. We tested for a postulated increase in glutamate AMPA receptor expression and signaling in magnocellular neurons of the male rat hypothalamic supraoptic nucleus (SON) induced by chronic salt loading. While without effect on GluA1-4 subunit mRNA, salt loading with 2% saline for 5-7 days resulted in a selective increase in AMPA receptor GluA1 protein expression in the SON, with no change in GluA2-4 protein expression, suggesting an increase in the ratio of GluA1 to GluA2 subunits. Salt loading induced a corresponding increase in excitatory postsynaptic currents in both oxytocin and vasopressin neurons, with properties characteristic of calcium-permeable AMPA receptor-mediated currents. Unexpectedly, the emergent AMPA synaptic currents were silenced by blocking protein synthesis and mTOR activity in the slices, suggesting that the new glutamate synapses induced by salt loading require continuous dendritic protein synthesis for maintenance. These findings indicate that chronic salt loading leads to the induction of highly labile glutamate synapses in oxytocin and vasopressin neurons that are comprised of calcium-permeable homomeric GluA1 AMPA receptors. The glutamate-induced calcium influx via calcium-permeable AMPA receptors would be expected to play a key role in the induction and/or maintenance of activity-dependent synaptic plasticity that occurs in the magnocellular neurons during chronic osmotic stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Oxytocin- and vasopressin-secreting neurons of the hypothalamus undergo robust synaptic plasticity during chronic osmotic stimulation, including an increase in excitatory synapses. Here, we show that chronic salt loading results in the emergence of calcium-permeable AMPA receptor-mediated synaptic currents in oxytocin and vasopressin neurons by inducing an increase in GluA1 AMPA receptor subunits without a coordinate increase in GluA2 subunits. The salt loading-induced calcium-permeable AMPA currents were rapidly silenced by inhibiting protein synthesis and mTOR activity, suggesting that continuous dendritic protein synthesis is required to functionally maintain the new AMPA synapses. Calcium influx through calcium-permeable AMPA receptors should play a key role in the induction and/or maintenance of synaptic plasticity in oxytocin and vasopressin neurons by chronic osmotic stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 ABSTRACT&lt;p&gt;The neural mechanisms responsible for the initiation and expression of migraines remain unknown. Though there is growing evidence of changes in brainstem anatomy and function between attacks, very little is known about brainstem function and structure in the period immediately prior to a migraine. The aim of this investigation is to use brainstem-specific analyses of diffusion weighted images to determine if the brainstem pain processing regions display altered structure in individuals with migraine across the migraine cycle, and in particular immediately prior to a migraine. Diffusion tensor images (29 controls, 36 migraineurs) were used to assess brainstem anatomy in migraineurs compared with controls. We found that during the interictal phase, migraineurs displayed greater mean diffusivity in the region of the spinal trigeminal nucleus, dorsomedial/dorsolateral pons and midbrain periaqueductal gray matter/cuneiform nucleus. Remarkably, the mean diffusivity returned to controls levels during the 24-hour period immediately prior to a migraine, only to increase again within the three following days. Additionally, fractional anisotropy was significantly elevated in the region of the medial lemniscus/ventral trigeminal thalamic tract in migraineurs compared with controls over the entire migraine cycle. These data show that regional brainstem anatomy changes over the migraine cycle, with specific anatomical changes occurring in the 24 hours prior to onset. These changes may contribute to the activation of the ascending trigeminal pathway by either an increase in basal traffic or by sensitising the trigeminal nuclei to external triggers, with activation ultimately resulting in perception of head pain during a migraine attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFIANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; It has been hypothesised that modulation of brainstem pain pathways may be critical for the initiation of migraine attacks. There is some evidence that altered brainstem function, possibly involving increased astrocyte activation, occurs immediately prior to a migraine attack. We sought to obtain evidence to support this theory. Using diffusion tensor imaging, we found that immediately prior to a migraine, mean diffusivity decreased in the spinal trigeminal nucleus, dorsomedial/dorsolateral pons and midbrain periaqueductal gray matter/nucleus cuneiform. Mean diffusivity then increased again immediately following the migraine attack. Decreased mean diffusivity before a migraine is consistent with increased astrocyte activation, since astrocyte processes enlarge during activation. These changes may underlie changes in brainstem function that are essential for the generation of a migraine.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transient ischemic attack (TIA) is defined as focal neurological deficit caused by ischemia resolving within 24 hrs. In a secondary analysis of a large monocentric cohort of 446 TIA patients, we explored the frequency and determinants of DWI lesions on high‐resolution MRI. Overall, 240 (54%) of all TIA patients presented with DWI lesions. These patients had higher NIHSS and ABCD2 scores and presented more frequently with vessel occlusion and perfusion deficits, but had similar functional outcome at 3 months. Taken together high‐resolution DWI provides evidence of ischemic brain injury in the majority of TIA patients.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autosomal dominant optic atrophy (ADOA) starts in early childhood with loss of visual acuity and color vision deficits. &lt;i&gt;OPA1&lt;/i&gt; mutations are responsible for the majority of cases, but in a proportion of patients with a clinical diagnosis of ADOA, the cause remains unknown. This study aimed to identify novel ADOA‐associated genes and explore their causality.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linkage analysis and sequencing were performed in multi‐generation families and unrelated patients to identify disease‐causing variants. Functional consequences were investigated &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; and confirmed experimentally using the zebrafish model.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We defined a new ADOA locus on 7q33‐q35 and identified three different missense variants in &lt;i&gt;SSBP1&lt;/i&gt; (NM_001256510.1; c.113G&amp;gt;A (p.(Arg38Gln)), c.320G&amp;gt;A (p.(Arg107Gln)) and c.422G&amp;gt;A (p.(Ser141Asn))) in affected individuals from two families and two singletons with ADOA and variable retinal degeneration. The mutated arginine residues are part of a basic patch that is essential for single‐strand DNA binding. The loss of a positive charge at these positions is very likely to lower the affinity of SSBP1 to ssDNA. Antisense‐mediated knockdown of endogenous &lt;i&gt;ssbp1&lt;/i&gt; mRNA in zebrafish resulted in compromised differentiation of retinal ganglion cells. A similar effect was achieved when mutated mRNAs were administered. These findings point to an essential role of &lt;i&gt;ssbp1&lt;/i&gt; in retinal development and the dominant‐negative nature of the identified human variants, which is consistent with the segregation pattern observed in two multi‐generation families studied.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SSBP1 is an essential protein for mtDNA replication and maintenance. Our data established pathogenic variants in &lt;i&gt;SSBP1&lt;/i&gt; as a cause of ADOA and variable retinal degeneration.&lt;/p&gt;

 The development of two-photon microscopy has revolutionized our understanding of how synapses are formed and how they transform synaptic inputs in dendritic spines – tiny protrusions that cover the dendrites of pyramidal neurons that receive most excitatory synaptic information in the brain. These discoveries have led us to better comprehend the neuronal computations that take place at the level of dendritic spines as well as within neuronal circuits with unprecedented resolution. Here we describe a method that uses a two-photon (2P) microscope and 2P uncaging of caged neurotransmitters for the activation of single and multiple spines in the dendrites of cortical pyramidal neurons. In addition, we propose a cost-effective description of the components necessary for the construction of a one laser source-2P microscope capable of nearly simultaneous 2P uncaging of neurotransmitters and 2P calcium imaging of the activated spines and nearby dendrites. We provide a brief overview on how the use of these techniques have helped researchers in the last 15 years unravel the function of spines in a) information processing, b) storage and c) integration of excitatory synaptic inputs.</content>

 Introduction: In-vivo quantification of the serotonin transporter (SERT) guided our understanding of many neuropsychiatric disorders. A recently introduced bolus plus constant infusion protocol has been shown to allow the reliable determination of SERT binding with reduced scan time. In this work, the outcomes of two methods, a bolus injection paradigm on a GE PET camera and a bolus plus infusion paradigm on a combined Siemens PET/MR camera were compared.
Methods: 7 healthy subjects underwent paired PET and paired PET/MR scans each with intravenous double-blind application of 7.5 mg citalopram or saline in a randomized cross-over study design. While PET scans were performed according to standard protocols and nondisplaceable binding potentials (BPND) were calculated using the multi-linear reference tissue model, during PET/MR measurements [11C]DASB was applied as bolus plus constant infusion and BPND was calculated using the steady state method and data acquired at tracer equilibrium. Occupancies were calculated as the relative decrease in BPND between saline and citalopram scans. 
Results:  During placebo scans, a mean difference in BPND of -0.08 (-11.71%) across all ROIs was found between methods. PET/MR scans resulted in higher BPND estimates than PET scans in all ROIs except the midbrain. A mean difference of -0.19 (-109.40%) across all ROIs between methods was observed for citalopram scans. PET/MR scans resulted in higher BPND estimates than PET scans in all ROIs. For occupancy, a mean difference of 23.12% (21.91%) was observed across all ROIs. PET/MR scans resulted in lower occupancy compared to PET scans in all ROIs except the temporal cortex. While for placebo, BPND of high-binding regions (thalamus and striatum) exhibited moderate reliability (ICC=0.66), during citalopram scans ICC decreased (0.36-0.46). However, reliability for occupancy remained high (0.57-0.82). 
Conclusion: Here, we demonstrated the feasibility of reliable and non-invasive SERT quantification using a [11C]DASB bolus plus constant infusion protocol at a hybrid PET/MR scanner, which might facilitate future pharmacological imaging studies. Highest agreement with established methods for quantification of occupancy and SERT binding potentials at baseline was observed in subcortical high-binding regions.</content>

 Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an incurable and progressively fatal neurodegenerative disease that manifests with distinct clinical phenotypes, which are seen in neuroimaging and clinical studies. T2- and proton density (PD)-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) displays hyperintense signal along the corticospinal tract (CST) in some ALS patients with upper motor neuron (UMN)-predominant signs. These patients tend to be younger and have signiﬁcantly faster disease progression. We hypothesize that such ALS patients with CST hyperintensity (ALS-CST+) comprise a clinical subtype distinct from other ALS subtypes, namely patients with UMN-predominant ALS without CST hyperintensity, classic ALS, and ALS with frontotemporal dementia. Novel approaches such as fractal dimension analysis on conventional MRI (cMRI) and advanced MR techniques such as diffusion tensor imaging reveal significant differences between ALS-CST+ and the aforementioned ALS subtypes. Our unbiased neuroimaging studies demonstrate that the ALS-CST+ group, which can be initially identified by T2-, PD-, and FLAIR-weighted cMRI, is distinctive and distinguishable from other ALS subtypes with possible differences in disease pathogenesis.</content>

 During speech perception listeners rely on multimodal input and make use of both auditory and visual information. When presented with speech, for example syllables, the differences in brain responses to distinct stimuli are not, however, caused merely by the acoustic or visual features of the stimuli. The congruency of the auditory and visual information and the familiarity of a syllable, that is, whether it appears in the listener’s native language or not, also modulates brain responses. We investigated how the congruency and familiarity of the presented stimuli affect brain responses to audio-visual (AV) speech in 12 adult Finnish native speakers and 12 adult Chinese native speakers. They watched videos of a Chinese speaker pronouncing syllables (/pa/, /pha/, /ta/, /tha/, /fa/) during a magnetoencephalography (MEG) measurement where only /pa/ and /ta/ were part of Finnish phonology while all the stimuli were part of Chinese phonology. The stimuli were presented in audio-visual (congruent or incongruent), audio only, or visual only conditions. The brain responses were examined in five time-windows: 75–125 ms, 150–200 ms, 200–300 ms, 300–400 ms and 400–600 ms. We found significant differences for the congruency comparison in the fourth time-window (300–400 ms) in both sensor and source level analysis. Larger responses were observed for the incongruent stimuli than for the congruent stimuli. For the familiarity comparisons no significant differences were found. The results are in line with earlier studies reporting modulation of brain responses for audio-visual congruency around 250–500 ms. This suggests a much stronger process for the general detection of mismatch between predictions based on lip movements and the auditory signal than for the top-down modulation of brain responses based on phonological information.</content>

 The idea that intelligence is embedded not only in a single brain network, but instead in a complex, well-optimized system of complementary networks, has led to the development of whole brain network analysis. Using graph theory to analyze resting-state functional MRI data, we investigated the brain graph networks (or brain networks) of high intelligence quotient (HIQ) children. To this end, we computed the “hub disruption index κ”, an index sensitive to graph network modifications. We found significant topological differences in the integration and segregation properties of brain networks in HIQ compared to standard IQ children, not only for the whole brain graph, but also for each hemispheric graph, and for the homotopic connectivity. Moreover, two profiles of HIQ children, homogenous and heterogeneous, based on the differences between the two main IQ subscales (verbal comprehension index (VCI) and perceptual reasoning index (PRI)), were compared. Brain networks changes were more pronounced in the heterogeneous HIQ than in the homogeneous HIQ subgroups. Finally, we found significant correlations between the graph networks’ changes and the full-scale IQ (FSIQ), as well as the subscales VCI and PRI. Specifically, the higher the FSIQ the greater was the brain organization modification in the whole brain, the left hemisphere, and the homotopic connectivity. These results shed new light on the relation between functional connectivity topology and high intelligence, as well as on different intelligence profiles.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Purpose: Amblyopia and strabismus affect 2-5% of the population and cause a broad range of visual deficits. The response to treatment is generally assessed using visual acuity, which is relatively insensitive to binocular vision gains and may therefore underestimate binocular vision deficits in these patients. The contrast sensitivity function (CSF) generally takes longer to assess than visual acuity, but it is better correlated with improvement in a range of visual tasks and, notably, with improvements in binocular vision. The present study aims to assess monocular and binocular CSFs in amblyopia and strabismus patients.

Methods: Both monocular CSFs and the binocular CSF were assessed for subjects with amblyopia (n=11), strabismus without amblyopia (n=20), and normally sighted controls (n=24) using a tablet-based implementation of the quick CSF, which can assess a full CSF in &amp;lt;3 minutes. Binocular summation was evaluated against a baseline model of simple probability summation.

Results: The CSF of amblyopic eyes was impaired at mid-to-high spatial frequencies compared to fellow eyes, strabismic eyes without amblyopia, and control eyes. Binocular contrast summation exceeded probability summation in controls, but not in subjects with amblyopia (with or without strabismus) or strabismus without amblyopia who were able to fuse at the test distance. Binocular summation was less than probability summation in strabismic subjects who were unable to fuse.

Conclusions: We conclude that monocular and binocular contrast sensitivity deficits define important characteristics of amblyopia and strabismus that are not captured by visual acuity alone and can be measured efficiently using the quick CSF.</content>

 Magnetic resonance images of brain tumors are routinely used in neuro-oncology clinics for diagnosis, treatment planning and post-treatment tumor surveillance. Currently, physicians spend considerable time manually delineating different structures of the brain. Spatial and structural variations, as well as intensity inhomogeneity across images, make the problem of computer- assisted segmentation very challenging. We propose a new image segmentation framework for tumor delineation that benefits from two state-of-the-art machine learning architectures in computer vision, i.e., Inception modules and U-Net image segmentation architecture. Furthermore, our framework includes two learning regimes, i.e., learning to segment intra-tumoral structures (necrotic and non-enhancing tumor core, peritumoral edema, and enhancing tumor) or learning to segment glioma sub-regions (whole tumor, tumor core, and enhancing tumor). These learning regimes are incorporated into a newly proposed loss function which is based on the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC). In our experiments, we quantified the impact of introducing the Inception modules in the U-Net architecture, as well as, changing the objective function for the learning algorithm from segmenting the intra-tumoral structures to glioma sub-regions. We found that incorporating Inception modules significantly improved the segmentation performance (p &amp;lt; 0.001) for all glioma sub-regions. Moreover, in architectures with Inception modules, the models trained with the learning objective of segmenting the intra-tumoral structures outperformed the models trained with the objective of segmenting the glioma sub-regions for the whole tumor (p &amp;lt; 0.001). The improved performance is linked to multiscale features extracted by newly introduced Inception module and the modified loss function based on the DSC.</content>

 The presubiculum plays a key role in processing and integrating spatial and head-directional information. Layer III neurons of the presubiculum provide strong projections to the superficial layers of the medial entorhinal cortex in the rat. Our previous study revealed that the terminal distribution of efferents from layer III cells of the presubiculum was organized in a band-like fashion within the medial entorhinal cortex, and the transverse axis of these zones ran parallel to the rhinal fissure. Identifying axonal branching patterns of layer III neurons of the presubiculum is important to further elucidate the functional roles of the presubiculum. In the present study, we visualized all axonal processes and terminal distributions of single presubicular layer III neurons in the rat, using in vivo injection of a viral vector expressing membrane-targeted palmitoylation site-attached green fluorescent protein. We found that layer III of the rat presubiculum comprised multiple types of neurons (n=12) with characteristic patterns of axonal collateralization, including cortical projection neurons (n=6) and several types of intrinsic connectional neurons (n=6). Two of six cortical projection neurons provided two or three major axonal branches to the medial entorhinal cortex and formed elaborate terminal arbors within the superficial layers of the medial entorhinal cortex. The width and axis of the area of their terminal distribution resembled that of the band-like terminal field seen in our massive-scale observation. Two of the other four cortical projection neurons gave off axonal branches to the medial entorhinal cortex and also to the subiculum, and each of the other two neurons sent axons to the subiculum or parasubiculum. Patterns of axonal arborization of six intrinsic connectional neurons were distinct from each other, with four neurons sending many axonal branches to both superficial and deep layers of the presubiculum and the other two neurons showing sparse axonal branches with terminations confined to layers III-V of the presubiculum. These data demonstrate that layer III of the rat presubiculum consists of multiple types of cortical projection neurons and interneurons, and also suggest that inputs from a single presubicular layer III neuron can directly affect a band-like zone of the medial entorhinal cortex.</content>

 Aging is a multifactorial phenomenon that results in several changes at cellular and molecular levels and is considered the main risk factor for some neurodegenerative diseases. Several evidences show the participation of the kallikrein-kinin system in neurodegeneration and this system has been associated with inflammation and immunogenic responses in the central and peripheral systems by the activation of the B1 and B2 receptors. Previous work by our group showed that bradykinin and the B2 receptor played a possible role in neuroprotection. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the participation of B2 receptors in cell viability, neuroinflammatory response and neuroplasticity in organotypic hippocampal cultures of 6 and 12 month old mice. It was observed that activation of the B2 receptor by bradykinin decreased the inflammatory response and increased plasticity in 12 months old slices. Conversely, there was an increase in the inflammatory response and a decrease in neural plasticity in the six-months old slices. In both ages an increase in cell viability was observed. This data suggests that the function of the kinin B2 receptor in the hippocampus is modulated by age, providing neuroprotective action in old age.</content>

 &lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;It is well established that motor impairment often occurs alongside healthy aging, leading to problems with fine motor skills and coordination. Although previously thought to be caused by neuronal death accumulating across the lifespan, it is now believed that the source of this impairment instead stems from more subtle changes in neural connectivity. The dendritic spine is a prime target for exploration of this problem because it is the postsynaptic partner of most excitatory synapses received by the pyramidal neuron, a cortical cell that carries much of the information processing load in the cerebral cortex. We repeatedly imaged the same dendrites in young adult and aged mouse motor cortex over the course of 1 month to look for differences in the baseline state of the dendritic spine population. These experiments reveal increased dendritic spine density, without obvious changes in spine clustering, occurring at the aged dendrite. Additionally, aged dendrites exhibit elevated spine turnover and stabilization alongside decreased long-term spine survival. These results suggest that at baseline the aged motor cortex may exist in a perpetual state of relative instability and attempts at compensation. This phenotype of aging may provide clues for future targets of aging-related motor impairment remediation.&lt;/span&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Distinct clinical syndromes have been associated with pathogenic &lt;i&gt;MT‐ATP6&lt;/i&gt; variants. In this cohort study, we identified 125 individuals (60 families) including 88 clinically affected individuals and 37 asymptomatic carriers. Thirty‐one individuals presented with Leigh syndrome and 7 with neuropathy ataxia retinitis pigmentosa. The remaining 50 patients presented with variable nonsyndromic features including ataxia, neuropathy, and learning disability. We confirmed maternal inheritance in 39 families and demonstrated that tissue segregation patterns and phenotypic threshold are variant dependent. Our findings suggest that &lt;i&gt;MT‐ATP6&lt;/i&gt;–related mitochondrial DNA disease is best conceptualized as a mitochondrial disease spectrum disorder and should be routinely included in genetic ataxia and neuropathy gene panels.

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Brain computations involve multiple processes by which sensory information is encoded and transformed to drive behavior. These computations are thought to be mediated by dynamic interactions between populations of neurons. Here, we demonstrate that human brains exhibit a reliable sequence of neural interactions during speech production. We use an autoregressive Hidden Markov Model (ARHMM) to identify dynamical network states exhibited by electrocorticographic signals recorded from human neurosurgical patients. Our method resolves dynamic latent network states on a trial-by-trial basis. We characterize individual network states according to the patterns of directional information flow between cortical regions of interest. These network states occur consistently and in a specific, interpretable sequence across trials and subjects: the data support the hypothesis of a fixed-length visual processing state, followed by a variable-length language state, and then by a terminal articulation state. This empirical evidence validates classical psycholinguistic theories that have posited such intermediate states during speaking. It further reveals these state dynamics are not localized to one brain area or one sequence of areas, but are instead a network phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract&lt;p&gt;Grasping is an action engraved in the human genome, enabling newborn infants to hang from a monkey-bar immediately after birth. The grasp force provides rich information about the brain’s control of arm movements. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the grasp force increases to improve the hand’s movement precision during reaching. In two reaching experiments, subjects increased grasp force to suppress movement imprecision that arose from both self-generated motor noise and from an unpredictable environment. Furthermore, the grasp force did not increase constantly, but increased specifically along the movement where the hand’s deviation was greatest. The increased grasp was premeditated and wasn’t a reaction to environmental forces, suggesting that the central nervous system has a predictive, state-dependent model of movement precision during reaching. The grasp force provides a high temporal resolution and calibration-less estimate of movement precision adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Humans use their hands on a daily basis to interact with the environment. Many tasks require the hand’s movement to be precise. Standard measures of movement precision resort to measuring the stiffness of the arm, which is notoriously difficult to measure during motion. We show that the power grasp force is correlated with movement precision, and that it provides a real-time measure of movement precision adaptation. Furthermore, the grasp force measure reveals that the brain has a state-dependent adaptation of movement precision, such that it increased grasped force in locations where the hand’s deviation was greatest.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;OBJECTIVE&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quantification of gait with wearable technology is promising; recent cross‐sectional studies showed that gait characteristics are potential prodromal markers for Parkinson's disease (PD). The aim of this longitudinal prospective observational study was to establish gait impairments and trajectories in the prodromal phase of PD, identifying which gait characteristics are potentially early diagnostic markers of PD.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;METHODS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;696 healthy controls (HC, 63±7 years) recruited in the TREND study were included. Assessments were performed longitudinally four times at 2‐year intervals and people who converted to PD identified. Participants were asked to walk at different speed under single and dual‐tasking, with a wearable placed on the lower back; fourteen validated clinically relevant gait characteristics were quantified. Cox regression was used to examine whether gait at first visit could predict time to PD conversion after controlling for age and sex. Random effects linear mixed‐models (RELMs) were used to establish longitudinal trajectories of gait and model the latency between impaired gait and PD diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;RESULTS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sixteen participants were diagnosed with PD on average 4.5 years after first visit (converters, PDC). Higher step time variability and asymmetry of all gait characteristics were associated with a shorter time to PD diagnosis. RELMs indicated gait (lower pace) deviates from non‐PDC approximately four years prior to diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;INTERPRETATION&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together with other prodromal markers, quantitative gait characteristics can play an important role to identify prodromal PD and progression within this phase.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Postoperative resting state functional MRI in children with intractable epilepsy has not been quantified in relation to seizure outcome. Therefore, its value as a biomarker for epileptogenic pathology is not well understood.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a sample of children with intractable epilepsy who underwent prospective resting state guided epilepsy surgery, post‐operative resting state functional MRI was performed 6 to 12 months later. Graded normalization of the post‐operative resting state seizure onset zone was compared to seizure outcomes, patient, surgery, and anatomical MRI characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A total of 64 cases were evaluated. Post‐operative rs‐fMRI normalization was significantly (p‐value &amp;lt;0.001) correlated with seizure reduction, with Spearman rank correlation coefficient of 0.83. Of 39 cases with post‐operative resting state seizure onset zone normalization, 38 (97%) became completely seizure free. In contrast, of the 25 cases without complete rs‐fMRI SOZ normalization, only 3 (5%) become seizure free. The accuracy of rs‐fMRI as a biomarker predicting seizure freedom is 94%, with 96% sensitivity and 93% specificity.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among seizure localization techniques in pediatric epilepsy, post‐operative rs‐fMRI normalization has high correlation with seizure freedom. This study shows that pre‐operative resting state functional MRI abnormalities can be used as a biomarker of the epileptogenic zone and the post‐operative rs‐fMRI normalization is a biomarker for seizure onset zone quiescence.&lt;/p&gt;

 Background: There is accumulating evidence suggesting a connection between the gut and Parkinson’s disease (PD). Gut microbiota may play an important role in the intestinal lesions in PD patients.
Objective: This study aims to determine whether gut microbiota differs between PD patients and healthy controls in Northeast of China, and to identify the factors that influence the changes in the gut microbiota. 
Methods: We enrolled 51 PD patients and 48 healthy controls in this study. Microbial species in stool samples were determined through 16S-rRNA gene sequencing. Dietary intakes were collected from subset of 42 patients and 23 controls using a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Gut microbiota species richness, diversity, differential abundance of individual taxa between PD patients and controls, and the relationship between the gut microbiota abundance and the dietary and clinical factors were analyzed.
Results: PD patients showed decreased species richness, phylogenetic diversity, β-diversity, and altered relative abundance in several taxa compared to the controls. PD-associated clinical scores appeared to be the most influential factors that correlated with the abundance of a variety of taxa. The most consistent findings suggested by multiple analyses used in this study were the increase of Akkermansia and the decrease of Lactobacillus in PD patients in Northeast China.
Conclusion: Gut microbiota significantly differed between a group of PD patients and healthy controls in Northeast China, with decreased species richness, phylogenetic diversity, β-diversity, and altered relative abundance in several taxa compared to the controls.</content>

 Indirect traumatic optic neuropathy (ITON) is a condition that is often associated with traumatic brain injury and can result in significant vision loss due to degeneration of retinal ganglion cell axons at the time of injury or within the ensuing weeks. We used a mouse model of eye-directed air-blast exposure to characterize the histopathology of blast-induced ITON. This injury caused a transient elevation of intraocular pressure with subsequent retinal ganglion cell death and axon degeneration that was similar throughout the length of the optic nerve. Deficits in active anterograde axon transport to the superior colliculus accompanied axon degeneration and first appeared in peripheral representations of the retina. Glial area in the optic nerve increased early after injury and involved a later period of additional expansion. The increase in area involved a transient change in astrocyte organization independent of axon degeneration. While levels of many cytokines and chemokines did not change, IL-1α and IL-1β increased in both the optic nerve and retina. In contrast, glaucoma shows distal to proximal axon degeneration with astrocyte remodeling and increases in many cytokines and chemokines. Further, direct traumatic optic neuropathies have a clear site of injury with rapid, progressive axon degeneration and cell death. These data show that blast-induced ITON is a distinct neuropathology from other optic neuropathies.</content>

 The choice of the reference electrode scheme is an important step in event-related potential (ERP) analysis. In order to explore the optimal electroencephalogram reference electrode scheme for the ERP signal related to facial recognition, we investigated the influence of average reference (AR), mean mastoid reference (MM) and Reference Electrode Standardization Technique (REST) on the N170 component via statistical analysis, statistical parametric scalp mappings (SPSM) and source analysis. The statistical results showed that the choice of reference electrode scheme has little effect on N170 latency (p&amp;gt;0.05), but has a greater impact on N170 amplitude (p&amp;lt;0.05). ANOVA results show that, for the three references scheme, there was statistically significant difference between N170 latency and amplitude induced by the unfamiliar face and that induced by the scrambled face (p&amp;lt;0.05). Specifically, the SPSM results show an anterior and a temporo-occipital distribution for AR and REST, with just anterior distribution shown for MM. However, the circumstantial evidence provided by source analysis is more consistent with SPSM of AR and REST. These results indicate that the experimental results under the AR and REST references are more objective and appropriate. Thus, it is more appropriate to use AR and REST reference scheme settings in future facial recognition experiments.</content>

 To maximize brain plasticity after stroke, several rehabilitation strategies have been explored, including the use of intensive motor training, motor imagery, and action observation. Growing evidence of the positive impact of virtual reality (VR) techniques on recovery following stroke has been shown. However, most VR tools are designed to exploit active movement, and hence patients with low level of motor control cannot fully benefit from them. Consequently, the idea of directly training the central nervous system has been promoted by utilizing motor-imagery (MI) based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). To date, detailed information on which VR strategies lead to successful functional recovery is still largely missing, and very little is known about how to optimally integrate BCI and VR paradigms for stroke rehabilitation. The purpose of this study was to examine the efficacy of a BCI-VR system using a MI paradigm for post-stroke upper limb rehabilitation on functional assessments, and related changes in MI ability and brain imaging. To achieve this, a 60 years old male chronic stroke patient was recruited. The patient underwent a 3-week intervention in a clinical environment, resulting in 10 BCI-VR training sessions. The patient was assessed before and after intervention, as well as on a one-month follow-up, in terms of clinical scales and brain imaging using functional MRI (fMRI). Consistent with prior research, we found important improvements in upper extremity scores (Fugl-Meyer) and identified increases in brain activation measured by fMRI that suggest neuroplastic changes in brain motor networks. This study expands on the current body of evidence as more data are needed on the effect of this type of interventions not only on functional improvement but also through brain imaging to study the effect of the intervention on plasticity.</content>

 Human motor response time is determined by the matureness of the preceding neural motor preparation process.  In the current study, we characterize the optimal temporal boundaries required for the motor preparation process, and its impact on the overall motor response time. In particular, we contrasted short and long preparation durations by measuring the resulting differences in motor response times, in an attempt to find whether an optimal preparation time exists. Using a “Timed Response” paradigm, we presented participants with varying planning intervals prior to a requested motor response, and studied their effect on the timing of initiation of the following movement. We found that, as expected, reaction time shortens as more planning time is provided, yet only until reaching a minimal response time, after which additional preparation time increases the motor response time, thus creating a U-shaped behavioral function. Furthermore, since the minimal response time was found to be an individual characteristic, we suggest that there is an individual optimal time window for motor planning. The existence and personal timing of an optimal timing window can assist in the characterization and medical surveillance of patients with neurological disorders.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Children with Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD) have difficulty performing and learning motor skills. Automatic activation of the mirror neuron system (MNS) during action observation and its coupling to the motor output system are important neurophysiological processes that underpin observational motor learning. In the present study we tested the hypothesis that MNS function is disrupted in children with DCD by using sensitive EEG-based measures of MNS activation during action observation. Specifically, we predicted reduced mu-suppression and coherence in DCD compared with typically developing children.  
Neural activation of the motor network was measured by EEG, specifically event-related desynchronization (ERD) of mu rhythms and fronto-parietal coherence. Children (15 DCD / 15 controls) were tested under two task conditions: observational learning (imitation of an observed action) and detection (report a deviant movement after observation). EEG-metrics were compared between groups using linear mixed-effects models.  
As predicted, children with DCD showed lower levels of mu suppression and reduced modulation of coherence during the observational learning task compared with their non-DCD peers. Notably, mu suppression was reduced in DCD over the entire imitation task (repetitions, and both observation and pause intervals).
Action observation can be used for the acquisition of new motor skills. This form of learning entails the transposition of the observed action to the existing internal representations of the observer’s own motor system. The present neurophysiological results suggest that this process of learning is impaired in children with DCD. Results are discussed in relation to current hypotheses on mechanisms of DCD.</content>

 Orientation selectivity is a fundamental property of visual cortical neurons and plays a crucial role in pattern perception. Although many studies have dedicated to explain how the orientation selectivity emerged, the mechanism underlying orientation selectivity is still not clear. In this work, we investigated the synchronization between spikes and local field potentials (LFP) in gamma band, with the aim of providing a new avenue to analyze the orientation selectivity. The experimental data were recorded by utilizing two chronically implanted multi-electrode arrays, where each array consisted of 48 electrodes and was placed over V1 and V4 respectively in two macaques performing a selective visual attention task. An unbiased and robust measure for quantifying the synchronization between spikes and LFP was employed in the analysis process, which is termed as spike-triggered correlation matrix synchronization (SCMS) and performs reliably for limited samples of data. We observed the spike-LFP synchronization in three cases, i.e. spikes and LFP in V1, spikes and LFP in V4, spikes in V4 and LFP in V1. From the orientation tuning curves based on the spike-LFP synchronization, it is found that there is a strong correlation between the synchronization and grating orientation. The neurons in both V1 and V4 exhibit orientation selectivity, but V1 is stronger. In addition, the spike-LFP synchronization strength between V1 and V4 also shows orientation selectivity to drifting gratings. It means that the synchronization not only reflects the basic features of visual stimulation, but also describes the orientation tuning characteristics of neurons in different regions. Our results suggest that the spike-LFP synchronization can be used as an alternative and effective method to study the mechanism for generating orientation selectivity of visual neurons.</content>

 Objective: The aim of this review was to synthesize, using random-effects model of meta-analysis, the link between dopaminergic system and Alzheimer’s disease.
Methods: A detailed analysis protocol was registered at the PROSPERO database prior to data extraction (CRD42018110798). Electronic databases of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Psyc-ARTICLES were searched up to December 2018 for studies that examined dopamine and dopamine receptors in relation to Alzheimer’s disease. Standardized mean differences (SMD) were calculated to assess group differences in the levels of dopaminergic neurometabolites.
Results: Seventeen studies met the eligibility criteria. Collectively, they included 512 patients and 500 healthy controls. There were significantly lower levels of dopamine in patients with Alzheimer’s disease compared with controls (SMD= -1.56, 95% CI: -2.64 to -0.49). In addition, dopamine 1 receptor (SMD=-5.05, 95% CI: -6.14 to -3.97) and dopamine 2 receptor (SMD=-1.13, 95% CI: -1.52 to -0.74) levels were decreased in patients with Alzheimer’s disease compared with controls. The results of network meta-analysis indicated that the rank of correlation with Alzheimer’s disease from highest to lowest was dopamine (0.74), dopamine 2 receptor (0.49), dopamine 3 receptor (0.46), dopamine 4 receptor (0.33), dopamine 5 receptor (0.31), and dopamine 1 receptor (0.64).
Conclusions: Overall, decreased levels of dopaminergic neurotransmitters were linked with the pathophysiology of Alzheimer’s disease. Nonetheless, there is a clear need for more prospective studies to validate these hypotheses.</content>

 &lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Neural progenitor proliferation, neuronal migration, areal organization, and pioneer axon wiring are critical events during early forebrain development, yet remain incompletely understood, especially in human. Here, we studied forebrain development in human embryos aged 5 to 8 postconceptional weeks (WPC5–8), stages that correspond to the neuroepithelium/early marginal zone (WPC5), telencephalic preplate (WPC6 &amp;amp; 7), and incipient cortical plate (WPC8). We show that early telencephalic neurons are formed at the neuroepithelial stage; the most precocious ones originate from local telencephalic neuroepithelium and possibly from the olfactory placode. At the preplate stage, forebrain organization is quite similar in human and mouse in terms of areal organization and of differentiation of Cajal-Retzius cells, pioneer neurons, and axons. Like in mice, axons from pioneer neurons in prethalamus, ventral telencephalon, and cortical preplate cross the diencephalon–telencephalon junction and the pallial–subpallial boundary, forming scaffolds that could guide thalamic and cortical axons at later stages. In accord with this model, at the early cortical plate stage, corticofugal axons run in ventral telencephalon in close contact with scaffold neurons, which express CELSR3 and FZD3, two molecules that regulates formation of similar scaffolds in mice.&lt;/span&gt;</content>

 &lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The prefrontal cortex is vital for a range of cognitive processes, including working memory, attention, and decision-making. Notably, its absence impairs the performance of tasks requiring the maintenance of information through a delay period. In this paper, we formulate a rodent task—which requires maintenance of delay-period activity—as a Markov decision process and treat optimal task performance as an (active) inference problem. We simulate the behavior of a Bayes optimal mouse presented with 1 of 2 cues that instructs the selection of concurrent visual and auditory targets on a trial-by-trial basis. Formulating inference as message passing, we reproduce features of neuronal coupling within and between prefrontal regions engaged by this task. We focus on the micro-circuitry that underwrites delay-period activity and relate it to functional specialization within the prefrontal cortex in primates. Finally, we simulate the electrophysiological correlates of inference and demonstrate the consequences of lesions to each part of our in silico prefrontal cortex. In brief, this formulation suggests that recurrent excitatory connections—which support persistent neuronal activity—encode beliefs about transition probabilities over time. We argue that attentional modulation can be understood as the contextualization of sensory input by these persistent beliefs.&lt;/span&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The intrinsic vasopressin system of the olfactory bulb is involved in social odor processing and consists of glutamatergic vasopressin cells (VPCs) located at the medial border of the glomerular layer. To characterize VPCs in detail, we combined various electrophysiological, neuroanatomical, and two-photon Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; imaging techniques in acute bulb slices from juvenile transgenic rats with eGFP-labeled VPCs. VPCs showed regular non-bursting firing patterns, and displayed slower membrane time constants and higher input resistances versus other glutamatergic tufted cell types. VPC axons spread deeply into the external plexiform and superficial granule cell layer (GCL). Axonal projections fell into two subclasses, with either denser local columnar collaterals or longer-ranging single projections running laterally within the internal plexiform layer and deeper within the granule cell layer. VPCs always featured lateral dendrites and a tortuous apical dendrite that innervated a single glomerulus with a homogenously branching tuft. These tufts lacked Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients in response to single somatically-evoked action potentials and showed a moderate Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; increase upon prolonged action potential trains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notably, electrical olfactory nerve stimulation did not result in synaptic excitation of VPCs, but triggered substantial GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor-mediated IPSPs that masked excitatory barrages with yet longer latency. Exogenous vasopressin application reduced those IPSPs, as well as olfactory nerve-evoked EPSPs recorded from external tufted cells. In summary, VPCs can be classified as non-bursting, vertical superficial tufted cells. Moreover, our findings imply that sensory input alone cannot trigger excitation of VPCs, arguing for specific additional pathways for excitation or disinhibition in social contexts.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Physical activity is a critical behavioral variable in many research studies and is, therefore, important to quantify. However, existing methods for measuring physical activity have limitations which include high expense, specialized caging or equipment, and high computational overhead. To address these limitations, we present an open-source, cost-effective, device for measuring rodent activity. Our device is battery powered and designed to be placed in vivarium home cages to enable high-throughput, long-term operation with minimal investigator intervention. The primary aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of using passive infrared (PIR) sensors and microcontroller-based dataloggers in a rodent home cages to collect physical activity records. To this end, we developed an open-source PIR based data-logging device called the rodent activity detector (RAD). We publish the design files and code so others can readily build the RAD in their own labs. To demonstrate its utility, we used the RAD to collect physical activity data from 40 individually housed mice for up to 10 weeks. This dataset demonstrates the ability of the RAD to (1) operate in a high-throughput installation, (2) detect high-fat diet (HFD)-induced changes in physical activity, and (3) quantify circadian rhythms in individual animals. We further validated the data output of the RAD with simultaneous video tracking of mice in multiple caging configurations, to determine the features of physical activity that it detects. The RAD is easy to build, economical, and fits in vivarium caging. The scalability of such devices will enable high-throughput studies of physical activity in research studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The transentorhinal cortex (TEC) is an obliquely oriented cortex located in the medial temporal lobe and, together with the entorhinal cortex, is one of the first affected areas in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). One of the most widely accepted hypotheses is that synaptopathy (synaptic alterations and loss) represents the major structural correlate of the cognitive decline observed in AD. However, very few electron microscope (EM) studies are available; the most common method to estimate synaptic density indirectly is by counting, at the light microscopic level, immunoreactive puncta using synaptic markers. To investigate synaptic morphology and possible alterations related to AD, a detailed three-dimensional (3D) ultrastructural analysis using focused ion beam/scanning EM (FIB/SEM) was performed in the neuropil of Layer II of the TEC in human brain samples from non-demented subjects and AD patients. Evaluation of the proportion and shape of asymmetric synapses (AS) and symmetric synapses (SS) targeting spines or dendritic shafts was performed using 3D reconstructions of every synapse. The 3D analysis of 4722 synapses revealed that the preferable targets were spine heads for AS and dendritic shafts for SS, both in control and AD cases. However, in AD patients, we observed a reduction in the percentage of synapses targeting spine heads. Regarding the shape of synapses, in both control cases and AD samples, the vast majority of synapses had a macular shape, followed by perforated or horseshoe-shaped synapses, with fragmented synapses being the least frequent type. Moreover, comparisons showed an increased number of fragmented AS in AD patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

This is an especially daunting task for the development of the brain, which consists of an incredibly diverse population of neural cells. How genome architecture is established, maintained, and regulated to promote diverse cell fates and functions are fascinating questions with important implications in development and disease. The explosion in various biochemical and imaging techniques to analyze chromatin is now making it possible to interrogate the genome at an unprecedented resolution. Here we will focus on current advances in understanding genome architecture and gene regulation in the context of neural development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

 The sensory recruitment model envisages visual working memory (VWM) as an emergent property that is encoded and maintained in sensory (visual) regions. The model implies that enhanced sensory-perceptual functions, as in synaesthesia, entail a dedicated VWM-system, showing reduced visual cortex activity as a result of neural specificity. By contrast, sensory-perceptual decline, as in old age, is expected to show enhanced visual cortex activity as a result of neural broadening. To test this model, young grapheme-colour synaesthetes, older adults and young controls engaged in a delayed pair-associative retrieval and a delayed matching-to-sample task, consisting of achromatic fractal stimuli that do not induce synaesthesia. While a previous analysis of this dataset (Pfeifer et al., 2016) has focused on cued retrieval and recognition of pair-associates (i.e. long-term memory), the current study focuses on visual working memory and considers, for the first time, the crucial delay period in which no visual stimuli are present, but working memory processes are engaged. Participants were trained to criterion and demonstrated comparable behavioural performance on VWM tasks. Whole-brain and region-of-interest-analyses revealed significantly lower activity in synaesthetes’ middle frontal gyrus and visual regions (cuneus, inferior temporal cortex) respectively, suggesting greater neural efficiency relative to young and older adults in both tasks. The results support the sensory recruitment model and can explain age and individual WM-differences based on neural specificity in visual cortex.</content>

 Over the past 2,500 years, contemplative traditions have explored the nature of the mind using meditation. More recently, neuroimaging research on meditation has revealed differences in brain function and structure in meditators. Nevertheless, the underlying neural mechanisms are still unclear. In order to understand how meditation shapes global activity through the brain, we investigated the spatiotemporal dynamics across the whole-brain functional network using the Intrinsic Ignition Framework. Recent neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that different states of consciousness differ in their underlying dynamical complexity, i.e., how the broadness of communication is elicited and distributed through the brain over time and space. In this work, controls and experienced meditators were scanned using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during resting-state and meditation (focused attention on breathing). Our results evidenced that the dynamical complexity underlying meditation shows less complexity than during resting-state in the meditator group but not in the control group. Furthermore, we report that during resting-state, the brain activity of experienced meditators showed higher metastability (i.e., a wider dynamical regime over time) than the one observed in the control group. Overall, these results indicate that the meditation state operates in a different dynamical regime compared to the resting-state.</content>

 Objective
In children screened for dizziness with vergence disorders, we tested short and long term efficacy of orthoptic vergence training (OVT) and instructions to reduce screen usage.
Methods
Prospective study. Of the 179 children referred for vertigo or dizziness (over 3 years) and ophthalmological disorder as the only problem after complete oto-neuro-vestibular testing, 69 presented vergence insufficiency, and 49 accepted to participate to this study. 109 healthy children served as controls. All subjects performed classic orthoptic evaluation and video binocular movement recordings during various oculomotor tasks. Patients were evaluated before OVT (M0), after the end of OVT (M3) and 6 months later (M9). Statistics compared orthoptic and oculomotor parameters between patients and controls over time with one-way ANCOVA, and mixed models, controlling for age and gender.
Results
Patients reported vertigo that was usually rotatory, lasting &amp;lt;15 min, associated or alternating with headache (50%). Their exposure to small videoscreens and TV was intensive (~3.6 h per day). At M0, all orthoptic and oculomotor parameters were statistically different in patients relative to controls (p&amp;lt;0.0001) except for divergence. At M3, vertigo symptoms had disappeared in all of the patients, and all eye movement parameters improved significantly (p&amp;lt;0.0001). At M9, this improvement remained stable or continued. 
Conclusion
Vergence disorders (assessed by abnormal orthoptic and oculomotor parameters) can generate symptoms of dizziness in children. Orthoptic treatment and instruction to reduce screen usage has a significant and long term effect on vertigo symptoms as well as oculomotor performances. Dizzy children should be screened for vergence disorders.</content>

 Limited in part by the spatial resolution of typical in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, recent neuroimaging studies have only identified a connectivity-based shell-core-like partitioning of the nucleus accumbens (Acb) in humans. This has hindered the process of making a more refined description of the Acb using non-invasive neuroimaging technologies and approaches. In this study, high-resolution ex vivo macaque brain diffusion MRI data were acquired to investigate the tractography-based parcellation of the Acb. Our results identified a shell-core-like partitioning in macaques that is similar to that in humans as well as an alternative solution that subdivided the Acb into four parcels, the medial shell, the lateral shell, the ventral core, and the dorsal core. Furthermore, we characterized the specific anatomical and functional connectivity profiles of these Acb subregions and generalized their specialized functions to establish a fine-grained macaque Acb brainnetome atlas. This atlas should be helpful in neuroimaging, stereotactic surgery, and comparative neuroimaging studies to reveal the neurophysiological substrates of various diseases and cognitive functions associated with the Acb.</content>

 Electroencephalography (EEG) data recorded during simultaneous EEG-fMRI experiments are contaminated by large gradient artefacts (GA). The amplitude of the GA depends on the area of the wire loops formed by the EEG leads, as well as on the rate of switching of the magnetic field gradients, which are essential for MR imaging. Average artefact subtraction (AAS), the method most commonly used method for GA correction, relies on the EEG amplifier having a large enough dynamic range to characterize the artefact voltages. Low-pass filtering (250 Hz cut-off) is generally used to attenuate the high-frequency voltage fluctuations of the GA, but even with this precaution channel saturation can occur, particularly during acquisition of high spatial resolution MRI data. Previous work has shown that the ribbon cable, used to connect the EEG cap and amplifier, makes a significant contribution to the GA, since the cable geometry produces large effective wire-loop areas. However, by appropriately connecting the wires of the ribbon cable to the EEG cap it should be possible to minimize the overall range and root mean square (RMS) amplitude of the GA by producing partial cancellation of the cap and cable contributions. Here by modifying the connections of the EEG cap to a 1 m ribbon cable we were able to reduce the range of the GA for a high-resolution coronal echo planar Imaging (EPI) acquisition by a factor of ~ 1.6 and by a factor of ~ 1.15 for a standard axial EPI acquisition. These changes could potentially be translated into a reduction in the required dynamic range, an increase in the EEG bandwidth or an increase in the achievable image resolution without saturation, all of which could be beneficially exploited in EEG-fMRI studies. The re-wiring could also prevent the system from saturating when small subject movements occur using the standard recording bandwidth.</content>

 Adenosine A2A receptors (A2ARs) have attracted considerable attention as an important molecular target for the design of Parkinson’s disease (PD) therapeutic compounds. Here, we studied the transcriptional regulation of the A2AR gene in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from PD patients and in the striatum of the well-validated, 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced PD mouse model.  We report an increase in A2AR mRNA expression and protein levels in both human cells and mice striata, and in the latter we could also observe a consistent reduction in DNA methylation at gene promoter and an increase in histone H3 acetylation at lysine 9. Of particular relevance in clinical samples, we also observed higher levels in the receptor gene expression in younger subjects, as well as in those with less years from disease onset and less severe disease according to clinical scores. In conclusion, the present findings provide further evidence of the relevant role of A2AR in PD and, based on the clinical data, highlight its potential role as disease biomarker for PD especially at the initial stages of disease development. Furthermore, our preclinical results also suggest selective epigenetic mechanisms targeting gene promoter as tool for the development of new treatments.</content>

 Objectives: To evaluate white matter hyperintensities (WMH) quantification reproducibility from multiple aspects of view, examine the effects of scan-rescan procedure, types of scanner, imaging protocols, scanner software upgrade, and automatic segmentation tools on WMH quantification results using MRI. 
Methods: Six post-stroke subjects (4 males; mean age 62.8, range 58-72 years) were scanned and rescanned with both 3D T1-weighted, 2D and 3D T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (T2-FLAIR) MRI across four different MRI scanners within 12 hours. Two automated WMH segmentation and quantification tools were used to measure WMH volume based on each MR scan. Robustness was assessed using the coefficient of variation (CV).
Results: Experimental results show that the best reproducibility was achieved by using 3D T2-FLAIR MRI under intra-scanner setting with CV ranging from 2.69% to 2.97%, while the largest variability resulted from comparing WMH volumes measured based on 2D T2-FLAIR MRI with those of 3D T2-FLAIR MRI, with CV values in the range of 15.62%-29.33%. The WMH quantification variability based on 2D MRIs is larger than 3D MRIs due to their large slice thickness. In addition to image acquisition, the choice of automatic WMH segmentation tool also has a large impact on WMH quantification.
Conclusions: WMH reproducibility is one of the primary issues to be considered in multicenter and longitudinal studies. The study provides solid guidance in assisting multicenter and longitudinal study design to achieve meaningful results with enough power.</content>

 Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a severe type of neurodegeneration which worsens human memory, thinking and cognition along a temporal continuum. How to identify the informative  phenotypic neuroimaging markers and accurately predict cognitive assessment are crucial for early detection and diagnosis Alzheimer's disease. Regression models are widely used to predict the relationship between imaging biomarkers and cognitive assessment, and identify discriminative neuroimaging markers. Most existing methods use different matrix norms as the similarity measures of the empirical loss or regularization to improve the prediction performance, but ignore the inherent geometry of the cognitive data. To tackle this issue, in this paper we propose a novel robust matrix regression model with imposing Wasserstein distances on both loss function and regularization. It successfully integrate Wasserstein distance into the regression model, which can excavate the latent geometry of cognitive data. We introduce an efficient algorithm to solve the proposed new model with convergence analysis. Empirical results on cognitive data of the  ADNI cohort demonstrate the great effectiveness of the proposed method for clinical cognitive predication.</content>

 Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at resting state (RS) has been widely used to characterize the main brain networks. Functional connectivity (FC) has been mostly assessed assuming that FC is stationary across the whole fMRI examination. However, FC is highly variable at a very fast time-scale, as demonstrated by neurophysiological techniques. Dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) is a novel approach that allows capturing reoccurring patterns of interaction among functional brain networks. Aim of this review is to provide a description of the methods currently used to assess dFC on RS fMRI data, and to summarize the main results of studies applying dFC in healthy controls and patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). An overview of the main results obtained in neurodegenerative and psychiatric conditions is also provided.
The most popular dFC approach is based on the so-called “sliding windows”, in which the RS fMRI acquisition is divided in small temporal segments (windows). A window of fixed length is shifted over RS fMRI time courses, and data within each window are used to calculate FC and its variability over time. Sliding windows can be combined with clustering techniques to identify recurring FC states or used to assess global dFC properties of large-scale functional networks or specific brain regions. 
dFC studies have used heterogeneous methodologies so far. Despite this, similar results have been obtained across investigations. In healthy subjects, the default-mode network (DMN) exhibited the highest degree of connectivity dynamism. In MS patients, abnormal global dFC properties and dFC strengths were found mainly in sensorimotor, DMN and salience networks, and were associated with more severe structural MRI damage and with more severe physical and cognitive disability. Conversely, abnormal dFC measures of the temporal network were correlated with better cognitive performances and less severe fatigue. In patients with neurodegenerative and psychiatric conditions, dFC abnormalities of the DMN, attention and executive networks were associated to more severe clinical manifestations.
Dynamic FC helps to provide novel insights into fundamental properties of functional networks, and improves the understanding of brain reorganization mechanisms. Future technical advances might help to clarify dFC association with disease prognosis and response to treatment.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Real-life decisions often require a comparison of multi-attribute options with various benefits and costs, and the evaluation of each option depends partly on the other ones in the choice set (i.e., the choice context). Although reinforcement learning models have successfully described choice behavior, it remains unclear how multi-attribute information is taken into account for making a context-dependent decision in reinforcement learning algorithms. Here we develop a computational model of attention control that includes context effects on multi-attribute decisions, linking a context-dependent choice model with a reinforcement learning model. The overall model suggests that the distinctiveness of attributes guides an individual’s preferences among multi-attribute options via an attention-control mechanism that determines whether choices are selectively biased toward the most distinctive attribute (selective attention) or proportionally distributed based on the relative distinctiveness of attributes (divided attention). To test the model, we conducted a behavioral experiment in rhesus monkeys, in which they made simple multi-attribute decisions over three conditions that manipulated the degree of distinctiveness between alternatives: (1) four foods of different size and calorie; (2) four pieces of the same food in different colors; and (3) four identical pieces of food. The model simulation of the choice behavior captured the preference bias (i.e., overall preference structure) and the choice persistence (repeated choices) in the empirical data, providing evidence for the respective influences of attention and memory on preference bias and choice persistence. Our study provides insights into computations underlying multi-attribute decisions, linking attentional control to decision-making processes.</content>

 Prions are lethal pathogens, which cause fatal neurodegenerative diseases in mammals. They are unique infectious agents and are composed of self-propagating multi-chain assemblies of misfolded host-encoded prion protein (PrP). Understanding prion structure is fundamental to understanding prion disease pathogenesis however to date, the high-resolution structure of authentic ex vivo infectious prions remains unknown. Advances in determining prion structure have been severely impeded by the difficulty in recovering relatively homogeneous prion particles from infected brain and definitively associating infectivity with the PrP assembly state. Recently however, images of highly infectious ex vivo PrP rods that produce prion-strain specific disease phenotypes in mice have been obtained using cryo-electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. These images have provided the most detailed description of ex vivo mammalian prions reported to date and have established that prions isolated from multiple strains have a common hierarchical structure. Misfolded PrP is assembled into 20 nm wide rods containing two fibres, each with double helical repeating substructure, separated by a characteristic central gap 8–10 nm in width. Irregularly structured material with adhesive properties distinct to that of the fibres is present within the central gap of the rod. Prions are clearly distinguishable from non-infectious recombinant PrP fibrils generated in vitro and from all other propagating protein structures so far described in other neurodegenerative diseases. The basic architecture of mammalian prions appears to be exceptional and fundamental to their lethal pathogenicity.</content>

 Glutamate transporter-1 (GLT-1) is a Na+-dependent transporter that plays a key role in glutamate homeostasis by removing excess glutamate in the central nervous system (CNS).  GLT-1 dysregulation occurs in various neurological diseases including Huntington’s disease (HD), Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and epilepsy.  Downregulation or dysfunction of GLT-1 has been a common finding across these diseases but how this occurs is still under investigation.  This review aims to highlight post-translational regulation of GLT-1 which leads to its downregulation including sumoylation, palmitoylation, nitrosylation, ubiquitination and subcellular localization.  Various therapeutic interventions to restore GLT-1, their proposed mechanism of action and functional effects will be examined as potential treatments to attenuate the neurological symptoms associated with loss or downregulation of GLT-1.</content>

 Numerous neurodegenerative diseases including prion, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases are characterized by accumulation of protein aggregates in brain. Prion disease is unique in that the natively folded prion protein forms diverse misfolded aggregates with distinct molecular conformations (strains), which underlie different disease phenotypes. In addition, the conformational strains are able to self-propagate their unique conformations by recruiting normal protein monomers and converting their conformations to misfolded conformers. There is an increasing body of evidence that suggests other aggregation-prone proteins including tau and alpha-synuclein associated with Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases, respectively, also behave like a prion that has conformational strains with self-propagation (seeding) property. Moreover, misfolded protein aggregates can promote misfolding and aggregation of different proteins through cross-seeding, which might be associated with co-occurrence of multiple neurodegenerative diseases in the same patient. Elucidation of diverse conformational strains with self-propagation capability and of molecular basis for the cross-talk between misfolded proteins is essential to the development of effective therapeutic intervention.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Although maladaptive sensory processing has been observed among individuals with persistent heightened anxiety, it is unclear if difficulties processing sensory input early in life lead to anxiety disorders in adulthood and what mechanisms would drive this progression. In a transdiagnostic clinical sample of 231 adults characterized by heightened difficulties with emotion regulation, the present study sought to examine whether (a) childhood sensory processing disorder (SPD) symptoms predict an increased probability of an anxiety disorder diagnosis in adulthood and (b) difficulties with emotion regulation and adult SPD symptoms mediate this relationship. Participants were administered the Structured Clinical Interview for Axis-I disorders and self-reported symptoms of SPD experienced in childhood and adulthood. Results from suggested that childhood SPD symptoms were significantly associated with a higher likelihood of a lifetime anxiety disorder diagnosis. Difficulties with emotion regulation fully mediated the relationship between childhood SPD and (a) any anxiety disorder in adulthood and, specifically (b) current generalized anxiety disorder. Further, we found evidence for a candidate model accounting for the relationship among childhood SPD, adulthood SPD, difficulties with emotion regulation, and anxiety disorders in adulthood. Specifically, our data indicated that high symptoms of SPD in childhood may lead to high SPD symptoms in adulthood, which then lead to high emotion dysregulation, ultimately conferring vulnerability for an anxiety disorder diagnosis. Taken together, these findings provide preliminary evidence for how sensory processing impairments in childhood may relate to anxiety through difficulties regulating emotion regulation.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Objectives: Trigeminal postherpetic neuralgia (TPHN) often presents with moderate to severe pain, hyperalgesia, and allodynia. Conventional analgesic treatments are poorly effective, which seriously affects the quality of life. This retrospective study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) for the treatment of TPHN. 
Methods: A total of 90 TPHN patients were selected between January 2014 and December 2016 in the Department of Pain Management, Shengjing Hospital, China Medical University. Patients were randomly divided into 2 groups according to the order of enrollment (n=45 per group): group A, peripheral nerve (supraorbital nerve, infraorbital nerve and mental nerve) PRF; group B, gasserian ganglion PRF. Follow-up assessments of Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) pain assessment, SF-36 health status questionnaire, total efficiency rate, and drug dosage of anticonvulsants and opioid analgesics were performed at time points of 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year after surgery. 
Results: At each postsurgery time point, the VAS decreased, SF-36 (physical and mental components) increased, and drug dosage of anticonvulsants and opioids analgesics decreased in both treatment groups; values at each time point were significantly different from presurgery values (P&amp;lt;0.05). Compared with group A, VAS decreased, SF-36 increased, and dosage of anticonvulsants and opioids analgesics decreased significantly in group B (P&amp;lt;0.05). The total efficiency rates one year after surgery in group A and group B were 68.9% and 86.7%, respectively. The total efficiency rate of group B was statistically higher than that of group A (P&amp;lt;0.05).
Conclusion: PRF relieved TPHN, and gasserian ganglion PRF was more effective than peripheral nerve PRF. The method was effective and improved the quality of life of the patients. PRF is recommended as a treatment for TPHN.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Background: Cortical function is dependent on the balance between excitatory and inhibitory influences. In the human motor cortex, surrogates of these interactions can be measured in-vivo, non-invasively with double-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). To compare results from data acquired with different available setups and bring data together, it is inevitable to determine whether different TMS setups lead to comparable or differential results.
Objective: We assessed and compared short intracortical inhibition (SICI) and intracortical facilitation (ICF) testing four different experimental conditions.
Methods: SICI and ICF were studied with different stimulators (Magstim BiStim² or MagVenture MagPro X100), waveforms (monophasic or biphasic), current directions (anterior-posterior or posterior-anterior) at interstimulus intervals (ISIs) of 1, 3, 10, 15 ms.
Results: We were not able to detect differences for SICI and ICF, when comparing the tested conditions, except for 3 ms SICI in which the anterior-posterior current direction led to stronger modulation. Correlation analysis suggested comparability for 3 ms SICI for the Magstim monophasic posterior-anterior condition with both tested MagVenture conditions. 
Conclusions: 3 ms SICI data sets obtained with two different, commonly used stimulators (Magstim BiStim² or MagVenture MagPro X100) with conventionally used stimulation parameters are largely comparable.  This may allow the combination of data sets in an open science view.</content>

 Background:
Cranial irradiation is a common therapy for the treatment of brain tumors, but unfortunately patients suffer from side effects, particularly cognitive impairment, caused by neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory mechanisms. Finding a therapeutic agent protecting hippocampal neurons would be beneficial. Fingolimod (FTY720), a sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulator approved for multiple sclerosis, is an immunosuppressant and known to enhance proliferation and differentiation of neuronal precursor cells (NPCs). 
Objectives:
To investigate whether pre-treatment with FTY720 protects NPCs in vitro and in vivo from irradiation-induced damage. 
Methods:
NPCs were isolated from E13 C57BL/6 wildtype mice, treated at day 0 of differentiation with FTY720 and irradiated on day 6 with 1 Gy. NPCs were analyzed for markers of cell death (PI, Caspase 3), proliferation (Ki67), and differentiation (DCX, βIII-tubulin). Adult C57BL/6 wildtype mice were treated with FTY720 (1 mg/kg) and received a single dose of 6 Gy cranial irradiation at day 7. Using immunohistochemistry, we analyzed DCX and BrdU as markers of neurogenesis and Iba1, GFAP, and CD3 to visualize inflammation in the dentate gyrus and the subventricular zone. B6(Cg)-Tyrc-2J/J DCX-luc reporter mice were used for bioluminescence imaging to evaluate the effect of FTY720 on neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus and the spinal cord of naïve mice. 
Results:
FTY720 protected NPCs against irradiation induced cell death in vitro. Treatment with FTY720 dose-dependently reduced the number of PI+ cells 24 and 96 h after irradiation without effecting proliferation or neuronal differentiation. In vivo treatment resulted in a significant survival of DCX+ neurons in the dentate gyrus and the subventricular zone 4 weeks after irradiation as well as a slight increase of proliferating cells. FTY720 inhibited microglia activation 24 h after X-ray exposure in the dentate gyrus, while astrocyte activation was unaffected and no lymphocyte infiltrations were found. In naïve mice, FTY720 treatment for 4 weeks had no effect on neurogenesis. 
Conclusions:
FTY720 treatment of NPCs prior to X-ray exposure and of mice prior to cranial irradiation is neuroprotective. No effects on neurogenesis were found.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Dynamical changes have been recently tracked in functional connectivity (FC) calculated from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (R-fMRI), when a person is conscious but not carrying out a directed task during scanning. Diverse dynamical FC states (dFC) are believed to represent different internal states of brain, in terms of brain-regional interactions. In this paper, we propose a novel protocol, the signed community clustering with the optimized modularity by two-step procedures, to track dynamical whole brain functional connectivity (dWFC) states. This protocol is assumption free without a priori threshold for the number of clusters. By applying our method on sliding window based dWFC’s with automated anatomical labeling 2 (AAL2), three main dWFC states were extracted from R-fMRI datasets in Human Connectome Project, that are independent on window size. Through extracting the FC features of these states, we found the functional links in state 1 (WFC-C1) mainly involved visual, somatomotor, attention and cerebellar (posterior lobe) modules. State 2 (WFC-C2) was similar to WFC-C1, but more FC’s linking limbic, default mode and frontoparietal modules and less linking the cerebellum, sensory and attention modules. State 3 had more FC’s linking default mode, limbic, and cerebellum, compared to WFC-C1 and WFC-C2. With test of robustness and stability, our work provides a solid, hypothesis-free tool to detect dWFC states for the possibility of tracking rapid dynamical change in FCs among large data set.</content>

 Background and Purpose: Cerebral edema and elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) are the leading cause of death in the first week following stroke. Despite this, current treatments are limited and fail to address the underlying mechanisms of swelling, highlighting the need for targeted treatments. When screening promising novel agents, it is essential to use clinically-relevant large animal models to increase the likelihood of successful clinical translation.  As such, we sought to develop a survival model of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) in the sheep and subsequently characterize the temporal profile of cerebral edema and elevated ICP following stroke in this novel, clinically-relevant model. 

Methods: Merino-sheep (27M;31F) were anesthetized and subject to 2 hours tMCAO with reperfusion or sham surgery. Following surgery, animals were allowed to recover and returned to their home pens. At preselected times points ranging from 1 to 7 days post-stroke, animals were re-anesthetized, ICP measured for 4 hours, followed by imaging with MRI to determine cerebral edema, midline shift and infarct volume (T2, FLAIR, DWI). Animals were subsequently euthanized and their brain removed for immunohistochemical analysis. Serum and cerebrospinal fluid samples were also collected and analyzed for substance P (SP) using ELISA.

Results: ICP and MRI scans were normal in sham animals. Following stroke, ICP rose gradually over time and by 5 days was significantly (p&amp;lt;0.0001) elevated above sham levels. Profound cerebral edema was observed as early as 2 days post-stroke and continued to evolve out to 6 days, resulting in significant midline shift which was most prominent at 5 days post-stroke (p&amp;lt;0.01), in keeping with increasing ICP. Serum SP levels were significantly elevated (p&amp;lt;0.01) by 7 days post tMCAO.

Conclusion: We have successfully developed a survival model of ovine tMCAO and characterized the temporal profile of ICP. Peak ICP elevation, cerebral edema and midline shift occurred at day 5-6 following stroke, accompanied by an elevation in serum SP. Our findings suggest that novel therapeutic agents screened in this model targeting cerebral edema and elevated ICP would most likely be effective when administered prior to 5 days, or as early as possible following stroke onset.</content>

 Studying and understanding human brain structures and functions have become one of the most challenging issues in neuroscience today. However, the mammalian nervous system is made up of hundreds of millions of neurons and billions of synapses.
This complexity made it impossible to reconstruct such a huge nervous system in the laboratory. So, most researchers focus on C.elegans neural network. The C.elegans neural network is the only biological neural network that is fully mapped. This nervous system is the simplest neural network that exists. However, many fundamental behaviors like movement emerge from this basic network. These features made C.elegans a convenient case to study the nervous systems. Many studies try to propose a network formation model for C.elegans neural network. However, these studies could not meet all characteristics of C.elegans neural network such as significant factors that play a role in the formation of C.elegans neural network. Thus, new models are needed to be proposed in order to explain all aspects of C.elegans neural network.

In this paper, a new model based on game theory is proposed in order to understand the factors affecting the formation of nervous systems, which meet the C.elegans frontal neural network characteristics. In this model, neurons are considered to be agents. The strategy for each neuron includes either making or removing links to other neurons.
 After choosing the basic network, the utility function is built using structural and functional factors. In order to find the coefficients for each of these factors, linear programming is used. Finally, the output network is compared with C.elegans frontal neural network and previous models. The results implicate that the game-theoretical model proposed in this paper can better predict the influencing factors in the formation of C.elegans neural network compared to previous models.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Hibernation is a natural phenomenon in many species which helps them to survive under extreme ambient conditions, such as cold temperatures and reduced availability of food in the winter months. It is characterized by a dramatic and regulated drop of body temperature, which in some cases can be near 0°C. Additionally, neural control of hibernation is maintained over all phases of a hibernation bout, including entrance into, during and arousal from torpor, despite a marked decrease in overall neural activity in torpor. In the present review we provide an overview on what we know about neuronal activity in the hibernating brain focusing on cold-induced adaptations. We discuss pioneer and more recent in vitro and in vivo electrophysiological data and molecular analyses of activity markers which strikingly contributed to our understanding of the brain’s sensitivity to dramatic changes in temperature across the hibernation cycle. Neuronal activity is markedly reduced with decreasing body temperature, and many neurons may fire infrequently in torpor at low brain temperatures. Still, there is convincing evidence that specific regions maintain their ability to generate action potentials in deep torpor, at least in response to adequate stimuli. Those regions include the peripheral system and primary central regions. However, further experiments on neuronal activity are needed to more precisely determine temperature effects on neuronal activity in specific cell types and specific brain nuclei.</content>

 Neurodevelopmental disorders, including those involving intellectual disability, are characterized by abnormalities in formation and functions of synaptic circuits. Traditionally, research on synaptogenesis and synaptic transmission in health and disease focused on neurons, however, a growing number of studies have highlighted the role of astrocytes in this context. Tight structural and functional interactions of astrocytes and synapses indeed play important roles in brain functions, and the repertoire of astroglial regulations of synaptic circuits is large and complex.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Homozygous and heterozygous mutations in GBA1, the gene implicated in Gaucher disease, increase the risk and severity of Parkinson disease (PD). We evaluated the design, phenotype, strengths, and limitations of current GBA1-associated PD mouse models. Although faithful modeling of a genetic risk factor poses many challenges, the different approaches taken were successful in revealing predisposing abnormalities in heterozygotes for GBA1 mutations and demonstrating the deleterious effects of GBA1 impairment on the PD course in PD models.</content>
