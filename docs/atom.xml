		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Stagnation detection has been proposed as a mechanism for randomized search
heuristics to escape from local optima by automatically increasing the size of
the neighborhood to find the so-called gap size, i.e., the distance to the next
improvement. Its usefulness has mostly been considered in simple multimodal
landscapes with few local optima that could be crossed one after another. In
multimodal landscapes with a more complex location of optima of similar gap
size, stagnation detection suffers from the fact that the neighborhood size is
frequently reset to $1$ without using gap sizes that were promising in the
past.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we investigate a new mechanism called radius memory which can
be added to stagnation detection to manage the search radius for each search
point based on the last success. We implement this idea in an algorithm called
SD-RLS$^{\text{m}}$ and show compared to previous variants of stagnation
detection that it yields speed-ups for linear functions under uniform
constraints and the minimum spanning tree. Moreover, its running time does not
significantly deteriorate on unimodal functions and a generalization of the
Jump benchmark. Finally, we present experimental results carried out to study
SD-RLS$^{\text{m}}$ and compare it with other algorithms.

 &lt;p&gt;In evolutionary robotics, several approaches have been shown to be capable of
the joint optimisation of body-plans and controllers by either using only
evolution or combining evolution and learning. When working in rich
morphological spaces, it is common for offspring to have body-plans that are
very different from either of their parents, which can cause difficulties with
respect to inheriting a suitable controller. To address this, we propose a
framework that combines an evolutionary algorithm to generate body-plans and a
learning algorithm to optimise the parameters of a neural controller where the
topology of this controller is created once the body-plan of each offspring
body-plan is generated. The key novelty of the approach is to add an external
archive for storing learned controllers that map to explicit `types' of robots
(where this is defined with respect the features of the body-plan). By
inheriting an appropriate controller from the archive rather than learning from
a randomly initialised one, we show that both the speed and magnitude of
learning increases over time when compared to an approach that starts from
scratch, using three different test-beds. The framework also provides new
insights into the complex interactions between evolution and learning, and the
role of morphological intelligence in robot design.

 &lt;p&gt;A genetic algorithm (GA) is a search method that optimises a population of
solutions by simulating natural evolution. Good solutions reproduce together to
create better candidates. The standard GA assumes that any two solutions can
mate. However, in nature and social contexts, social networks can condition the
likelihood that two individuals mate. This impact of population network
structure over GAs performance is unknown. Here we introduce the Networked
Genetic Algorithm (NGA) to evaluate how various random and scale-free
population networks influence the optimisation performance of GAs on benchmark
functions. We show evidence of significant variations in performance of the NGA
as the network varies. In addition, we find that the best-performing population
networks, characterised by intermediate density and low average shortest path
length, significantly outperform the standard complete network GA. These
results may constitute a starting point for network tuning and network control:
seeing the network structure of the population as a parameter that can be tuned
to improve the performance of evolutionary algorithms, and offer more realistic
modelling of social learning.

 &lt;p&gt;Replay is the reactivation of one or more neural patterns, which are similar
to the activation patterns experienced during past waking experiences. Replay
was first observed in biological neural networks during sleep, and it is now
thought to play a critical role in memory formation, retrieval, and
consolidation. Replay-like mechanisms have been incorporated into deep
artificial neural networks that learn over time to avoid catastrophic
forgetting of previous knowledge. Replay algorithms have been successfully used
in a wide range of deep learning methods within supervised, unsupervised, and
reinforcement learning paradigms. In this paper, we provide the first
comprehensive comparison between replay in the mammalian brain and replay in
artificial neural networks. We identify multiple aspects of biological replay
that are missing in deep learning systems and hypothesize how they could be
utilized to improve artificial neural networks.

 &lt;p&gt;Neuromorphic architectures are ideally suited for the implementation of smart
sensors able to react, learn, and respond to a changing environment. Our work
uses the insect brain as a model to understand how heterogeneous architectures,
incorporating different types of neurons and encodings, can be leveraged to
create systems integrating input processing, evaluation, and response. Here we
show how the combination of time and rate encodings can lead to fast sensors
that are able to generate a hypothesis on the input in only a few cycles and
then use that hypothesis as secondary input for more detailed analysis.

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Neuro-encoded expression programming(NEEP) that aims to offer a novel
continuous representation of combinatorial encoding for genetic programming
methods is proposed in this paper. Genetic programming with linear
representation uses nature-inspired operators (e.g., crossover, mutation) to
tune expressions and finally search out the best explicit function to simulate
data. The encoding mechanism is essential for genetic programmings to find a
desirable solution efficiently. However, the linear representation methods
manipulate the expression tree in discrete solution space, where a small change
of the input can cause a large change of the output. The unsmooth landscapes
destroy the local information and make difficulty in searching. The
neuro-encoded expression programming constructs the gene string with recurrent
neural network (RNN) and the weights of the network are optimized by powerful
continuous evolutionary algorithms. The neural network mappings smoothen the
sharp fitness landscape and provide rich neighborhood information to find the
best expression. The experiments indicate that the novel approach improves
training efficiency and reduces test errors on several well-known symbolic
regression problems.

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Aggregation of α-synuclein (αSyn) into proteinaceous deposits is a pathological hallmark of a range of neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson’s disease (PD). Numerous lines of evidence indicate that the accumulation of toxic oligomeric and prefibrillar αSyn species may underpin the cellular toxicity and spread of pathology between cells. Therefore, aggregation of αSyn is considered a priority target for drug development, as aggregation inhibitors are expected to reduce αSyn toxicity and serve as therapeutic agents. Here, we used the budding yeast S. cerevisiae as a platform for the identification of short peptides that inhibit αSyn aggregation and toxicity. A library consisting of approximately one million peptide variants was utilized in two high-throughput screening approaches for isolation of library representatives that reduce αSyn-associated toxicity and aggregation. Seven peptides were isolated that were able to suppress specifically αSyn toxicity and aggregation in living cells. Expression of the peptides in yeast reduced the accumulation of αSyn-induced reactive oxygen species and increased cell viability. Next, the peptides were chemically synthesized and probed for their ability to modulate αSyn aggregation in vitro. Two synthetic peptides, K84s and K102s, of 25 and 19 amino acids, respectively, significantly inhibited αSyn oligomerization and aggregation at sub-stoichiometric molar ratios. Importantly, K84s reduced αSyn aggregation in human cells. These peptides represent promising αSyn aggregation antagonists for the development of future therapeutic interventions.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Hypoxic-ischemia (HI) is a major cause of acquired visual impairment in children from developed countries. Previous studies have shown that systemic administration of 7,8-dihydroxyavone (DHF), a selective tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) agonist, provides long-term neuroprotection against HI injury in an immature retina. However, the target genes and the mechanisms of the neuroprotective effects of TrkB signaling are not known. In the present study, we induced an HI retinal injury through unilateral common carotid artery ligation followed by 8% oxygen for 2 h in P7 rat pups. DHF was administered intraperitoneally 2 h before and 18 h after the HI injury. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) array was used to identify the target genes upregulated after the DHF treatment, which was then confirmed with quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase PCR and a western blot. Effects of the downstream mediator of DHF were assessed using an intravitreal injection of neutralizing antibody 4 h after DHF administration (24 h after HI). Meanwhile, the target protein was injected into the vitreous 24 h after HI to validate its protective effect when exogenously supplemented. We found that systemic DHF treatment after HI significantly increased the expression of the artemin (ARTN) gene and protein at P8 and P10, respectively. The neuroprotective effects of DHF were inhibited after the ARTN protein blockade, with an increase in neuroinflammation and astrogliosis. ARTN treatment showed long-term protection against HI injury at both the histopathological and functional levels. The neuroprotective effects of ARTN were related to a decrease in microglial activation at P17 and attenuation of astrogliosis at P29. ARTN enhances phosphorylation of RET, ERK, and JNK, but not AKT or p38 in the immature retina. Altogether, these results suggest that the neuroprotective effect of a TrkB agonist is partially exerted through a mechanism that involves ARTN because the protective effect is ameliorated by ARTN sequestration. ARTN treatment after HI injury protects the immature retina by attenuating late neuroinflammation and astrogliosis in the immature retina relating to the ARTN/RET/JNK/ERK signaling pathway. ARTN may be a strategy by which to provide long-term protection in the immature retina against HI injury.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The cerebellum harbors a circadian clock that can be shifted by scheduled mealtime and participates in behavioral anticipation of food access. Large-scale two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) combined with mass spectrometry was used to identify day–night variations in the cerebellar proteome of mice fed either during daytime or nighttime. Experimental conditions led to modified expression of 89 cerebellar proteins contained in 63 protein spots. Five and 33 spots were changed respectively by time-of-day or feeding conditions. Strikingly, several proteins of the heat-shock protein family (i.e., Hsp90aa1, 90ab1, 90b1, and Hspa2, 4, 5, 8, 9) were down-regulated in the cerebellum of daytime food-restricted mice. This was also the case for brain fatty acid protein (Fabp7) and enzymes involved in oxidative phosphorylation (Ndufs1) or folate metabolism (Aldh1l1). In contrast, aldolase C (Aldoc or zebrin II) and pyruvate carboxylase (Pc), two enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, and vesicle-fusing ATPase (Nsf) were up-regulated during daytime restricted feeding, possibly reflecting increased neuronal activity. Significant feeding × time-of-day interactions were found for changes in the intensity of 20 spots. Guanine nucleotide-binding protein G(o) subunit alpha (Gnao1) was more expressed in the cerebellum before food access. Neuronal calcium-sensor proteins [i.e., parvalbumin (Pvalb) and visinin-like protein 1 (Vsnl1)] were inversely regulated in daytime food-restricted mice, compared to control mice fed at night. Furthermore, expression of three enzymes modulating the circadian clockwork, namely heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (Hnrnpk), serine/threonine-protein phosphatases 1 (Ppp1cc and Ppp1cb subunits) and 5 (Ppp5), was differentially altered by daytime restricted feeding. Besides cerebellar proteins affected only by feeding conditions or daily cues, specific changes in in protein abundance before food access may be related to behavioral anticipation of food access and/or feeding-induced shift of the cerebellar clockwork.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Altered function or presence of inhibitory neurons is documented in autism spectrum disorders (ASD), but the mechanism underlying this alternation is poorly understood. One major subtype of inhibitory neurons altered is the parvalbumin (PV)-containing neurons with reduced density and intensity in ASD patients and model mice. A subpopulation of PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons expresses perineuronal nets (PNN). To better understand whether the relationship between PV and PNN is altered in ASD, we measured quantitatively the intensities of PV and PNN in single PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons in the prelimbic prefrontal cortex (PrL-PFC) of a valproic acid (VPA) model of ASD at different ages. We found a decreased PV intensity but increased PNN intensity in VPA mice. The relationship between PV and PNN intensities is altered in VPA mice, likely due to an “abnormal” subpopulation of neurons with an altered PV-PNN relationship. Furthermore, reducing PNN level using in vivo injection of chondroitinase ABC corrects the PV expression in adult VPA mice. We suggest that the interaction between PV and PNN is disrupted in PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons in VPA mice which may contribute to the pathology in ASD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in the aging population. Evidence implicates elevated soluble oligomeric Aβ as one of the primary triggers during the prodromic phase leading to AD, effected largely via hyperphosphorylation of the microtubule-associated protein tau. At low, physiological levels (pM-nM), however, oligomeric Aβ has been found to regulate synaptic plasticity as a neuromodulator. Through mutational analysis, we found a core hexapeptide sequence within the N-terminal domain of Aβ (N-Aβcore) accounting for its physiological activity, and subsequently found that the N-Aβcore peptide is neuroprotective. Here, we characterized the neuroprotective potential of the N-Aβcore against dysfunction of synaptic plasticity assessed in ex vivo hippocampal slices from 5xFAD APP/PS1 mice, specifically hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). The N-Aβcore was shown to reverse impairment in synaptic plasticity in hippocampal slices from 5xFAD APP/PS1 model mice, both for LTP and LTD. The reversal by the N-Aβcore correlated with alleviation of downregulation of hippocampal AMPA-type glutamate receptors in preparations from 5xFAD mice. The action of the N-Aβcore depended upon a critical di-histidine sequence and involved the phosphoinositide-3 (PI3) kinase pathway via mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin). Together, the present findings indicate that the non-toxic N-Aβcore hexapeptide is not only neuroprotective at the cellular level but is able to reverse synaptic dysfunction in AD-like models, specifically alterations in synaptic plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Neural interfacing devices using penetrating microelectrode arrays have emerged as an important tool in both neuroscience research and medical applications. These implantable microelectrode arrays enable communication between man-made devices and the nervous system by detecting and/or evoking neuronal activities. Recent years have seen rapid development of electrodes fabricated using flexible, ultrathin carbon-based microfibers. Compared to electrodes fabricated using rigid materials and larger cross-sections, these microfiber electrodes have been shown to reduce foreign body responses after implantation, with improved signal-to-noise ratio for neural recording and enhanced resolution for neural stimulation. Here, we review recent progress of carbon-based microfiber electrodes in terms of material composition and fabrication technology. The remaining challenges and future directions for development of these arrays will also be discussed. Overall, these microfiber electrodes are expected to improve the longevity and reliability of neural interfacing devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;In neurodegenerative diseases, neurodegeneration has been related to several mitochondrial dynamics imbalances such as excessive fragmentation of mitochondria, impaired mitophagy, and blocked mitochondria mitochondrial transport in axons. Mitochondria are dynamic organelles, and essential for energy conversion, neuron survival, and cell death. As mitochondrial dynamics have a significant influence on homeostasis, in this review, we mainly discuss the role of mitochondrial dynamics in several neurodegenerative diseases. There is evidence that several mitochondrial dynamics-associated proteins, as well as related pathways, have roles in the pathological process of neurodegenerative diseases with an impact on mitochondrial functions and metabolism. However, specific pathological mechanisms need to be better understood in order to propose new therapeutic strategies targeting mitochondrial dynamics that have shown promise in recent studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) are widely utilized for the semantic segmentation of dense nerve tissues from light and electron microscopy (EM) image data; the goal of this technique is to achieve efficient and accurate three-dimensional reconstruction of the vasculature and neural networks in the brain. The success of these tasks heavily depends on the amount, and especially the quality, of the human-annotated labels fed into DCNNs. However, it is often difficult to acquire the gold standard of human-annotated labels for dense nerve tissues; human annotations inevitably contain discrepancies or even errors, which substantially impact the performance of DCNNs. Thus, a novel boosting framework consisting of a DCNN for multilabel semantic segmentation with a customized Dice-logarithmic loss function, a fusion module combining the annotated labels and the corresponding predictions from the DCNN, and a boosting algorithm to sequentially update the sample weights during network training iterations was proposed to systematically improve the quality of the annotated labels; this framework eventually resulted in improved segmentation task performance. The microoptical sectioning tomography (MOST) dataset was then employed to assess the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The result indicated that the framework, even trained with a dataset including some poor-quality human-annotated labels, achieved state-of-the-art performance in the segmentation of somata and vessels in the mouse brain. Thus, the proposed technique of artificial intelligence could advance neuroscience research.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Purpose&lt;p&gt;This study aims to investigate the agreement of three software packages in measuring baseline ischemic core volume (ICV) and penumbra volume (PV), and determine their predictive values for unfavorable clinical outcome in patients with endovascular thrombectomy (EVT).&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Patients with acute ischemic stroke who underwent computed tomographic perfusion (CTP) were recruited. Baseline CTP measurements including ICV and PV were calculated by three software packages of IntelliSpace Portal (ISP), Rapid Processing of Perfusion and Diffusion (RAPID), and fast-processing of ischemic stroke (F-STROKE). All patients received EVT, and the modified Rankin scale (mRS) at 90 days after EVT was assessed to determine the clinical outcomes (favorable: mRS = 0–2; unfavorable: mRS = 3–6). The agreement of CTP measurements among three software packages was determined using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). The associations between CTP measurements and unfavorable clinical outcome were analyzed using logistic regression. Receiver operating characteristic curves were conducted to calculate the area under the curve (AUC) of CTP measurements in predicting unfavorable clinical outcome.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Of 223 recruited patients (68.2 ± 11.3 years old; 145 males), 17.0% had unfavorable clinical outcome after EVT. Excellent agreement between F-STROKE and RAPID was found in measuring ICV (ICC 0.965; 95% CI 0.956–0.973) and PV (ICC 0.966; 95% CI 0.956–0.973). ICVs measured by three software packages were significantly associated with unfavorable clinical outcome before (odds ratios 1.012–1.018, all P &amp;lt; 0.01) and after (odds ratios 1.003–1.014, all P &amp;lt; 0.05) adjusted for confounding factors (age, gender, TOAST classification, and NIHSS on admission). In predicting unfavorable clinical outcome, ICV measured by F-STROKE showed similar performance to that measured by RAPID (AUC 0.701 vs. 0.717) but higher performance than that measured by ISP (AUC 0.629).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusions&lt;p&gt;The software of F-STROKE has excellent agreement with the widely used analysis tool of RAPID in measuring ICV and PV. The ischemic core volume measured by both F-STROKE and RAPID is a stronger predictor for unfavorable clinical outcome after EVT compared to ISP.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Purpose&lt;p&gt;To evaluate the prevalence and treatment patterns of speech and language disorders in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;A retrospective analysis of data collected from 32% of the German population, insured by the statutory German health insurance (AOK, Local Health Care Funds). We used The International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th revision, German Modification (ICD-10 GM) codes for stuttering (F98.5), cluttering (F98.6), and developmental disorders of speech and language (F80) to identify prevalent and newly diagnosed cases each year. Prescription and speech therapy reimbursement data were used to evaluate treatment patterns.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;In 2017, 27,977 patients of all ages were diagnosed with stuttering (21,045 males, 75% and 6,932 females, 25%). Stuttering prevalence peaks at age 5 years (boys, 0.89% and girls, 0.40%). Cluttering was diagnosed in 1,800 patients of all ages (1,287 males, 71.5% and 513 females, 28.5%). Developmental disorders of speech and language were identified in 555,774 AOK-insurants (61.2% males and 38.8% females). Treatment data indicate a substantial proportion newly diagnosed stuttering individuals receive treatment (up to 45% of 6-year-old patients), with slightly fewer than 20 sessions per year, on average. We confirmed a previous study showing increased rates of atopic disorders and neurological and psychiatric comorbidities in individuals with stuttering, cluttering, and developmental disorders of speech and language.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;This is the first nationwide study using health insurance data to analyze the prevalence and newly diagnosed cases of a speech and language disorder. Prevalence and gender ratio data were consistent with the international literature. The crude prevalence of developmental disorders of speech and language increased from 2015 to 2018, whereas the crude prevalence for stuttering remained stable. For cluttering, the numbers were too low to draw reliable conclusions. Proportional treatment allocation for stuttering peaked at 6 years of age, which is the school entrance year, and is later than the prevalence peak of stuttering.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Purpose: The cognitive effects of total sleep deprivation (TSD) on the brain remain poorly understood. Electroencephalography (EEG) is a very useful tool for detecting spontaneous brain activity in the resting state. Quasi-stable electrical distributions, known as microstates, carry useful information about the dynamics of large-scale brain networks. In this study, microstate analysis was used to study changes in brain activity after 24 h of total sleep deprivation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants and Methods: Twenty-seven healthy volunteers were recruited and underwent EEG scans before and after 24 h of TSD. Microstate analysis was applied, and six microstate classes (A–F) were identified. Topographies and temporal parameters of the microstates were compared between the rested wakefulness (RW) and TSD conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Microstate class A (a right-anterior to left-posterior orientation of the mapped field) showed lower global explained variance (GEV), frequency of occurrence, and time coverage in TSD than RW, whereas microstate class D (a fronto-central extreme location of the mapped field) displayed higher GEV, frequency of occurrence, and time coverage in TSD compared to RW. Moreover, subjective sleepiness was significantly negatively correlated with the microstate parameters of class A and positively correlated with the microstate parameters of class D. Transition analysis revealed that class B exhibited a higher probability of transition than did classes D and F in TSD compared to RW.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: The observation suggests alterations of the dynamic brain-state properties of TSD in healthy young male subjects, which may serve as system-level neural underpinnings for cognitive declines in sleep-deprived subjects.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Experimental studies support the notion of spike-based neuronal information processing in the brain, with neural circuits exhibiting a wide range of temporally-based coding strategies to rapidly and efficiently represent sensory stimuli. Accordingly, it would be desirable to apply spike-based computation to tackling real-world challenges, and in particular transferring such theory to neuromorphic systems for low-power embedded applications. Motivated by this, we propose a new supervised learning method that can train multilayer spiking neural networks to solve classification problems based on a rapid, first-to-spike decoding strategy. The proposed learning rule supports multiple spikes fired by stochastic hidden neurons, and yet is stable by relying on first-spike responses generated by a deterministic output layer. In addition to this, we also explore several distinct, spike-based encoding strategies in order to form compact representations of presented input data. We demonstrate the classification performance of the learning rule as applied to several benchmark datasets, including MNIST. The learning rule is capable of generalizing from the data, and is successful even when used with constrained network architectures containing few input and hidden layer neurons. Furthermore, we highlight a novel encoding strategy, termed “scanline encoding,” that can transform image data into compact spatiotemporal patterns for subsequent network processing. Designing constrained, but optimized, network structures and performing input dimensionality reduction has strong implications for neuromorphic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Oligodendrocytes exert a profound influence on neural circuits by accelerating action potential conduction, altering excitability, and providing metabolic support. As oligodendrogenesis continues in the adult brain and is essential for myelin repair, uncovering the factors that control their dynamics is necessary to understand the consequences of adaptive myelination and develop new strategies to enhance remyelination in diseases such as multiple sclerosis. Unfortunately, few methods exist for analysis of oligodendrocyte dynamics, and even fewer are suitable for in vivo investigation. Here, we describe the development of a fully automated cell tracking pipeline using convolutional neural networks (Oligo-Track) that provides rapid volumetric segmentation and tracking of thousands of cells over weeks in vivo. This system reliably replicated human analysis, outperformed traditional analytic approaches, and extracted injury and repair dynamics at multiple cortical depths, establishing that oligodendrogenesis after cuprizone-mediated demyelination is suppressed in deeper cortical layers. Volumetric data provided by this analysis revealed that oligodendrocyte soma size progressively decreases after their generation, and declines further prior to death, providing a means to predict cell age and eventual cell death from individual time points. This new CNN-based analysis pipeline offers a rapid, robust method to quantitatively analyze oligodendrocyte dynamics in vivo, which will aid in understanding how changes in these myelinating cells influence circuit function and recovery from injury and disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Amyloid-based neurodegenerative diseases such as prion, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's diseases have distinct etiologies and clinical manifestations, but they share common pathological events. These diseases are caused by abnormally folded proteins (pathogenic prions PrP&lt;sup&gt;Sc&lt;/sup&gt; in prion diseases, β-amyloids/Aβ and Tau in Alzheimer's disease, α-synuclein in Parkinson's disease) that display β-sheet-enriched structures, propagate and accumulate in the nervous central system, and trigger neuronal death. In prion diseases, PrP&lt;sup&gt;Sc&lt;/sup&gt;-induced corruption of the physiological functions exerted by normal cellular prion proteins (PrP&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt;) present at the cell surface of neurons is at the root of neuronal death. For a decade, PrP&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt; emerges as a common cell surface receptor for other amyloids such as Aβ and α-synuclein, which relays, at least in part, their toxicity. In lipid-rafts of the plasma membrane, PrP&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt; exerts a signaling function and controls a set of effectors involved in neuronal homeostasis, among which are the RhoA-associated coiled-coil containing kinases (ROCKs). Here we review (i) how PrP&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt; controls ROCKs, (ii) how PrP&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt;-ROCK coupling contributes to neuronal homeostasis, and (iii) how the deregulation of the PrP&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt;-ROCK connection in amyloid-based neurodegenerative diseases triggers a loss of neuronal polarity, affects neurotransmitter-associated functions, contributes to the endoplasmic reticulum stress cascade, renders diseased neurons highly sensitive to neuroinflammation, and amplifies the production of neurotoxic amyloids.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;TDP-43 is a nuclear protein involved in pivotal processes, extensively studied for its implication in neurodegenerative disorders. TDP-43 cytosolic inclusions are a common neuropathologic hallmark in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and related diseases, and it is now established that TDP-43 misfolding and aggregation play a key role in their etiopathology. TDP-43 neurotoxic mechanisms are not yet clarified, but the identification of proteins able to modulate TDP-43-mediated damage may be promising therapeutic targets for TDP-43 proteinopathies. Here we show by the use of refined yeast models that the nucleolar protein nucleolin (NCL) acts as a potent suppressor of TDP-43 toxicity, restoring cell viability. We provide evidence that NCL co-expression is able to alleviate TDP-43-induced damage also in human cells, further supporting its beneficial effects in a more consistent pathophysiological context. Presented data suggest that NCL could promote TDP-43 nuclear retention, reducing the formation of toxic cytosolic TDP-43 inclusions.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The role of gut-brain axis in the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease (PD) have become a research hotspot, appropriate animal model to study gut-brain axis in PD is yet to be confirmed. Our study employed a classical PD mice model achieved by chronic MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) injection to study concurrent changes of dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain and the colon of mice. Our results showed such a PD model exhibited apparent locomotor deficits but not gastrointestinal dysfunction. Tyrosine hydroxylase expressions and dopamine content reduced greatly in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) or striatum, but increased in the colon of PD mice. Mechanism investigation indicated autophagy activity and apoptosis were stimulated in the SNpc, but inhibited in the colon of PD mice. Interplay of gut microbiota (GM) and autophagy in response to chronic MPTP injection led to GM dysbiosis and defective autophagy in mice colon. Meanwhile, fecal short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), acetate and propionate in particular, declined greatly in PD mice, which could be attributed to the decreased bacteria abundance of phylum Bacteroidetes, but increased abundance of phylum Firmicutes. GM dysbiosis derived fecal SCFAs might be one of the mediators of downregulated autophagy in the colon of PD mice. In conclusion, colonic dopaminergic neurons changed in the opposition direction with those in the midbrain via GM dysbiosis-mediated autophagy inhibition followed by suppressed apoptosis in response to chronic MPTP injection. Such a chronic PD mice model might not be an ideal model to study role of gut-brain axis in PD progression.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Background: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) impairs the ability to carry out daily activities, reduces independence and quality of life and increases caregiver burden. Our understanding of functional decline has traditionally relied on reports by family and caregivers, which are subjective and vulnerable to recall bias. The Internet of Things (IoT) and wearable sensor technologies promise to provide objective, affordable, and reliable means for monitoring and understanding function. However, human factors for its acceptance are relatively unexplored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: The Public Involvement (PI) activity presented in this paper aims to capture the preferences, priorities and concerns of people with AD and their caregivers for using monitoring wearables. Their feedback will drive device selection for clinical research, starting with the study of the RADAR-AD project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Method: The PI activity involved the Patient Advisory Board (PAB) of the RADAR-AD project, comprised of people with dementia across Europe and their caregivers (11 and 10, respectively). A set of four devices that optimally represent various combinations of aspects and features from the variety of currently available wearables (e.g., weight, size, comfort, battery life, screen types, water-resistance, and metrics) was presented and experienced hands-on. Afterwards, sets of cards were used to rate and rank devices and features and freely discuss preferences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Overall, the PAB was willing to accept and incorporate devices into their daily lives. For the presented devices, the aspects most important to them included comfort, convenience and affordability. For devices in general, the features they prioritized were appearance/style, battery life and water resistance, followed by price, having an emergency button and a screen with metrics. The metrics valuable to them included activity levels and heart rate, followed by respiration rate, sleep quality and distance. Some concerns were the potential complexity, forgetting to charge the device, the potential stigma and data privacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: The PI activity explored the preferences, priorities and concerns of the PAB, a group of people with dementia and caregivers across Europe, regarding devices for monitoring function and decline, after a hands-on experience and explanation. They highlighted some expected aspects, metrics and features (e.g., comfort and convenience), but also some less expected (e.g., screen with metrics).&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Older adults typically perform worse on spatial navigation tasks, although whether this is due to degradation of memory or an impairment in using specific strategies has yet to be determined. An issue with some past studies is that older adults are tested on desktop-based virtual reality: a technology many report lacking familiarity with. Even when controlling for familiarity, these paradigms reduce the information-rich, three-dimensional experience of navigating to a simple two-dimensional task that utilizes a mouse and keyboard (or joystick) as means for ambulation. Here, we utilize a wireless head-mounted display and free ambulation to create a fully immersive virtual Morris water maze in which we compare the navigation of older and younger adults. Older and younger adults learned the locations of hidden targets from same and different start points. Across different conditions tested, older adults remembered target locations less precisely compared to younger adults. Importantly, however, they performed comparably from the same viewpoint as a switched viewpoint, suggesting that they could generalize their memory for the location of a hidden target given a new point of view. When we implicitly moved one of the distal cues to determine whether older adults used an allocentric (multiple landmarks) or beaconing (single landmark) strategy to remember the hidden target, both older and younger adults showed comparable degrees of reliance on allocentric and beacon cues. These findings support the hypothesis that while older adults have less precise spatial memories, they maintain the ability to utilize various strategies when navigating.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Objectives: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and whether synthetic MRI can benefit diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Materials and Methods: Eighteen patients and eighteen age-matched normal controls (NCs) underwent MR examination. The mini-mental state examination (MMSE) scores were obtained from all patients. The whole brain volumetric characteristics, T1, T2, and proton density (PD) values of different cortical and subcortical regions were obtained. The volumetric characteristics and brain regional relaxation values between AD patients and NCs were compared using independent-samples t-test. The correlations between these quantitative parameters and MMSE score were assessed by the Pearson correlation in AD patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Although the larger volume of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), lower brain parenchymal volume (BPV), and the ratio of brain parenchymal volume to intracranial volume (BPV/ICV) were found in AD patients compared with NCs, there were no significant differences (p &amp;gt; 0.05). T1 values of right insula cortex and T2 values of left hippocampus and right insula cortex were significantly higher in AD patients than in NCs, but T1 values of left caudate showed a reverse trend (p &amp;lt; 0.05). As the MMSE score decreased in AD patients, the BPV and BPV/ICV decreased, while the volume of CSF and T1 values of bilateral insula cortex and bilateral hippocampus as well as T2 values of bilateral hippocampus increased (p &amp;lt; 0.05).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Synthetic MRI not only provides more information to differentiate AD patients from normal controls, but also reflects the disease severity of AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Objective: Olfactory impairment (OI) refers to decreased (hyposmia) or absent (anosmia) ability to smell. We sought to estimate the prevalence and correlates of OI among rural-dwelling Chinese older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: This population-based cross-sectional analysis included 4,514 participants (age ≥65 years; 56.7% women) from the Multidomain Interventions to Delay Dementia and Disability in Rural China (MIND-China). The 16-item Sniffin' Sticks identification test (SSIT) was used to assess olfactory function. Olfactory impairment was defined as the SSIT score ≤10, hyposmia as SSIT score of 8–10, and anosmia as SSIT score &amp;lt;8. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to examine factors associated with OI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The overall prevalence was 67.7% for OI, 35.3% for hyposmia, and 32.5% for anosmia. The prevalence increased with age for OI and anosmia, but not for hyposmia. The multivariable-adjusted odds ratio (OR) of OI was 2.10 (95% CI 1.69–2.61) for illiteracy and 1.41 (1.18–1.70) for elementary school (vs. middle school or above), 1.30 (1.01–1.67) for current smoking (vs. never smoking), 0.86 (0.74–0.99) for overweight and 0.73 (0.61–0.87) for obesity (vs. normal weight), 4.21 (2.23–7.94) for dementia, 1.68 (1.23–2.30) for head injury, and 1.44 (1.14–1.83) for sinonasal disease. Illiteracy in combination with either male sex or diabetes was significantly associated with an over two-fold increased OR of OI (p for interactions &amp;lt;0.05).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Olfactory impairment is highly prevalent that affects over two-thirds of rural-dwelling older adults in China. OI is correlated with illiteracy, current smoking, dementia, head injury, and sinonasal disease, but negatively associated with overweight or obesity. Olfactory impairment as a potential clinical marker of neurodegenerative disorders among older adults deserves further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Background and purpose&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The diagnostic value of non-contrast CT (NCCT) in acute stroke imaging remains indispensable, especially under emergency conditions with limited resources. The radiological conjugate eye deviation (RCED) has been demonstrated as a NCCT sign to predict acute ischemic stroke (AIS) or AIS secondary to large vessel occlusion (LVO) in recent studies. We performed a meta-analysis to gain a better understanding into the predictive role of RCED for AISs and LVO-AISs.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We conducted a systematic literature search using PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane. The search focused on studies published between January 2000 and August 2020 that reported the predictive value of RCED for the diagnosis of AIS or LVO-AIS. Principal measurements of the meta-analysis were the overall sensitivity, specificity, the positive likelihood ratio (PLR), and the negative likelihood ratio (NLR) of RCED in predicting AIS and LVO-AIS.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We included 11 studies (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 2304). For AIS, RCED had a sensitivity of 0.37 (95% CI 0.27–0.47), a specificity of 0.86 (95% CI 0.73–0.93), the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.58 (95% CI 0.53–0.62), PLR was 2.5 (95% CI 1.5–4.4), and NLR was 0.74 (95% CI 0.65–0.84). For LVO-AIS, RCED had a sensitivity of 0.63 (95% CI 0.46–0.77), a specificity of 0.77 (95% CI 0.71–0.82), AUC was 0.63 (95% CI 0.46–0.77), PLR was 2.7 (95% CI 1.7–4.3), and NLR was 0.49 (95% CI 0.3–0.78).&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;RCED can be used to predict LVO-AIS. It is expected that this method will be extensively used and validated in acute stroke imaging, especially under emergency conditions with limited resources.&lt;/p&gt;

 We are exquisitely sensitive to the microstructure and material properties of surfaces. In the peripheral nerves, two separate mechanisms convey texture information: coarse textural features are encoded in spatial patterns of activation that reflect their spatial layout and fine features are encoded in highly repeatable, texture specific temporal spiking patterns evoked as the skin moves across the surface. In the present study, we examined whether this temporal code is preserved in the responses of neurons in somatosensory cortex. To this end, we scanned a diverse set of everyday textures across the fingertip of awake macaques while recording the responses evoked in individual cortical neurons. We found that temporal spiking patterns are highly repeatable across multiple presentations of the same texture, with millisecond precision. As a result, texture identity can be reliably decoded from the temporal patterns themselves, even after information carried in the spike rates is eliminated. However, a neural code that combines rate and timing is more informative than either code in isolation. The temporal precision of the texture response is heterogenous across cortical neurons and depends on the submodality composition of their input and on their location along the somatosensory neuraxis. Furthermore, temporal spiking patterns in cortex dilate and contract with decreases and increases in scanning speed and this systematic relationship between speed and patterning may contribute to the observed perceptual invariance to speed. Finally, we find that the quality of a texture percept can be better predicted when these temporal patterns are taken into consideration. We conclude that high-precision spike timing complements rate-based signals to encode texture in somatosensory cortex.</content>

 Fly-by-feel describes how flying animals capture aerodynamic information via their wings' sensory system to implement or enhance flight control. Traditional studies on animal flight emphasized controlling body stability via visual or inertial sensory inputs. In line with this, it has been demonstrated that wing sensory systems can provide inertial state estimation for the body. What about the state estimation of the wings themselves? Little is known about how flying animals utilize their wing sensory systems to monitor the dynamic state of their highly deformable wings. This study is a step toward a comprehensive investigation of how a flying animal senses aerodynamic and aeroelastic features of the wings relevant to flight control. Odonates: dragonflies and damselflies, are a great model for this because they have excellent flight performance and their wing structure has been extensively studied. Here, we developed a strategy to map the entire sensory system of Odonata wings via confocal microscopy. The result is the first complete map of a flying animal's wing sensory system, including both the external sensor morphologies and internal neuroanatomy. This complete search revealed over 750 sensors on each wing for one of the smallest dragonfly species and roughly half for a comparable size damselfly. We found over eight morphological classes of sensors, most of which resembled mechanosensors. Most sensors were innervated by a single neuron with an innervation pattern consistent with minimising wiring length. We further mapped the major veins of 13 Odonate species across 10 families and identified consistent sensor distribution patterns, with sensor count scaling with wing length. To explain the strain sensor density distribution along the major veins, we constructed a high-fidelity finite element model of a dragonfly wing based on micro-CT data. This flapping wing model revealed dynamic strain fields and suggested how increasing sensor count could allow encoding of different wing states. Taken together, the Odonate wing sensory system is well-equipped to implement sophisticated fly-by-feel flight control.</content>

 Early in auditory processing, neural responses faithfully reflect acoustic input. At higher stages of auditory processing, however, neurons become selective for particular call types, eventually leading to specialized regions of cortex that preferentially process calls at the highest auditory processing stages. We previously proposed that an intermediate step in how non-selective responses are transformed into call-selective responses is the detection of informative call features. But how neural selectivity for informative call features emerges from non-selective inputs, whether feature selectivity gradually emerges over the processing hierarchy, and how stimulus information is represented in non-selective and feature-selective populations remain open questions. In this study, using unanesthetized guinea pigs, a highly vocal and social rodent, as an animal model, we characterized the neural representation of calls in three auditory processing stages: the thalamus (vMGB), and thalamorecipient (L4) and superficial layers (L2/3) of primary auditory cortex (A1). We found that neurons in vMGB and A1 L4 did not exhibit call-selective responses and responded throughout the call durations. However, A1 L2/3 neurons showed high call-selectivity with about a third of neurons responding to only one or two call types. These A1 L2/3 neurons only responded to restricted portions of calls suggesting that they were highly selective for call features. Receptive fields of these A1 L2/3 neurons showed complex spectrotemporal structures that could underlie their high call feature selectivity. Information theoretic analysis revealed that in A1 L4 stimulus information was distributed over the population and was spread out over the call durations. In contrast, in A1 L2/3, individual neurons showed brief bursts of high stimulus-specific information, and conveyed high levels of information per spike. These data demonstrate that a transformation in the neural representation of calls occurs between A1 L4 and A1 L2/3, leading to the emergence of a feature-based representation of calls in A1 L2/3. Our data thus suggest that observed cortical specializations for call processing emerge in A1, and set the stage for further mechanistic studies.</content>

 Patients with drug-resistant epilepsy can experience respiratory alterations notably during seizures. The mechanisms underlying this long-term alteration of respiratory function remain unclear. This study aimed at determining in rats whether epilepsy is associated with alterations of both the respiratory function and brainstem serotonin (5-HT) system. Epilepsy was triggered by pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus in rats. 30-50% of epileptic (EPI) rats exhibited sharp decrease of oxygen consumption (SDOC), low metabolic rate of oxygen and slow regular ventilation; these rats were called EPI/SDOC+ rats. These alterations were only detected in rats with chronic epilepsy, independent of behavioral seizures, persisted over the time, and were not associated with death. In these rats, 5-HT fiber density in the nucleus tractus solitarius was below that of control and EPI/SDOC- rats. Both EPI/SDOC+ rats and DBA/2 mice presenting with fatal respiratory arrest following an audiogenic-induced seizure, a model of sudden and expected death in epilepsy, had increased transcript levels of tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (p&amp;lt;0.001 for both strains) and 5-HT presynaptic transporter (rats: p=0.003; mice: p=0.001). Thus, our data support that 5-HT alterations are associated with chronic and acute epilepsy-related respiratory dysfunctions.</content>

 Mutations in the gene brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) cause obesity in humans. BDNF signaling and its expressing neurons in the hypothalamus help control feeding, energy expenditure (EE), and physical activity. However, whether the BDNF neurons interact with another EE-regulating system, the thermoregulation circuitry, remains unclear. Here, we show that BDNF neurons in the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH) are activated by environmental cooling and sufficient to induce body temperature increases and brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenesis. Conversely, blocking these neurons impairs BAT thermogenesis and cold defense, causing body weight gain and glucose intolerance. DMH BDNF neurons are therefore an important type of thermoregulatory neuron, integrating thermal afferent signals to control EE during cold defense. This reveals a critical intersection between the BDNF circuitry and the thermoregulatory system.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Background: Continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) is a powerful form of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation capable of suppressing cortical excitability for up to 50 minutes. A growing number of studies have applied cTBS to the visual cortex in human subjects to investigate the neural dynamics of visual processing, but few studies have specifically examined its effects on central vision, which has crucial implications for safety and inference on downstream cognitive effects. Objective: Assess the safety of offline, neuronavigated cTBS to V2 by examining its effects on central vision performance on a computerized stimulus detection task. Methods: In a single-blind, randomized sham-controlled, crossover study, 17 healthy adults received cTBS and sham to V2 two weeks apart. Their central vision ([≤]8{degrees}) was tested at 1-minute (T1) and again at 50-minutes (T50) post-stimulation. Effects of condition (cTBS vs. sham) and time (T1 vs. T50) on accuracy and reaction time were examined using Bayes factor. Results: Bayes factor results suggested that cTBS did not impair stimulus detection over the entire central visual field nor subfields at T1 or T50. Conclusions: Our results offer the first explicit evidence supporting that cTBS applied to V2 does not create blind spots in the central visual field in humans. Any subtler changes to vision and downstream visual perception should be investigated in future studies.</content>

 Japanese English learners have difficulty speaking Double Object (DO; give B A) than Prepositional Object (PO; give A to B) structures which neural underpinning is unknown. In speaking, syntactic and phonological processing follow semantic encoding, conversion of non-verbal mental representation into a structure suitable for expression. To test whether DO difficulty lies in linguistic or prelinguistic process, we conducted functional magnetic resonance imaging. Thirty participants described cartoons using DO or PO, or simply named them. Greater reaction times and error rates indicated DO difficulty. DO compared with PO showed parieto-frontal activation including left inferior frontal gyrus, reflecting linguistic process. Psychological priming in PO produced immediately after DO and vice versa compared to after control, indicated shared process between PO and DO. Cross-structural neural repetition suppression was observed in occipito-parietal regions, overlapping the linguistic system in pre-SMA. Thus DO and PO share prelinguistic process, whereas linguistic process imposes overload in DO.</content>

 Foraging, pursuit, and predation rapidly transition into behavioral quiescence during reward capture and consumption. While appetitive-consummatory dissociations are embedded at both psychological and neural levels, the mechanisms controlling switches or transitions between appetitive seeking and consummatory behaviors remain poorly understood. Here we identify the BLA[-&amp;gt;]AcbSh pathway as critical to these transitions by showing that this pathway inhibits the appetitive seeking response in the presence of consummatory demands. Using an appetitive cue-discrimination task in male rats, we show that reward delivery is a significant driver of seeking inhibition and that a BLA[-&amp;gt;]AcbSh pathway mediates this inhibition. This role in suppressing seeking responses during periods of consumption was not due to a general suppression of behavior because responding to other cues during the same test was unaffected. Moreover, it was specific to the BLA[-&amp;gt;]AcbSh pathway, because the contribution of the BLA[-&amp;gt;]AcbC pathway to appetitive switching was distinct and modest. State-dependent silencing of BLA[-&amp;gt;]AcbSh revealed that the modulation of seeking before and after reward delivery are co-dependent. Finally, we found that BLA terminals in AcbSh have functional connectivity to LH-projecting AcbSh neurons, thereby identifying a BLA[-&amp;gt;]AcbSh[-&amp;gt;]LH pathway as a putative route for the rapid regulation of appetitive behaviors. Taken together, these findings suggest that the BLA[-&amp;gt;]AcbSh pathway is a core component of an appetitive switching system, recruited under conditions requiring rapid or dynamic shifts in appetitive behavior, and that this pathway enables these shifts by actively inhibiting seeking.</content>

 We explore the utility of an on-demand multimodal conversational platform in extracting speech and facial metrics in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). We investigate the extent to which these metrics correlate with objective clinical measures, particularly as they pertain to the interplay between the affective, phonatory and motoric subsystems. 22 participants diagnosed with ASD engaged with a virtual agent in conversational affect production tasks designed to elicit facial and vocal affect. We found significant correlations between vocal pitch and loudness extracted by our platform during these tasks and accuracy in recognition of facial and vocal affect, assessed via the Diagnostic Analysis of Nonverbal Accuracy-2 (DANVA-2) neuropsychological task. We also found significant correlations between jaw kinematic metrics extracted using our platform and motor speed of the dominant hand assessed via a standardised neuropsychological finger tapping task. These findings offer preliminary evidence for the usefulness of these audiovisual analytic metrics and could help us better model the interplay between different physiological subsystems in individuals with ASD.</content>

 Recent studies suggest that transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) can be performed during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The novel approach of using concurrent tES-fMRI to modulate and measure targeted brain activity/connectivity may provide unique insights into the causal interactions between the brain neural responses and psychiatric/neurologic signs and symptoms, and importantly, guide the development of new treatments. However, tES stimulation parameters to optimally influence the underlying brain activity in health and disorder may vary with respect to phase, frequency, intensity, and electrode's montage. Here, we delineate how a closed-loop tES-fMRI study of frontoparietal network modulation can be designed and performed. We also discuss the challenges of running a concurrent tES-fMRI, describing how we can distinguish clinically meaningful physiological changes caused by tES from tES-related artifacts. There is a large methodological parameter space including electrode types, electrolytes, electrode montages, concurrent tES-fMRI hardware, online fMRI processing pipelines and closed-loop optimization algorithms that should be carefully selected for closed-loop tES-fMRI brain modulation. We also provide technical details on how safety and quality of tES-fMRI settings can be tested, and how these settings can be monitored during the study to ensure they do not exceed safety standards. The initial results of feasibility and applicability of closed-loop tES-fMRI are reported and potential hypotheses for the outcomes are discussed.</content>

 Purpose: To explore the effect of joint hypermobility on acuity, and plasticity, of hand proprioception. Materials and Methods: We compared proprioceptive acuity between EDS patients and controls. We then measured any changes in their estimate of hand position after participants adapted their reaches in response to altered visual feedback of their hand. The Beighton Scale was used to quantify the magnitude of joint hypermobility. Results: There were no differences between the groups in the accuracy of estimates of hand location, nor in the visually-induced changes in hand location. However, EDS patients' estimates were less precise when based purely on proprioception and could be moderately predicted by Beighton score. Conclusions: EDS patients are less precise at estimating their hand's location when only afferent information is available, but the presence of efferent signalling may reduce this imprecision. Those who are more hypermobile are more likely to be imprecise. This deficit likely has peripheral origins since we found no differences in the extent of sensorimotor plasticity.</content>

 In this study we report on a field test where we asked if it is feasible to deliver a scalable, commercial-grade solution for brain-based authentication currently given available head wearables. Sixty-two (62) participants living across the United States in autumn 2020 completed four (4) at-home sessions over a single (1) week. In each session there were six (6) authentication events consisting of rapid presentation of images (10Hz) that participants watched for 10 seconds while recording their brain signal with an off-the-shelf brain signal measuring headband. The non-stationary nature of the brain signal, and the fact that the signal results from a superposition of hundreds of simultaneous processes in the brain that respond to context makes the data unique in time, unrepeatable, and unpredictable. Even when a participant watched identical stimuli, we find no two periods of time to be alike (Fig. 4B) and furthermore, no two combinations of time periods are alike. Differences within people (intra-) and across people (inter- participant) from session to session were found to be significant, however stable processes do appear to be underlying the signal complexity and non-stationarity. We show a simplified brain-based authentication system that captures distinguishable information with reliable, commercial-grade performance from participants at their own homes. We conclude that noninvasively measured brain signals are an ideal candidate for biometric authentication, especially for head wearables such as headphones and AR/VR devices.</content>

 Neurons cooperate and interact with one another to generate behavior. While individual neurons and their ensembles are often probed in isolation, very little is known about their relationships on a global scale. Here, we define six groups of neurons with interactions that encode and process food stimulus responses in Caenorhabditis elegans. Using brain-wide calcium imaging in restrained animals, we categorized active neurons into either: sensory (On or Off) or motor (forward, backward, dorsal or ventral turn) neuron groups. Next, we show that stimulus onset rapidly shifts activity from backward to forward motor neuron groups, while prolonged stimulus removal is required to initiate converse activity. Finally, we use a gated multinomial logistic regression model to understand how stimulus processing depends on network state. This study shows how neural activity is coordinated across a network to generate global dynamics that drive behavior.</content>

 The pupil dilates and re-constricts following task events. It is popular to model this task-evoked pupil response as a linear transformation of event-locked impulses, the amplitudes of which are used as estimates of arousal. We show that this model is incorrect, and we propose an alternative model based on the physiological finding that a common neural input drives saccades and pupil size. The estimates of arousal from our model agreed with key predictions: arousal scaled with task difficulty and behavioral performance but was invariant to trial duration. Moreover, the model offers a unified explanation for a wide range of phenomena: entrainment of pupil size and saccade occurrence to task timing, modulation of pupil response amplitude and noise with task difficulty, reaction-time dependent modulation of pupil response timing and amplitude, a constrictory pupil response time-locked to saccades, and task-dependent distortion of this saccade-locked pupil response.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Default Mode Network (DMN) has been called a &quot;task-negative&quot; network which deactivates during engaging extrinsic tasks. But the behavior is more nuanced. We analyse the DMN during three different tasks (visual, affect and language; n=54) and find inter trial variability which gets amiss when analysed using General Linear Model (GLM). The region also shows significant across subjects variations which limits the use of Inter Subject Correlation (ISC) method to detect correlated deactivations during the task. We introduce Temporal Synchronization Analysis (TSA), a family of methods that can help detect inter-trial (IT-TSA) and inter-subject (IS-TSA) synchronization across the brain. We find that DMN is weakly synchronized across trials and subjects, challenging the notion of task negative behavior. Our study suggests the role of DMN as an active component associated with self-referential, autobiographical processes which are deactivated differentially and non linearly across trials and subjects in the presence of extrinsic processes.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Switching between motor tasks requires accurate adjustments for changes in dynamics (grasping a cup) or sensorimotor transformations (moving a computer mouse). Dual-adaptation studies have investigated how learning of context-dependent dynamics or transformations is enabled by sensory cues. However, certain cues, such as color, have shown mixed results. We propose that these mixed results may arise from two major classes of cues: &quot;direct&quot; cues, which are part of the dynamic state and &quot;indirect&quot; cues, which are not. We hypothesized that explicit strategies would primarily account for adaptation for an indirect color cue but would be limited to simple tasks while a direct visual separation cue would allow implicit adaptation regardless of task complexity. To test this idea, we investigated the relative contribution of implicit and explicit learning in relation to contextual cue type (colored or visually shifted workspace) and task complexity (one or eight targets) in a dual-adaptation task. We found that the visual workspace location cue enabled adaptation across conditions primarily through implicit adaptation. In contrast, we found that the color cue was largely ineffective for dual adaptation, except in a small subset of participants who appeared to use explicit strategies. Our study suggests that the previously inconclusive role of color cues in dual-adaptation may be explained by differential contribution of explicit strategies across conditions.</content>

 The resurgent component of the voltage-gated sodium current (INaR) is a depolarizing conductance, revealed on membrane hyperpolarizations following brief depolarizing voltage steps, which has been shown to contribute to regulating the firing properties of numerous neuronal cell types throughout the central and peripheral nervous systems. Although mediated by the same voltage-gated sodium (Nav) channels that underlie the transient and persistent Nav current components, the gating mechanisms that contribute to the generation of INaR remain unclear. Here, we characterized Nav currents in mouse cerebellar Purkinje neurons, and used tailored voltage-clamp protocols to define how the voltage and the duration of the initial membrane depolarization affect the amplitudes and kinetics of INaR. Using the acquired voltage-clamp data, we developed a novel Markov kinetic state model with parallel (fast and slow) inactivation pathways and, we show that this model reproduces the properties of the resurgent, as well as the transient and persistent, Nav currents recorded in (mouse) cerebellar Purkinje neurons. Based on the acquired experimental data and the simulations, we propose that resurgent Na+ influx occurs as a result of fast inactivating Nav channels transitioning into an open/conducting state on membrane hyperpolarization, and that the decay of INaR reflects the slow accumulation of recovered/opened Nav channels into a second, alternative and more slowly populated, inactivated state. Additional simulations reveal that extrinsic factors that affect the kinetics of fast or slow Nav channel inactivation and/or impact the relative distribution of Nav channels in the fast- and slow-inactivated states, such as the accessory Nav{beta}4 channel subunit, can modulate the amplitude of INaR.</content>

                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Voluntary rapid eye movements (saccades) redirect the fovea toward objects of visual interest. The saccadic system can be considered as a dual-mode system: in one mode the eye is fixating, in the other it is making a saccade. In this review, we consider two examples of dysfunctional saccades, interrupted saccades in late-onset Tay-Sachs disease and gaze-position dependent opsoclonus after concussion, which fail to properly shift between fixation and saccade modes. Insights and benefits gained from bi-directional collaborative exchange between clinical and basic scientists are emphasized. In the case of interrupted saccades, existing mathematical models were sufficiently detailed to provide support for the cause of interrupted saccades. In the case of gaze-position dependent opsoclonus, existing models could not explain the behavior, but further development provided a reasonable hypothesis for the mechanism underlying the behavior. Collaboration between clinical and basic science is a rich source of progress for developing biologically plausible models and understanding neurological disease. Approaching a clinical problem with a specific hypothesis (model) in mind often prompts new experimental tests and provides insights into basic mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Neuroblastoma (NB) is one of the most common extracranial solid tumors in children. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been shown to be involved in the development of NB. However, the function of circ_0132817 in NB is currently unclear. In this paper, the levels of circ_0132817 and NOL4L were induced in NB tissues and cells, and miR-432-5p expression was on the contrary. MiR-432-5p was verified as a target of circ_0132817 and miR-432-5p could bind to NOL4L. The inhibitory effects of miR-432-5p overexpression on cell proliferation, migration, invasion and glycolysis could be reversed by circ_0132817 facilitation. The suppression of NOL4L knockdown on NB cells progression could be rescued by miR-432-5p inhibition. Besides, knockdown of circ_0132817 repressed tumor growth in vivo. Thus, we came to a conclusion that circ_0132817 promoted the tumorigenesis of NB cells by up-regulating NOL4L and acting as a sponge for miR-432-5p.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 What gives rise to the human sense of confidence? Here, we tested the Bayesian hypothesis that confidence is based on a probability distribution represented in neural population activity. We implemented several computational models of confidence, and tested their predictions using psychophysics and fMRI. Using a generative model-based fMRI decoding approach, we extracted probability distributions from neural population activity in human visual cortex. We found that subjective confidence tracks the shape of the decoded distribution. That is, when sensory evidence was more precise, as indicated by the decoded distribution, observers reported higher levels of confidence. We furthermore found that neural activity in the insula, anterior cingulate, and prefrontal cortex was linked to both the shape of the decoded distribution and reported confidence, in ways consistent with the Bayesian model. Altogether, our findings support recent statistical theories of confidence and suggest that probabilistic information guides the computation of one's sense of confidence.</content>

 Background: The brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has been implicated in processes essential for neuroplasticity. Learning and serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) foster neuronal reorganization, a mechanism potentially related to BDNF. This study aims to assess the effects of associative learning and escitalopram on serum BDNF (sBDNF) levels, to gain further knowledge on their dynamic interplay. Methods: For three weeks, 37 participants performed one of two associative learning paradigms with either emotional or semantic content daily. During a subsequent three-week period of reversal learning, subjects either received escitalopram (10mg per day) or placebo. Before and after each learning period sBDNF values were assessed. Citalopram plasma levels were measured at the last time point. Linear mixed effects models (LME) and partial Spearman's rank and Pearson correlations were used for statistical analyses. Results: One-way LME resulted in a significant effect of time during the first learning period over both groups (p&amp;lt;0.01). Two-way LME revealed a significant interaction effect of the emotional content learning group and time (p=0.02). Three-way LME (time x reversal learning group x substance) showed no significant effects (all p&amp;gt; 0.05). Furthermore, correlation between citalopram and sBDNF level after three weeks of escitalopram administration exhibit a negative trend (partial Pearson correlation: r=-0.30, p=0.05; partial Spearman's rank: r=-0.22, p=0.15). Conclusion: The results suggest that three weeks of associative emotional content learning affect sBDNF levels, while subsequently assessed citalopram plasma and sBDNF levels tend to correlate negatively.</content>

 Intergenerational stress increases lifetime susceptibility to depression and other psychiatric disorders. Whether intergenerational stress transmission is a consequence of in utero neurodevelopmental disruptions vs early-life mother-infant interaction is largely unknown. Here, we demonstrated that exposure to traumatic stress in mice during pregnancy, through predator scent exposure, induces in the offspring social deficits and depressive-like behavior. We found, through cross-fostering experiments, that raising of normal pups by traumatized mothers produced a similar behavioral phenotype to that induced in pups raised by their biological traumatized mothers. Good caregiving (by non-traumatized mothers), however, did not completely protect against the prenatal trauma- induced behavioral deficits. These findings support a two-hit stress mechanism of both in utero and early-life parenting (poor caregiving by the traumatized mothers) environments. Associated with the behavioral deficits, we found profound changes in brain metabolomics and transcriptomic (metabotranscriptome). Striking increases in the mitochondrial hypoxia marker and epigenetic modifier 2-hydroxyglutaric acid, in the brains of neonatal and adult pups whose mothers were exposed to stress during pregnancy, indicated mitochondrial metabolism dysfunctions and epigenetic mechanisms. Bioinformatic analyses revealed mechanisms involving stress- and hypoxia-response metabolic pathways in the brains of the neonatal mice, which appear to lead to long-lasting alterations in mitochondrial- energy metabolism, and epigenetic processes pertaining to DNA and chromatin modifications. Most strikingly, we demonstrated that an early pharmacological intervention that can correct mitochondria metabolism - lipid metabolism and epigenetic modifications with acetyl-L-carnitine (ALCAR) supplementation - produces long-lasting protection against the behavioral deficits associated with intergenerational transmission of traumatic stress.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Despite the importance of face perception in human and computer vision, no quantitative model of perceived face dissimilarity exists. We designed an efficient behavioural task to collect dissimilarity and same/different identity judgements for 232 pairs of realistic faces that densely sampled geometric relationships in a face space derived from principal components of 3D shape and texture (Basel Face Model, BFM). In a comparison of 15 models, we found that representational distances in deep neural networks (DNNs) and Euclidean distances within BFM space predicted human judgements best. A face-trained DNN explained unique variance over simpler models and was statistically indistinguishable from the noise ceiling. Sigmoidal transformation of distances improved performance for all models. Identity judgements were better predicted by Euclidean than angular or radial distances in BFM space. DNNs provide the best available image-computable models of perceived face dissimilarity. The success of BFM space suggests that human face perception is attuned to the natural distribution of faces.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Huntington disease (HD) is a fatal neurodegenerative movement disorder caused by an expanded CAG repeat in the huntingtin gene (HTT). The mutant huntingtin protein is ubiquitously expressed, but only certain brain regions are affected. The hypothalamus has emerged as an important area of pathology with selective loss of neurons expressing the neuropeptides orexin (hypocretin), oxytocin and vasopressin in human postmortem HD tissue. Hypothalamic changes in HD may have implications for early disease manifestations affecting the regulation of sleep, emotions and metabolism. The underlying mechanisms of selective vulnerability of certain neurons in HD are not fully understood, but excitotoxicity has been proposed to play a role. Further understanding of mechanisms rendering neurons sensitive to mutant huntingtin may reveal novel targets for therapeutic interventions. In the present study, we wanted to examine whether transgenic HD mice display altered sensitivity to excitotoxicity in the hypothalamus. We first assessed effects of hypothalamic injections of the excitotoxin quinolinic acid (QA) into wild-type (WT) mice. We show that neuronal populations expressing melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) and cocaine and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) display a dose-dependent sensitivity to QA. In contrast, neuronal populations expressing orexin, oxytocin, vasopressin as well as tyrosine hydroxylase in the A13 area are resistant to QA-induced toxicity. We demonstrate that the R6/2 transgenic mouse model expressing a short fragment of mutant HTT displays hypothalamic neuropathology with discrete loss of the neuronal populations expressing orexin, MCH, CART, and orexin at 12 weeks of age. The BACHD mouse model expressing full-length mutant HTT does not display any hypothalamic neuropathology at 2 months of age. There was no effect of hypothalamic injections of QA on the neuronal populations expressing orexin, MCH, CART or oxytocin in neither HD mouse model. In conclusion, we find no support for a role of excitotoxicity in the loss of hypothalamic neuronal populations in HD.</content>

 Sleep has been proposed to facilitate inference, insight, and innovative problem-solving. However, it remains unclear how and when the subconscious brain can create novel ideas. Here, we show that cortical offline, but not online, activity is essential for inference evolution and that activity during rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep is sufficient to inspire inference from inadequate knowledge. In a transitive inference paradigm, mice gained the inference one day, but not shortly, after complete training. Inhibiting the neuronal computations in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) during post-learning sleep, but not during wakefulness, disrupted the inference without affecting the original memories. Furthermore, after insufficient learning, artificial activation of medial entorhinal cortex-ACC dialogue during only REM sleep created inferential knowledge. These findings establish causal evidence for the necessity and sufficiency of REM sleep in reorganizing existing knowledge to achieve novel inference, thereby highlighting the power of the idling brain in creativity and cognitive flexibility.</content>

 Top-down attention is a dynamic cognitive process that facilitates the detection of the task-relevant stimuli from our complex sensory environment. A neural mechanism capable of deployment under specific task-demand conditions would be crucial to efficiently control attentional processes and improve goal-directed attention performance in task demand-dependent manner. Previous studies have shown that frontal top-down neurons projecting from anterior cingulate area (ACA) to the visual cortex (VIS; ACAVIS) are required for attentional behavior during the 5-choice serial reaction time task (5CSRTT) in mice. However, it is unknown whether the contribution of this projecting neurons is dependent on the extent of task demand. Here, we examine the differential contribution of ACAVIS projection neurons to the attentional behavior in adult male mice performing two visual attention tasks of varying task demand: the 5CSRTT and 2-choice serial reaction time task (2CSRTT). We found that optogenetic suppression ACAVIS projections immediately before stimulus presentation has no effect during the 2CSRTT in contrast to the impaired performance during the 5CSRTT. Fiber photometry calcium imaging of ACAVIS neuron activity revealed that these neurons, which are recruited after errors during 5CSRTT, are not recruited during 2CSRTT. These results suggest that ACAVIS projections are necessary only when task demand is high and that ACAVIS neuron activity may not provide an error monitoring signal when task demand is low. Collectively, this frontal-sensory ACAVIS projection regulates visual attention behavior during specific high task demand conditions, pointing to a flexible circuit-based mechanism for promoting attentional behavior.</content>

 The vertebrate brain consists of diverse neuronal types, classified by distinct anatomy and function, along with divergent transcriptomes and proteomes. Defining the cell type-specific neuroproteome is important for understanding the development and functional organization of neural circuits. This task remains challenging in complex tissue, due to suboptimal protein isolation techniques that often result in loss of cell-type specific information and incomplete capture of subcellular compartments. Here, we develop a genetically targeted proximity labeling approach to identify cell-type specific subcellular proteome in the mouse brain. Using adeno- associated viral transduction, we express subcellular-localized APEX2 to map the proteome of the nucleus, cytosol, and cell membrane of Drd1 receptor-positive striatal neurons. We show that each APEX2 construct can differentially and rapidly biotinylate proteins in situ across various subcellular compartments, confirmed by imaging, electron microscopy, and mass spectrometry. This method enables flexible, cell-type specific quantitative profiling of subcellular proteome in the mouse brain.</content>

 Visual information is transmitted from the eye to the brain along the optic nerve, a structure composed of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons. The optic nerve is highly vulnerable to damage in neurodegenerative diseases like glaucoma and there are currently no FDA-approved drugs or therapies to protect RGCs from death. Zebrafish possess remarkable neuroprotective and regenerative abilities and here, utilizing an optic nerve transection (ONT) injury and an RNA-seq-based approach, we identify genes and pathways active in RGCs that may modulate their survival. Through pharmacological perturbation, we demonstrate that JAK/STAT pathway activity is required for RGC survival after ONT. Furthermore, we show that immune responses directly contribute to RGC death after ONT; macrophages/microglia are recruited to the retina and blocking neuroinflammation or depleting these cells after ONT rescues survival of RGCs. Taken together, our results support a model in which pro-survival signals in RGCs, mediated by JAK/STAT signaling, counteract the activity of innate immune responses to modulate RGC vulnerability and resilience in the zebrafish retina after severe optic nerve damage.</content>

 Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) regulates hippocampal plasticity, learning, and memory. While circulating, liver-derived IGF1 is known to play an essential role in hippocampal function and plasticity, IGF1 is also synthesized in multiple brain regions, including the hippocampus. However, little is known about the role of hippocampus-derived IGF1 in synaptic plasticity, the type of cells that may provide relevant IGF1, and the spatiotemporal dynamics of IGF1 signaling. Here, using a new FRET sensor for IGF1 signaling, we show that IGF1 in the hippocampus is primarily synthesized in CA1 pyramidal neurons and released in an activity-dependent manner in mice. The local IGF1 release from dendritic spines triggers local autocrine IGF1 receptor activation on the same spine, regulating structural and electrophysiological plasticity of the activated spine. Thus, our study demonstrates a novel mechanism underlying synaptic plasticity by the synthesis and autocrine signaling of IGF1 specific to CA1 pyramidal neurons.</content>

 Perceptual confidence is an evaluation of the validity of perceptual decisions. While there is behavioural evidence that confidence evaluation differs from perceptual decision-making, disentangling these two processes remains a challenge at the neural level. Here we examined the electrical brain activity of human participants in a protracted perceptual decision-making task where observers tend to commit to perceptual decisions early whilst continuing to monitor sensory evidence for evaluating confidence. Premature decision commitments were revealed by patterns of spectral power overlying motor cortex, followed by an attenuation of the neural representation of perceptual decision evidence. A distinct neural representation was associated with suboptimalities affecting confidence reports, with sources localised in the superior parietal and orbitofrontal cortices. In agreement with a dissociation between perception and confidence, these neural resources were recruited even after observers committed to their perceptual decisions, and thus delineate an integral neural circuit for the computation of confidence.</content>

 When we observe another persons actions, we process many kinds of information - from how their body moves to the intention behind their movements. What kinds of information underlie our intuitive understanding about how similar actions are to each other? To address this question, we measured the intuitive similarities among a large set of everyday action videos using multi-arrangement experiments, then used a modeling approach to predict this intuitive similarity space along three hypothesized properties. We found that similarity in the actors inferred goals predicted the intuitive similarity judgments the best, followed by similarity in the actors movements, with little contribution from the videos visual appearance. In opportunistic fMRI analyses assessing brain-behavior correlations, we found evidence for an action processing hierarchy, in which these three kinds of action similarities are reflected in the structure of brain responses along a posterior-to-anterior gradient on the lateral surface of the visual cortex. Altogether, this work joins existing literature suggesting that humans are naturally tuned to process others intentions, and that the visuo-motor cortex computes the perceptual precursors of the higher-level representations over which intuitive action perception operates.</content>

		<content type="html">
 BackgroundNeuroimaging studies have consistently reported that stress-related disorders such as depression and anxiety impinge on the activity of emotion regulation networks, namely in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). This circuitry is known to be extensively modulated by serotonin and it has been long shown that genetic polymorphisms in the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4) are linked to anxiety and depression. vmPFC encompasses different brain regions in terms of cytoarchitecture, activity and connectivity. However, molecular heterogeneity, including microRNAs, within the vmPFC and how these differences affect emotion regulation and behavior have not been elucidated.

MethodsHere, we took advantage of recently described polymorphisms in marmoset SLC6A4 gene linked to altered threat responses. Using FACS-sorted cells from different brain regions of genotyped marmosets, we tested the hypothesis that specific molecular changes in the form of microRNAs in precise regions of the vmPFC underlie these behavioral differences.

ResultsWe showed that microRNA profiling is a good means to assess molecular heterogeneity across cell subsets (NeuN+ versus NeuN- cells) or cortical regions (visual cortex versus vmPFC) in the primate cortex. More importantly, we provided evidence that marmosets bearing different SLC6A4 polymorphisms exhibit distinct miRNAs signatures specifically in vmPFC area 32 neurons, but not in the closely related vmPFC area 25 neurons. Finally, levels of these miRNAs were highly correlated to an anxiety-like score in a test of uncertain threat.

 There is an accumulating volume of research into neurological manifestations of COVID‐19. However, inconsistent study designs, inadequate controls, poorly‐validated tests, and differing settings, interventions, and cultural norms weaken study quality, comparability, and thus the understanding of the spectrum, burden and pathophysiology of these complications. Therefore, a global COVID‐19 Neuro Research Coalition, together with the WHO, has reviewed reports of COVID‐19 neurological complications and harmonised clinical measures for future research. This will facilitate well‐designed studies using precise, consistent case definitions of SARS‐CoV2 infection and neurological complications, with standardised forms for pooled data analyses that non‐specialists can use, including in low‐income settings.

 Abstract
Pattern separation, the ability to differentiate new information from previously experienced similar information, is highly sensitive to hippocampal structure and function and declines with age. Functional MRI studies have demonstrated hippocampal hyperactivation in older adults compared to young, with greater task‐related activation associated with worse pattern separation performance. The current study was designed to determine whether pattern separation was sensitive to differences in task‐free hippocampal cerebral blood flow (CBF) in 130 functionally intact older adults. Given prior evidence that apolipoprotein E e4 (APOE e4) status moderates the relationship between CBF and episodic memory, we predicted a stronger negative relationship between hippocampal CBF and pattern separation in APOE e4 carriers. An interaction between APOE group and right hippocampal CBF was present, such that greater right hippocampal CBF was related to better lure discrimination in noncarriers, whereas the effect reversed directionality in e4 carriers. These findings suggest that neurovascular changes in the medial temporal lobe may underlie memory deficits in cognitively normal older adults who are APOE e4 carriers.</content>

 Abstract
Research has reported that repeatedly retrieving a novel or imagined event representation reduces activity within brain regions critical for constructing mental scenarios, namely the anterior hippocampus and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). The primary aim of this investigation was to test if this pattern reported for imagined events would be found when repeatedly recollecting autobiographical memories. Twenty‐four participants retrieved 12 pre‐selected autobiographical memories four times while undergoing an fMRI scan. We used a region of interest approach to investigate how the anterior and posterior hippocampus as well as cortical regions critical for memory retrieval—the vmPFC and the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)—are affected by repeated retrievals. This analysis revealed an effect in the bilateral anterior hippocampi and vmPFC, but not the posterior hippocampus nor the PCC, with activity decreasing in these regions as a function of repeated retrievals. A multivariate analytic approach (Partial Least Squares) was used to assess whole‐brain patterns of neural activity associated with repeated retrievals. This analysis revealed one pattern of neural activity associated with the initial retrieval of a memory (e.g., inferior frontal and temporal lobe regions) and a separate pattern of activity associated with later retrievals that was distributed primarily across the lateral parietal cortices. These findings suggest that the anterior hippocampus and the vmPFC support the episodic construction of an autobiographical memory the first time it is retrieved and that alternate nonconstructive processes support its subsequent retrieval shortly thereafter.</content>

		<link href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26068?af=R"/>
		<id>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/10.1002/ana.26068</id>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 Objective
Lennox–Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is an epileptic encephalopathy frequently associated with multiple types of seizures. The classical Na+ channel inhibitors are in general ineffective against the seizures in LGS. Rufinamide is a new Na+ channel inhibitor, but approved for the treatment of LGS. This is not consistent with a choice of antiseizure drugs (ASDs) according to simplistic categorical grouping.


Methods
The effect of rufinamide on the Na+ channel, cellular discharges, and seizure behaviors was quantitatively characterized in native neurons and mammalian models of epilepsy, and compared with the other Na+ channel inhibitors.


Results
With a much faster binding rate to the inactivated Na+ channel than phenytoin, rufinamide is distinctively effective if the seizure discharges chiefly involve short bursts interspersed with hyperpolarized interburst intervals, exemplified by spike and wave discharges (SWDs) on electroencephalograms. Consistently, rufinamide, but not phenytoin, suppresses SWD‐associated seizures in pentylenetetrazol or AY‐9944 models, which recapitulate the major electrophysiological and behavioral manifestations in typical and atypical absence seizures, including LGS.


Interpretation
Na+ channel inhibitors shall have sufficiently fast binding to exert an action during the short bursts and then suppress SWDs, in which cases rufinamide is superior. For the epileptiform discharges where the interburst intervals are not so hyperpolarized, phenytoin could be better because of the higher affinity. Na+ channel inhibitors with different binding kinetics and affinity to the inactivated channels may have different antiseizure scope. A rational choice of ASDs according to in‐depth molecular pharmacology and the attributes of ictal discharges is advisable. ANN NEUROL 2021</content>

The interplay between nutrient-induced signaling and metabolism plays an important role in maintaining homeostasis and its malfunction has been implicated in many different human diseases such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, cancer, and neurological disorders. Therefore, unraveling the role of nutrients as signaling molecules and metabolites together with their interconnectivity may provide a deeper understanding of how these conditions occur. Both signaling and metabolism have been extensively studied using various systems biology approaches. However, they are mainly studied individually and in addition, current models lack both the complexity of the dynamics and the effects of the crosstalk in the signaling system. To gain a better understanding of the interconnectivity between nutrient signaling and metabolism in yeast cells, we developed a hybrid model, combining a Boolean module, describing the main pathways of glucose and nitrogen signaling, and an enzyme-constrained model accounting for the central carbon metabolism of &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt;, using a regulatory network as a link. The resulting hybrid model was able to capture a diverse utalization of isoenzymes and to our knowledge outperforms constraint-based models in the prediction of individual enzymes for both respiratory and mixed metabolism. The model showed that during fermentation, enzyme utilization has a major contribution in governing protein allocation, while in low glucose conditions robustness and control are prioritized. In addition, the model was capable of reproducing the regulatory effects that are associated with the Crabtree effect and glucose repression, as well as regulatory effects associated with lifespan increase during caloric restriction. Overall, we show that our hybrid model provides a comprehensive framework for the study of the non-trivial effects of the interplay between signaling and metabolism, suggesting connections between the Snf1 signaling pathways and processes that have been related to chronological lifespan of yeast cells.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/_Dbq8MMfdOM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

The COVID-19 pandemic is posing an unprecedented threat to the whole world. In this regard, it is absolutely imperative to understand the mechanism of metabolic reprogramming of host human cells by SARS-CoV-2. A better understanding of the metabolic alterations would aid in design of better therapeutics to deal with COVID-19 pandemic. We developed an integrated genome-scale metabolic model of normal human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBE) infected with SARS-CoV-2 using gene-expression and macromolecular make-up of the virus. The reconstructed model predicts growth rates of the virus in high agreement with the experimental measured values. Furthermore, we report a method for conducting genome-scale differential flux analysis (GS-DFA) in context-specific metabolic models. We apply the method to the context-specific model and identify severely affected metabolic modules predominantly comprising of lipid metabolism. We conduct an integrated analysis of the flux-altered reactions, host-virus protein-protein interaction network and phospho-proteomics data to understand the mechanism of flux alteration in host cells. We show that several enzymes driving the altered reactions inferred by our method to be directly interacting with viral proteins and also undergoing differential phosphorylation under diseased state. In case of SARS-CoV-2 infection, lipid metabolism particularly fatty acid oxidation, cholesterol biosynthesis and beta-oxidation cycle along with arachidonic acid metabolism are predicted to be most affected which confirms with clinical metabolomics studies. GS-DFA can be applied to existing repertoire of high-throughput proteomic or transcriptomic data in diseased condition to understand metabolic deregulation at the level of flux.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/GHLqZEvY94w&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 Haverkamp et al. use various cell markers to study the buzzard, pigeon and marmoset retina. They compare marker expression, cell densities and the cellular organization of foveae.






Abstract
In the vertebrate retina, amacrine and ganglion cells represent the most diverse cell classes. They can be classified into different cell types by several features, such as morphology, light responses, and gene expression profile. Although birds possess high visual acuity (similar to primates which we used here for comparison) and tetrachromatic color vision, data on the expression of transcription factors in retinal ganglion cells of birds is largely missing. In this study, we tested various transcription factors, known to label subpopulations of cells in mammalian retinae, in two avian species: the common buzzard (Buteo buteo), a raptor with exceptional acuity, and the domestic pigeon (Columba livia domestica), a good navigator and widely used model for visual cognition. Staining for the transcription factors Foxp2, Satb1 and Satb2 labelled most ganglion cells in the avian ganglion cell layer. CtBP2 was established as marker for displaced amacrine cells which allowed us to reliably distinguish ganglion cells from displaced amacrine cells and assess their densities in buzzard and pigeon. When we additionally compared the temporal and central fovea of the buzzard with the fovea of primates, we found that the cellular organization in the pits was different in primates and raptors. In summary, we demonstrate that the expression of transcription factors is a defining feature of cell types not only in the retina of mammals but also of birds. The markers, which we have established, may provide useful tools for more detailed studies on the retinal circuitry of these highly visual animals.

 Brain mosaic mutations are a major cause of refractory focal epilepsies with cortical malformations such as focal cortical dysplasia, hemimegalencephaly, malformation of cortical development with oligodendroglial hyperplasia in epilepsy, or ganglioglioma. Here, we collected 1‐6 mL of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) during epilepsy surgery to search for somatic variants in cell‐free DNA (cfDNA) using targeted droplet digital PCR. In 3/12 epileptic patients with known somatic mutations previously identified in brain tissue, we here provide evidence that brain mosaicism can be detected in the CSF‐derived cfDNA. These findings suggest future opportunities for detecting the mutant allele driving epilepsy in CSF.

 &lt;p&gt;As open-ended learning based on divergent search algorithms such as Novelty
Search (NS) draws more and more attention from the research community, it is
natural to expect that its application to increasingly complex real-world
problems will require the exploration to operate in higher dimensional Behavior
Spaces which will not necessarily be Euclidean. Novelty Search traditionally
relies on k-nearest neighbours search and an archive of previously visited
behavior descriptors which are assumed to live in a Euclidean space. This is
problematic because of a number of issues. On one hand, Euclidean distance and
Nearest-neighbour search are known to behave differently and become less
meaningful in high dimensional spaces. On the other hand, the archive has to be
bounded since, memory considerations aside, the computational complexity of
finding nearest neighbours in that archive grows linearithmically with its
size. A sub-optimal bound can result in &quot;cycling&quot; in the behavior space, which
inhibits the progress of the exploration. Furthermore, the performance of NS
depends on a number of algorithmic choices and hyperparameters, such as the
strategies to add or remove elements to the archive and the number of
neighbours to use in k-nn search. In this paper, we discuss an alternative
approach to novelty estimation, dubbed Behavior Recognition based Novelty
Search (BR-NS), which does not require an archive, makes no assumption on the
metrics that can be defined in the behavior space and does not rely on nearest
neighbours search. We conduct experiments to gain insight into its feasibility
and dynamics as well as potential advantages over archive-based NS in terms of
time complexity.

 &lt;p&gt;Scheduling is a fundamental task occurring in various automated systems
applications, e.g., optimal schedules for machines on a job shop allow for a
reduction of production costs and waste. Nevertheless, finding such schedules
is often intractable and cannot be achieved by Combinatorial Optimization
Problem (COP) methods within a given time limit. Recent advances of Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL) in learning complex behavior enable new COP
application possibilities. This paper presents an efficient DRL environment for
Job-Shop Scheduling -- an important problem in the field. Furthermore, we
design a meaningful and compact state representation as well as a novel, simple
dense reward function, closely related to the sparse make-span minimization
criteria used by COP methods. We demonstrate that our approach significantly
outperforms existing DRL methods on classic benchmark instances, coming close
to state-of-the-art COP approaches.

 &lt;p&gt;Addressing shifts in data distributions is an important prerequisite for the
deployment of deep learning models to real-world settings. A general approach
to this problem involves the adjustment of models to a new domain through
transfer learning. However, in many cases, this is not applicable in a post-hoc
manner to deployed models and further parameter adjustments jeopardize safety
certifications that were established beforehand. In such a context, we propose
to deal with changes in the data distribution via guided data homogenization
which shifts the burden of adaptation from the model to the data. This approach
makes use of information about the training data contained implicitly in the
deep learning model to learn a domain transfer function. This allows for a
targeted deployment of models to unknown scenarios without changing the model
itself. We demonstrate the potential of data homogenization through experiments
on the CIFAR-10 and MNIST data sets.

 &lt;p&gt;Recently proposed few-shot image classification methods have generally
focused on use cases where the objects to be classified are the central subject
of images. Despite success on benchmark vision datasets aligned with this use
case, these methods typically fail on use cases involving densely-annotated,
busy images: images common in the wild where objects of relevance are not the
central subject, instead appearing potentially occluded, small, or among other
incidental objects belonging to other classes of potential interest. To
localize relevant objects, we employ a prototype-based few-shot segmentation
model which compares the encoded features of unlabeled query images with
support class centroids to produce region proposals indicating the presence and
location of support set classes in a query image. These region proposals are
then used as additional conditioning input to few-shot image classifiers. We
develop a framework to unify the two stages (segmentation and classification)
into an end-to-end classification model -- PRoPnet -- and empirically
demonstrate that our methods improve accuracy on image datasets with natural
scenes containing multiple object classes.

 &lt;p&gt;The Stockpile blending problem is an important component of mine production
scheduling, where stockpiles are used to store and blend raw material. The goal
of blending material from stockpiles is to create parcels of concentrate which
contain optimal metal grades based on the material available. The volume of
material that each stockpile provides to a given parcel is dependent on a set
of mine schedule conditions and customer demands. Therefore, the problem can be
formulated as a continuous optimization problem. In the real-world application,
there are several constraints required to guarantee parcels that meet the
demand of downstream customers. It is a challenge in solving the stockpile
blending problems since its scale can be very large. We introduce two repaired
operators for the problems to convert the infeasible solutions into the
solutions without violating the two tight constraints. Besides, we introduce a
multi-component fitness function for solving the large-scale stockpile blending
problem which can maximize the volume of metal over the plan and maintain the
balance between stockpiles according to the usage of metal. Furthermore, we
investigate the well-known approach in this paper, which is used to solve
optimization problems over continuous space, namely the differential evolution
(DE) algorithm. The experimental results show that the DE algorithm combined
with two proposed duration repair methods is significantly better in terms of
the values of results than the results on real-world instances for both
one-month problems and large-scale problems.

 &lt;p&gt;We create an artificial system of agents (attention-based neural networks)
which selectively exchange messages with each-other in order to study the
emergence of memetic evolution and how memetic evolutionary pressures interact
with genetic evolution of the network weights. We observe that the ability of
agents to exert selection pressures on each-other is essential for memetic
evolution to bootstrap itself into a state which has both high-fidelity
replication of memes, as well as continuing production of new memes over time.
However, in this system there is very little interaction between this memetic
'ecology' and underlying tasks driving individual fitness - the emergent meme
layer appears to be neither helpful nor harmful to agents' ability to learn to
solve tasks. Sourcecode for these experiments is available at

 &lt;p&gt;One of the first and easy to use techniques for proving run time bounds for
evolutionary algorithms is the so-called method of fitness levels by Wegener.
It uses a partition of the search space into a sequence of levels which are
traversed by the algorithm in increasing order, possibly skipping levels. An
easy, but often strong upper bound for the run time can then be derived by
adding the reciprocals of the probabilities to leave the levels (or upper
bounds for these). Unfortunately, a similarly effective method for proving
lower bounds has not yet been established. The strongest such method, proposed
by Sudholt (2013), requires a careful choice of the viscosity parameters
$\gamma_{i,j}$, $0 \le i &amp;lt; j \le n$.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper we present two new variants of the method, one for upper and
one for lower bounds. Besides the level leaving probabilities, they only rely
on the probabilities that levels are visited at all. We show that these can be
computed or estimated without greater difficulties and apply our method to
reprove the following known results in an easy and natural way. (i) The precise
run time of the \oea on \leadingones. (ii) A lower bound for the run time of
the \oea on \onemax, tight apart from an $O(n)$ term. (iii) A lower bound for
the run time of the \oea on long $k$-paths.

 &lt;p&gt;Airline disruption management traditionally seeks to address three problem
dimensions: aircraft scheduling, crew scheduling, and passenger scheduling, in
that order. However, current efforts have, at most, only addressed the first
two problem dimensions concurrently and do not account for the propagative
effects that uncertain scheduling outcomes in one dimension can have on another
dimension. In addition, existing approaches for airline disruption management
include human specialists who decide on necessary corrective actions for
airline schedule disruptions on the day of operation. However, human
specialists are limited in their ability to process copious amounts of
information imperative for making robust decisions that simultaneously address
all problem dimensions during disruption management. Therefore, there is a need
to augment the decision-making capabilities of a human specialist with
quantitative and qualitative tools that can rationalize complex interactions
amongst all dimensions in airline disruption management, and provide objective
insights to the specialists in the airline operations control center. To that
effect, we provide a discussion and demonstration of an agnostic and systematic
paradigm for enabling expeditious simultaneously-integrated recovery of all
problem dimensions during airline disruption management, through an intelligent
multi-agent system that employs principles from artificial intelligence and
distributed ledger technology.

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Plasticity of the cerebral cortex following a modification of the sensorimotor experience takes place in several steps that can last from few hours to several months. Among the mechanisms involved in the dynamic modulation of the cerebral cortex in adults, it is commonly proposed that short-term plasticity reflects changes in synaptic connections. Here, we were interested in the time-course of synaptic plasticity taking place in the somatosensory primary cortex all along a 14-day period of sensorimotor perturbation (SMP), as well as during a recovery phase up to 24 h. Activation and expression level of pre- (synapsin 1, synaptophysin, synaptotagmin 1) and postsynaptic (AMPA and NMDA receptors) proteins, postsynaptic density scaffold proteins (PSD-95 and Shank2), and cytoskeletal proteins (neurofilaments-L and M, β3-tubulin, synaptopodin, N-cadherin) were determined in cortical tissue enriched in synaptic proteins. During the SMP period, most changes were observed as soon as D7 in the presynaptic compartment and were followed, at D14, by changes in the postsynaptic compartment. These changes persisted at least until 24 h of recovery. Proteins involved in synapse structure (scaffolding, adhesion, cytoskeletal) were mildly affected and almost exclusively at D14. We concluded that experience-dependent reorganization of somatotopic cortical maps is accompanied by changes in synaptic transmission with a very close time-course.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have key roles in a variety of neurological diseases, including epilepsy. This objective of this study was to perform the functional exploration and mechanism investigation of circRNA Ubiquilin1 (circUBQLN1) in epilepsy. Epilepsy cell model was established by the treatment of Mg&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-free in human neurons-hippocampal (HN-h) cells. The quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used for the expression analysis of circUBQLN1, linear-UBQLN1, microRNA-155 (miR-155), and sex-determining region Y-box 7 (SOX7). Proliferation detection was completed using Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. Apoptosis analysis was conducted by flow cytometry and caspase-3 assay. Oxidative stress was assessed through determining the levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA). Target analysis was performed by dual-luciferase reporter and RNA pull-down assays. SOX7 protein level was examined by Western blot. CircUBQLN1 was downregulated in epilepsy samples and Mg&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-free-induced cell model. Functional analysis in vitro suggested that circUBQLN1 overexpression facilitated proliferation but reduced apoptosis and oxidative stress in Mg&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-free-treated HN-h cells. Target analysis showed that circUBQLN1 acted as a miR-155 sponge and miR-155-targeted SOX7. Moreover, circUBQLN1 could combine with miR-155 to regulate the SOX7 expression. Reverted assays indicated that circUBQLN1 overexpression alleviated the Mg&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-free-induced nerve injury by sponging miR-155, and knockdown of SOX7 abrogated the protective function of in-miR-155 or circUBQLN1 in the Mg&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-free-treated HN-h cells. Our data revealed that circUBQLN1 prevented nerve injury in Mg&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-free-treated HN-h cells by regulating the miR-155/SOX7 axis, showing that circUBQLN1 might be used as a biomolecular target for the treatment of epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The cerebellum and its functional multiplicity and heterogeneity have been objects of curiosity and interest since ancient times, giving rise to the urge to reveal its complexity. Since the first hypothesis of cerebellar mere role in motor tuning and coordination, much more has been continuously discovered about the cerebellum’s circuitry and functioning throughout centuries, leading to the currently accepted knowledge of its prominent involvement in cognitive, social, and behavioral areas. Particularly in childhood, the cerebellum may subserve several age-dependent functions, which might be compromised in several Central Nervous System pathologies. Overall, cerebellar damage may produce numerous signs and symptoms and determine a wide variety of neuropsychiatric impairments already during the evolutive age. Therefore, an early assessment in children would be desirable to address a prompt diagnosis and a proper intervention since the first months of life. Here we provide an overview of the cerebellum, retracing its morphology, histogenesis, and physiological functions, and finally outlining its involvement in typical and atypical development and the age-dependent patterns of cerebellar dysfunctions.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Early adversity (EA) impairs myelin development in a manner that persists later in life across diverse mammalian species including humans, non-human primates, and rodents. These observations, coupled with the highly conserved nature of myelin development suggest that animal models can provide important insights into the molecular mechanisms by which EA impairs myelin development later in life and the impact of these changes on network connectivity, cognition, and behavior. However, this area of translational research has received relatively little attention and no comprehensive review is currently available to address these issues. This is particularly important given some recent mechanistic studies in rodents and the availability of new agents to increase myelination. The goals of this review are to highlight the need for additional pre-clinical work in this area and to provide specific examples that demonstrate the potential of this work to generate novel therapeutic interventions that are highly needed.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Purpose: This systematic review aims to examine the efficacy of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) combined with physical training on the excitability of the motor cortex, physical performance, and motor learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: A systematic search was performed on PubMed, Web of Science, and EBSCO databases for relevant research published from inception to August 2020. Eligible studies included those that used a randomized controlled design and reported the effects of tDCS combined with physical training to improve motor-evoked potential (MEP), dynamic posture stability index (DPSI), reaction time, and error rate on participants without nervous system diseases. The risk of bias was assessed by the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Twenty-four of an initial yield of 768 studies met the eligibility criteria. The risk of bias was considered low. Results showed that anodal tDCS combined with physical training can significantly increase MEP amplitude, decrease DPSI, increase muscle strength, and decrease reaction time and error rate in motor learning tasks. Moreover, the gain effect is significantly greater than sham tDCS combined with physical training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: tDCS combined with physical training can effectively improve the excitability of the motor cortex, physical performance, and motor learning. The reported results encourage further research to understand further the synergistic effects of tDCS combined with physical training.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Combining multi-modality data for brain disease diagnosis such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) commonly leads to improved performance than those using a single modality. However, it is still challenging to train a multi-modality model since it is difficult in clinical practice to obtain complete data that includes all modality data. Generally speaking, it is difficult to obtain both magnetic resonance images (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) images of a single patient. PET is expensive and requires the injection of radioactive substances into the patient’s body, while MR images are cheaper, safer, and more widely used in practice. Discarding samples without PET data is a common method in previous studies, but the reduction in the number of samples will result in a decrease in model performance. To take advantage of multi-modal complementary information, we first adopt the Reversible Generative Adversarial Network (RevGAN) model to reconstruct the missing data. After that, a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) classification model with multi-modality input was proposed to perform AD diagnosis. We have evaluated our method on the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, and compared the performance of the proposed method with those using state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results show that the structural and functional information of brain tissue can be mapped well and that the image synthesized by our method is close to the real image. In addition, the use of synthetic data is beneficial for the diagnosis and prediction of Alzheimer’s disease, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed framework.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Although spinal cord injury (SCI) is the main cause of disability worldwide, there is still no definite and effective treatment method for this condition. Our previous clinical trials confirmed that the increased excitability of the motor cortex was related to the functional prognosis of patients with SCI. However, it remains unclear which cell types in the motor cortex lead to the later functional recovery. Herein, we applied optogenetic technology to selectively activate glutamate neurons in the primary motor cortex and explore whether activation of glutamate neurons in the primary motor cortex can promote functional recovery after SCI in rats and the preliminary neural mechanisms involved. Our results showed that the activation of glutamate neurons in the motor cortex could significantly improve the motor function scores in rats, effectively shorten the incubation period of motor evoked potentials and increase motor potentials’ amplitude. In addition, hematoxylin-eosin staining and nerve fiber staining at the injured site showed that accurate activation of the primary motor cortex could effectively promote tissue recovery and neurofilament growth (GAP-43, NF) at the injured site of the spinal cord, while the content of some growth-related proteins (BDNF, NGF) at the injured site increased. These results suggested that selective activation of glutamate neurons in the primary motor cortex can promote functional recovery after SCI and may be of great significance for understanding the neural cell mechanism underlying functional recovery induced by motor cortex stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Many studies have observed modulation of the amplitude of the neural index mismatch negativity (MMN) related to which member of a phoneme contrast [phoneme A, phoneme B] serves as the frequent (standard) and which serves as the infrequent (deviant) stimulus (i.e., AAAB vs. BBBA) in an oddball paradigm. Explanations for this amplitude modulation range from acoustic to linguistic factors. We tested whether exchanging the role of the mid vowel /ε/ vs. high vowel /ɪ/ of English modulated MMN amplitude and whether the pattern of modulation was compatible with an underspecification account, in which the underspecified height values are [−high] and [−low]. MMN was larger for /ε/ as the deviant, but only when compared across conditions to itself as the standard. For the within-condition comparison, MMN was larger to /ɪ/ deviant minus /ε/ standard than to the reverse. A condition order effect was also observed. MMN amplitude was smaller to the deviant stimulus if it had previously served as the standard. In addition, the amplitudes of late discriminative negativity (LDN) showed similar asymmetry. LDN was larger for deviant /ε/ than deviant /ɪ/ when compared to themselves as the standard. These findings were compatible with an underspecification account, but also with other accounts, such as the Natural Referent Vowel model and a prototype model; we also suggest that non-linguistic factors need to be carefully considered as additional sources of speech processing asymmetries.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;A variety of studies show that parental absence early in life leads to deleterious effects on the developing CNS. This is thought to be largely because evolutionary-dependent stimuli are necessary for the appropriate postnatal development of the young brain, an effect sometimes termed the “experience-expectant brain,” with parents providing the necessary input for normative synaptic connections to develop and appropriate neuronal survival to occur. Principal among CNS systems affected by parental input are the monoamine systems. In the present study, N = 434 rhesus monkeys (233 males, 201 females) were reared in one of two conditions: as mother-reared controls (MR; n = 269) or without adults with 24-h access to same-aged peers (PR; n = 165). When subjects were six-months-old, they underwent a separation paradigm involving 4, sequential, four-day social separations from their mothers or peers, with each separation followed by three-day reunions with their mothers or their peers. Prior to the separation paradigm, baseline cisternal CSF samples were obtained, as well as at the end of each the four social separations, and after final separation, during a recovery period. CSF was assayed for concentrations of monoamine metabolites and a blood sample was genotyped for the serotonin transporter (5-HTT) genotype. Replicating earlier landmark findings, PR subjects with the s allele exhibited lower baseline concentrations of the serotonin metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), when compared to PR subjects homozygous for the L allele. MR subjects were undifferentiated by genotype. PR subjects exhibited lower CSF 5-HIAA concentrations during baseline, but higher CSF 5-HIAA during social separations, when compared to MR subjects. There were rearing effects for the dopamine metabolite homovanillic acid (HVA) and for the norepinephrine metabolite 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG), with PR subjects showing higher HVA and lower MHPG when compared to MR subjects. These findings indicate that there are long-term deficits in the response of monoamines following early maternal absence. The results of this study confirm and extend earlier findings that early parental absence has deleterious consequences for the development of the monoamine systems, and that these consequences are modulated by the 5-HTT genotype.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;From birth to 15 months infants and caregivers form a fundamentally intersubjective, dyadic unit within which the infant’s ability to recognize gender/sex in the world develops. Between about 18 and 36 months the infant accumulates an increasingly clear and subjective sense of self as female or male. We know little about how the precursors to gender/sex identity form during the intersubjective period, nor how they transform into an independent sense of self by 3 years of age. In this Theory and Hypothesis article I offer a general framework for thinking about this problem. I propose that through repetition and patterning, the dyadic interactions in which infants and caregivers engage imbue the infant with an embodied, i.e., sensori-motor understanding of gender/sex. During this developmental period (which I label Phase 1) gender/sex is primarily an intersubjective project. From 15 to 18 months (which I label Phase 2) there are few reports of newly appearing gender/sex behavioral differences, and I hypothesize that this absence reflects a period of developmental instability during which there is a transition from gender/sex as primarily inter-subjective to gender/sex as primarily subjective. Beginning at 18 months (i.e., the start of Phase 3), a toddler’s subjective sense of self as having a gender/sex emerges, and it solidifies by 3 years of age. I propose a dynamic systems perspective to track how infants first assimilate gender/sex information during the intersubjective period (birth to 15 months); then explore what changes might occur during a hypothesized phase transition (15 to 18 months), and finally, review the emergence and initial stabilization of individual subjectivity-the period from 18 to 36 months. The critical questions explored focus on how to model and translate data from very different experimental disciplines, especially neuroscience, physiology, developmental psychology and cognitive development. I close by proposing the formation of a research consortium on gender/sex development during the first 3 years after birth.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Background&lt;p&gt;Functional changes after spinal cord injury (SCI) are related to changes in cortical plasticity. These changes can be measured with electroencephalography (EEG) and has potential to be used as a clinical biomarker.&lt;/p&gt;Method&lt;p&gt;In this longitudinal study participants underwent a total of 30 sessions of robotic-assisted gait training (RAGT) over a course of 6 weeks. The duration of each session was 30 min. Resting state EEG was recorded before and after 30-session rehabilitation therapy. To measure gait, we used the Walking Index for Spinal Cord Injury Scale, 10-Meter- Walking Test, Timed-Up-and-Go, and 6-Min-Walking Test. Balance was measured using Berg Balance Scale.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Fifteen participants with incomplete SCI who had AIS C or D injuries based on American Spinal Cord Injury Association Impairment Scale classification were included in this study. Mean age was 35.7 years (range 17–51) and the mean time since injury was 17.08 (range 4–37) months. All participants showed clinical improvement with the rehabilitation program. EEG data revealed that high beta EEG activity in the central area had a negative correlation with gait (p = 0.049; β coefficient: −0.351; and adj-R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;: 0.23) and balance (p = 0.043; β coefficient: −0.158; and adj-R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;:0.24) measured at baseline, in a way that greater high beta EEG power was related to worse clinical function at baseline. Moreover, improvement in gait and balance had negative correlations with the change in alpha/theta ratio in the parietal area (Gait: p = 0.049; β coefficient: −0.351; adj-R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;: 0.23; Balance: p = 0.043; β coefficient: −0.158; and adj-R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;: 0.24).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;In SCI, functional impairment and subsequent improvement following rehabilitation therapy with RAGT correlated with the change in cortical activity measured by EEG. Our results suggest that EEG alpha/theta ratio may be a potential surrogate marker of functional improvement during rehabilitation. Future studies are necessary to improve and validate these findings as a neurophysiological biomarker for SCI rehabilitation.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a life-threatening condition that can also lead to permanent paralysis. However, the mechanisms that underlying neurobehavioral deficits after SAH have not been fully elucidated. As theta burst stimulation (TBS) can induce long-term potentiation (LTP) in the motor cortex, we tested its potential as a functional evaluation tool after experimentally induced SAH. Motor cortical inter-neuronal excitability was evaluated in anesthetized rats after 200 Hz-quadripulse TBS (QTS5), 200 Hz-quadripulse stimulation (QPS5), and 400 Hz-octapulse stimulation (OPS2.5). Furthermore, correlation between motor cortical LTP and N-methyl-D-aspartate-receptor activation was evaluated using MK-801, a NMDA-receptor antagonist. We evaluated inhibition-facilitation configurations [interstimulus interval: 3 ms; short-latency intracortical inhibition (SICI) and 11 ms; intracortical facilitation (ICF)] with paired electrical stimulation protocols and the effect of TBS paradigm on continuous recording of motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) for quantitative parameters. SAH and MK-801 completely blocked ICF, while SICI was preserved. QTS5, QPS5, and OPS2.5 facilitated continuous MEPs, persisting for 180 min. Both SAH and MK-801 completely blocked MEP facilitations after QPS5 and OPS2.5, while MEP facilitations after QTS5 were preserved. Significant correlations were found among neurological scores and 3 ms-SICI rates, 11 ms-ICF rates, and MEP facilitation rates after 200 Hz-QTS5, 7 days after SAH (R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.6236; r = −0.79, R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.6053; r = −0.77 and R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.9071; r = 0.95, p &amp;lt; 0.05, respectively). Although these findings need to be verified in humans, our study demonstrates that the neurophysiological parameters 3 ms-SICI, 11 ms-ICF, and 200 Hz-QTS5-MEPs may be useful surrogate quantitative biomarkers for assessing inter-neuronal function after SAH.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;A key function of the mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR) is to control the speed of forward symmetrical locomotor movements. However, the ability of freely moving mammals to integrate environmental cues to brake and turn during MLR stimulation is poorly documented. Here, we investigated whether freely behaving mice could brake or turn, based on environmental cues during MLR stimulation. We photostimulated the cuneiform nucleus (part of the MLR) in mice expressing channelrhodopsin in Vglut2-positive neurons in a Cre-dependent manner (Vglut2-ChR2-EYFP) using optogenetics. We detected locomotor movements using deep learning. We used patch-clamp recordings to validate the functional expression of channelrhodopsin and neuroanatomy to visualize the stimulation sites. In the linear corridor, gait diagram and limb kinematics were similar during spontaneous and optogenetic-evoked locomotion. In the open-field arena, optogenetic stimulation of the MLR evoked locomotion, and increasing laser power increased locomotor speed. Mice could brake and make sharp turns (~90°) when approaching a corner during MLR stimulation in the open-field arena. The speed during the turn was scaled with the speed before the turn, and with the turn angle. Patch-clamp recordings in Vglut2-ChR2-EYFP mice show that blue light evoked short-latency spiking in MLR neurons. Our results strengthen the idea that different brainstem neurons convey braking/turning and MLR speed commands in mammals. Our study also shows that Vglut2-positive neurons of the cuneiform nucleus are a relevant target to increase locomotor activity without impeding the ability to brake and turn when approaching obstacles, thus ensuring smooth and adaptable navigation. Our observations may have clinical relevance since cuneiform nucleus stimulation is increasingly considered to improve locomotion function in pathological states such as Parkinson’s disease, spinal cord injury, or stroke.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The voltage-gated proton channel Hv1 is a newly discovered ion channel that is highly conserved among species. It is known that Hv1 is not only expressed in peripheral immune cells but also one of the major ion channels expressed in tissue-resident microglia of the central nervous systems (CNS). One key role for Hv1 is its interaction with NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2) to regulate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cytosolic pH. Emerging data suggest that excessive ROS production increases and requires proton currents through Hv1 in the injured CNS, and manipulations that ablate Hv1 expression or induce loss of function may provide neuroprotection in CNS injury models including stroke, traumatic brain injury, and spinal cord injury. Recent data demonstrating microglial Hv1-mediated signaling in the pathophysiology of the CNS injury further supports the idea that Hv1 channel may function as a key mechanism in posttraumatic neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. In this review, we summarize the main findings of Hv1, including its expression pattern, cellular mechanism, role in aging, and animal models of CNS injury and disease pathology. We also discuss the potential of Hv1 as a therapeutic target for CNS injury.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;At the end of 2019, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was discovered in China, causing a new coronavirus disease, termed COVID-19 by the WHO on February 11, 2020. At the time of this paper (January 31, 2021), more than 100 million cases have been recorded, which have claimed over 2 million lives worldwide. The most important clinical presentation of COVID-19 is severe pneumonia; however, many patients present various neurological symptoms, ranging from loss of olfaction, nausea, dizziness, and headache to encephalopathy and stroke, with a high prevalence of inflammatory central nervous system (CNS) syndromes. SARS-CoV-2 may also target the respiratory center in the brainstem and cause silent hypoxemia. However, the neurotropic mechanism(s) by which SARS-CoV-2 affects the CNS remain(s) unclear. In this paper, we first address the involvement of astrocytes in COVID-19 and then elucidate the present knowledge on SARS-CoV-2 as a neurotropic virus as well as several other neurotropic flaviviruses (with a particular emphasis on the West Nile virus, tick-borne encephalitis virus, and Zika virus) to highlight the neurotropic mechanisms that target astroglial cells in the CNS. These key homeostasis-providing cells in the CNS exhibit many functions that act as a favorable milieu for virus replication and possibly a favorable environment for SARS-CoV-2 as well. The role of astrocytes in COVID-19 pathology, related to aging and neurodegenerative disorders, and environmental factors, is discussed. Understanding these mechanisms is key to better understanding the pathophysiology of COVID-19 and for developing new strategies to mitigate the neurotropic manifestations of COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The dopamine transporter (DAT) clears neurotransmitters from the extracellular space and serves as an important regulator of signal amplitude and duration at sites of dopamine release. Several different intracellular signaling pathways have been observed to modulate DAT activity through the regulation of the trafficking of the carriers to and from the cell surface. Acute activation of protein kinase C (PKC) by phorbol esters facilitates clathrin-dependent internalization of the DAT in a variety of model systems; however, the physiological stimuli and cell-surface receptor systems that activate PKC and regulate the DAT in dopamine neurons remain elusive. We report here that stimulation of M&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/M&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; muscarinic receptors in midbrain cultures decreases the ability of dopamine neurons to transport dopamine through DAT. Application of the cholinomimetic drug carbachol leads to a decrease in DAT activity in primary cultures while the M&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/M&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;-specific antagonist, pirenzepine, blocks these effects. The M&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; antagonist, DAU 5884, does not affect, but a positive modulator of M&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, VU 0238429, enhances the loss of DAT function in response to carbachol and acetylcholine. These data implicate M&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/M&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; receptors on dopamine neurons in the modulation of DAT function. Bisindolylmaleimide, a PKC inhibitor, blocks the effects of carbachol stimulation on dopamine uptake, supporting a role for PKC in muscarinic receptor-mediated DAT internalization. Furthermore, as shown previously for PKC-induced internalization, downregulation of the DAT is dependent on both clathrin and dynamin. A G&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;-specific inhibitor peptide also blocks the effects of carbachol on DAT in primary cultures, confirming G&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt; as the G-protein that couples M&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/M&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; receptors to PKC activation in these cells. In acute midbrain slices, biotinylation of cell-surface proteins revealed the loss of dopamine transport mediated by muscarinic receptor stimulation was, indeed, due to loss of membrane expression of the DAT in endogenous tissue. These data indicate that stimulation of cholinergic pathways can lead to modulation of dopamine through internalization of the DAT.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) converts sphingomyelin into ceramide. Recent work has advanced the ASM/ceramide system as a major player in the pathogenesis of major depressive disorder (MDD). Indeed, ASM activity is enhanced in MDD patients and antidepressant drugs like fluoxetine act as functional inhibitors of ASM. Here, we employed the specific ASM inhibitor ARC39 to explore the acute effects of the enzyme on hippocampal synaptic transmission and cell excitability in adult mouse brain slice preparations. In both field potential and whole-cell recordings, ARC39 (1–3 μM) enhanced excitatory synaptic input onto ventral hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells. The specificity of drug action was demonstrated by its lacking effect in slices from ASM knockout mice. In control condition, ARC39 strongly reduced firing in most CA1 pyramidal cells, together with membrane hyperpolarization. Such pronounced inhibitory action of ARC39 on soma excitability was largely reversed when GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors were blocked. The idea that ARC39 recruits GABAergic inhibition to dampen cell excitability was further reinforced by the drug’s ability to enhance the inhibitory synaptic drive onto pyramidal cells. In pyramidal cells that were pharmacologically isolated from synaptic input, the overall effect of ARC39 on cell firing was inhibitory, but some neurons displayed a biphasic response with a transient increase in firing, suggesting that ARC39 might alter intrinsic firing properties in a cell-specific fashion. Because ARC39 is charged at physiological pH and exerted all its effects within minutes of application, we propose that the neurophysiological actions reported here are due to the inhibition of secretory rather than lysosomal ASM. In summary, the ASM inhibitor ARC39 reveals a tonic control of the enzyme over ventral hippocampal excitability, which involves the intrinsic excitability of CA1 pyramidal cells as well as their excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Children born prematurely suffer from learning disabilities and exhibit reading, speech, and cognitive difficulties, which are associated with an auditory processing disorder. However, it is unknown whether gestational age at delivery and the unnatural auditory environment in neonatal intensive care units (NICU) collectively affect proper auditory development and neuronal circuitry in premature newborns. We morphologically characterized fetal development of the medial superior olivary nucleus (MSO), an area important for binaural hearing and sound localization, in the auditory brainstem of baboon neonates at different gestational ages. Axonal and synaptic structures and the tonotopic differentiation of ion channels in the MSO underwent profound refinements after hearing onset in the uterus. These developmental refinements of the MSO were significantly altered in preterm baboon neonates in the NICU. Thus, the maternal environment in uterus is critical for auditory nervous system development during the last trimester of pregnancy and critically affects the anatomic and functional formation of synapses and neural circuitry in the preterm newborn brain.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) is a severe complication of preterm birth associated with cerebral palsy, intellectual disability, and commonly, accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Histologically, IVH leads to subependymal gliosis, fibrosis, and disruption of the ependymal wall. Importantly, expression of aquaporin channels 1 and 4 (AQP1 and AQP4) regulating respectively, secretion and absorption of cerebrospinal fluids is altered with IVH and are associated with development of post hemorrhagic hydrocephalus. Human cord blood derived unrestricted somatic stem cells (USSCs), which we previously demonstrated to reduce the magnitude of hydrocephalus, as having anti-inflammatory, and beneficial behavioral effects, were injected into the cerebral ventricles of rabbit pups 18 h after glycerol-induced IVH. USSC treated IVH pups showed a reduction in ventricular size when compared to control pups at 7 and 14 days (both, P &amp;lt; 0.05). Histologically, USSC treatment reduced cellular infiltration and ependymal wall disruption. In the region of the choroid plexus, immuno-reactivity for AQP1 and ependymal wall AQP4 expression were suppressed after IVH but were restored following USSC administration. Effects were confirmed by analysis of mRNA from dissected choroid plexus and ependymal tissue. Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) isoforms, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and matrix metalloprotease-9 (MMP-9) mRNA, as well as protein levels, were significantly increased following IVH and restored towards normal with USSC treatment (P &amp;lt; 0.05). The anti-inflammatory cytokine Interleukin-10 (IL-10) mRNA was reduced in IVH, but significantly recovered after USSC injection (P &amp;lt; 0.05). In conclusion, USSCs exerted anti-inflammatory effects by suppressing both TGF-β specific isoforms, CTGF and MMP-9, recovered IL-10, restored aquaporins expression towards baseline, and reduced hydrocephalus. These results support the possibility of the use of USSCs to reduce IVH consequences in prematurity.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Microglia are the primary resident immune cells of the central nervous system that maintain physiological homeostasis in the brain and contribute to the pathogenesis of many psychiatric disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. Due to the lack of appropriate human cellular models, it is difficult to study the basic pathophysiological processes linking microglia to brain diseases. In this study, we adopted a microglia-like cellular model derived from peripheral blood monocytes with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interleukin-34 (IL-34). We characterized and validated this in vitro cellular model by morphology, immunocytochemistry, gene expression profiles, and functional study. Our results indicated that the iMG cells developed typical microglial ramified morphology, expressed microglial specific surface markers (P2RY12 and TMEM119), and possessed phagocytic activity. Principal component analyses and multidimensional scaling analyses of RNA-seq data showed that iMG cells were distinct from monocytes and induced macrophages (iMacs) but clustered closer to human microglia and hiPSC-induced microglia. Heatmap analyses also found that iMG cells, but not monocytes, were closely clustered with human primary microglia. Further pathway and relative expression analysis indicated that unique genes from iMG cells were involved in the regulation of the complement system, especially in the synapse and ion transport. Overall, our data demonstrated that the iMG model mimicked many features of the brain resident microglia, highlighting its utility in the study of microglial function in many brain diseases, such as schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease (AD).&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Hyperactivation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) due to mutations in genes along the PI3K-mTOR pathway and the GATOR1 complex causes a spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders (termed mTORopathies) associated with malformation of cortical development and intractable epilepsy. Despite these gene variants’ converging impact on mTORC1 activity, emerging findings suggest that these variants contribute to epilepsy through both mTORC1-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Here, we review the literature on in utero electroporation-based animal models of mTORopathies, which recapitulate the brain mosaic pattern of mTORC1 hyperactivity, and compare the effects of distinct PI3K-mTOR pathway and GATOR1 complex gene variants on cortical development and epilepsy. We report the outcomes on cortical pyramidal neuronal placement, morphology, and electrophysiological phenotypes, and discuss some of the converging and diverging mechanisms responsible for these alterations and their contribution to epileptogenesis. We also discuss potential therapeutic strategies for epilepsy, beyond mTORC1 inhibition with rapamycin or everolimus, that could offer personalized medicine based on the gene variant.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Dementia and cognitive impairment are considered to be one of the biggest social and medical problems. While there is a definite relationship between vitamin B and cognitive decline, this has yet to be fully assessed with regard to sex differences. Thus, the present study investigated the relationship of vitamin B1 or vitamin B12 with dementia in accordance with the sex in 188 patients who visited the Memory Clinic at Showa University Hospital in Japan from March 2016 to March 2019. Cognitive function was tested by the Japanese version of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Hasegawa Dementia Scale-Revised (HDS-R). Blood tests were performed to measure the vitamin levels. Logistic regression analysis was used to calculate the odds ratio (OR) for dementia and the 95% confidence interval (CI). Compared to the highest vitamin group (third tertile), the lowest vitamin group (first tertile) exhibited a significantly increased OR for dementia defined by MMSE for vitamin B1 (OR:3.73, 95% CI:1.52–9.16) and vitamin B12 (2.97, 1.22–7.28) among women. In contrast, vitamin levels were not significantly associated with dementia determined by MMSE in men. These findings were similar even when dementia was defined by HDS-R. The present study suggests that vitamin B1 plays a role in preventing development of dementia in women. Future longitudinal studies will need to be undertaken in order to examine whether decreasing vitamin levels occur before or after cognitive impairment, and whether maintaining a higher vitamin level can prevent a worsening of cognitive function and the development of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), are typically characterized by progressive neuronal loss and neurological dysfunctions in the nervous system, affecting both memory and motor functions. Neuregulins (NRGs) belong to the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like family of extracellular ligands and they play an important role in the development, maintenance, and repair of both the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS) through the ErbB signaling pathway. They also regulate multiple intercellular signal transduction and participate in a wide range of biological processes, such as differentiation, migration, and myelination. In this review article, we summarized research on the changes and roles of NRGs in neurodegenerative diseases, especially in AD. We elaborated on the structural features of each NRG subtype and roles of NRG/ErbB signaling networks in neurodegenerative diseases. We also discussed the therapeutic potential of NRGs in the symptom remission of neurodegenerative diseases, which may offer hope for advancing related treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Aging is marked by an accumulation of damaged and modified brain proteins, and the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is important for cellular protein degradation. Recent work has established a critical role for the UPS in memory and synaptic plasticity, but the role of the UPS in age-related cognitive decline remains poorly understood. We trained young, middle-aged, and aged male and female rats using trace fear conditioning (TFC) to investigate the effects of age and sex on memory. We then measured markers of UPS-related protein degradation (phosphorylation of the Rpt6 proteasome regulatory subunit and K48-linked polyubiquitination) using western blots. We found that aged males, but not aged females, showed behavioral deficits at memory retrieval. Aged males also displayed reduced phosphorylation of the Rpt6 proteasome subunit and accumulation of K48 in the basolateral amygdala, while aged females displayed a similar pattern in the medial prefrontal cortex. These findings suggest that markers of UPS function are differentially affected by age and sex in a brain region-dependent manner. Together these results provide an important step toward understanding the UPS and circuit-level differences in aging males and females.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Aging is accompanied by unisensory decline. To compensate for this, two complementary strategies are potentially relied upon increasingly: first, older adults integrate more information from different sensory organs. Second, according to the predictive coding (PC) model, we form “templates” (internal models or “priors”) of the environment through our experiences. It is through increased life experience that older adults may rely more on these templates compared to younger adults. Multisensory integration and predictive coding would be effective strategies for the perception of near-threshold stimuli, which may however come at the cost of integrating irrelevant information. Both strategies can be studied in multisensory illusions because these require the integration of different sensory information, as well as an internal model of the world that can take precedence over sensory input. Here, we elicited a classic multisensory illusion, the sound-induced flash illusion, in younger (mean: 27 years, N = 25) and older (mean: 67 years, N = 28) adult participants while recording the magnetoencephalogram. Older adults perceived more illusions than younger adults. Older adults had increased pre-stimulus beta-band activity compared to younger adults as predicted by microcircuit theories of predictive coding, which suggest priors and predictions are linked to beta-band activity. Transfer entropy analysis and dynamic causal modeling of pre-stimulus magnetoencephalography data revealed a stronger illusion-related modulation of cross-modal connectivity from auditory to visual cortices in older compared to younger adults. We interpret this as the neural correlate of increased reliance on a cross-modal predictive template in older adults leading to the illusory percept.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Objective: This cross-sectional study aimed to distinguish patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from patients with normal controls (NCs) by measuring the levels of N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), total creatinine (tCr), and choline (Cho) in their hippocampus (HIP) and their posterior cingulate gyrus (PCG) by using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and to predict the cutoff value on the ratios of metabolites. We further aimed to provide a reference for the diagnosis of MCI in elderly patients in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: About 69 patients who underwent a clinical diagnosis of the MCI group and 67 patients with NCs, the Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) score, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score, and MRS of the bilateral HIP and bilateral PCG were considered. The ratio of NAA/tCr and Cho/tCr in the bilateral HIP and bilateral PCG was calculated. The relationship between the ratios of metabolites and the scores of MMSE and MoCA was analyzed, and the possible brain metabolite cutoff point for the diagnosis of MCI was evaluated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Compared with the NC group, the scores of MMSE and MoCA in the MCI group decreased significantly (p &amp;lt; 0.05); the ratio of NAA/tCr in the bilateral HIP and bilateral PCG and the ratio of Cho/tCr at the right HIP in the MCI group decreased significantly (p &amp;lt; 0.05); however, there was no significant difference in the ratio of Cho/tCr in the left HIP and bilateral PCG between the two groups (p &amp;gt; 0.05). The correlation coefficient between MMSE/MoCA and the ratio of NAA/tCr was 0.49–0.56 in the bilateral HIP (p &amp;lt; 0.01). The best cutoff value of NAA/creatine (Cr) in the left HIP and the right HIP was 1.195 and 1.19. Sensitivity, specificity, and the Youden index (YDI) in the left HIP and the right HIP were (0.725, 0.803, 0.528) and (0.754, 0.803, 0.557), respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: The level of metabolites in the HIP and the PCG of patients with MCI and of those with normal subjects has a certain correlation with the score of their MMSE and MoCA. When the value of NAA/tCr in the left HIP and right HIP is &amp;lt;1.19, it suggests that MCI may have occurred. According to this cutoff point, elderly patients with MCI in China could be screened.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Virus propagation methods generally use transformed cell lines to grow viruses from clinical specimens, which may force viruses to rapidly adapt to cell culture conditions, a process facilitated by high viral mutation rates. Upon propagation in VeroE6 cells, SARS-CoV-2 may mutate or delete the multibasic cleavage site (MBCS) in the spike protein. Previously, we showed that the MBCS facilitates serine protease-mediated entry into human airway cells (Mykytyn et al., 2021). Here, we report that propagating SARS-CoV-2 on the human airway cell line Calu-3 - that expresses serine proteases - prevents cell culture adaptations in the MBCS and directly adjacent to the MBCS (S686G). Similar results were obtained using a human airway organoid-based culture system for SARS-CoV-2 propagation. Thus, in-depth knowledge on the biology of a virus can be used to establish methods to prevent cell culture adaptation.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Chronic loss of Augmenter of Liver Regeneration (ALR) results in mitochondrial myopathy with cataracts, however, the mechanism for this disorder remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that loss of ALR, a principal component of the MIA40/ALR protein import pathway, results in impaired cytosolic Fe/S cluster biogenesis in mammalian cells. Mechanistically, MIA40/ALR facilitates the mitochondrial import of ATP binding cassette (ABC)-B8, an inner mitochondrial membrane protein required for cytoplasmic Fe/S cluster maturation, through physical interaction with ABCB8. Downregulation of ALR impairs mitochondrial ABCB8 import, reduces cytoplasmic Fe/S cluster maturation, and increases cellular iron through the iron regulatory protein-iron response element system. Our finding provides a mechanistic link between MIA40/ALR import machinery and cytosolic Fe/S cluster maturation through the mitochondrial import of ABCB8, and offers a potential explanation for the pathology seen in patients with ALR mutations.</content>

		<content type="html">
 The major barrier to curing HIV-1 infection is a small pool of latently infected cells that harbor replication-competent viruses, which are widely considered the origin of viral rebound when ART is interrupted. The difficulty of distinguishing latently infected cells from the vast majority of uninfected cells has represented a significant bottleneck precluding comprehensive understandings of HIV-1 latency. Here we reported and validated a newly-designed dual fluorescent reporter virus, DFV-B, infection with which in primary CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells can directly label latently infected cells and generate a latency model that was highly physiological relevant. Applying DFV-B infection in Jurkat T cells, we generated a stable cell line model of HIV-1 latency with diverse viral integration sites. High-throughput compound screening with this model identified ACY-1215 as a potent latency reversing agent, which could be verified in other cell models and in primary CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells from ART-suppressed individuals &lt;i&gt;ex vivo.&lt;/i&gt; In summary, we have generated a meaningful and feasible model to directly study latently infected cells, which could open up new avenues to explore the critical events of HIV-1 latency and become a valuable tool for the research of AIDS functional cure.</content>

 Single-cell measurements of cellular characteristics have been instrumental in understanding the heterogeneous pathways that drive differentiation, cellular responses to signals, and human disease. Recent advances have allowed paired capture of protein abundance and transcriptomic state, but a lack of epigenetic information in these assays has left a missing link to gene regulation. Using the heterogeneous mixture of cells in human peripheral blood as a test case, we developed a novel scATAC-seq workflow that increases signal-to-noise and allows paired measurement of cell surface markers and chromatin accessibility: integrated cellular indexing of chromatin landscape and epitopes, called ICICLE-seq. We extended this approach using a droplet-based multiomics platform to develop a trimodal assay that simultaneously measures transcriptomics (scRNA-seq), epitopes, and chromatin accessibility (scATAC-seq) from thousands of single cells, which we term TEA-seq. Together, these multimodal single-cell assays provide a novel toolkit to identify type-specific gene regulation and expression grounded in phenotypically defined cell types.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Actomyosin contractility is regulated by Rho-GTP in cell migration, cytokinesis and morphogenesis in embryo development. Whereas Rho activation by Rho-GTP exchange factor (GEF), RhoGEF2 is well known in actomyosin contractility during cytokinesis at the base of invaginating membranes in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; cellularization, Rho inhibition by RhoGTPase activating proteins (GAP) remains to be studied. We have found that the RhoGAP, GRAF inhibits actomyosin contractility during cellularization. GRAF is enriched at the cleavage furrow tip during actomyosin assembly and initiation of ring constriction. &lt;i&gt;Graf&lt;/i&gt; depletion shows increased Rho-GTP, increased Myosin II and ring hyper constriction dependent upon the loss of the RhoGTPase domain. GRAF and RhoGEF2 are present in a balance for appropriate activation of actomyosin ring constriction. RhoGEF2 depletion and abrogation of Myosin II activation in Rho Kinase mutants suppresses the &lt;i&gt;Graf &lt;/i&gt;hyper constriction defect. Therefore, GRAF recruitment restricts Rho-GTP levels in a spatiotemporal manner for inhibiting actomyosin contractility during cellularization.</content>

		<content type="html">
 We conducted a controlled before-and-after trial to evaluate the impact of an onsite urban sanitation intervention on the prevalence of enteric infection, soil transmitted helminth re-infection, and diarrhea among children in Maputo, Mozambique. A non-governmental organization replaced existing poor-quality latrines with pour-flush toilets with septic tanks serving household clusters. We enrolled children aged 1-48 months at baseline and measured outcomes before and 12 and 24 months after the intervention, with concurrent measurement among children in a comparable control arm. Despite nearly exclusive use, we found no evidence that intervention affected the prevalence of any measured outcome after 12 or 24 months of exposure. Among children born into study sites after intervention, we observed a reduced prevalence of &lt;i&gt;Trichuris&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Shigella&lt;/i&gt; infection relative to the same age group at baseline (&amp;lt;2 years old). Protection from birth may be important to reduce exposure to and infection with enteric pathogens in this setting.</content>

 NusA and NusG are transcription factors that stimulate RNA polymerase pausing in &lt;i&gt;Bacillus subtilis&lt;/i&gt;. While NusA was known to function as an intrinsic termination factor in &lt;i&gt;B. subtilis&lt;/i&gt;, the role of NusG in this process was unknown. To examine the individual and combinatorial roles that NusA and NusG play in intrinsic termination&lt;i&gt;, &lt;/i&gt;Term-seq was conducted in wild type, NusA depletion, D&lt;i&gt;nusG&lt;/i&gt;, and NusA depletion D&lt;i&gt;nusG &lt;/i&gt;strains. We determined that NusG functions as an intrinsic termination factor that works alone and cooperatively with NusA to facilitate termination at 88% of the 1400 identified intrinsic terminators. Our results indicate that NusG stimulates a sequence-specific pause that assists in the completion of suboptimal terminator hairpins with weak terminal A-U and G-U base pairs at the bottom of the stem. Loss of NusA and NusG leads to global misregulation of gene expression and loss of NusG results in flagella and swimming motility defects.</content>

 The Cellular Potts Model (CPM) is a powerful &lt;i&gt;in silico &lt;/i&gt;method for simulating biological processes at tissue scale. Their inherently graphical nature makes CPMs very accessible in theory, but in practice, they are mostly implemented in specialised frameworks users need to master before they can run simulations. We here present Artistoo (Artificial Tissue Toolbox), a JavaScript library for building 'explorable' CPM simulations where viewers can change parameters interactively, exploring their effects in real time. Simulations run directly in the web browser and do not require third-party software, plugins, or back-end servers. The JavaScript implementation imposes no major performance loss compared to frameworks written in C++; Artistoo remains sufficiently fast for interactive, real time simulations. Artistoo provides an opportunity to unlock CPM models for a broader audience: Interactive simulations can be shared via a URL in a &lt;i&gt;zero-install&lt;/i&gt; setting. We discuss applications in CPM research, science dissemination, open science, and education.</content>

 Objective
Mutations in the ATXN2 gene (CAG expansions ≥32 repeats) can be a rare cause of Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We recently reported that the stress granule (SG) protein Staufen1 (STAU1) was overabundant in neurodegenerative disorder spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) patient cells, animal models, and ALS‐TDP‐43 fibroblasts, and provided a link between SG formation and autophagy. We aimed to test if STAU1 overabundance has a role in the pathogenesis of other neurodegenerative diseases.


Methods
With multiple neurodegenerative patient‐derived cell models, animal models, and human postmortem ALS tissue, we evaluate STAU1 function using biochemical and immunohistological analyses.


Results
We demonstrate STAU1 overabundance and increased total and phosphorylated mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) in fibroblast cells from patients with ALS with mutations in TDP‐43, patients with dementia with PSEN1 mutations, a patient with parkinsonism with MAPT mutation, Huntington's disease (HD) mutations, and SCA2 mutations. Increased STAU1 levels and mTOR activity were seen in human ALS spinal cord tissues as well as in animal models. Changes in STAU1 and mTOR protein levels were post‐transcriptional. Exogenous expression of STAU1 in wildtype cells was sufficient to activate mTOR and downstream targets and form SGs. Targeting STAU1 by RNAi normalized mTOR, suggesting a potential role for therapy in diseases associated with STAU1 overabundance.


Interpretation
STAU1 overabundance in neurodegeneration is a common phenomenon associated with hyperactive mTOR. Targeting STAU1 with ASOs or miRNA viral vectors may represent a novel, efficacious therapy for neurodegenerative diseases characterized by overabundant STAU1. ANN NEUROL 2021</content>

 Objective
Migraine is a prevalent and disabling neurological disease. Its genesis is poorly understood, and there remains unmet clinical need. We aimed to identify mechanisms and thus novel therapeutic targets for migraine using human models of migraine and translational models in animals, with emphasis on amylin, a close relative of calcitonin gene‐related peptide (CGRP).


Methods
Thirty‐six migraine without aura patients were enrolled in a randomized, double‐blind, 2‐way, crossover, positive‐controlled clinical trial study to receive infusion of an amylin analogue pramlintide or human αCGRP on 2 different experimental days. Furthermore, translational studies in cells and mouse models, and rat, mouse and human tissue samples were conducted.


Results
Thirty patients (88%) developed headache after pramlintide infusion, compared to 33 (97%) after CGRP (p = 0.375). Fourteen patients (41%) developed migraine‐like attacks after pramlintide infusion, compared to 19 patients (56%) after CGRP (p = 0.180). The pramlintide‐induced migraine‐like attacks had similar clinical characteristics to those induced by CGRP. There were differences between treatments in vascular parameters. Human receptor pharmacology studies showed that an amylin receptor likely mediates these pramlintide‐provoked effects, rather than the canonical CGRP receptor. Supporting this, preclinical experiments investigating symptoms associated with migraine showed that amylin treatment, like CGRP, caused cutaneous hypersensitivity and light aversion in mice.


Interpretation
Our findings propose amylin receptor agonism as a novel contributor to migraine pathogenesis. Greater therapeutic gains could therefore be made for migraine patients through dual amylin and CGRP receptor antagonism, rather than selectively targeting the canonical CGRP receptor.

The brain is a network system in which excitatory and inhibitory neurons keep activity balanced in the highly non-random connectivity pattern of the microconnectome. It is well known that the relative percentage of inhibitory neurons is much smaller than excitatory neurons in the cortex. So, in general, how inhibitory neurons can keep the balance with the surrounding excitatory neurons is an important question. There is much accumulated knowledge about this fundamental question. This study quantitatively evaluated the relatively higher functional contribution of inhibitory neurons in terms of not only properties of individual neurons, such as firing rate, but also in terms of topological mechanisms and controlling ability on other excitatory neurons. We combined simultaneous electrical recording (~2.5 hours) of ~1000 neurons in vitro, and quantitative evaluation of neuronal interactions including excitatory-inhibitory categorization. This study accurately defined recording brain anatomical targets, such as brain regions and cortical layers, by inter-referring MRI and immunostaining recordings. The interaction networks enabled us to quantify topological influence of individual neurons, in terms of controlling ability to other neurons. Especially, the result indicated that highly influential inhibitory neurons show higher controlling ability of other neurons than excitatory neurons, and are relatively often distributed in deeper layers of the cortex. Furthermore, the neurons having high controlling ability are more effectively limited in number than central nodes of k-cores, and these neurons also participate in more clustered motifs. In summary, this study suggested that the high controlling ability of inhibitory neurons is a key mechanism to keep balance with a large number of other excitatory neurons beyond simple higher firing rate. Application of the selection method of limited important neurons would be also applicable for the ability to effectively and selectively stimulate E/I imbalanced disease states.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/08xK9fPbAeM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Variation in the acoustic structure of vocal signals is important to communicate social information. However, relatively little is known about the features that receivers extract to decipher relevant social information. Here, we took an expansive, bottom-up approach to delineate the feature space that could be important for processing social information in zebra finch song. Using operant techniques, we discovered that female zebra finches can consistently discriminate brief song phrases (“motifs”) from different social contexts. We then applied machine learning algorithms to classify motifs based on thousands of time-series features and to uncover acoustic features for motif discrimination. In addition to highlighting classic acoustic features, the resulting algorithm revealed novel features for song discrimination, for example, measures of time irreversibility (i.e., the degree to which the statistical properties of the actual and time-reversed signal differ). Moreover, the algorithm accurately predicted female performance on individual motif exemplars. These data underscore and expand the promise of broad time-series phenotyping to acoustic analyses and social decision-making.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/KiTCUWTx8Pk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 Pancreatic transcription factor 1a (Ptf1a) expressing serial sister cell types of the mammalian cerebellum and dorsal cochlear nucleus are supposed to share genetic programs. We show that two out of three Ptf1a lineal cell types differ with respect to their Ladybird homeobox protein homolog 1 expression. Our results uncover an unexpected genetic incongruence.







Abstract
The dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) is a mammalian‐specific nucleus of the auditory system. Anatomically, it is classified as a cerebellum‐like structure. These structures are proposed to share genetic programs with the cerebellum. Previous analyses demonstrated that inhibitory serial sister cell types (SCTs) of the DCN and cerebellum are derived from the pancreatic transcription factor 1a (Ptf1a) lineage. Postmitotic neurons of the Ptf1a lineage often express the transcription factor Ladybird homeobox protein homolog 1 (Lbx1) which is involved in neuronal cell fate determination. Lbx1 is therefore an attractive candidate for a further component of the genetic program shared between the DCN and cerebellum. Here, we used cell‐type specific marker analysis in combination with an Lbx1 reporter mouse line to analyze in both tissues which cell types of the Ptf1a lineage express Lbx1. In the DCN, stellate cells and Purkinje‐like cartwheel cells were part of the Lbx1 lineage and Golgi cells were not, as determined by cell counts. In contrast, in the cerebellum, stellate cells and Golgi cells were part of the Lbx1 lineage and Purkinje cells were not. Hence, two out of three phenotypically similar cell types differed with respect to their Lbx1 expression. Our study demonstrates that Lbx1 is differentially recruited to the developmental genetic program of inhibitory neurons both within a given tissue and between the DCN and cerebellum. The differential expression of Lbx1 within the DCN and the cerebellum might contribute to the genetic individuation of the inhibitory SCTs to adapt to circuit specific tasks.</content>

 Using monosynaptic rabies virus tracing, we have identified the distribution of input cells to basolateral amygdala (BLA) neuronal subtypes defined by axonal projection patterns. Overall, central nucleus of amygdala‐, nucleus accumbens‐, ventral hippocampus‐projecting BLA neurons receive similar monosynaptic input from various brain regions. However, there are some preferential input patterns among the subtypes, which are likely to be attributed to the differential localization of the starter cells.







Abstract
The basolateral amygdala (BLA), a region critical for emotional processing, is the limbic hub that is connected with various brain regions. BLA neurons are classified into different subtypes that exhibit differential projection patterns and mediate distinct emotional behaviors; however, little is known about their presynaptic input patterns. In this study, we employed projection‐specific monosynaptic rabies virus tracing to identify the direct monosynaptic inputs to BLA subtypes. We found that each neuronal subtype receives long‐range projection input from specific brain regions. In contrast to their specific axonal projection patterns, all BLA neuronal subtypes exhibited relatively similar input patterns. This anatomical organization supports the idea that the BLA is a central integrator that associates sensory information in different modalities with valence and sends associative information to behaviorally relevant brain regions.</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Anatomical tracing, human clinical data, and stimulation functional imaging have firmly established the major role of the (neo-)cerebellum in cognition and emotion. Telencephalization characterized by the great expansion of associative cortices, especially the prefrontal one, has been associated with parallel expansion of the neocerebellar cortex, especially the lobule VII, and by an increased number of interconnections between these two cortical structures. These anatomical modifications underlie the implication of the neocerebellum in cognitive control of complex motor and non-motor tasks. In humans, resting state functional connectivity has been used to determine a thorough anatomo-functional parcellation of the neocerebellum. This technique has identified central networks involving the neocerebellum and subserving its cognitive function. Neocerebellum participates in all intrinsic connected networks such as central executive, default mode, salience, dorsal and ventral attentional, and language-dedicated networks. The central executive network constitutes the main circuit represented within the neocerebellar cortex. Cerebellar zones devoted to these intrinsic networks appear multiple, interdigitated, and spatially ordered in three gradients. Such complex neocerebellar organization enables the neocerebellum to monitor and synchronize the main networks involved in cognition and emotion, likely by computing internal models.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 The lateral protocerebrum of a shore crab possesses a stalked center, adjacent to the optic lobe, that supports long‐term visual habituation. The center has been claimed as the homologue of the insect mushroom body. However, the discovery of an inverted mushroom body (MB) equipped with the canonical features of columns (Clm) and calyces (Ca) supplied by thousands of globuli cells (gc) dismisses that claim. Comparisons across malacostracan crustaceans confirm that the habituation center is a reniform body (RB), first described by Bellonci in 1882.






Abstract
In one species of shore crab (Brachyura, Varunidae) a center that supports long‐term visual habituation and that matches the reniform body’s morphology has been claimed as a homologue of the insect mushroom body despite lacking traits that define it as such. The discovery in a related species of shore crab of a mushroom body possessing those defining traits renders that interpretation unsound. Two phenotypically distinct, coexisting centers cannot both be homologues of the insect mushroom body. The present commentary outlines the history of research leading to misidentification of the reniform body as a mushroom body. One conclusion is that if both centers support learning and memory, this would be viewed as a novel and fascinating attribute of the pancrustacean brain.

 &lt;p&gt;We introduce an exactly integrable version of the well-known leaky
integrate-and-fire (LIF) model, with continuous membrane potential at the
spiking event, the c-LIF. We investigate the dynamical regimes of a fully
connected network of excitatory c-LIF neurons in the presence of short-term
synaptic plasticity. By varying the coupling strength among neurons, we show
that a complex chaotic dynamics arises, characterized by scale free avalanches.
The origin of this phenomenon in the c-LIF can be related to the order symmetry
breaking in neurons spike-times, which corresponds to the onset of a broad
activity distribution. Our analysis uncovers a general mechanism through which
networks of simple neurons can be attracted to a complex basin in the phase
space.

 &lt;p&gt;Designing robots by hand can be costly and time consuming, especially if the
robots have to be created with novel materials, or be robust to internal or
external changes. In order to create robots automatically, without the need for
human intervention, it is necessary to optimise both the behaviour and the body
design of the robot. However, when co-optimising the morphology and controller
of a locomoting agent the morphology tends to converge prematurely, reaching a
local optimum. Approaches such as explicit protection of morphological
innovation have been used to reduce this problem, but it might also be possible
to increase exploration of morphologies using a more indirect approach. We
explore how changing the environment, where the agent locomotes, affects the
convergence of morphologies. The agents' morphologies and controllers are
co-optimised, while the environments the agents locomote in are evolved
open-endedly with the Paired Open-Ended Trailblazer (POET). We compare the
diversity, fitness and robustness of agents evolving in environments generated
by POET to agents evolved in handcrafted curricula of environments. Our agents
each contain of a population of individuals being evolved with a genetic
algorithm. This population is called the agent-population. We show that
agent-populations evolving in open-endedly evolving environments exhibit larger
morphological diversity than agent-populations evolving in hand crafted
curricula of environments. POET proved capable of creating a curriculum of
environments which encouraged both diversity and quality in the populations.
This suggests that POET may be capable of reducing premature convergence in
co-optimisation of morphology and controllers.

 &lt;p&gt;System identification poses a significant bottleneck to characterizing and
controlling complex systems. This challenge is greatest when both the system
states and parameters are not directly accessible leading to a dual-estimation
problem. Current approaches to such problems are limited in their ability to
scale with many-parameter systems as often occurs in networks. In the current
work, we present a new, computationally efficient approach to treat large
dual-estimation problems. Our approach consists of directly integrating
pseudo-optimal state estimation (the Extended Kalman Filter) into a
dual-optimization objective, leaving a differentiable cost/error function of
only in terms of the unknown system parameters which we solve using numerical
gradient/Hessian methods. Intuitively, our approach consists of solving for the
parameters that generate the most accurate state estimator (Extended Kalman
Filter). We demonstrate that our approach is at least as accurate in state and
parameter estimation as joint Kalman Filters (Extended/Unscented), despite
lower complexity. We demonstrate the utility of our approach by inverting
anatomically-detailed individualized brain models from human
magnetoencephalography (MEG) data.

 &lt;p&gt;Inhibitory neurons play a crucial role in maintaining persistent neuronal
activity. Although connected extensively through electrical synapses
(gap-junctions), these neurons also exhibit interactions through chemical
synapses in certain regions of the brain. When the coupling is sufficiently
strong, the effects of these two synaptic modalities combine in a nonlinear
way. Hence, in this work, we focus on the strong inhibition regime and identify
the parametric conditions that result in the emergence of self-sustained
oscillations in systems of coupled excitable neurons, in the presence of a
brief sub-threshold stimulus. Our investigation on the dynamics in a minimal
network of two neurons reveals a rich set of dynamical behaviors viz., periodic
and various complex oscillations including period-n (n=2,4,8...) dynamics and
chaos. We further extend our study by considering a system of inhibitory
neurons arranged in a one-dimensional ring topology and determine the optimal
conditions for sustained activity. Our work highlights the nonlinear dynamical
behavior arising due to the combined effects of gap-junctions and strong
synaptic inhibition, which can have potential implications in maintaining
robust memory patterns.

 &lt;p&gt;A formulation of Langevin dynamics for discrete systems is derived as a class
of generic stochastic processes. The dynamics simplify for a two-state system

successfully quantitative exact results of Boltzmann distributed systems by LIF
neurons. Besides a detailed introduction of the dynamics, different simplified
models of a neuromorphic hardware system are studied with respect to a control
of emerging sources of errors.

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Structural and functional abnormalities in the cerebellar midline region, including the fastigial nucleus, have been reported in neuropsychiatric disorders, also comprising the cerebellar cognitive affecting syndrome. In rats, early fastigial lesions reduce social interaction during development and lead to cognitive and emotional deficits in adults, accompanied by compromised neuronal network activity. Since epigenetic mechanisms are implicated in the etiology of neuropsychiatric disorders, we investigated whether fastigial nucleus lesions in juvenile rats would impact epigenetic regulation of neural transmission. The fastigial nucleus was lesioned bilaterally in 23-day-old male rats. Sham-lesion and naïve rats served as controls. DNA methylation was investigated for target genes of the GABAergic, dopaminergic, glutamatergic and oxytocinergic systems in brain regions with anatomic connections to the fastigial nucleus, i.e., medial prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, striatum, thalamus, and sensorimotor cortex. Protein expression was examined for the respective target genes in case of altered DNA methylation between lesion and control groups. Lesioning of the fastigial nucleus led to significant differences in the epigenetic regulation of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;glutamate decarboxylase 1&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;oxytocin receptor&lt;/em&gt; in the nucleus accumbens and the prefrontal cortex. No differences were found for the other target genes and brain regions. Our findings indicate that epigenetic dysregulation after lesioning of the fastigial nucleus may influence long-term recovery and the emergence of behavioral changes. Together with previous behavioral and electrophysiological investigations of this rat model, these observations can play a role in the cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome and other neuropsychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder, and its pathogenesis is not fully known. Although there are several hypotheses, such as neuroinflammation, tau hyperphosphorylation, amyloid-β plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and oxidative stress, none of them completely explain the origin and progression of AD. Emerging evidence suggests that gut microbiota and epigenetics can directly influence the pathogenesis of AD via their effects on multiple pathways, including neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and amyloid protein. Various gut microbes such as &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Actinobacteria&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Bacteroidetes&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Firmicutes&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Proteobacteria&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Tenericutes&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Verrucomicrobia&lt;/em&gt; are known to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of AD. These microbes and their metabolites modulate various physiological processes that contribute to AD pathogenesis, such as neuroinflammation and other inflammatory processes, amyloid deposition, cytokine storm syndrome, altered BDNF and NMDA signaling, impairing neurodevelopmental processes. Likewise, epigenetic markers associated with AD mainly include histone modifications and DNA methylation, which are under the direct control of a variety of enzymes, such as acetylases and methylases. The activity of these enzymes is dependent upon the metabolites generated by the host’s gut microbiome, suggesting the significance of epigenetics in AD pathogenesis. It is interesting to know that both gut microbiota and epigenetics are dynamic processes and show a high degree of variation according to diet, stressors, and environmental factors. The bidirectional relation between the gut microbiota and epigenetics suggests that they might work in synchrony to modulate AD representation, its pathogenesis, and progression. They both also provide numerous targets for early diagnostic biomarkers and for the development of AD therapeutics. This review discusses the gut microbiota and epigenetics connection in the pathogenesis of AD and aims to highlight vast opportunities for diagnosis and therapeutics of AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec1&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Dementia with Lewy bodies remains underdiagnosed in clinical practice mainly because of the low sensitivity of existing diagnostic criteria and a strong overlap with Alzheimer’s pathology that can mask the Lewy phenotype.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Objective&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The objective of this study was therefore to develop and validate a new clinical scale designed to detect signs of Lewy body disease, called LeSCoD for Lewy body Screening scale in Cognitive Disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;128 patients who fulfilled the clinical criteria of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 32), Alzheimer’s disease (AD; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 77) or both (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 19) was prospectively enrolled. &lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-DOPA PET imaging and/or CSF biomarkers were available in some patients. LeSCoD scale was systematically administered and the potential correlation with &lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-DOPA PET imaging was evaluated in a subgroup of patients.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;LeSCoD scale showed robust internal and external validity. We determined a cut-off of 10 above which the sensitivity and specificity for Lewy body disease diagnosis were 86% and 95%, respectively. The LeSCoD scale correlated with striatal dopamine uptake in &lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-DOPA PET.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec5&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;LeSCoD scale is a simple and reliable tool for the evaluation of Lewy body disease in routine clinical practice, with a higher sensitivity and specificity than the existing criteria. It might be an alternative to the use of dopamine-specific imaging.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec1&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Objective&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Niemann Pick disease type C (NPC) is a rare progressive neurovisceral lysosomal disorder caused by autosomal recessive mutations in the NPC1 or NPC2 genes. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is a positron-emitting glucose analogue for non-invasive imaging of brain metabolism. FDG PET is commonly used for dementia imaging but its specific application to NPC is rarely described.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This is a retrospective study of all baseline brain FDG PET performed for NPC patients. Images were assessed using a normal database statistical comparison of metabolic changes expressed in standard deviations and three-dimensional Stereotactic Surface Projection maps. Typical hypometabolic patterns in NPC were identified. We further investigated any correlation between the degree of regional brain hypometabolism and the Iturriaga clinical severity scale.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Brain FDG PET images of 14 adolescent–adult NPC patients were analysed, with mean age of 35 years. We found significant frontal lobe hypometabolism in 12 patients (86%), thalamic hypometabolism in eight patients (57%) and variable parietal lobe hypometabolism in 13 patients (93%). Hypometabolic changes were usually bilateral and symmetric. Ten out of 13 ataxic patients showed cerebellar or thalamic hypometabolism (sensitivity 77%, specificity 100%). Linear regression analysis showed frontal lobe hypometabolism to have the best correlation with the Iturriaga clinical scale (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;R&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.439; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.01).&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We found bilateral symmetric hypometabolism of the frontal lobes, thalami and parietal lobes (especially posterior cingulate gyrus) to be typical of adolescent–adult NPC. Ataxia was commonly associated with cerebellar or thalamic hypometabolism. Frontal lobe hypometabolism showed the best inverse correlation with clinical severity.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Previous research shows that individuals who tend to get bored frequently and intensely—the highly boredom prone—are more likely to engage in risky behaviors. However, these studies are based largely on self-reports. Here we address this gap and suggest that noisy decision-making (DM) is a potential driver for this relationship between boredom proneness and risk-taking. In Study 1, eighty-six participants completed the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART) while EEG was recorded. We found blunted feedback processing with higher boredom proneness, as indexed by reduced feedback-P3 amplitudes. Risk taking, as indexed by the BART, was not higher in the highly boredom prone. In Study 2a (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 404) we directly tested the noisy DM hypothesis in an online sample using a binary choice task, and found that with higher boredom proneness, participants were more likely to alternate between choices on a trial-to-trial basis, but were not more likely to choose the risky alternative. These findings were replicated in a new sample (Study 2b), and extended to the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT; Study 3). In the IGT we found increased choice switching and reduced feedback sensitivity with higher boredom proneness. Once again, higher risk taking as indexed by the IGT was not evident in the highly boredom prone. Overall, our findings suggest that boredom proneness is associated with noisy decision-making (i.e., a tendency to alternate more between choice options regardless of risk level), and not risk-seeking per se. That is, the highly boredom prone are not necessarily attracted to risks, but rather, may be insensitive to risks due to reduced feedback sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Ischemic stroke is a worldwide complex brain disease that results in numerous disabilities and deaths. It leads to the deprivation of oxygen and glucose, which causes energy failure and neuronal death. The activation of astrocytes contributes to neuronal damage or repair after brain ischemia/reperfusion, although astrocytes get little attention as potential drug targets. This study investigated the protective effects of Astragaloside IV (AS-IV) on oxygen glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R)-induced damage in rat primary cultured astrocytes and the underlying molecular mechanism. The results showed that compared with the control group, astrocytes under OGD/R exposure significantly decreased cell viability and increased the number of apoptotic cells, whereas AS-IV evidently protected the astrocytes against OGD/R-induced cell damage. In addition, low and medium concentrations of AS-IV can promote the increase of intracellular superoxide dismutase (SOD) level, as well as restored the morphological changes caused by OGD/R exposure. Supplementation with AS-IV after OGD/R exposure promoted the expression of oxidation and apoptosis indexes and further study demonstrated that AS-IV inhibited CXCR4 receptor and downregulated the activation of p-JNK/JNK pathway, which suppressed the expression of Bax/Bcl-2, and finally uprising Nrf2/Keap1 signaling. In conclusion, these findings revealed that AS-IV protected against OGD/R-induced astrocytes through inhibiting oxidative stress and apoptotic pathways.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Brain homeostasis is the dynamic equilibrium whereby physiological parameters are kept actively within a specific range. The homeostatic range is not fixed and may change throughout the individual's lifespan, or may be transiently modified in the presence of severe perturbations. The endocannabinoid system has emerged as a safeguard of homeostasis, e.g., it modulates neurotransmission and protects neurons from prolonged or excessively strong activation. We used genetically engineered mouse lines that lack the cannabinoid type-1 receptor (CB1) either in dorsal telencephalic glutamatergic or in forebrain GABAergic neurons to create new allostatic states, resulting from alterations in the excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance. Previous studies with these two mouse lines have shown dichotomic results in the context of behavior, neuronal morphology, and electrophysiology. Thus, we aimed at analyzing the transcriptomic profile of the hippocampal CA region from these mice in the basal condition and after a mild behavioral stimulation (open field). Our results provide insights into the gene networks that compensate chronic E/I imbalances. Among these, there are differentially expressed genes involved in neuronal and synaptic functions, synaptic plasticity, and the regulation of behavior. Interestingly, some of these genes, e.g., Rab3b, Crhbp, and Kcnn2, and related pathways showed a dichotomic expression, i.e., they are up-regulated in one mutant line and down-regulated in the other one. Subsequent interrogation on the source of the alterations at transcript level were applied using exon-intron split analysis. However, no strong directions toward transcriptional or post-transcriptional regulation comparing both mouse lines were observed. Altogether, the dichotomic gene expression observed and their involved signaling pathways are of interest because they may act as “switches” to modulate the directionality of neural homeostasis, which then is relevant for pathologies, such as stress-related disorders and epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a very well-established and effective treatment for patients with extrapyramidal diseases. Despite its generally favorable clinical efficacy, some undesirable outcomes associated with DBS have been reported. Among such complications are incidences of suicidal ideation (SI) and behavior (SB) in patients undergoing this neurosurgical procedure. However, causal associations between DBS and increased suicide risk are not demonstrated and they constitute a debated issue. In light of these observations, the main objective of this work is to provide a comprehensive and unbiased overview of the literature on suicide risk in patients who received subthalamic nucleus (STN) and internal part of globus pallidum (GPi) DBS treatment. Additionally, putative mechanisms that might be involved in the development of SI and SB in these patients as well as caveats associated with these hypotheses are introduced. Finally, we briefly propose some clinical implications, including therapeutic strategies addressing these potential disease mechanisms. While a mechanistic connection between DBS and suicidality remains a controversial topic that requires further investigation, it is of critical importance to consider suicide risk as an integral component of candidate selection and post-operative care in DBS.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The overarching goal was to resolve a major barrier to real-life prosthesis usability—the rapid degradation of prosthesis control systems, which require frequent recalibrations. Specifically, we sought to develop and test a motor decoder that provides (1) highly accurate, real-time movement response, and (2) unprecedented adaptability to dynamic changes in the amputee’s biological state, thereby supporting long-term integrity of control performance with few recalibrations. To achieve that, an adaptive motor decoder was designed to auto-switch between algorithms in real-time. The decoder detects the initial aggregate motoneuron spiking activity from the motor pool, then engages the optimal parameter settings for decoding the motoneuron spiking activity in that particular state. “Clear-box” testing of decoder performance under varied physiological conditions and post-amputation complications was conducted by comparing the movement output of a simulated prosthetic hand as driven by the decoded signal vs. as driven by the actual signal. Pearson’s correlation coefficient and Normalized Root Mean Square Error were used to quantify the accuracy of the decoder’s output. Our results show that the decoder algorithm extracted the features of the intended movement and drove the simulated prosthetic hand accurately with real-time performance (&amp;lt;10 ms) (Pearson’s correlation coefficient &amp;gt;0.98 to &amp;gt;0.99 and Normalized Root Mean Square Error &amp;lt;13–5%). Further, the decoder robustly decoded the spiking activity of multi-speed inputs, inputs generated from reversed motoneuron recruitment, and inputs reflecting substantial biological heterogeneity of motoneuron properties, also in real-time. As the amputee’s neuromodulatory state changes throughout the day and the electrical properties and ratio of slower vs. faster motoneurons shift over time post-amputation, the motor decoder presented here adapts to such changes in real-time and is thus expected to greatly enhance and extend the usability of prostheses.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Aim&lt;p&gt;The objective of this work was to demonstrate the usefulness of a novel statistical method to study the impact of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) on brain connectivity in patients with depression using different stimulation protocols, i.e., 1 Hz repetitive TMS over the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) (protocol G1), 10 Hz repetitive TMS over the left DLPFC (G2), and intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) consisting of three 50 Hz burst bundle repeated at 5 Hz frequency (G3).&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Electroencephalography (EEG) connectivity analysis was performed using Directed Transfer Function (DTF) and a set of 21 indices based on graph theory. The statistical analysis of graph-theoretic indices consisted of a combination of the k-NN rule, the leave-one-out method, and a statistical test using a 2 × 2 contingency table.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Our new statistical approach allowed for selection of the best set of graph-based indices derived from DTF, and for differentiation between conditions (i.e., before and after TMS) and between TMS protocols. The effects of TMS was found to differ based on frequency band.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;A set of four brain asymmetry measures were particularly useful to study protocol- and frequency-dependent effects of TMS on brain connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;Significance&lt;p&gt;The new approach would allow for better evaluation of the therapeutic effects of TMS and choice of the most appropriate stimulation protocol.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a heterogenous neurodevelopmental disorder which is characterized by impaired communication, and limited social interactions. The shortcomings of current clinical approaches which are based exclusively on behavioral observation of symptomology, and poor understanding of the neurological mechanisms underlying ASD necessitates the identification of new biomarkers that can aid in study of brain development, and functioning, and can lead to accurate and early detection of ASD. In this paper, we developed a deep-learning model called ASD-SAENet for classifying patients with ASD from typical control subjects using fMRI data. We designed and implemented a sparse autoencoder (SAE) which results in optimized extraction of features that can be used for classification. These features are then fed into a deep neural network (DNN) which results in superior classification of fMRI brain scans more prone to ASD. Our proposed model is trained to optimize the classifier while improving extracted features based on both reconstructed data error and the classifier error. We evaluated our proposed deep-learning model using publicly available Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) dataset collected from 17 different research centers, and include more than 1,035 subjects. Our extensive experimentation demonstrate that ASD-SAENet exhibits comparable accuracy (70.8%), and superior specificity (79.1%) for the whole dataset as compared to other methods. Further, our experiments demonstrate superior results as compared to other state-of-the-art methods on 12 out of the 17 imaging centers exhibiting superior generalizability across different data acquisition sites and protocols. The implemented code is available on GitHub portal of our lab at: https://github.com/pcdslab/ASD-SAENet.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Over the last few decades, electroencephalogram (EEG) has become one of the most vital tools used by physicians to diagnose several neurological disorders of the human brain and, in particular, to detect seizures. Because of its peculiar nature, the consequent impact of epileptic seizures on the quality of life of patients made the precise diagnosis of epilepsy extremely essential. Therefore, this article proposes a novel deep-learning approach for detecting seizures in pediatric patients based on the classification of raw multichannel EEG signal recordings that are minimally pre-processed. The new approach takes advantage of the automatic feature learning capabilities of a two-dimensional deep convolution autoencoder (2D-DCAE) linked to a neural network-based classifier to form a unified system that is trained in a supervised way to achieve the best classification accuracy between the ictal and interictal brain state signals. For testing and evaluating our approach, two models were designed and assessed using three different EEG data segment lengths and a 10-fold cross-validation scheme. Based on five evaluation metrics, the best performing model was a supervised deep convolutional autoencoder (SDCAE) model that uses a bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) – based classifier, and EEG segment length of 4 s. Using the public dataset collected from the Children’s Hospital Boston (CHB) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), this model has obtained 98.79 ± 0.53% accuracy, 98.72 ± 0.77% sensitivity, 98.86 ± 0.53% specificity, 98.86 ± 0.53% precision, and an F1-score of 98.79 ± 0.53%, respectively. Based on these results, our new approach was able to present one of the most effective seizure detection methods compared to other existing state-of-the-art methods applied to the same dataset.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Persistent cohomology is a powerful technique for discovering topological structure in data. Strategies for its use in neuroscience are still undergoing development. We comprehensively and rigorously assess its performance in simulated neural recordings of the brain's spatial representation system. Grid, head direction, and conjunctive cell populations each span low-dimensional topological structures embedded in high-dimensional neural activity space. We evaluate the ability for persistent cohomology to discover these structures for different dataset dimensions, variations in spatial tuning, and forms of noise. We quantify its ability to decode simulated animal trajectories contained within these topological structures. We also identify regimes under which mixtures of populations form product topologies that can be detected. Our results reveal how dataset parameters affect the success of topological discovery and suggest principles for applying persistent cohomology, as well as persistent homology, to experimental neural recordings.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The Keap1-Nrf2 signaling axis is a validated and promising target for cellular defense and survival pathways. This minireview discusses the potential off-target effects and their impact on future drug development originating from Keap1-targeting small molecules that function as displacement activators of the redox-sensitive transcription factor Nrf2. We argue that small-molecule displacement activators, similarly to electrophiles, will release both Nrf2 and other Keap1 client proteins from the ubiquitin ligase complex. This non-specificity is likely unavoidable and may result in off-target effects during Nrf2 activation by targeting Keap1. The small molecule displacement activators may also target Kelch domains in proteins other than Keap1, causing additional off-target effects unless designed to ensure specificity for the Kelch domain only in Keap1. A potentially promising and alternative therapeutic approach to overcome this non-specificity emerging from targeting Keap1 is to inhibit the Nrf2 repressor Bach1 for constitutive activation of the Nrf2 pathway and bypass the Keap1-Nrf2 complex.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;COVID-19 pandemic has already produced great impacts on global health security and social-economy. Elderly, particularly those with underlying diseases, are suffering from higher fatality rate. Neurodegenerative diseases are a group of incurable neurological disorders of loss of neuron and/or myelin sheath, which affect hundreds of millions of elderly populations and usually need long-term care. Older population is one of the most vulnerable to COVID-19 pandemic. In this report, we reviewed the current status of COVID-19 on the patients with several neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, prion disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Meanwhile, the potential mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases were also summarized.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Individuals with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) are at an elevated risk of dementia and exhibit deficits in cognition and cortical gray matter (GM) volume, thickness, and microstructure. Meanwhile, exercise training appears to preserve brain function and macrostructure may help delay or prevent the onset of dementia in individuals with MCI. Yet, our understanding of the neurophysiological effects of exercise training in individuals with MCI remains limited. Recent work suggests that the measures of gray matter microstructure using diffusion imaging may be sensitive to early cognitive and neurophysiological changes in the aging brain. Therefore, this study is aimed to determine the effects of exercise training in cognition and cortical gray matter microstructure in individuals with MCI vs. cognitively healthy older adults. Fifteen MCI participants and 17 cognitively intact controls (HC) volunteered for a 12-week supervised walking intervention. Following the intervention, MCI and HC saw improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness, performance on Trial 1 of the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT), a measure of verbal memory, and the Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT), a measure of verbal fluency. After controlling for age, a voxel-wise analysis of cortical gray matter diffusivity showed individuals with MCI exhibited greater increases in mean diffusivity (MD) in the left insular cortex than HC. This increase in MD was positively associated with improvements in COWAT performance. Additionally, after controlling for age, the voxel-wise analysis indicated a main effect of Time with both groups experiencing an increase in left insular and left and right cerebellar MD. Increases in left insular diffusivity were similarly found to be positively associated with improvements in COWAT performance in both groups, while increases in cerebellar MD were related to gains in episodic memory performance. These findings suggest that exercise training may be related to improvements in neural circuits that govern verbal fluency performance in older adults through the microstructural remodeling of cortical gray matter. Furthermore, changes in left insular cortex microstructure may be particularly relevant to improvements in verbal fluency among individuals diagnosed with MCI.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;As the main immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS), microglia regulates normal development, homeostasis and general brain physiology. These functions put microglia at the forefront of CNS repair and recovery. Uncontrolled activation of microglia is related to the course of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease. It is clear that the classic pathologies of amyloid β (Aβ) and Tau are usually accompanied by the activation of microglia, and the activation of microglia also serves as an early event in the pathogenesis of AD. Therefore, during the occurrence and development of AD, the key susceptibility factors for AD—apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype, sex and age—may further interact with microglia to exacerbate neurodegeneration. In this review, we discuss the role of microglia in the progression of AD related to the three risk factors for AD: APOE genotype, sex and aging. APOE-expressing microglia accumulates around Aβ plaques, and the presence of APOE4 may disrupt the phagocytosis of Aβ aggregates and aggravate neurodegeneration in Tau disease models. In addition, females have a high incidence of AD, and normal female microglia and estrogen have protective effects under normal conditions. However, under the influence of AD, female microglia seem to lose their protective effect and instead accelerate the course of AD. Aging, another major risk factor, may increase the sensitivity of microglia, leading to the exacerbation of microglial dysfunction in elderly AD. Obviously, in the role of microglia in AD, the three main risk factors of APOE, sex, and aging are not independent and have synergistic effects that contribute to the risk of AD. Moreover, new microglia can replace dysfunctional microglia after microglial depletion, which is a new promising strategy for AD treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 The BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech) is being utilised internationally for mass COVID-19 vaccination. Evidence of single-dose protection against symptomatic disease has encouraged some countries to opt for delayed booster doses of BNT162b2, but the effect of this strategy on rates of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection remains unknown. We previously demonstrated frequent pauci- and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection amongst healthcare workers (HCWs) during the UK’s first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, using a comprehensive PCR-based HCW screening programme (Rivett et al., 2020; Jones et al., 2020). Here, we evaluate the effect of first-dose BNT162b2 vaccination on test positivity rates, and find a four-fold reduction in asymptomatic infection amongst HCWs ≥12 days post-vaccination. These data provide real-world evidence of short-term protection against asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection following a single dose of BNT162b2 vaccine, suggesting that mass first-dose vaccination will reduce SARS-CoV-2 &lt;i&gt;transmission&lt;/i&gt;, as well as the burden of COVID-19 &lt;i&gt;disease&lt;/i&gt;.</content>

 Innate immune cellular effectors are actively consumed during systemic inflammation but the systemic traffic and the mechanisms that support their replenishment remain unknown. Here we demonstrate that acute systemic inflammation induces the emergent activation of a previously unrecognized system of rapid migration of granulocyte-macrophage progenitors and committed macrophage-dendritic progenitors, but not other progenitors or stem cells, from bone marrow (BM) to regional lymphatic capillaries. The progenitor traffic to the systemic lymphatic circulation is mediated by Ccl19/Ccr7 and is NFkB independent, Traf6/IkB-kinase/SNAP23 activation dependent, and is responsible for the secretion of pre-stored Ccl19 by a subpopulation of CD205&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/CD172a&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; conventional dendritic cells type 2 (cDC2) and upregulation of BM myeloid progenitor Ccr7 signaling. Mature myeloid Traf6 signaling is anti-inflammatory and necessary for lymph node (LN) myeloid cell development. This report unveils the existence and the mechanistic basis of a very early direct traffic of myeloid progenitors from BM to lymphatics during inflammation.</content>

 Automated segmentation of cellular electron microscopy (EM) datasets remains a challenge. Supervised deep learning (DL) methods that rely on region-of-interest (ROI) annotations yield models that fail to generalize to unrelated datasets. Newer unsupervised DL algorithms require relevant pre-training images, however, pre-training on currently available EM datasets is computationally expensive and shows little value for unseen biological contexts, as these datasets are large and homogeneous. To address this issue, we present CEM500K, a nimble 25 GB dataset of 0.5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; unique 2D cellular EM images curated from nearly 600 three-dimensional (3D) and 10,000 two-dimensional (2D) images from &amp;gt;100 unrelated imaging projects. We show that models pre-trained on CEM500K learn features that are biologically relevant and resilient to meaningful image augmentations. Critically, we evaluate transfer learning from these pre-trained models on six publicly available and one newly derived benchmark segmentation task and report state-of-the-art results on each. We release the CEM500K dataset, pre-trained models and curation pipeline for model building and further expansion by the EM community.

		<content type="html">
 Self-motion signals, distributed ubiquitously across parietal-temporal lobes, propagate to limbic hippocampal system for vector-based navigation via hubs including posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and retrosplenial cortex (RSC). Although numerous studies have indicated posterior cingulate areas are involved in spatial tasks, it is unclear how their neurons represent self-motion signals. Providing translation and rotation stimuli to macaques on a 6-degree-of-freedom motion platform, we discovered robust vestibular responses in PCC. A combined three-dimensional spatiotemporal model captured data well and revealed multiple temporal components including velocity, acceleration, jerk, and position. Compared to PCC, RSC contained moderate vestibular temporal modulations and lacked significant spatial tuning. Visual self-motion signals were much weaker in both regions compared to the vestibular signals. We conclude that macaque posterior cingulate region carries vestibular-dominant self-motion signals with plentiful temporal components that could be useful for path integration.</content>

 Interval timing is a fundamental component of action, and is susceptible to motor-related temporal distortions. Previous studies have shown that concurrent movement biases temporal estimates, but have primarily considered self-modulated movement only. However, real-world encounters often include situations in which movement is restricted or perturbed by environmental factors. In the following experiments, we introduced viscous movement environments to externally modulate movement and investigated the resulting effects on temporal perception. In two separate tasks, participants timed auditory intervals while moving a robotic arm that randomly applied four levels of viscosity. Results demonstrated that higher viscosity led to shorter perceived durations. Using a drift-diffusion model and a Bayesian observer model, we confirmed these biasing effects arose from perceptual mechanisms, instead of biases in decision making. These findings suggest that environmental perturbations are an important factor in movement-related temporal distortions, and enhance the current understanding of the interactions of motor activity and cognitive processes.</content>

 The increase in activity of the two-pore potassium-leak channel Kcnk5b maintains allometric juvenile growth of adult zebrafish appendages. However, it remains unknown how this channel maintains allometric growth and how its bioelectric activity is regulated to scale these anatomical structures. We show the activation of Kcnk5b is sufficient to activate several genes that are part of important development programs. We provide &lt;i&gt;in vivo &lt;/i&gt;transplantation evidence that the activation of gene transcription is cell autonomous. We also show that Kcnk5b will induce the expression of different subsets of the tested developmental genes in different cultured mammalian cell lines, which may explain how one electrophysiological stimulus can coordinately regulate the allometric growth of diverse populations of cells in the fin that use different developmental signals. We also provide evidence that the post-translational modification of serine 345 in Kcnk5b by calcineurin regulates channel activity to scale the fin. Thus, we show how an endogenous bioelectric mechanism can be regulated to promote coordinated developmental signaling to generate and scale a vertebrate appendage.</content>

 There are many monitoring environments, such as railway control, in which lapses of attention can have tragic consequences. Problematically, sustained monitoring for rare targets is difficult, with more misses and longer reaction times over time. What changes in the brain underpin these 'vigilance decrements'? We designed a multiple-object monitoring (MOM) paradigm to examine how the neural representation of information varied with target frequency and time performing the task. Behavioural performance decreased over time for the rare target (monitoring) condition, but not for a frequent target (active) condition. This was mirrored in neural decoding using Magnetoencephalography: coding of critical information declined more during monitoring versus active conditions along the experiment. We developed new analyses that can predict behavioural errors from the neural data more than a second before they occurred. This facilitates pre-empting behavioural errors due to lapses in attention and provides new insight into the neural correlates of vigilance decrements.</content>

Can egalitarian norms or conventions survive the presence of dominant individuals who are ensured of victory in conflicts? We investigate the interaction of power asymmetry and partner choice in games of conflict over a contested resource. Previous models of cooperation do not include both power inequality and partner choice. Furthermore, models that do include power inequalities assume a static game where a bully’s advantage does not change. They have therefore not attempted to model complex and realistic properties of social interaction. Here, we introduce three models to study the emergence and resilience of cooperation among unequals when interaction is random, when individuals can choose their partners, and where power asymmetries dynamically depend on accumulated payoffs. We find that the ability to avoid bullies with higher competitive ability afforded by partner choice mostly restores cooperative conventions and that the competitive hierarchy never forms. Partner choice counteracts the hyper dominance of bullies who are isolated in the network and eliminates the need for others to coordinate in a coalition. When competitive ability dynamically depends on cumulative payoffs, complex cycles of coupled network-strategy-rank changes emerge. Effective collaborators gain popularity (and thus power), adopt aggressive behavior, get isolated, and ultimately lose power. Neither the network nor behavior converge to a stable equilibrium. Despite the instability of power dynamics, the cooperative convention in the population remains stable overall and long-term inequality is completely eliminated. The interaction between partner choice and dynamic power asymmetry is crucial for these results: without partner choice, bullies cannot be isolated, and without dynamic power asymmetry, bullies do not lose their power even when isolated. We analytically identify a single critical point that marks a phase transition in all three iterations of our models. This critical point is where the first individual breaks from the convention and cycles start to emerge.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/q802JuLBljY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Tandem alternative splice sites (TASS) is a special class of alternative splicing events that are characterized by a close tandem arrangement of splice sites. Most TASS lack functional characterization and are believed to arise from splicing noise. Based on the RNA-seq data from the Genotype Tissue Expression project, we present an extended catalogue of TASS in healthy human tissues and analyze their tissue-specific expression. The expression of TASS is usually dominated by one major splice site (maSS), while the expression of minor splice sites (miSS) is at least an order of magnitude lower. Among 46k miSS with sufficient read support, 9k (20%) are significantly expressed above the expected noise level, and among them 2.5k are expressed tissue-specifically. We found significant correlations between tissue-specific expression of RNA-binding proteins (RBP), tissue-specific expression of miSS, and miSS response to RBP inactivation by shRNA. In combination with RBP profiling by eCLIP, this allowed prediction of novel cases of tissue-specific splicing regulation including a miSS in &lt;i&gt;QKI&lt;/i&gt; mRNA that is likely regulated by &lt;i&gt;PTBP1&lt;/i&gt;. The analysis of human primary cell transcriptomes suggested that both tissue-specific and cell-type-specific factors contribute to the regulation of miSS expression. More than 20% of tissue-specific miSS affect structured protein regions and may adjust protein-protein interactions or modify the stability of the protein core. The significantly expressed miSS evolve under the same selection pressure as maSS, while other miSS lack signatures of evolutionary selection and conservation. Using mixture models, we estimated that not more than 15% of maSS and not more than 54% of tissue-specific miSS are noisy, while the proportion of noisy splice sites among non-significantly expressed miSS is above 63%.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ApT8i7YI2tk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

High-throughput spatial-transcriptomics RNA sequencing (sptRNA-seq) based on in-situ capturing technologies has recently been developed to spatially resolve transcriptome-wide mRNA expressions mapped to the captured locations in a tissue sample. Due to the low RNA capture efficiency by in-situ capturing and the complication of tissue section preparation, sptRNA-seq data often only provides an incomplete profiling of the gene expressions over the spatial regions of the tissue. In this paper, we introduce a graph-regularized tensor completion model for imputing the missing mRNA expressions in sptRNA-seq data, namely FIST, Fast Imputation of Spatially-resolved transcriptomes by graph-regularized Tensor completion. We first model sptRNA-seq data as a 3-way sparse tensor in genes (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-mode) and the (&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt;) spatial coordinates (&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;-mode and &lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt;-mode) of the observed gene expressions, and then consider the imputation of the unobserved entries or fibers as a tensor completion problem in Canonical Polyadic Decomposition (CPD) form. To improve the imputation of highly sparse sptRNA-seq data, we also introduce a protein-protein interaction network to add prior knowledge of gene functions, and a spatial graph to capture the the spatial relations among the capture spots. The tensor completion model is then regularized by a Cartesian product graph of protein-protein interaction network and the spatial graph to capture the high-order relations in the tensor. In the experiments, FIST was tested on ten 10x Genomics Visium spatial transcriptomic datasets of different tissue sections with cross-validation among the known entries in the imputation. FIST significantly outperformed the state-of-the-art methods for single-cell RNAseq data imputation. We also demonstrate that both the spatial graph and PPI network play an important role in improving the imputation. In a case study, we further analyzed the gene clusters obtained from the imputed gene expressions to show that the imputations by FIST indeed capture the spatial characteristics in the gene expressions and reveal functions that are highly relevant to three different kinds of tissues in mouse kidney.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/4Mfo7VVeeZs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Neural stem cell (NSC) transplantation induces recovery in animal models of central nervous system (CNS) diseases. Although the replacement of lost endogenous cells was originally proposed as the primary healing mechanism of NSC grafts, it is now clear that transplanted NSCs operate via multiple mechanisms, including the horizontal exchange of therapeutic cargoes to host cells via extracellular vesicles (EVs). EVs are membrane particles trafficking nucleic acids, proteins, metabolites and metabolic enzymes, lipids, and entire organelles. However, the function and the contribution of these cargoes to the broad therapeutic effects of NSCs are yet to be fully understood. Mitochondrial dysfunction is an established feature of several inflammatory and degenerative CNS disorders, most of which are potentially treatable with exogenous stem cell therapeutics. Herein, we investigated the hypothesis that NSCs release and traffic functional mitochondria via EVs to restore mitochondrial function in target cells. Untargeted proteomics revealed a significant enrichment of mitochondrial proteins spontaneously released by NSCs in EVs. Morphological and functional analyses confirmed the presence of ultrastructurally intact mitochondria within EVs with conserved membrane potential and respiration. We found that the transfer of these mitochondria from EVs to mtDNA-deficient L929 Rho&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; cells rescued mitochondrial function and increased Rho&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; cell survival. Furthermore, the incorporation of mitochondria from EVs into inflammatory mononuclear phagocytes restored normal mitochondrial dynamics and cellular metabolism and reduced the expression of pro-inflammatory markers in target cells. When transplanted in an animal model of multiple sclerosis, exogenous NSCs actively transferred mitochondria to mononuclear phagocytes and induced a significant amelioration of clinical deficits. Our data provide the first evidence that NSCs deliver functional mitochondria to target cells via EVs, paving the way for the development of novel (a)cellular approaches aimed at restoring mitochondrial dysfunction not only in multiple sclerosis, but also in degenerative neurological diseases.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/AYPHUFuFydY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 Retinal photoreceptors express visual opsins that capture light to begin the process of phototransduction. The consequences of opsin disruption on retinal development are poorly understood. Here, the ultraviolet (short‐wavelength sensitive 1, sws1) opsin of rainbow trout was partially knocked out using the CRISPR/Cas9 editing system. Knockouts showed a disrupted outer retina consisting of diminished opsin expression, absent or stunted outer segments, photoreceptor degeneration, and loss of mosaic regularity. These findings indicate developmental roles of visual opsins beyond phototransduction.







Abstract
Visual opsins are proteins expressed by retinal photoreceptors that capture light to begin the process of phototransduction. In vertebrates, the two types of photoreceptors (rods and cones) express one or multiple opsins and are distributed in variable patterns across the retina. Some cones form opsin retinal gradients, as in the mouse, whereas others form more demarcated opsin domains, as in the lattice‐like mosaic retinas of teleost fishes. Reduced rod opsin (rh1) expression in mouse, zebrafish, and African clawed frog results in lack of photoreceptor outer segments (i.e., the cilium that houses the opsins) and, in the case of the mouse, to retinal degeneration. The effects of diminished cone opsin expression have only been studied in the mouse where knockout of the short‐wavelength sensitive 1 (sws1) opsin leads to ventral retinal cones lacking outer segments, but no retinal degeneration. Here we show that, following CRISPR/Cas9 injections that targeted knockout of the sws1 opsin in rainbow trout, fish with diminished sws1 opsin expression exhibited a variety of developmental defects including head and eye malformations, underdeveloped outer retina, mislocalized opsin expression, cone degeneration, and mosaic irregularity. All photoreceptor types were affected even though sws1 is only expressed in the single cones of wild fish. Our results reveal unprecedented developmental defects associated with diminished cone opsin expression and suggest that visual opsin genes are involved in regulatory processes that precede photoreceptor differentiation.</content>

 &lt;p&gt;This article proposes a new population-based optimization algorithm called
the Tangent Search Algorithm (TSA) to solve optimization problems. The TSA uses
a mathematical model based on the tangent function to move a given solution
toward a better solution. The tangent flight function has the advantage to
balance between the exploitation and the exploration search. Moreover, a novel
escape procedure is used to avoid to be trapped in local minima. Besides, an
adaptive variable step size is also integrated in this algorithm to enhance the
convergence capacity. The performance of TSA is assessed in three classes of
tests: classical tests, CEC benchmarks, and engineering optimization problems.
Moreover, several studies and metrics have been used to observe the behavior of
the proposed TSA. The experimental results show that TSA algorithm is capable
to provide very promising and competitive results on most benchmark functions
thanks to better balance between exploration and exploitation of the search
space. The main characteristics of this new optimization algorithm is its
simplicity and efficiency and it requires only a small number of user-defined
parameters.

 &lt;p&gt;Nonlinear system design is often a multi-objective optimization problem
involving search for a design that satisfies a number of predefined
constraints. The design space is typically very large since it includes all
possible system architectures with different combinations of components
composing each architecture. In this article, we address nonlinear system
design space exploration through a two-step approach encapsulated in a
framework called Fast Design Space Exploration of Nonlinear Systems (ASSENT).
In the first step, we use a genetic algorithm to search for system
architectures that allow discrete choices for component values or else only
component values for a fixed architecture. This step yields a coarse design
since the system may or may not meet the target specifications. In the second
step, we use an inverse design to search over a continuous space and fine-tune
the component values with the goal of improving the value of the objective
function. We use a neural network to model the system response. The neural
network is converted into a mixed-integer linear program for active learning to
sample component values efficiently. We illustrate the efficacy of ASSENT on
problems ranging from nonlinear system design to design of electrical circuits.
Experimental results show that ASSENT achieves the same or better value of the
objective function compared to various other optimization techniques for
nonlinear system design by up to 54%. We improve sample efficiency by 6-10x
compared to reinforcement learning based synthesis of electrical circuits.

 &lt;p&gt;Synchronization in neural system plays an important role in many brain
functions. Synchronization in the gamma frequency band (30Hz-100Hz) is involved
in a variety of cognitive phenomena; abnormalities of the gamma synchronization
are found in schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder. Frequently, the
strength of synchronization is not very high and is intermittent even on short
time scales (a few cycles of oscillations). That is, the network exhibits
intervals of synchronization followed by intervals of desynchronization. Neural
circuits dynamics may show different distributions of desynchronization
durations even if the synchronization strength is fixed. In this study, we use
a conductance-based neural network exhibiting pyramidal-interneuron (PING)
gamma rhythm to study the temporal patterning of synchronized neural
oscillations. We found that changes in the synaptic strength (as well as
changes in the membrane kinetics) can alter the temporal patterning of
synchrony. Moreover, we found that the changes in the temporal pattern of
synchrony may be independent of the changes in the average synchrony strength.
Even though the temporal patterning may vary, there is a tendency for dynamics
with short (although potentially numerous) desynchronizations, similar to what
was observed in experimental studies of neural activity synchronization in the
brain. Recent studies suggested that the short desynchronizations dynamics may
facilitate the formation and the break-up of transient neural assemblies. Thus,
the results of this study suggest that changes of synaptic strength may alter
the temporal patterning of the gamma synchronization as to make the neural
networks more efficient in the formation of neural assemblies and the
facilitation of cognitive phenomena.

 &lt;p&gt;The geodesic ray-tracing method has shown its effectiveness for the
reconstruction of fibers in white matter structure. Based on reasonable metrics
on the spaces of the diffusion tensors, it can provide multiple solutions and
get robust to noise and curvatures of fibers. The choice of the metric on the
spaces of diffusion tensors has a significant impact on the outcome of this
method. Our objective is to suggest metrics and modifications of the algorithms
leading to more satisfactory results in the construction of white matter tracts
as geodesics. Starting with the DTI modality, we propose to rescale the
initially chosen metric on the space of diffusion tensors to increase the
geodetic cost in the isotropic regions. This change should be conformal in
order to preserve the angles between crossing fibers. We also suggest enhancing
the methods to be more robust to noise and employing the fourth-order tensor
data in order to handle the fiber crossings properly.

 &lt;p&gt;Regularization has long been utilized to learn sparsity in deep neural
network pruning. However, its role is mainly explored in the small penalty
strength regime. In this work, we extend its application to a new scenario
where the regularization grows large gradually to tackle two central problems
of pruning: pruning schedule and weight importance scoring. (1) The former
topic is newly brought up in this work, which we find critical to the pruning
performance while receives little research attention. Specifically, we propose
an L2 regularization variant with rising penalty factors and show it can bring
significant accuracy gains compared with its one-shot counterpart, even when
the same weights are removed. (2) The growing penalty scheme also brings us an
approach to exploit the Hessian information for more accurate pruning without
knowing their specific values, thus not bothered by the common Hessian
approximation problems. Empirically, the proposed algorithms are easy to
implement and scalable to large datasets and networks in both structured and
unstructured pruning. Their effectiveness is demonstrated with modern deep
neural networks on the CIFAR and ImageNet datasets, achieving competitive
results compared to many state-of-the-art algorithms. Our code and trained
models are publicly available at
https://github.com/mingsuntse/regularization-pruning.

 &lt;p&gt;We present a neural architecture search algorithm to construct compact
reinforcement learning (RL) policies, by combining ENAS and ES in a highly
scalable and intuitive way. By defining the combinatorial search space of NAS
to be the set of different edge-partitionings (colorings) into same-weight
classes, we represent compact architectures via efficient learned
edge-partitionings. For several RL tasks, we manage to learn colorings
translating to effective policies parameterized by as few as $17$ weight
parameters, providing &amp;gt;90% compression over vanilla policies and 6x compression
over state-of-the-art compact policies based on Toeplitz matrices, while still
maintaining good reward. We believe that our work is one of the first attempts
to propose a rigorous approach to training structured neural network
architectures for RL problems that are of interest especially in mobile
robotics with limited storage and computational resources.

Topics range from molecular and cellular aspects of neuronal development and function to behavior, cognition and disorders of the nervous system. By commissioning the best authors to write on the timeliest issues, and following a rigorous peer-review process, the journal provides an unparalleled source of information and opinion for neuroscientists in academia, clinical research and industry.

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;In the last decade, neurosciences have had an increasing interest in resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) as a result of its advantages, such as high spatial resolution, compared to other brain exploration techniques. To improve the technique, the elimination of artifacts through Independent Components Analysis (ICA) has been proposed, as this can separate neural signal and noise, opening possibilities for automatic classification. The main classification techniques have focused on processes based on typical machine learning. However, there are currently more robust approaches such as convolutional neural networks, which can deal with complex problems directly from the data without feature selection and even with data that does not have a simple interpretation, being limited by the amount of data necessary for training and its high computational cost. This research focused on studying four methods of volume reduction mitigating the computational cost for the training of 3 models based on convolutional neural networks. One of the reduction techniques is a novel approach that we call Reduction by Consecutive Binary Patterns (RCBP), which was shown to preserve the spatial features of the independent components. In addition, the RCBP showed networks in components associated with neuronal activity more clearly. The networks achieved accuracy above 98 % in classification, and one network was even found to be over 99 % accurate, outperforming most machine learning-based classification algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;An inverse procedure is developed and tested to recover functional and structural information from global signals of brains activity. The method assumes a leaky-integrate and fire model with excitatory and inhibitory neurons, coupled via a directed network. Neurons are endowed with a heterogenous current value, which sets their associated dynamical regime. By making use of a heterogenous mean-field approximation, the method seeks to reconstructing from global activity patterns the distribution of in-coming degrees, for both excitatory and inhibitory neurons, as well as the distribution of the assigned currents. The proposed inverse scheme is first validated against synthetic data. Then, time-lapse acquisitions of a zebrafish larva recorded with a two-photon light sheet microscope are used as an input to the reconstruction algorithm. A power law distribution of the in-coming connectivity of the excitatory neurons is found. Local degree distributions are also computed by segmenting the whole brain in sub-regions traced from annotated atlas.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec1&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) has been proven beneficial in myasthenic crisis, but their role as maintenance therapy is unclear. The aim of this study was to determine if maintenance therapy with low-dose IVIg improves clinical outcome and may be used as a steroid-sparing agent in myasthenia gravis (MG).&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We retrospectively reviewed charts of all MG patients treated with IVIg from January 2006 to December 2019. Long-term treatment response to IVIg was assessed by improvement in the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America (MGFA) clinical classification scale as primary end point, as well as the ability to reduce the time-weighted average required dose of prednisone as secondary end-point, in a follow-up period of 36 months.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;109 patients were treated with IVIg. The mean follow-up time was 34.03 ± 5.5 months. Sixty-seven patients (61.4%) responded to therapy with at least one-point improvement of the MGFA scale. There was no statistical difference in demographic and clinical characteristics between IVIg responders and non-responders. The mean prednisone dose decreased significantly from 33.1 ± 14.5 mg at baseline to 7.2 ± 7.8 mg after 36 months of IVIg treatment (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001), with the greatest effect after 6 months (33.1 ± 14.5 mg Vs. 17.9 ± 11.7 mg; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001). In the follow-up period of 36 months, most patients (92.5%) remained clinically and pharmacologically stable under chronic IVIg treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This retrospective study demonstrates that chronic low-dose IVIg treatment in patients with MG improves clinical outcomes and has a prolonged and significant steroid-sparing effect over a period of 3 years.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec1&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;In multiple sclerosis (MS), pronounced neurodegeneration manifests itself as cerebral gray matter (GM) atrophy, which is associated with cognitive and physical impairments. Microstructural changes in GM estimated by diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) may reveal neurodegeneration that is undetectable by conventional structural MRI and thus serve as a more sensitive marker of disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Objective&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The primary objective was to investigate the relationships between morphological and diffusional properties in cerebral GM and physical and cognitive performance in relapsing–remitting MS (RRMS) patients. A secondary objective was to investigate the relationship between GM microstructure and white matter (WM) injury, estimated by the volume of WM lesions.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Sixty-seven RRMS patients performed the brief repeatable battery of neuropsychological tests (BRB-N), the 6-minute walk test (6MWT), the six spot step test (SSST), and underwent MRI scans using structural and DKI protocols. GM volumetrics and DKI measurements were analyzed in the cortex and deep GM structures using a general linear model with demographics, physical- and cognitive performance as covariates.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Mean diffusivity (MD) in the cortex was associated with the SSST, 6MWT, information processing, global cognitive performance, and volume of WM lesions. In addition, thalamic volume was associated with SSST (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.21, 6MWT (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.18), information processing (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.21), and WM lesion volume (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.60).&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec5&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Cortical diffusion and thalamic volume are associated with walking and cognitive performance in RRMS patients and are highly affected by the presence of WM lesions.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;People form coherent representations of goal-directed actions. Such agency experiences of intentional action are reflected by a shift in temporal perception: self-generated motor movements and subsequent sensory effects are perceived to occur closer together in time—a phenomenon termed intentional binding. Building on recent research suggesting that temporal binding occurs without intentionally performing actions, we further examined whether such perceptual compression occurs when motor action is fully absent. In three experiments, we used a novel sensory-based adaptation of the Libet clock paradigm to assess how a brief tactile sensation on the index finger and a resulting auditory stimulus perceptually bind together in time. Findings revealed robust temporal repulsion (instead of binding) between tactile sensation and auditory effect. Temporal repulsion was attenuated when participants could anticipate the identity and temporal onset (two crucial components of intentional action) of the tactile sensation. These findings are briefly discussed in the context of differences between intentional movement and anticipated bodily sensations in shaping action coherence and agentic experiences.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The ATP binding cassette subfamily A member 7 (ABCA7) gene is one of the significant susceptibility loci for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Furthermore, ABCA7 loss of function variants resulting from premature termination codon in the gene are associated with increased risk for AD. ABCA7 belongs to the ABC transporter family, which mediates the transport of diverse metabolites across the cell membrane. ABCA7 is also involved in modulating immune responses. Because the immune system and lipid metabolism causatively engage in the pathogenesis of AD, we investigated how ABCA7 haplodeficiency modulates the metabolic profile in mouse brains during acute immune response using a metabolomics approach through LC/Q-TOF-MS. Peripheral lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation substantially influenced the metabolite content in the cortex, however, the effect on metabolic profiles in Abca7 heterozygous knockout mice (Abca7&lt;sup&gt;±&lt;/sup&gt;) was modest compared to that in the control wild-type mice. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) of the metabolomics dataset identified two modules influenced by LPS administration and ABCA7 haplodeficiency, in which glycerophospholipid metabolism, linoleic acid metabolism, and α-linolenic acid metabolism were identified as major pathways. Consistent with these findings, we also found that LPS stimulation increased the brain levels of eicosapentaenoic acid, oleic acid, and palmitic acid in Abca7&lt;sup&gt;±&lt;/sup&gt; mice, but not control mice. Together, our results indicate that ABCA7 is involved in the crosstalk between fatty acid metabolism and inflammation in the brain, and disturbances in these pathways may contribute to the risk for AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Recently, due to the emergence of mobile electroencephalography (EEG) devices, assessment of mental workload in highly ecological settings has gained popularity. In such settings, however, motion and other common artifacts have been shown to severely hamper signal quality and to degrade mental workload assessment performance. Here, we show that classical EEG enhancement algorithms, conventionally developed to remove ocular and muscle artifacts, are not optimal in settings where participant movement (e.g., walking or running) is expected. As such, an adaptive filter is proposed that relies on an accelerometer-based referential signal. We show that when combined with classical algorithms, accurate mental workload assessment is achieved. To test the proposed algorithm, data from 48 participants was collected as they performed the Revised Multi-Attribute Task Battery-II (MATB-II) under a low and a high workload setting, either while walking/jogging on a treadmill, or using a stationary exercise bicycle. Accuracy as high as 95% could be achieved with a random forest based mental workload classifier with ambulant users. Moreover, an increase in gamma activity was found in the parietal cortex, suggesting a connection between sensorimotor integration, attention, and workload in ambulant users.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a major neurodegenerative disease characterized by massive degeneration of the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, α-synuclein-containing Lewy bodies, and neuroinflammation. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging plays a crucial role in the diagnosis and monitoring of disease progression and treatment. A variety of MR methods are available to characterize neurodegeneration and other disease features such as iron accumulation and metabolic changes in animal models of PD. This review aims at giving an overview of how those physiopathological features of PD have been investigated using various MR methods in rodent models. Toxin-based and genetic-based models of PD are first described. MR methods for neurodegeneration evaluation, iron load, and metabolism alterations are then detailed, and the main findings are provided in those models. Ultimately, future directions are suggested for neuroinflammation and neuromelanin evaluations in new animal models.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Background: There is increasing evidence to support the efficacy of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) applications in cognitive augmentation and rehabilitation. Neuromodulation achieved with tDCS may further regulate regional cerebral perfusion affiliated through the neurovascular unit; however, components of cerebral perfusion decrease across aging. A novel neuroimaging approach, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), can aid in quantifying these regional perfusional changes. To date, the interaction of the effects of tDCS on cognitive performance across the lifespan and obtained fNIRS hemodynamic responses remain unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: This review aims to examine the effects of tDCS on cognitive performance and fNIRS hemodynamic responses within the context of cognitive aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Six databases were searched for studies. Quality appraisal and data extraction were conducted by two independent reviewers. Meta-analysis was carried out to determine overall and subgroup effect sizes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Eight studies met inclusion criteria. The overall effect size demonstrates that tDCS can alter cognitive performance and fNIRS signals, with aging being a potential intermediary in tDCS efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: From the studies included, the effects of tDCS on cognitive performance and fNIRS metrics are most prominent in young healthy adults and appear to become less robust with increasing age. Given the small number of studies included in this review further investigation is recommended.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The relation between mental states and brain states is important in computational neuroscience, and in psychiatry in which interventions with medication are made on brain states to alter mental states. The relation between the brain and the mind has puzzled philosophers for centuries. Here a neuroscience approach is proposed in which events at the sub-neuronal, neuronal, and neuronal network levels take place simultaneously to perform a computation that can be described at a high level as a mental state, with content about the world. It is argued that as the processes at the different levels of explanation take place at the same time, they are linked by a non-causal supervenient relationship: causality can best be described in brains as operating within but not between levels. This allows the supervenient (e.g., mental) properties to be emergent, though once understood at the mechanistic levels they may seem less emergent, and expected. This mind-brain theory allows mental events to be different in kind from the mechanistic events that underlie them; but does not lead one to argue that mental events cause brain events, or vice versa: they are different levels of explanation of the operation of the computational system. This approach may provide a way of thinking about brains and minds that is different from dualism and from reductive physicalism, and which is rooted in the computational processes that are fundamental to understanding brain and mental events, and that mean that the mental and mechanistic levels are linked by the computational process being performed. Explanations at the different levels of operation may be useful in different ways. For example, if we wish to understand how arithmetic is performed in the brain, description at the mental level of the algorithm being computed will be useful. But if the brain operates to result in mental disorders, then understanding the mechanism at the neural processing level may be more useful, in for example, the treatment of psychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Movement has a prominent impact on activity in sensory cortex, but has opposing effects on visual and auditory cortex. Both cortical areas feature a vasoactive intestinal peptide-expressing (VIP) disinhibitory circuit, which in visual cortex contributes to the effect of running. In auditory cortex, however, the role of VIP circuitry in running effects remains poorly understood. Running and optogenetic VIP activation are known to differentially modulate sound-evoked activity in auditory cortex, but it is unknown how these effects vary across cortical layers, and whether laminar differences in the roles of VIP circuitry could contribute to the substantial diversity that has been observed in the effects of both movement and VIP activation. Here we asked whether VIP neurons contribute to the effects of running, across the layers of auditory cortex. We found that both running and optogenetic activation of VIP neurons produced diverse changes in the firing rates of auditory cortical neurons, but with distinct effects on spontaneous and evoked activity and with different patterns across cortical layers. On average, running increased spontaneous firing rates but decreased evoked firing rates, resulting in a reduction of the neuronal encoding of sound. This reduction in sound encoding was observed in all cortical layers, but was most pronounced in layer 2/3. In contrast, VIP activation increased both spontaneous and evoked firing rates, and had no net population-wide effect on sound encoding, but strongly suppressed sound encoding in layer 4 narrow-spiking neurons. These results suggest that VIP activation and running act independently, which we then tested by comparing the arithmetic sum of the two effects measured separately to the actual combined effect of running and VIP activation, which were closely matched. We conclude that the effects of locomotion in auditory cortex are not mediated by the VIP network.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Our previous study demonstrated rapamycin added to diet at 4 months of age had significantly less age-related outer hair cell loss in the basal half of the cochlea at 22 months of age compared to mice without rapamycin. The present study tested adding rapamycin to diet later in life, at 14 months of age, and added a longitudinal assessment of auditory brain stem response (ABR). The present study used UMHET4 mice, a 4 way cross in which all grandparental strains lack the Cdh23&lt;sup&gt;753A&lt;/sup&gt; allele that predisposes to early onset, progressive hearing loss. UMHET4 mice typically have normal hearing until 16–17 months, then exhibit threshold shifts at low frequencies/apical cochlea and later in more basal high frequency regions. ABR thresholds at 4, 12, 24, and 48 kHz were assessed at 12, 18, and 24 months of age and compared to baseline ABR thresholds acquired at 5 months of age to determine threshold shifts (TS). There was no TS at 12 months of age at any frequency tested. At 18 months of age mice with rapamycin added to diet at 14 months had a significantly lower mean TS at 4 and 12 kHz compared to mice on control diet with no significant difference at 24 and 48 kHz. At 24 months of age, the mean 4 kHz TS in rapamycin diet group was no longer significantly lower than the control diet group, while the 12 kHz mean remained significantly lower. Mean TS at 24 and 48 kHz in the rapamycin diet group became significantly lower than in the control diet group at 24 months. Hair cell counts at 24 months showed large loss in the apical half of most rapamycin and control diet mice cochleae with no significant difference between groups. There was only mild outer hair cell loss in the basal half of rapamycin and control diet mice cochleae with no significant difference between groups. The results show that a later life addition of rapamycin can decrease age-related hearing loss in the mouse model, however, it also suggests that this decrease is a delay/deceleration rather than a complete prevention.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Large-scale simulation of detailed computational models of neuronal microcircuits plays a prominent role in reproducing and predicting the dynamics of the microcircuits. To reconstruct a microcircuit, one must choose neuron and synapse models, placements, connectivity, and numerical simulation methods according to anatomical and physiological constraints. For reconstruction and refinement, it is useful to be able to replace one module easily while leaving the others as they are. One way to achieve this is via a scaffolding approach, in which a simulation code is built on independent modules for placements, connections, and network simulations. Owing to the modularity of functions, this approach enables researchers to improve the performance of the entire simulation by simply replacing a problematic module with an improved one. Casali et al. (2019) developed a spiking network model of the cerebellar microcircuit using this approach, and while it reproduces electrophysiological properties of cerebellar neurons, it takes too much computational time. Here, we followed this scaffolding approach and replaced the simulation module with an accelerated version on graphics processing units (GPUs). Our cerebellar scaffold model ran roughly 100 times faster than the original version. In fact, our model is able to run faster than real time, with good weak and strong scaling properties. To demonstrate an application of real-time simulation, we implemented synaptic plasticity mechanisms at parallel fiber–Purkinje cell synapses, and carried out simulation of behavioral experiments known as gain adaptation of optokinetic response. We confirmed that the computer simulation reproduced experimental findings while being completed in real time. Actually, a computer simulation for 2 s of the biological time completed within 750 ms. These results suggest that the scaffolding approach is a promising concept for gradual development and refactoring of simulation codes for large-scale elaborate microcircuits. Moreover, a real-time version of the cerebellar scaffold model, which is enabled by parallel computing technology owing to GPUs, may be useful for large-scale simulations and engineering applications that require real-time signal processing and motor control.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Electrical synaptic transmission is an essential form of interneuronal communication which is mediated by gap junctions that permit ion flow. Three gene families (connexins, innexins, and pannexins) have evolved to form gap junctional channels. Each gap junctional channel is formed by the docking of the hemichannel of one cell with the corresponding hemichannel of an adjacent cell. To date, there has been a lack of study models to describe this structure in detail. In this study, we demonstrate that numerical simulations suggest that the passive transmembrane ion transport model, based on the generality of ion channels, also applies to hemichannels in non-junctional plasma membranes. On this basis, we established a gap junctional channel model, which describes hemichannels' docking. We simulated homotypic and heterotypic gap junctions formed by connexins, innexins, and pannexins. Based on the numerical results and our theoretical model, we discussed the physiology of hemichannels and gap junctions, including ion blockage of hemichannels, voltage gating of gap junctions, and asymmetry and delay of electrical synaptic transmission, for which the numerical simulations are first comprehensively realized.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 We examine how a complex transcription network composed of seven 'master' regulators and hundreds of target genes evolved over a span of approximately 70 million years. The network controls biofilm formation in several &lt;i&gt;Candida&lt;/i&gt; species, a group of fungi that are present in humans both as constituents of the microbiota and as opportunistic pathogens. Using a variety of approaches, we observed two major types of changes that have occurred in the biofilm network since the four extant species we examined last shared a common ancestor. Master regulator 'substitutions' occurred over relatively long evolutionary times, resulting in different species having overlapping, but different sets of master regulators of biofilm formation. Second, massive changes in the connections between the master regulators and their target genes occurred over much shorter timescales. We believe this analysis is the first detailed, empirical description of how a complex transcription network has evolved.</content>

 Over two-thirds of integral membrane proteins of known structure assemble into oligomers. Yet, the forces that drive the association of these proteins remain to be delineated, as the lipid bilayer is a solvent environment that is both structurally and chemically complex. In this study we reveal how the lipid solvent defines the dimerization equilibrium of the CLC-ec1 Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;/H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; antiporter. Integrating experimental and computational approaches, we show that monomers associate to avoid a thinned-membrane defect formed by hydrophobic mismatch at their exposed dimerization interfaces. In this defect, lipids are strongly tilted and less densely packed than in the bulk, with a larger degree of entanglement between opposing leaflets and greater water penetration into the bilayer interior. Dimerization restores the membrane to a near-native state and therefore, appears to be driven by the larger free-energy cost of lipid solvation of the dissociated protomers. Supporting this theory, we demonstrate that addition of short-chain lipids strongly shifts the dimerization equilibrium towards the monomeric state, and show that the cause of this effect is that these lipids preferentially solvate the defect. Importantly, we show that this shift requires only minimal quantities of short-chain lipids, with no measurable impact on either the macroscopic physical state of the membrane or the protein's biological function. Based on these observations, we posit that free-energy differentials for local lipid solvation define membrane-protein association equilibria. With this, we argue that preferential lipid solvation is a plausible cellular mechanism for lipid regulation of oligomerization processes, as it can occur at low concentrations and does not require global changes in membrane properties.</content>

 Eukaryotes compartmentalize metabolic pathways into sub-cellular domains, but the role of inter-organelle contacts in organizing metabolic reactions remains poorly understood. Here, we show that in response to acute glucose restriction (AGR) yeast undergo metabolic remodeling of their mevalonate pathway that is spatially coordinated at nucleus-vacuole junctions (NVJs). The NVJ serves as a metabolic platform by selectively retaining HMG-CoA Reductases (HMGCRs), driving mevalonate pathway flux in an Upc2-dependent manner. Both spatial retention of HMGCRs and increased mevalonate pathway flux during AGR is dependent on NVJ tether Nvj1. Furthermore, we demonstrate that HMGCRs associate into high molecular weight assemblies during AGR in an Nvj1-dependent manner. Loss of Nvj1-mediated HMGCR partitioning can be bypassed by artificially multimerizing HMGCRs, indicating NVJ compartmentalization enhances mevalonate pathway flux by promoting the association of HMGCRs in high molecular weight assemblies. Loss of HMGCR compartmentalization perturbs yeast growth following glucose starvation, indicating it promotes adaptive metabolic remodeling. Collectively we propose a non-canonical mechanism regulating mevalonate metabolism via the spatial compartmentalization of rate-limiting HMGCR enzymes at an inter-organelle contact site.</content>

 Aggregation of Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) is implicated in the motor neuron disease, ALS. Although more than 140 disease mutations of SOD1 are available, their stability or aggregation behaviors in membrane environment are not correlated with disease pathophysiology. Here, we use multiple mutational variants of SOD1 to show that the absence of Zn, and not Cu, significantly impacts membrane attachment of SOD1 through two loop regions facilitating aggregation driven by lipid induced conformational changes. These loop regions influence both the primary (through Cu intake) and the gain of function (through aggregation) of SOD1 presumably through a shared conformational landscape. Combining experimental and theoretical frameworks using representative ALS disease mutants, we develop a 'co-factor derived membrane association model' wherein mutational stress closer to the Zn (but not to the Cu) pocket is responsible for membrane association mediated toxic aggregation and survival time scale after ALS diagnosis.</content>

 Understanding perceptual decision-making requires linking sensory neural responses to behavioral choices. In two-choice tasks, activity-choice covariations are commonly quantified with a single measure of choice probability (CP), without characterizing their changes across stimulus levels. We provide theoretical conditions for stimulus dependencies of activity-choice covariations. Assuming a general decision-threshold model, which comprises both feedforward and feedback processing and allows for a stimulus-modulated neural population covariance, we analytically predict a very general and previously unreported stimulus dependence of CPs. We develop new tools, including refined analyses of CPs and generalized linear models with stimulus-choice interactions, which accurately assess the stimulus- or choice-driven signals of each neuron, characterizing stimulus-dependent patterns of choice-related signals. With these tools, we analyze CPs of macaque MT neurons during a motion discrimination task. Our analysis provides preliminary empirical evidence for the promise of studying stimulus dependencies of choice-related signals, encouraging further assessment in wider data sets.</content>

 Background
To operationalize the National Institute on Aging – Alzheimer's Association (NIA‐AA) Research Framework for Alzheimer's Disease 6‐stage continuum of clinical progression for persons with abnormal amyloid.


Methods
The Mayo Clinic Study of Aging is a population‐based longitudinal study of aging and cognitive impairment in Olmsted County, Minnesota. We evaluated persons without dementia having 3 consecutive clinical visits. Measures for cross‐sectional categories included objective cognitive impairment (OBJ) and function (FXN). Measures for change included subjective cognitive impairment (SCD), objective cognitive change (ΔOBJ), and new onset of neurobehavioral symptoms (ΔNBS). We calculated frequencies of the stages using different cutoff points and assessed stability of the stages over 15 months.


Results
Among 243 abnormal amyloid participants, the frequencies of the stages varied with age: 66 to 90% were classified as stage 1 at age 50 but at age 80, 24 to 36% were stage 1, 32 to 47% were stage 2, 18 to 27% were stage 3, 1 to 3% were stage 4 to 6, and 3 to 9% were indeterminate. Most stage 2 participants were classified as stage 2 because of abnormal ΔOBJ only (44–59%), whereas 11 to 21% had SCD only, and 9 to 13% had ΔNBS only. Short‐term stability varied by stage and OBJ cutoff points but the most notable changes were seen in stage 2 with 38 to 63% remaining stable, 4 to 13% worsening, and 24 to 41% improving (moving to stage 1).


Interpretation
The frequency of the stages varied by age and the precise membership fluctuated by the parameters used to define the stages. The staging framework may require revisions before it can be adopted for clinical trials. ANN NEUROL 2021</content>

 Abstract
Object naming involves accessing meaning and retrieving the associated word form from remote semantic memory. Historically, previously acquired semantic knowledge (i.e., remote semantic memory) was thought to be independent of the hippocampus via neocortical consolidation. This view is based on evidence demonstrating a dissociation in behavior in patients with hippocampal amnesia: amnesic patients are impaired in acquiring new vocabulary yet can name and define previously acquired words. More recently, the view that remote semantic memory is hippocampus‐independent has been challenged by the documentation of disruptions in aspects of remote semantic memory in patients with hippocampal amnesia, particularly in language use and depth of semantic knowledge. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that the hippocampus plays a long‐term role in remote semantic memory. We tested amnesic patients and demographically matched healthy comparison participants in an extensive naming task using photographic images of objects normalized for familiarity, object agreement, and visual complexity. Amnesic patients were less likely to correctly name objects than healthy comparison participants. Further, amnesic patients' performance worsened for words that were less familiar, more visually complex, and had less object agreement. These findings suggest that the hippocampus may play a long‐term role in semantic memory processes, rather than a time‐limited role in the initial acquisition of semantic information, and that hippocampal damage can disrupt object naming.</content>

Wild animals face novel environmental threats from human activities that may occur along a gradient of interactions with humans. Recent work has shown that merely living close to humans has major implications for a variety of antipredator traits and physiological responses. Here, we hypothesize that when human presence protects prey from their genuine predators (as sometimes seen in urban areas and at some tourist sites), this predator shield, followed by a process of habituation to humans, decouples commonly associated traits related to coping styles, which results in a new range of phenotypes. Such individuals are characterized by low aggressiveness and physiological stress responses, but have enhanced behavioral plasticity, boldness, and cognitive abilities. We refer to these individuals as “preactive,” because their physiological and behavioral coping style falls outside the classical proactive/reactive coping styles. While there is some support for this new coping style, formal multivariate studies are required to investigate behavioral and physiological responses to anthropogenic activities.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/yQhbIdrHJOw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 The central complex is an insect brain area controlling spatial orientation. Immunolabeling in 20 species ranging from firebrats to flies shows that the cellular distribution of the dopamine‐synthesizing enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase in the central complex is largely conserved but reveals additional novel cell types in flies and water striders.







Abstract
Dopamine acts as a neurohormone and neurotransmitter in the insect nervous system and controls a variety of physiological processes. Dopaminergic neurons also innervate the central complex (CX), a multisensory center of the insect brain involved in sky compass navigation, goal‐directed locomotion and sleep control. To infer a possible influence of evolutionary history and lifestyle on the neurochemical architecture of the CX, we have studied the distribution of neurons immunoreactive to tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the rate‐limiting enzyme in dopamine biosynthesis. Analysis of representatives from 12 insect orders ranging from firebrats to flies revealed high conservation of immunolabeled neurons. One type of TH‐immunoreactive neuron was found in all species studied. The neurons have somata in the pars intercerebralis, arborizations in the lateral accessory lobes, and axonal ramifications in the central body and noduli. In all pterygote species a second type of tangential neuron of the upper division of the central body was TH‐immunoreactive. The neurons have cell bodies near the calyces and arborizations in the superior protocerebrum. Both types of neuron showed species‐specific variations in cell number and in the innervated areas outside and inside the CX. Additional neurons were found in only two taxa: one type of columnar neuron showed TH immunostaining in the water strider Gerris lacustris, but not in other Heteroptera, and a tritocerebral neuron innervating the protocerebral bridge was immunolabeled in Diptera. The data show largely taxon‐specific variations of a common ground pattern of putatively dopaminergic neurons that may be commonly involved in state‐dependent modulation of CX function.

 &lt;p&gt;Meta-learning algorithms leverage regularities that are present on a set of
tasks to speed up and improve the performance of a subsidiary learning process.
Recent work on deep neural networks has shown that prior gradient-based
learning of meta-parameters can greatly improve the efficiency of subsequent
learning. Here, we present a gradient-based meta-learning algorithm based on
equilibrium propagation. Instead of explicitly differentiating the learning
process, our contrastive meta-learning rule estimates meta-parameter gradients
by executing the subsidiary process more than once. This avoids reversing the
learning dynamics in time and computing second-order derivatives. In spite of
this, and unlike previous first-order methods, our rule recovers an arbitrarily
accurate meta-parameter update given enough compute. As such, contrastive
meta-learning is a candidate rule for biologically-plausible meta-learning. We
establish theoretical bounds on its performance and present experiments on a
set of standard benchmarks and neural network architectures.

 &lt;p&gt;Neuromorphology is crucial to identifying neuronal subtypes and understanding
learning. It is also implicated in neurological disease. However, standard
morphological analysis focuses on macroscopic features such as branching
frequency and connectivity between regions, and often neglects the internal
geometry of neurons. In this work, we treat neuron trace points as a sampling
of differentiable curves and fit them with a set of branching B-splines. We
designed our representation with the Frenet-Serret formulas from differential
gemoetry in mind. The Frenet-Serret formulas completely characterize smooth
curves, and involve two parameters, curvature and torsion. Our representation
makes it possible to compute these parameters from neuron traces in closed
form. These parameters are defined continuously along the curve, in contrast to
other parameters like tortuosity which depend on start and end points. We
applied our method to a dataset of cortical projection neurons traced in two
mouse brains, and found that the parameters are distributed differently between
primary, collateral, and terminal axon branches, thus quantifying geometric
differences between different components of an axonal arbor. The results agreed
in both brains, further validating our representation. The code used in this
work can be readily applied to neuron traces in SWC format and is available in
our open-source Python package brainlit: &lt;a href=&quot;http://brainlit.neurodata.io/.&quot;&gt;this http URL&lt;/a&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;This paper proposes a novel nature-inspired meta-heuristic algorithm called
the Golden Tortoise Beetle Optimizer (GTBO) to solve optimization problems. It
mimics golden tortoise beetle's behavior of changing colors to attract opposite
sex for mating and its protective strategy that uses a kind of anal fork to
deter predators. The algorithm is modeled based on the beetle's dual
attractiveness and survival strategy to generate new solutions for optimization
problems. To measure its performance, the proposed GTBO is compared with five
other nature-inspired evolutionary algorithms on 24 well-known benchmark
functions investigating the trade-off between exploration and exploitation,
local optima avoidance, and convergence towards the global optima is
statistically significant. We particularly applied GTBO to two well-known
engineering problems including the welded beam design problem and the gear
train design problem. The results demonstrate that the new algorithm is more
efficient than the five baseline algorithms for both problems. A sensitivity
analysis is also performed to reveal different impacts of the algorithm's key
control parameters and operators on GTBO's performance.

 &lt;p&gt;Despite the recent success of neural network models in mimicking animal
performance on visual perceptual tasks, critics worry that these models fail to
illuminate brain function. We take it that a central approach to explanation in
systems neuroscience is that of mechanistic modeling, where understanding the
system is taken to require fleshing out the parts, organization, and activities
of a system, and how those give rise to behaviors of interest. However, it
remains somewhat controversial what it means for a model to describe a
mechanism, and whether neural network models qualify as explanatory.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We argue that certain kinds of neural network models are actually good
examples of mechanistic models, when the right notion of mechanistic mapping is
deployed. Building on existing work on model-to-mechanism mapping (3M), we
describe criteria delineating such a notion, which we call 3M++. These criteria
require us, first, to identify a level of description that is both abstract but
detailed enough to be &quot;runnable&quot;, and then, to construct model-to-brain
mappings using the same principles as those employed for brain-to-brain mapping
across individuals. Perhaps surprisingly, the abstractions required are those
already in use in experimental neuroscience, and are of the kind deployed in
the construction of more familiar computational models, just as the principles
of inter-brain mappings are very much in the spirit of those already employed
in the collection and analysis of data across animals.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a companion paper, we address the relationship between optimization and
intelligibility, in the context of functional evolutionary explanations. Taken
together, mechanistic interpretations of computational models and the
dependencies between form and function illuminated by optimization processes
can help us to understand why brain systems are built they way they are.

 &lt;p&gt;Computational modeling plays an increasingly important role in neuroscience,
highlighting the philosophical question of how computational models explain. In
the context of neural network models for neuroscience, concerns have been
raised about model intelligibility, and how they relate (if at all) to what is
found in the brain. We claim that what makes a system intelligible is an
understanding of the dependencies between its behavior and the factors that are
causally responsible for that behavior. In biological systems, many of these
dependencies are naturally &quot;top-down&quot;: ethological imperatives interact with
evolutionary and developmental constraints under natural selection. We describe
how the optimization techniques used to construct NN models capture some key
aspects of these dependencies, and thus help explain *why* brain systems are as
they are -- because when a challenging ecologically-relevant goal is shared by
a NN and the brain, it places tight constraints on the possible mechanisms
exhibited in both kinds of systems. By combining two familiar modes of
explanation -- one based on bottom-up mechanism (whose relation to neural
network models we address in a companion paper) and the other on top-down
constraints, these models illuminate brain function.

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Although the role of the cerebellum in motor sequences learning is widely established, the specific function of its gamma oscillatory activity still remains unclear. In the present study, gamma (50 Hz)—or delta (1 Hz)—transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) was applied to the right cerebellar cortex while participants performed an implicit serial reaction time task (SRTT) with their right hand. The task required the execution of motor sequences simultaneously with the presentation of a series of visual stimuli. The same sequence was repeated across multiple task blocks (from blocks 2 to 5 and from blocks 7 to 8), whereas in other blocks, new/pseudorandom sequences were reproduced (blocks 1 and 6). Task performance was examined before and during tACS. To test possible after-effects of cerebellar tACS on the contralateral primary motor cortex (M1), corticospinal excitability was assessed by examining the amplitude of motor potentials (MEP) evoked by single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Compared with delta stimulation, gamma-tACS applied during the SRTT impaired participants’ performance in blocks where the same motor sequence was repeated but not in blocks where the new pseudorandom sequences were presented. Noteworthy, the later assessed corticospinal excitability was not affected. These results suggest that cerebellar gamma oscillations mediate the implicit acquisition of motor sequences but do not affect task execution itself. Overall, this study provides evidence of a specific role of cerebellar gamma oscillatory activity in implicit motor learning.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy (MNGIE) is a multi-system disorder caused by several homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations, mostly in the nuclear gene of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;TYMP&lt;/em&gt;. Our current knowledge on the underlying pathology of the disease is derived through the study of about 200 cases of different ethnicities. Clinical presentations include severe cachexia, weakness, ptosis, diplopia, abdominal cramps or digestive tract disorders, hearing impairment, and paresthesia.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Herein, we aim to present five novel mutations of the nuclear gene of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;TYMP&lt;/em&gt; in six Iranian patients diagnosed with MNGIE. In our population, age at the time of diagnosis was 18 to 49 years, while the onset of the symptoms varied from 13 to 20 years. We detected two pathogenic non-frameshift nonsense premature stop codon mutations (c.1013C &amp;gt; A, and c.130C &amp;gt; T), one variant of uncertain significance (VUS) non-frameshift missense mutation (c.345G &amp;gt; T), one likely pathogenic frameshift insertion (c.801_802insCGCG), and one likely benign homozygous non-frameshift deletion (c.1176_1187del) from two siblings. Our findings also confirm the autosomal recessive inheritance pattern of MNGIE in the Iranian population. The lack of knowledge in the area of nuclear gene-modifier genes shadows the genotype–phenotype relationships of MNGIE.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The principle of constraint-induced therapy is widely practiced in rehabilitation. In hemiplegic cerebral palsy (CP) with impaired contralateral corticospinal projection due to unilateral injury, function improves after imposing a temporary constraint on limbs from the less affected hemisphere. This type of partially-reversible impairment in motor control by early brain injury bears a resemblance to the experience-dependent plastic acquisition and modification of neuronal response selectivity in the visual cortex. Previously, such mechanism was modeled within the framework of BCM (Bienenstock-Cooper-Munro) theory, a rate-based synaptic modification theory. Here, we demonstrate a minimally complex yet sufficient neural network model which provides a fundamental explanation for inter-hemispheric competition using a simplified spike-based model of information transmission and plasticity. We emulate the restoration of function in hemiplegic CP by simulating the competition between cells of the ipsilateral and contralateral corticospinal tracts. We use a high-speed hardware neural simulation to provide realistic numbers of spikes and realistic magnitudes of synaptic modification. We demonstrate that the phenomenon of constraint-induced partial reversal of hemiplegia can be modeled by simplified neural descending tracts with 2 layers of spiking neurons and synapses with spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). We further demonstrate that persistent hemiplegia following unilateral cortical inactivation or deprivation is predicted by the STDP-based model but is inconsistent with BCM model. Although our model is a highly simplified and limited representation of the corticospinal system, it offers an explanation of how constraint as an intervention can help the system to escape from a suboptimal solution. This is a display of an emergent phenomenon from the synaptic competition.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The analysis of the central and the autonomic nervous systems (CNS, ANS) activities during general anesthesia (GA) provides fundamental information for the study of neural processes that support alterations of the consciousness level. In the present pilot study, we analyzed EEG signals and the heart rate (HR) variability (HRV) in a sample of 11 patients undergoing spinal surgery to investigate their CNS and ANS activities during GA obtained with propofol administration. Data were analyzed during different stages of GA: baseline, the first period of anesthetic induction, the period before the loss of consciousness, the first period after propofol discontinuation, and the period before the recovery of consciousness (ROC). In EEG spectral analysis, we found a decrease in posterior alpha and beta power in all cortical areas observed, except the occipital ones, and an increase in delta power, mainly during the induction phase. In EEG connectivity analysis, we found a significant increase of local efficiency index in alpha and delta bands between baseline and loss of consciousness as well as between baseline and ROC in delta band only and a significant reduction of the characteristic path length in alpha band between the baseline and ROC. Moreover, connectivity results showed that in the alpha band there was mainly a progressive increase in the number and in the strength of incoming connections in the frontal region, while in the beta band the parietal region showed mainly a significant increase in the number and in the strength of outcoming connections values. The HRV analysis showed that the induction of anesthesia with propofol was associated with a progressive decrease in complexity and a consequent increase in the regularity indexes and that the anesthetic procedure determined bradycardia which was accompanied by an increase in cardiac sympathetic modulation and a decrease in cardiac parasympathetic modulation during the induction. Overall, the results of this pilot study showed as propofol-induced anesthesia caused modifications on EEG signal, leading to a “rebalance” between long and short-range cortical connections, and had a direct effect on the cardiac system. Our data suggest interesting perspectives for the interactions between the central and autonomic nervous systems for the modulation of the consciousness level.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a relentlessly progressive neurodegenerative disorder. As previous therapeutic trials in ALS have been severely hampered by patients’ heterogeneity, the identification of biomarkers that reliably reflect disease progression represents a priority in ALS research. Here, we used the D50 disease progression model to investigate correlations between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) neurofilament light chain (NfL) levels and disease aggressiveness. The D50 model quantifies individual disease trajectories for each ALS patient. The value D50 provides a unified measure of a patient’s overall disease aggressiveness (defined as time taken in months to lose 50% of functionality). The relative D50 (rD50) reflects the individual disease covered and can be calculated for any time point in the disease course. We analyzed clinical data from a well-defined cohort of 156 patients with ALS. The concentration of NfL in CSF samples was measured at two different laboratories using the same procedure. Based on patients’ individual D50 values, we defined subgroups with high (&amp;lt;20), intermediate (20–40), or low (&amp;gt;40) disease aggressiveness. NfL levels were compared between these subgroups via analysis of covariance, using an array of confounding factors: age, gender, clinical phenotype, frontotemporal dementia, rD50-derived disease phase, and analyzing laboratory. We found highly significant differences in NfL concentrations between all three D50 subgroups (p &amp;lt; 0.001), representing an increase of NfL levels with increasing disease aggressiveness. The conducted analysis of covariance showed that this correlation was independent of gender, disease phenotype, and phase; however, age, analyzing laboratory, and dementia significantly influenced NfL concentration. We could show that CSF NfL is independent of patients’ disease covered at the time of sampling. The present study provides strong evidence for the potential of NfL to reflect disease aggressiveness in ALS and in addition proofed to remain at stable levels throughout the disease course. Implementation of CSF NfL as a potential read-out for future therapeutic trials in ALS is currently constrained by its demonstrated susceptibility to (pre-)analytical variations. Here we show that the D50 model enables the discovery of correlations between clinical characteristics and CSF analytes and can be recommended for future studies evaluating potential biomarkers.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Conventional magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI) in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients provides measures of focal brain damage and activity, which are fundamental for disease diagnosis, prognosis, and the evaluation of response to therapy. However, cMRI is insensitive to the damage to the microenvironment of the brain tissue and the heterogeneity of MS lesions. In contrast, the damaged tissue can be characterized by mathematical models on multishell diffusion imaging data, which measure different compartmental water diffusion. In this work, we obtained 12 diffusion measures from eight diffusion models, and we applied a deep-learning attention-based convolutional neural network (CNN) (GAMER-MRI) to select the most discriminating measures in the classification of MS lesions and the perilesional tissue by attention weights. Furthermore, we provided clinical and biological validation of the chosen metrics—and of their most discriminative combinations—by correlating their respective mean values in MS patients with the corresponding Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and the serum level of neurofilament light chain (sNfL), which are measures of disability and neuroaxonal damage. Our results show that the neurite density index from neurite orientation and dispersion density imaging (NODDI), the measures of the intra-axonal and isotropic compartments from microstructural Bayesian approach, and the measure of the intra-axonal compartment from the spherical mean technique NODDI were the most discriminating (respective attention weights were 0.12, 0.12, 0.15, and 0.13). In addition, the combination of the neurite density index from NODDI and the measures for the intra-axonal and isotropic compartments from the microstructural Bayesian approach exhibited a stronger correlation with EDSS and sNfL than the individual measures. This work demonstrates that the proposed method might be useful to select the microstructural measures that are most discriminative of focal tissue damage and that may also be combined to a unique contrast to achieve stronger correlations to clinical disability and neuroaxonal damage.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune, inflammatory neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system characterized by demyelination and axonal damage. Diagnosis and prognosis are mainly assessed through clinical examination and neuroimaging. However, more sensitive biomarkers are needed to measure disease activity and guide treatment decisions in MS. Prompt and individualized management can reduce inflammatory activity and delay disease progression. Neurofilament Light chain (NfL), a neuron-specific cytoskeletal protein that is released into the extracellular fluid following axonal injury, has been identified as a biomarker of disease activity in MS. Measurement of NfL levels can capture the extent of neuroaxonal damage, especially in early stages of the disease. A growing body of evidence has shown that NfL in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum can be used as reliable indicators of prognosis and treatment response. More recently, NfL has been shown to facilitate individualized treatment decisions for individuals with MS. In this review, we discuss the characteristics that make NfL a highly informative biomarker and depict the available technologies used for its measurement. We further discuss the growing role of serum and CSF NfL in MS research and clinical settings. Finally, we address some of the current topics of debate regarding the use of NfL in clinical practice and examine the possible directions that this biomarker may take in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Recent neuroimaging studies have shown that functional connectomes are unique to individuals, i.e., two distinct fMRIs taken over different sessions of the same subject are more similar in terms of their connectomes than those from two different subjects. In this study, we present new results that identify specific parts of resting state and task-specific connectomes that are responsible for the unique signatures. We show that a very small part of the connectome can be used to derive features for discriminating between individuals. A network of these features is shown to achieve excellent training and test accuracy in matching imaging datasets. We show that these features are statistically significant, robust to perturbations, invariant across populations, and are localized to a small number of structural regions of the brain. Furthermore, we show that for task-specific connectomes, the regions identified by our method are consistent with their known functional characterization. We present a new matrix sampling technique to derive computationally efficient and accurate methods for identifying the discriminating sub-connectome and support all of our claims using state-of-the-art statistical tests and computational techniques.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are communication bridges between a human brain and external world, enabling humans to interact with their environment without muscle intervention. Their functionality, therefore, depends on both the BCI system and the cognitive capacities of the user. Motor-imagery BCIs (MI-BCI) rely on the users’ mental imagination of body movements. However, not all users have the ability to sufficiently modulate their brain activity for control of a MI-BCI; a problem known as BCI illiteracy or inefficiency. The underlying mechanism of this phenomenon and the cause of such difference among users is yet not fully understood. In this study, we investigated the impact of several cognitive and psychological measures on MI-BCI performance. Fifty-five novice BCI-users participated in a left- versus right-hand motor imagery task. In addition to their BCI classification error rate and demographics, psychological measures including personality factors, affinity for technology, and motivation during the experiment, as well as cognitive measures including visuospatial memory and spatial ability and Vividness of Visual Imagery were collected. Factors that were found to have a significant impact on MI-BCI performance were Vividness of Visual Imagery, and the personality factors of orderliness and autonomy. These findings shed light on individual traits that lead to difficulty in BCI operation and hence can help with early prediction of inefficiency among users to optimize training for them.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is associated with peripheral and central nervous system tumors. It is noteworthy that the regions in which these tumors frequently arise are the optic pathways (OPs) and the brainstem. Thus, we decided to trace the procedure of diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (dMRI) alterations along with Short-Wavelength Automated Perimetry (SWAP) examinations of the OPs after surgery and chemotherapy over 1 year, which enabled us to evaluate chemotherapy's efficacy in an NF1 patient with an OP tumor. In this study, a 25-year-old woman with NF1 and left optic radiation (OR) glioma underwent surgery to remove the glioma. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) revealed a Pilocytic Astrocytoma (PA) WHO grade I. Post-operation chemotherapy done using nine treatment cycles of administering Temozolomide (TMZ) for 5 days every 4 weeks. Applying the region of interest (ROI) differential tractography method and SWAP four times every 3 months allowed us to follow the patient's visual acuity alterations longitudinally. The differential deterministic tractography method and statistical analyses enabled us to discover the white matter (WM) tracts anisotropy alterations over time. Furthermore, statistical analyses on the SWAP results along time illustrated possible alterations in visual acuity. Then, we could compare and associate the findings with the SWAP examinations and patient symptoms longitudinally. Statistical analyses of SWAP tests revealed a significant improvement in visual fields, and longitudinal differential tractography showed myelination and dense axonal packing in the left OR after 1 year of treatment. In this study, we examined an old hypothesis suggesting that chemotherapy is more effective than radiotherapy for NF1 patients with OP gliomas (OPGs) because of the radiation side effects on the visual field, cognition, and cerebrovascular complications. Our longitudinal clinical case study involving dMRI and SWAP on a single NF1-OPG patient showed that chemotherapy did not suppress the OP myelination over time. However, it should be noted that this is a clinical case study, and, therefore, the generalization of results is limited. Future investigations might focus on genetic-based imaging, particularly in more cases. Further, meta-analyses are recommended for giving a proper Field Of View (FOV) to researchers as a subtle clue regarding precision medicine.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Ability to recall the timing of events is a crucial aspect of associative learning. Yet, traditional theories of associative learning have often overlooked the role of time in learning association and shaping the behavioral outcome. They address temporal learning as an independent and parallel process. Temporal Coding Hypothesis is an attempt to bringing together the associative and non-associative aspects of learning. This account proposes temporal maps, a representation that encodes several aspects of a learned association, but attach considerable importance to the temporal aspect. A temporal map helps an agent to make inferences about missing information by applying an integration mechanism over a common element present in independently acquired temporal maps. We review the empirical evidence demonstrating the construct of temporal maps and discuss the importance of this concept in clinical and behavioral interventions.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Serotonergic (5-HT) neurons in the medulla play multiple functional roles associated with many symptoms and motor activities. The descending serotonergic pathway from medulla is essential for initiating locomotion. However, the ionic properties of 5-HT neurons in the medulla remain unclear. Using whole-cell patch-clamp technique, we studied the biophysical and modulatory properties of persistent inward currents (PICs) in 5-HT neurons of medulla in ePet-EYFP transgenic mice (P3–P6). PICs were recorded by a family of voltage bi-ramps (10-s duration, 40-mV peak step), and the ascending and descending PICs were mirrored to analyze the PIC hysteresis. PICs were found in 77% of 5-HT neurons (198/258) with no significant difference between parapyramidal region (n = 107) and midline raphe nuclei (MRN) (n = 91) in either PIC onset (−47.4 ± 10 mV and −48.7 ± 7 mV; P = 0.44) or PIC amplitude (226.9 ± 138 pA and 259.2 ± 141 pA; P = 0.29). Ninety-six percentage (191/198) of the 5-HT neurons displayed counterclockwise hysteresis and four percentage (7/198) exhibited the clockwise hysteresis. The composite PICs could be differentiated as calcium component (Ca_PIC) by bath application of nimodipine (25 μM), sodium component (Na_PIC) by tetrodotoxin (TTX, 2 μM), and TTX- and dihydropyridine-resistance component (TDR_PIC) by TTX and nimodipine. Ca_PIC, Na_PIC and TDR_PIC all contributed to upregulation of excitability of 5-HT neurons. 5-HT (15 μM) enhanced the PICs, including a 26% increase in amplitude of the compound currents of Ca_PIC and TDR_PIC (P &amp;lt; 0.001, n = 9), 3.6 ± 5 mV hyperpolarization of Na_PIC and TDR_PIC onset (P &amp;lt; 0.05, n = 12), 30% increase in amplitude of TDR_PIC (P &amp;lt; 0.01), and 2.0 ± 3 mV hyperpolarization of TDR_PIC onset (P &amp;lt; 0.05, n = 18). 5-HT also facilitated repetitive firing of 5-HT neurons through modulation of composite PIC, Na_PIC and TDR_PIC, and Ca_PIC and TDR_PIC, respectively. In particular, the high voltage-activated TDR_PIC facilitated the repetitive firing in higher membrane potential, and this facilitation could be amplified by 5-HT. Morphological data analysis indicated that the dendrites of 5-HT neurons possessed dense spherical varicosities intensively crossing 5-HT neurons in medulla. We characterized the PICs in 5-HT neurons and unveiled the mechanism underlying upregulation of excitability of 5-HT neurons through serotonergic modulation of PICs. This study provided insight into channel mechanisms responsible for the serotonergic modulation of serotonergic neurons in brainstem.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Age-related hearing loss (ARHL) is the most common form of hearing loss and the predominant neurodegenerative disease associated with aging. Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) is associated with the most complex physiological processes, including metabolism, cancer onset, and aging. SIRT1 protein levels are enhanced by the conversion of nicotinamide to N&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;-methylnicotinamide (MNAM), independent of its mRNA levels. Moreover, MNAM has implications in increased longevity achieved through its mitohormetic effects. Nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (Nnmt) is an enzyme involved in MNAM metabolism, and its level increases under caloric restriction (CR) conditions. The CR condition has implications in delaying ARHL onset. In this study, we aimed to determine the relationship between diet, hearing function, SIRT1 and SIRT3 expression levels in the inner ear, and cochlear morphology. Mice fed with a high-fat diet (HFD), HFD + 1% MNAM, and low-fat diet (LFD) were monitored for age-related auditory-evoked brainstem responses, and changes in cochlear histology, metabolism, and protein and mRNA expressions were analyzed. Our results revealed that the HFD- and aging-mediated downregulated expression of SIRT1 and SIRT3 promoted hearing loss that was obfuscated by MNAM supplementation-induced upregulated expression of cochlear SIRT1 and SIRT3. Thus, our results suggest that MNAM can be used as a therapeutic agent for preventing ARHL.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Microglia are the primary cells in the central nervous system that identify and respond to injury or damage. Such a perturbation in the nervous system induces the release of molecules including ATP and glutamate that act as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). DAMPs are detected by microglia, which then regulate the inflammatory response in a manner sensitive to their surrounding environment. The available data indicates that ATP and glutamate can induce the release of pro inflammatory factors TNF (tumor necrosis factor), IL-1β (interleukin 1 beta), and NO (nitric oxide) from microglia. However, non-physiological concentrations of ATP and glutamate were often used to derive these insights. Here, we have compared the response of spinal cord microglia (SM) relative to brain microglia (BM) using physiologically relevant concentrations of glutamate and ATP that mimic injured conditions in the central nervous system. The data show that ATP and glutamate are not significant modulators of the release of cytokines from either BM or SM. Consistent with previous studies, spinal microglia exhibited a general trend toward reduced release of inflammatory cytokines relative to brain-derived microglia. Moreover, we demonstrate that the responses of microglia to these DAMPs can be altered by modifying the biochemical milieu in their surrounding environment. Preconditioning brain derived microglia with media from spinal cord derived mixed glial cultures shifted their release of IL-1ß and IL-6 to a less inflammatory phenotype consistent with spinal microglia.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 Background&lt;p&gt;Ischemic stroke is the main cause of disability worldwide, leading to a serious socioeconomic burden. Ferroptosis is a non-apoptotic form of programmed cell death and is related to various diseases. Acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 4 (ACSL4) is considered a target of ferroptosis, but its specific role in ischemic stroke remains unclear. In this study, we investigate whether the inhibition of ACSL4 promotes the recovery of neurological function in a way that prevents ferroptosis.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;A transient cerebral ischemia model was established for mice by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO); glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPx4), ACSL4 and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) were detected by Western blot, and changes to mitochondria were observed by a transmission electron microscope. A kit was used to determine iron levels and lipid peroxide indicators, such as glutathione peroxidase (GPx), reduced glutathione (GSH), total glutathione/oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG), lipid peroxidation, reactive oxygen species, superoxide and malonaldehyde. Following MCAO, a ferroptosis inhibitor, liproxstatin-1, was administered intranasally immediately at a concentration of 10 mg/kg. Rosiglitazone was used to inhibit ACSL4 and was administered intravenously 1 h before MCAO at a concentration of 0.4 mg/kg. Brain injury was determined by neurological deficit scores, neuroscore (28-point), corner test and gait analyses, at 24 and 72 h after stroke. Brain infarct volume was determined by 2, 3, 5-Triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining at 72 h after stroke.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;After MCAO, GPx4 protein expression decreased, ACSL4 and COX2 protein expression increased, GPx activity decreased and iron accumulation. Transmission electron microscopy confirmed that the outer mitochondrial membrane of neurons had ruptured and mitochondrial cristae had decreased or disappeared. Liproxstatin-1 could significantly attenuate the decrease of GPx4 and the increase of COX2 after MCAO, dramatically reducing iron accumulation and decreasing GPx activity, accompanied by a marked reduction in changes in lipid peroxidation indicators. The use of rosiglitazone to inhibit ACSL4 could significantly improve neurological function and reduce the brain infarct volume at 72 h after stroke. Importantly, inhibiting ACSL4 could significantly attenuate the decline of GPx4 after MCAO and markedly attenuate iron accumulation and a decrease in GPx activity. Additionally, changes in lipid peroxidation indicators were also significantly inhibited.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;This study indicates that inhibiting ACSL4 can promote the recovery of neurological function after stroke by suppression of ferroptosis.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Purinergic receptors play important roles in central nervous system (CNS), where the bulk of these receptors are implicated in neuroinflammatory responses and regulation of cellular function of neurons, microglial and astrocytes. Within the P2X receptor family, P2X&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; receptor is generally known for its inactivity in normal conditions and activation by moderately high concentrations (&amp;gt;100 μM) of extracellular adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP) released from injured cells as a result of brain injury or pathological conditions. Activation of P2X&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;R contributes to the activation and proliferation of microglia and directly contribute to neurodegeneration by provoking microglia-mediated neuronal death, glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity, and NLRP3 inflammasome activation that results in initiation, maturity and release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines and generation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. These components of the inflammatory response play important roles in many neural pathologies and neurodegeneration disorders. In CNS, expression of P2X&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;R on microglia, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes are upregulated under neuroinflammatory conditions. Several in vivo studies have demonstrated beneficial effects of the P2X&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; receptor antagonists in animal model systems of neurodegenerative diseases. A number of specific and selective P2X&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; receptor antagonists have been developed, but only few of them have shown efficient brain permeability. Finding potent and selective P2X&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; receptor inhibitors which are also CNS penetrable and display acceptable pharmacokinetics (PK) has presented challenges for both academic researchers and pharmaceutical companies. In this review, we discuss the role of P2X&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; receptor function in neurodegenerative diseases, the pharmacological inhibition of the receptor, and PET radiopharmaceuticals which permit non-invasive monitoring of the P2X&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; receptor contribution to neuroinflammation associated with neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Disappointing results from clinical trials designed to delay structural brain decline and the accompanying increase in risk for dementia in older adults have precipitated a shift in testing promising interventions from late in life toward midlife before irreversible damage has accumulated. This shift, however, requires targeting midlife biomarkers that are associated with clinical changes manifesting only in late life. Here we explored possible links between one putative biomarker, distributed integrity of brain white matter, and two intervention targets, cardiovascular fitness and healthy lifestyle behaviors, in midlife. At age 45, fractional anisotropy (FA) derived from diffusion weighted MRI was used to estimate the microstructural integrity of distributed white matter tracts in a population-representative birth cohort. Age-45 cardiovascular fitness (VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Max; N = 801) was estimated from heart rates obtained during submaximal exercise tests; age-45 healthy lifestyle behaviors were estimated using the Nyberg Health Index (N = 854). Ten-fold cross-validated elastic net predictive modeling revealed that estimated VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Max was modestly associated with distributed FA. In contrast, there was no significant association between Nyberg Health Index scores and FA. Our findings suggest that cardiovascular fitness levels, but not healthy lifestyle behaviors, are associated with the distributed integrity of white matter in the brain in midlife. These patterns could help inform future clinical intervention research targeting ADRDs.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;For over a century, neurons have been considered the basic functional units of the brain while glia only elements of support. Activation of glia has been long regarded detrimental for survival of neurons but more it appears that this is not the case in all circumstances. In this review, we report and discuss the recent literature on the alterations of astrocytes and microglia during inflammaging, the low-grade, slow, chronic inflammatory response that characterizes normal brain aging, and in acute inflammation. Becoming reactive, astrocytes and microglia undergo transcriptional, functional, and morphological changes that transform them into cells with different properties and functions, such as A1 and A2 astrocytes, and M1 and M2 microglia. This classification of microglia and astrocytes in two different, all-or-none states seems too simplistic, and does not correspond to the diverse variety of phenotypes so far found in the brain. Different interactions occur among the many cell populations of the central nervous system in health and disease conditions. Such interactions give rise to networks of morphological and functional reciprocal reliance and dependency. Alterations affecting one cell population reverberate to the others, favoring or dysregulating their activities. In the last part of this review, we present the modifications of the interplay between neurons and glia in rat models of brain aging and acute inflammation, focusing on the differences between CA1 and CA3 areas of the hippocampus, one of the brain regions most susceptible to different insults. With triple labeling fluorescent immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy (TIC), it is possible to evaluate and compare quantitatively the morphological and functional alterations of the components of the neuron-astrocyte-microglia triad. In the contiguous and interconnected regions of rat hippocampus, CA1 and CA3 Stratum Radiatum, astrocytes and microglia show a different, finely regulated, and region-specific reactivity, demonstrating that glia responses vary in a significant manner from area to area. It will be of great interest to verify whether these differential reactivities of glia explain the diverse vulnerability of the hippocampal areas to aging or to different damaging insults, and particularly the higher sensitivity of CA1 pyramidal neurons to inflammatory stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The death of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) is a key factor in the pathophysiology of all types of glaucoma, but the mechanism of pathogenesis of glaucoma remains unclear. RGCs are a group of central nervous system (CNS) neurons whose soma are in the inner retina. The axons of RGCs form the optic nerve and converge at the optic chiasma; from there, they project to the visual cortex via the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). In recent years, there has been increasing interest in the dysfunction and death of CNS and retinal neurons caused by transneuronal degeneration of RGCs, and the view that glaucoma is a widespread neurodegenerative disease involving CNS damage appears more and more frequently in the literature. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of LGN and visual cortex neuron damage in glaucoma and possible mechanisms behind the damage. This review presents an updated and expanded view of neuronal damage in glaucoma, and reveals new and potential targets for neuroprotection and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread around the globe causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Because it affects the respiratory system, common symptoms are cough and breathing difficulties with fever and fatigue. Also, some cases progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The acute phase of COVID-19 has been also related to nervous system symptoms, including loss of taste and smell as well as encephalitis and cerebrovascular disorders. However, it remains unclear if neurological complications are due to the direct viral infection of the nervous system, or they appear as a consequence of the immune reaction against the virus in patients who presented pre-existing deficits or had a certain detrimental immune response. Importantly, the medium and long-term consequences of the infection by SARS-CoV-2 in the nervous system remain at present unknown. This review article aims to give an overview of the current neurological symptoms associated with COVID-19, as well as attempting to provide an insight beyond the acute affectation.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Cancer cells undergo lineage switching during natural progression and in response to therapy. NKX2-1 loss in human and murine lung adenocarcinoma leads to invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma (IMA), a lung cancer subtype that exhibits gastric differentiation and harbors a distinct spectrum of driver oncogenes. In murine BRAF&lt;sup&gt;V600E&lt;/sup&gt; driven lung adenocarcinoma, NKX2-1 is required for early tumorigenesis, but dispensable for established tumor growth. NKX2-1-deficient, BRAF&lt;sup&gt;V600E&lt;/sup&gt; driven tumors resemble human IMA and exhibit a distinct response to BRAF/MEK inhibitors. Whereas BRAF/MEK inhibitors drive NKX2-1-positive tumor cells into quiescence, NKX2-1-negative cells fail to exit the cell cycle after the same therapy. BRAF/MEK inhibitors induce cell identity switching in NKX2-1-negative lung tumors within the gastric lineage, which is driven in part by WNT signaling and FoxA1/2. These data elucidate a complex, reciprocal relationship between lineage specifiers and oncogenic signaling pathways in the regulation of lung adenocarcinoma identity that is likely to impact lineage-specific therapeutic strategies.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Whether ion channel gating is independent of ion permeation has been an enduring, unresolved question. Here, applying single channel recording to the archetypal muscle nicotinic receptor, we unmask coupling between channel gating and ion permeation by structural perturbation of a conserved intramembrane salt bridge. A charge-neutralizing mutation suppresses channel gating, reduces unitary current amplitude, and increases fluctuations of the open channel current. Power spectra of the current fluctuations exhibit low- and high-frequency Lorentzian components, which increase in charge-neutralized mutant receptors. After aligning channel openings and closings at the time of transition, the average unitary current exhibits asymmetric relaxations just after channel opening and before channel closing. A theory in which structural motions contribute jointly to channel gating and ion conduction describes both the power spectrum and the current relaxations. Coupling manifests as a transient increase in the open channel current upon channel opening and a decrease upon channel closing.</content>

 Aging, for virtually all life, is inescapable. However, within populations, biological aging rates vary. Understanding sources of variation in this process is central to understanding the biodemography of natural populations. We constructed a DNA methylation-based age predictor for an intensively studied wild baboon population in Kenya. Consistent with findings in humans, the resulting 'epigenetic clock' closely tracks chronological age, but individuals are predicted to be somewhat older or younger than their known ages. Surprisingly, these deviations are not explained by the strongest predictors of lifespan in this population, early adversity and social integration. Instead, they are best predicted by male dominance rank: high-ranking males are predicted to be older than their true ages, and epigenetic age tracks changes in rank over time. Our results argue that achieving high rank for male baboons—the best predictor of reproductive success—imposes costs consistent with a 'live fast, die young' life history strategy.</content>

 The hippocampus plays a central role in long-term memory formation, and different hippocampal network states are thought to have different functions in this process. These network states are controlled by neuromodulatory inputs, including the cholinergic input from the medial septum. Here, we used optogenetic stimulation of septal cholinergic neurons to understand how cholinergic activity affects different stages of spatial memory formation in a reward-based navigation task in mice. We found that optogenetic stimulation of septal cholinergic neurons (1) impaired memory formation when activated at goal location but not during navigation; (2) reduced sharp wave-ripple (SWR) incidence at goal location; and (3) reduced SWR incidence and enhanced theta-gamma oscillations during sleep. These results underscore the importance of appropriate timing of cholinergic input in long-term memory formation, which might help explain the limited success of cholinesterase inhibitor drugs in treating memory impairment in Alzheimer's disease.</content>

 Colistin is an antibiotic of last resort, but has poor efficacy and resistance is a growing problem. Whilst it is well established that colistin disrupts the bacterial outer membrane by selectively targeting lipopolysaccharide (LPS), it was unclear how this led to bacterial killing. We discovered that MCR-1 mediated colistin resistance in&lt;i&gt; Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; is due to modified LPS at the cytoplasmic rather than outer membrane. In doing so, we also demonstrated that colistin exerts bactericidal activity by targeting LPS in the cytoplasmic membrane. We then exploited this information to devise a new therapeutic approach. Using the LPS transport inhibitor murepavadin, we were able to cause LPS accumulation in the cytoplasmic membrane of &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt;, which resulted in increased susceptibility to colistin &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and improved treatment efficacy &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. These findings reveal new insight into the mechanism by which colistin kills bacteria, providing the foundations for novel approaches to enhance therapeutic outcomes.</content>

 In cognitive neuroscience, computational modeling can formally adjudicate between theories and affords quantitative fits to behavioral/brain data. Pragmatically, however, the space of plausible generative models considered is dramatically limited by the set of models with known likelihood functions. For many models, the lack of a closed-form likelihood typically impedes Bayesian inference methods. As a result, standard models are evaluated for convenience, even when other models might be superior. Likelihood-free methods exist but are limited by their computational cost or their restriction to particular inference scenarios. Here, we propose neural networks that learn approximate likelihoods for arbitrary generative models, allowing fast posterior sampling with only a one-off cost for model simulations that is amortized for future inference. We show that these methods can accurately recover posterior parameter distributions for a variety of neurocognitive process models. We provide code allowing users to deploy these methods for arbitrary hierarchical model instantiations without further training.</content>

 Ultrapotent chemogenetics, including the chloride-permeable inhibitory PSAM&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;-GlyR receptor, were recently proposed as a powerful strategy to selectively control neuronal activity in awake, behaving animals. We aimed to validate the inhibitory function of PSAM&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;-GlyR in dopamine D1 receptor-expressing medium spiny neurons (D1-MSNs) in the ventral striatum. Activation of PSAM&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;-GlyR with the uPSEM&lt;sup&gt;792&lt;/sup&gt; ligand enhanced rather than suppressed the activity of D1-MSNs in vivo as indicated by increased c-fos expression in D1-MSNs and in vitro as indicated by cell-attached recordings from D1-MSNs in mouse brain slices. Whole-cell recordings showed that activation of PSAM&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;-GlyR depolarized D1-MSNs, attenuated GABAergic inhibition, and shifted the reversal potential of PSAM&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;-GlyR current to more depolarized potentials, perpetuating the depolarizing effect of receptor activation. These data show that ‘inhibitory’ PSAM&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;-GlyR chemogenetics may activate certain cell types and highlight the pitfalls of utilizing chloride conductances to inhibit neurons.</content>

 Meningitis is a potentially life-threatening infection characterized by the inflammation of the leptomeningeal membranes. Many different viral and bacterial pathogens can cause meningitis, with differences in mortality rates, risk of developing neurological sequelae and treatment options. Here we constructed a compendium of digital cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteome maps to define pathogen-specific host response patterns in meningitis. The results revealed a drastic and pathogen-type specific influx of tissue-, cell- and plasma proteins in the CSF, where in particular a large increase of neutrophil derived proteins in the CSF correlated with acute bacterial meningitis. Additionally, both acute bacterial and viral meningitis result in marked reduction of brain-enriched proteins. Generation of a multi-protein LASSO regression model resulted in an 18-protein panel of cell and tissue associated proteins capable of classifying acute bacterial meningitis and viral meningitis. The same protein panel also enabled classification of tick-borne encephalitis, a subgroup of viral meningitis, with high sensitivity and specificity. The work provides insights into pathogen specific host response patterns in CSF from different disease etiologies to support future classification of pathogen-type based on host response patterns in meningitis.</content>

 Abstract
Previous findings on the relationship between prediabetes (the precursor stage of type 2 diabetes) and brain health in humans are inconsistent. Thus, this systematic review of cross‐sectional and longitudinal studies aimed to summarize what is currently known about brain deficits in prediabetic adults. Following the PRISMA reporting standards for systematic reviews, we conducted a comprehensive review of peer‐reviewed journal articles published from 2009 to present, focusing on studies that assessed brain volume, structural connectivity, and cerebrovascular health in prediabetic adults and older adults (i.e., 18 years or older). We systematically searched PsychINFO, Scopus, Web of Science, Ovid MEDLINE, CINAHL, and EMbase databases. Quality assessment was based on the NIH Quality Assessment Tool for Observational and Cross‐sectional Studies. In total, 19 studies were included in our review. Results from these studies show that prediabetes may be associated with deficits in brain structure and pathology, however, several studies also refute these findings. Moreover, we identified clear inconsistencies in study methodologies, including diabetes measures and classification, across studies that may account for these conflicting findings.</content>

 Rapid eye movement sleep deprivation‐associated elevated noradrenaline reduced neuronal‐branching and ‐spines, while synaptic‐length of active zones and ‐protein expressions showed compensatory increase. These changes offer possible cellular level explanation of behavioral effects. Consolidating these and previous findings suggest that REMS plays a crucial role in modulating brain noradrenaline, which affect neuronal plasticity in health and diseases. 

Abstract
Rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) favors brain development and memory, while it is decreased in neurodegenerative diseases. REMS deprivation (REMSD) affects several physiological processes including memory consolidation; however, its detailed mechanism(s) of action was unknown. REMS reduces, while REMSD elevates noradrenaline (NA) level in the brain; the latter induces several deficiencies and disorders, including changes in neuronal cytomorphology and apoptosis. Therefore, we proposed that REMS‐ and REMSD‐associated modulation of NA level might affect neuronal plasticity and affect brain functions. Male albino rats were REMS deprived by flower‐pot method for 6 days, and its effects were compared with home cage and large platform controls as well as post‐REMSD recovered and REMS‐deprived prazosin (α1‐adrenoceptor antagonist)‐treated rats. We observed that REMSD reduced CA1 and CA3 neuronal dendritic length, branching, arborization, and spine density, while length of active zone and expressions of pre‐ as well as post‐synaptic proteins were increased as compared to controls; interestingly, prazosin prevented most of the effects in vivo. Studies on primary culture of neurons from chick embryo brain confirmed that NA at lower concentration(s) induced neuronal branching and arborization, while higher doses were destructive. The findings support our contention that REMSD adversely affects neuronal plasticity, branching, and synaptic scaffold, which explain the underlying cytoarchitectural basis of REMSD‐associated patho‐physio‐behavioral changes. Consolidation of findings of this study along with that of our previous reports suggest that the neuronal disintegration could be due to either withdrawal of direct protective and proliferative role of low dose of NA or indirect effect of high dose of NA or both.</content>

Deregulation of the protein secretory pathway (PSP) is linked to many hallmarks of cancer, such as promoting tissue invasion and modulating cell-cell signaling. The collection of secreted proteins processed by the PSP, known as the secretome, is often studied due to its potential as a reservoir of tumor biomarkers. However, there has been less focus on the protein components of the secretory machinery itself. We therefore investigated the expression changes in secretory pathway components across many different cancer types. Specifically, we implemented a dual approach involving differential expression analysis and machine learning to identify PSP genes whose expression was associated with key tumor characteristics: mutation of p53, cancer status, and tumor stage. Eight different machine learning algorithms were included in the analysis to enable comparison between methods and to focus on signals that were robust to algorithm type. The machine learning approach was validated by identifying PSP genes known to be regulated by p53, and even outperformed the differential expression analysis approach. Among the different analysis methods and cancer types, the kinesin family members &lt;i&gt;KIF20A&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;KIF23&lt;/i&gt; were consistently among the top genes associated with malignant transformation or tumor stage. However, unlike most cancer types which exhibited elevated &lt;i&gt;KIF20A&lt;/i&gt; expression that remained relatively constant across tumor stages, renal carcinomas displayed a more gradual increase that continued with increasing disease severity. Collectively, our study demonstrates the complementary nature of a combined differential expression and machine learning approach for analyzing gene expression data, and highlights key PSP components relevant to features of tumor pathophysiology that may constitute potential therapeutic targets.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/SeGnUiuqoI0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Colony Stimulating Factor 1 Receptor (CSF1R) is a potential target for anti-epileptic drugs. However, inhibition of CSF1R is not well tolerated by patients, thereby prompting the need for alternative targets. To develop a framework for identification of such alternatives, we here develop a mathematical model of a pro-inflammatory gene regulatory network (GRN) involved in epilepsy and centered around CSF1R. This GRN comprises validated transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulations involving STAT1, STAT3, NFκB, IL6R, CSF3R, IRF8, PU1, C/EBPα, TNFR1, CSF1 and CSF1R. The model was calibrated on mRNA levels of all GRN components in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated mouse microglial BV-2 cells, and allowed to predict that STAT1 and STAT3 have the strongest impact on the expression of the other GRN components. Microglial BV-2 cells were selected because, the modules from which the GRN was deduced are enriched for microglial marker genes. The function of STAT1 and STAT3 in the GRN was experimentally validated in BV-2 cells. Further, &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; analysis of the GRN dynamics predicted that a pro-inflammatory stimulus can induce irreversible bistability whereby the expression level of GRN components occurs as two distinct states. The irreversibility of the switch may enforce the need for chronic inhibition of the CSF1R GRN in order to achieve therapeutic benefit. The cell-to-cell heterogeneity driven by the bistability may cause variable therapeutic response. In conclusion, our modeling approach uncovered a GRN controlling CSF1R that is predominantly regulated by STAT1 and STAT3. Irreversible inflammation-induced bistability and cell-to-cell heterogeneity of the GRN provide a theoretical foundation to the need for chronic GRN control and the limited potential for disease modification via inhibition of CSF1R.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/CXYdek2j0Zc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Pathway level understanding of cancer plays a key role in precision oncology. However, the current amount of high-throughput data cannot support the elucidation of full pathway topology. In this study, instead of directly learning the pathway network, we adapted the probabilistic OR gate to model the modular structure of pathways and regulon. The resulting model, OR-gate Network (ORN), can simultaneously infer pathway modules of somatic alterations, patient-specific pathway dysregulation status, and downstream regulon. In a trained ORN, the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in each tumour can be explained by somatic mutations perturbing a pathway module. Furthermore, the ORN handles one of the most important properties of pathway perturbation in tumours, the mutual exclusivity. We have applied the ORN to lower-grade glioma (LGG) samples and liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC) samples in TCGA and breast cancer samples from METABRIC. Both datasets have shown abnormal pathway activities related to immune response and cell cycles. In LGG samples, ORN identified pathway modules closely related to glioma development and revealed two pathways closely related to patient survival. We had similar results with LIHC samples. Additional results from the METABRIC datasets showed that ORN could characterize critical mechanisms of cancer and connect them to less studied somatic mutations (e.g., BAP1, MIR604, MICAL3, and telomere activities), which may generate novel hypothesis for targeted therapy.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/JmuPOL5Tct8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;An important problem in systems neuroscience is to understand how information is communicated among brain regions, and it has been proposed that communication is mediated by neuronal oscillations, such as rhythms in the gamma band. We sought to investigate this idea by using a network model with two components, a source (sending) and a target (receiving) component, both built to resemble local populations in the cerebral cortex. To measure the effectiveness of communication, we used population-level correlations in spike times between the source and target. We found that after correcting for a response time that is independent of initial conditions, spike-time correlations between the source and target are significant, due in large measure to the alignment of firing events in their gamma rhythms. But, we also found that regular oscillations cannot produce the results observed in our model simulations of cortical neurons. Surprisingly, it is the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;irregularity&lt;/em&gt; of gamma rhythms, the absence of internal clocks, together with the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;malleability&lt;/em&gt; of these rhythms and their tendency to align with external pulses — features that are known to be present in gamma rhythms in the real cortex — that produced the results observed. These findings and the mechanistic explanations we offered are our primary results. Our secondary result is a mathematical relationship between correlations and the sizes of the samples used for their calculation. As improving technology enables recording simultaneously from increasing numbers of neurons, this relationship could be useful for interpreting results from experimental recordings.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Objective
Knowing explicitly where we are is an interpretation of our spatial representations. Reduplicative paramnesia is a disrupting syndrome in which patients present a firm belief of spatial mislocation. Here, we studied the largest sample of patients with delusional misidentifications of space (i.e. reduplicative paramnesia) after stroke to shed light on their neurobiology.


Methods
In a prospective, cumulative, case–control study, we screened 400 patients with acute right‐hemispheric stroke. We included 64 cases and 233 controls. First, lesions were delimited and normalized. Then, we computed structural and functional disconnection maps using methods of lesion‐track and network‐mapping. The maps were compared, controlling for confounders.
Second, we built a multivariate logistic model including clinical, behavioural and neuroimaging data. Finally, we performed a nested cross‐validation of the model with a support‐vector machine analysis.


Results
The most frequent misidentification subtype was confabulatory mislocation (56%), followed by place reduplication (19%) and chimeric assimilation (13%).
Our results indicate that structural disconnection is the strongest predictor of the syndrome and included two distinct streams, connecting right fronto‐thalamic and right occipito‐temporal structures.
In the multivariate model, the independent predictors of reduplicative paramnesia were the structural disconnection map, lesion sparing of right dorsal fronto‐parietal regions, age and anosognosia. Good discrimination accuracy was demonstrated (area under the curve = 0.80[0.75–0.85]).


Interpretation
Our results localize the anatomical circuits that may have a role in the abnormal spatial‐emotional binding and in the defective updating of spatial representations underlying reduplicative paramnesia. This novel data may contribute to better understand the pathophysiology of delusional syndromes after stroke.

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec1&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Ross syndrome is a rare disorder characterized by tonic pupils, hyporeflexia, and segmental anhidrosis. We sought to characterize the clinical presentation, associated autoimmune disorders, and autonomic profile in patients with Ross syndrome to further elucidate its pathophysiology.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We performed a retrospective chart review of all patients who underwent a thermoregulatory sweat test (TST) between 1998 and 2020 and had confirmation of the diagnosis of Ross syndrome by an autonomic disorders specialist. Standardized autonomic reflex testing was reviewed when available.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Twenty-six patients with Ross syndrome were identified. The most common initial reported manifestation was an abnormal segmental sweating response in 16 patients (described as hyperhidrosis in 12 patients and anhidrosis in 4 patients) while a tonic pupil was the initial manifestation in 10 patients. Other commonly reported symptoms included fatigue, chronic cough, and increased urinary frequency. An associated autoimmune disorder was identified in one patient. Positive autoantibodies were found in a minority of patients often with unclear clinical significance. Distributions of anhidrosis encountered were segmental (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 15), widespread (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 7), and global (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 4). Well-circumscribed small areas of preserved sweating within areas of anhidrosis were observed in the majority of patients (88.5%). Anhidrosis progressed slowly over time and sudomotor dysfunction was predominantly (post)ganglionic. Cardiovagal and adrenergic functions were preserved in most patients.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The pattern of autonomic dysfunction in Ross syndrome is suggestive of a limited autonomic ganglioneuropathy. Sudomotor impairment is prominent and should be the focus of symptomatic management; however, clinicians should be aware of symptoms beyond the classic triad.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Biallelic &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;STUB1&lt;/em&gt; variants are a well-established cause of autosomal-recessive early-onset multisystemic ataxia (SCAR16). Evidence for &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;STUB1&lt;/em&gt; variants causing autosomal-dominant ataxia (SCA48) so far largely relies on segregation data in larger families. Presenting the first de novo occurrence of a heterozygous &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;STUB1&lt;/em&gt; variant, we here present additional qualitative evidence for STUB1-disease as an autosomal-dominant disorder.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Whole exome sequencing on an index patient with sporadic early-onset ataxia, followed by Sanger sequencing in all family members, was used to identify causative variants as well as to rule out alternative genetic hits and intronic &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;STUB1&lt;/em&gt; variants. &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;STUB1&lt;/em&gt; mRNA and protein levels in PBMCs in all family members were analysed using qRT-PCR and Western Blot.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;A previously unreported start-lost loss-of-function variant c.3G&amp;gt;A in the start codon of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;STUB1&lt;/em&gt; was identified in the index case, occurring de novo and without evidence for a second (potentially missed) variant (e.g., intronic or copy number) in &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;STUB1&lt;/em&gt;. The patient showed an early adult-onset multisystemic ataxia complicated by spastic gait disorder, distal myoclonus and cognitive dysfunction, thus closely mirroring the systems affected in autosomal-recessive STUB1-associated disease. In line with the predicted start-lost effect of the variant, functional investigations demonstrated markedly reduced STUB1 protein expression in PBMCs, whereas mRNA levels were intact.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;De novo occurrence of the loss-of-function &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;STUB1&lt;/em&gt; variant in our case with multisystemic ataxia provides a qualitatively additional line of evidence for STUB1-disease as an autosomal-dominant disorder, in which the same neurological systems are affected as in its autosomal-recessive counterpart. Moreover, this finding adds support for loss-of-function as a mechanism underlying autosomal-dominant STUB1-disease, thus mirroring its autosomal-recessive counterpart also in terms of the underlying mutational mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;

The electroencephalogram (EEG) is a major tool for non-invasively studying brain function and dysfunction. Comparing experimentally recorded EEGs with neural network models is important to better interpret EEGs in terms of neural mechanisms. Most current neural network models use networks of simple point neurons. They capture important properties of cortical dynamics, and are numerically or analytically tractable. However, point neurons cannot generate an EEG, as EEG generation requires spatially separated transmembrane currents. Here, we explored how to compute an accurate approximation of a rodent’s EEG with quantities defined in point-neuron network models. We constructed different approximations (or proxies) of the EEG signal that can be computed from networks of leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) point neurons, such as firing rates, membrane potentials, and combinations of synaptic currents. We then evaluated how well each proxy reconstructed a ground-truth EEG obtained when the synaptic currents of the LIF model network were fed into a three-dimensional network model of multicompartmental neurons with realistic morphologies. Proxies based on linear combinations of AMPA and GABA currents performed better than proxies based on firing rates or membrane potentials. A new class of proxies, based on an optimized linear combination of time-shifted AMPA and GABA currents, provided the most accurate estimate of the EEG over a wide range of network states. The new linear proxies explained 85–95% of the variance of the ground-truth EEG for a wide range of network configurations including different cell morphologies, distributions of presynaptic inputs, positions of the recording electrode, and spatial extensions of the network. Non-linear EEG proxies using a convolutional neural network (CNN) on synaptic currents increased proxy performance by a further 2–8%. Our proxies can be used to easily calculate a biologically realistic EEG signal directly from point-neuron simulations thus facilitating a quantitative comparison between computational models and experimental EEG recordings.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ISn4r3l7CUU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Protein-protein interaction networks are one of the most effective representations of cellular behavior. In order to build these models, high-throughput techniques are required. Next-generation interaction screening (NGIS) protocols that combine yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) with deep sequencing are promising approaches to generate interactome networks in any organism. However, challenges remain to mining reliable information from these screens and thus, limit its broader implementation. Here, we present a computational framework, designated Y2H-SCORES, for analyzing high-throughput Y2H screens. Y2H-SCORES considers key aspects of NGIS experimental design and important characteristics of the resulting data that distinguish it from RNA-seq expression datasets. Three quantitative ranking scores were implemented to identify interacting partners, comprising: 1) significant enrichment under selection for positive interactions, 2) degree of interaction specificity among multi-bait comparisons, and 3) selection of &lt;i&gt;in-frame&lt;/i&gt; interactors. Using simulation and an empirical dataset, we provide a quantitative assessment to predict interacting partners under a wide range of experimental scenarios, facilitating independent confirmation by one-to-one bait-prey tests. Simulation of Y2H-NGIS enabled us to identify conditions that maximize detection of true interactors, which can be achieved with protocols such as prey library normalization, maintenance of larger culture volumes and replication of experimental treatments. Y2H-SCORES can be implemented in different yeast-based interaction screenings, with an equivalent or superior performance than existing methods. Proof-of-concept was demonstrated by discovery and validation of novel interactions between the barley nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) immune receptor MLA6, and fourteen proteins, including those that function in signaling, transcriptional regulation, and intracellular trafficking.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/uOSOP0HE0Ik&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

The world continues to face a life-threatening viral pandemic. The virus underlying the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has caused over 98 million confirmed cases and 2.2 million deaths since January 2020. Although the most recent respiratory viral pandemic swept the globe only a decade ago, the way science operates and responds to current events has experienced a cultural shift in the interim. The scientific community has responded rapidly to the COVID-19 pandemic, releasing over 125,000 COVID-19–related scientific articles within 10 months of the first confirmed case, of which more than 30,000 were hosted by preprint servers. We focused our analysis on bioRxiv and medRxiv, 2 growing preprint servers for biomedical research, investigating the attributes of COVID-19 preprints, their access and usage rates, as well as characteristics of their propagation on online platforms. Our data provide evidence for increased scientific and public engagement with preprints related to COVID-19 (COVID-19 preprints are accessed more, cited more, and shared more on various online platforms than non-COVID-19 preprints), as well as changes in the use of preprints by journalists and policymakers. We also find evidence for changes in preprinting and publishing behaviour: COVID-19 preprints are shorter and reviewed faster. Our results highlight the unprecedented role of preprints and preprint servers in the dissemination of COVID-19 science and the impact of the pandemic on the scientific communication landscape.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/HcSkXYHORoI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 Mice lacking the microglial receptor CX3CR1 display several phenotypes in the auditory brainstem. They have normal pruning in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) and increased expression of mature astrocyte markers. They have normal auditory brainstem recording (ABR) thresholds, but the ABR latencies are decreased. They show increased expression of inhibitory presynaptic terminal markers, possibly reflecting impaired inhibitory pruning.  Finally, CX3CR1‐/‐ mice lack the tonotopic gradients seen for cell body size and calyx of Held size in the MNTB.







ABSTRACT
The precise and specialized circuitry in the auditory brainstem develops through adaptations of cellular and molecular signaling. We previously showed that elimination of microglia during development impairs synaptic pruning that leads to maturation of the calyx of Held, a large encapsulating synapse that terminates on neurons of the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB). Microglia depletion also led to a decrease of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a marker for mature astrocytes. Here we investigated the role of signaling through the fractalkine receptor (CX3CR1), which is expressed by microglia and mediates communication with neurons. CX3CR1‐/‐ and wild type mice were studied before and after hearing onset and at 9 weeks of age. Levels of GFAP were significantly increased in the MNTB in mutants at 9 weeks. Pruning was unaffected at the calyx of Held, but we found an increase in expression of glycinergic synaptic marker in mutant mice at P14, suggesting an effect on maturation of inhibitory inputs. We observed disrupted tonotopic gradients of neuron and calyx size in MNTB in mutant mice. Auditory brainstem recording (ABR) revealed that CX3CR1‐/‐ mice had normal thresholds and amplitudes, but decreased latencies and inter‐peak latencies, particularly for the highest frequencies. These results demonstrate that disruption of fractalkine signaling has a significant effect on auditory brainstem development. Our findings highlight the importance of neuron‐microglia‐astrocyte communication in pruning of inhibitory synapses and establishment of tonotopic gradients early in postnatal development.

Bacteria utilize a wide variety of endogenous cell wall hydrolases, or autolysins, to remodel their cell walls during processes including cell division, biofilm formation, and programmed death. We here systematically investigate the composition of these enzymes in order to gain insights into their associated biological processes, potential ways to disrupt them via chemotherapeutics, and strategies by which they might be leveraged as recombinant antibacterial biotherapies. To do so, we developed LEDGOs (lytic enzyme domains grouped by organism), a pipeline to create and analyze databases of autolytic enzyme sequences, constituent domain annotations, and architectural patterns of multi-domain enzymes that integrate peptidoglycan binding and degrading functions. We applied LEDGOs to eight pathogenic bacteria, gram negatives &lt;i&gt;Acinetobacter baumannii&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Klebsiella pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Neisseria gonorrhoeae&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt;; and gram positives &lt;i&gt;Clostridioides difficile&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Enterococcus faecium&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Streptococcus pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt;. Our analysis of the autolytic enzyme repertoires of these pathogens reveals commonalities and differences in their key domain building blocks and architectures, including correlations and preferred orders among domains in multi-domain enzymes, repetitions of homologous binding domains with potentially complementarity recognition modalities, and sequence similarity patterns indicative of potential divergence of functional specificity among related domains. We have further identified a variety of unannotated sequence regions within the lytic enzymes that may themselves contain new domains with important functions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/WZszWqbC3p4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

In recent studies of humans estimating non-stationary probabilities, estimates appear to be unbiased on average, across the full range of probability values to be estimated. This finding is surprising given that experiments measuring probability estimation in other contexts have often identified &lt;i&gt;conservatism&lt;/i&gt;: individuals tend to overestimate low probability events and underestimate high probability events. In other contexts, &lt;i&gt;repulsive&lt;/i&gt; biases have also been documented, with individuals producing judgments that tend toward extreme values instead. Using extensive data from a probability estimation task that produces unbiased performance on average, we find substantial biases at the individual level; we document the coexistence of both conservative and repulsive biases in the same experimental context. Individual biases persist despite extensive experience with the task, and are also correlated with other behavioral differences, such as individual variation in response speed and adjustment rates. We conclude that the rich computational demands of our task give rise to a variety of behavioral patterns, and that the apparent unbiasedness of the pooled data is an artifact of the aggregation of heterogeneous biases.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/u97HhtFHUF0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

The arrangement and physiology of muscle fibres can strongly influence musculoskeletal function and whole-organismal performance. However, experimental investigation of muscle function during &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; activity is typically limited to relatively few muscles in a given system. Computational models and simulations of the musculoskeletal system can partly overcome these limitations, by exploring the dynamics of muscles, tendons and other tissues in a robust and quantitative fashion. Here, a high-fidelity, 26-degree-of-freedom musculoskeletal model was developed of the hindlimb of a small ground bird, the elegant-crested tinamou (&lt;i&gt;Eudromia elegans&lt;/i&gt;, ~550 g), including all the major muscles of the limb (36 actuators per leg). The model was integrated with biplanar fluoroscopy (XROMM) and forceplate data for walking and running, where dynamic optimization was used to estimate muscle excitations and fibre length changes throughout both gaits. Following this, a series of static simulations over the total range of physiological limb postures were performed, to circumscribe the bounds of possible variation in fibre length. During gait, fibre lengths for all muscles remained between 0.5 to 1.21 times optimal fibre length, but operated mostly on the ascending limb and plateau of the active force-length curve, a result that parallels previous experimental findings for birds, humans and other species. However, the ranges of fibre length varied considerably among individual muscles, especially when considered across the total possible range of joint excursion. Net length change of muscle–tendon units was mostly less than optimal fibre length, sometimes markedly so, suggesting that approaches that use muscle–tendon length change to estimate optimal fibre length in extinct species are likely underestimating this important parameter for many muscles. The results of this study clarify and broaden understanding of muscle function in extant animals, and can help refine approaches used to study extinct species.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/_ciS8QiJ5LY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Developing new methods for modelling infectious diseases outbreaks is important for monitoring transmission and developing policy. In this paper we propose using semi-mechanistic Hawkes Processes for modelling malaria transmission in near-elimination settings. Hawkes Processes are well founded mathematical methods that enable us to combine the benefits of both statistical and mechanistic models to recreate and forecast disease transmission beyond just malaria outbreak scenarios. These methods have been successfully used in numerous applications such as social media and earthquake modelling, but are not yet widespread in epidemiology. By using domain-specific knowledge, we can both recreate transmission curves for malaria in China and Eswatini and disentangle the proportion of cases which are imported from those that are community based.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/n97vhwlCm4U&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

The primary immunological target of COVID-19 vaccines is the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein. S is exposed on the viral surface and mediates viral entry into the host cell. To identify possible antibody binding sites, we performed multi-microsecond molecular dynamics simulations of a 4.1 million atom system containing a patch of viral membrane with four full-length, fully glycosylated and palmitoylated S proteins. By mapping steric accessibility, structural rigidity, sequence conservation, and generic antibody binding signatures, we recover known epitopes on S and reveal promising epitope candidates for structure-based vaccine design. We find that the extensive and inherently flexible glycan coat shields a surface area larger than expected from static structures, highlighting the importance of structural dynamics. The protective glycan shield and the high flexibility of its hinges give the stalk overall low epitope scores. Our computational epitope-mapping procedure is general and should thus prove useful for other viral envelope proteins whose structures have been characterized.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Acqu72UmLb8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Nearly all mammals have a vibrissal system specialized for tactile sensation, composed of whiskers growing from sensor-rich follicles in the skin. When a whisker deflects against an object, it deforms within the follicle and exerts forces on the mechanoreceptors inside. In addition, during active whisking behavior, muscle contractions around the follicle and increases in blood pressure in the ring sinus will affect the whisker deformation profile. To date, however, it is not yet possible to experimentally measure how the whisker deforms in an intact follicle or its effects on different groups of mechanoreceptors. The present study develops a novel model to predict vibrissal deformation within the follicle sinus complex. The model is based on experimental results from a previous &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; study on whisker deformation within the follicle, and on a new histological analysis of follicle tissue. It is then used to simulate whisker deformation within the follicle during passive touch and active whisking. Results suggest that the most likely whisker deformation profile is “S-shaped,” crossing the midline of the follicle right below the ring sinus. Simulations of active whisking indicate that an increase in overall muscle stiffness, an increase in the ratio between deep and superficial intrinsic muscle stiffness, and an increase in sinus blood pressure will all enhance tactile sensitivity. Finally, we discuss how the deformation profiles might map to the responses of primary afferents of each mechanoreceptor type. The mechanical model presented in this study is an important first step in simulating mechanical interactions within whisker follicles.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/fDgtlkYxIss&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

General anesthesia is characterized by reversible loss of consciousness accompanied by transient amnesia. Yet, long-term memory impairment is an undesirable side effect. How different types of general anesthetics (GAs) affect the hippocampus, a brain region central to memory formation and consolidation, is poorly understood. Using extracellular recordings, chronic 2-photon imaging, and behavioral analysis, we monitor the effects of isoflurane (Iso), medetomidine/midazolam/fentanyl (MMF), and ketamine/xylazine (Keta/Xyl) on network activity and structural spine dynamics in the hippocampal CA1 area of adult mice. GAs robustly reduced spiking activity, decorrelated cellular ensembles, albeit with distinct activity signatures, and altered spine dynamics. CA1 network activity under all 3 anesthetics was different to natural sleep. Iso anesthesia most closely resembled unperturbed activity during wakefulness and sleep, and network alterations recovered more readily than with Keta/Xyl and MMF. Correspondingly, memory consolidation was impaired after exposure to Keta/Xyl and MMF, but not Iso. Thus, different anesthetics distinctly alter hippocampal network dynamics, synaptic connectivity, and memory consolidation, with implications for GA strategy appraisal in animal research and clinical settings.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/5KUMfdk5WG0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Here, we reveal that the regulation of &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; odorant receptor (OR) expression during the pupal stage is permissive and imprecise. We found that directly after hatching an OR feedback mechanism both directs and refines OR expression. We demonstrate that, as in mice, &lt;i&gt;dLsd1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Su(var)3-9&lt;/i&gt; balance heterochromatin formation to direct OR expression. We show that the expressed OR induces &lt;i&gt;dLsd1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Su(var)3-9&lt;/i&gt; expression, linking OR level and possibly function to OR expression. OR expression refinement shows a restricted duration, suggesting that a gene regulatory critical period brings olfactory sensory neuron differentiation to an end. Consistent with a change in differentiation, stress during the critical period represses &lt;i&gt;dLsd1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Su(var)3-9&lt;/i&gt; expression and makes the early permissive OR expression permanent. This induced permissive gene regulatory state makes OR expression resilient to stress later in life. Hence, during a critical period OR feedback, similar to in mouse OR selection, defines adult OR expression in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/TxmQGxP8xfM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 Using neuronal tract tracing and immunohistochemical methods, we have identified a previously unreported group of auditory efferent neurons located in the ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus that project unmyelinated axons to the inner hair cell region in mouse. These “dorsal efferents” were then anatomically characterized using a combination of light, fluorescent and electron microscopy, and their possible functional significance within the context of the known olivocochlear efferents is discussed.







Abstract
Auditory efferents originate in the central auditory system and project to the cochlea. Although the specific anatomy of the olivocochlear (OC) efferents can vary between species, two types of auditory efferents have been identified based upon the general location of their cell bodies and their distinctly different axon terminations in the organ of Corti. In the mouse, the relatively small somata of the lateral (LOC) efferents reside in the lateral superior olive (LSO), have unmyelinated axons, and terminate around ipsilateral inner hair cells (IHCs), primarily against the afferent processes of type I auditory nerve fibers. In contrast, the larger somata of the medial (MOC) efferents are distributed in the ventral nucleus of the trapezoid body (VNTB), have myelinated axons, and terminate bilaterally against the base of multiple outer hair cells (OHCs). Using in vivo retrograde cell body marking, anterograde axon tracing, immunohistochemistry, and electron microscopy, we have identified a group of efferent neurons in mouse, whose cell bodies reside in the ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus (VNLL). By virtue of their location, we call them dorsal efferent (DE) neurons. Labeled DE cells were immuno‐negative for tyrosine hydroxylase, glycine, and GABA, but immuno‐positive for choline acetyltransferase. Morphologically, DEs resembled LOC efferents by their small somata, unmyelinated axons, and ipsilateral projection to IHCs. These three classes of efferent neurons all project axons directly to the cochlea and exhibit cholinergic staining characteristics. The challenge is to discover the contributions of this new population of neurons to auditory efferent function.</content>

 A rapidly expanding catalog of neurogenetic disorders has encouraged a diagnostic shift towards early clinical whole exome sequencing (WES). Adult primary mitochondrial diseases (PMDs) frequently exhibit neurological manifestations that overlap with other nervous system disorders. However, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is not routinely analyzed in standard clinical WES bioinformatic pipelines. We reanalyzed 11,424 exomes, enriched with neurological diseases, for pathogenic mtDNA variants. Twenty‐four different mtDNA mutations were detected in 64 exomes, 11 of which were considered disease causing based on the associated clinical phenotypes. These findings highlight the diagnostic uplifts gained by analyzing mtDNA from WES data in neurological diseases. ANN NEUROL 2021</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Regulation of AMPA receptor expression by neuronal activity and neuromodulators is critical to the expression of both long-term potentiation (LTP) and memory. In particular, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-permeable AMPARs (CP-AMPAR) play a unique role in these processes due to their transient, activity-regulated expression at synapses. Secreted amyloid precursor protein-alpha (sAPPα), a metabolite of the parent amyloid precursor protein (APP) has been previously shown to enhance hippocampal LTP as well as memory formation in both normal animals and in Alzheimer’s disease models. In earlier work we showed that sAPPα promotes trafficking of GluA1-containing AMPARs to the cell surface and specifically enhances synthesis of GluA1. To date it is not known whether de novo synthesized GluA1 form CP-AMPARs or how they contribute to sAPPα-mediated plasticity. Here, using fluorescent non-canonical amino acid tagging–proximity ligation assay (FUNCAT-PLA), we show that brief treatment of primary rat hippocampal neurons with sAPPα (1 nM, 30 min) rapidly enhanced the cell-surface expression of de novo GluA1 homomers and reduced levels of de novo GluA2, as well as extant GluA2/3-AMPARs. The de novo GluA1-containing AMPARs were localized to extrasynaptic sites and later internalized by sAPPα-driven expression of the activity-regulated cytoskeletal-associated protein, Arc. Interestingly, longer exposure to sAPPα increased synaptic levels of GluA1/2 AMPARs. Moreover, the sAPPα-mediated enhancement of LTP in area CA1 of acute hippocampal slices was dependent on CP-AMPARs. Together, these findings show that sAPPα engages mechanisms which specifically enhance the synthesis and cell-surface expression of GluA1 homomers, underpinning the sAPPα-driven enhancement of synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Objective: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has shown promising outcomes as new therapeutic opportunities for patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) who do not respond adequately to several consecutive treatments. This study aims to systematically review and conduct a meta-analysis on the efficacy and safety of DBS for TRD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Method: The literature was comprehensively reviewed using Medline, Google scholar, Cochrane library, Embase, and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform until January 2019. The studied outcomes included response, remission, recurrence, and adverse events (AEs) rates, and were reported as the rate ratio (RR) or pooled estimate with a 95% confidence interval (95% CI). Heterogeneity was measured by an I-square test and a sensitive analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: A total of 17 studies involving 7 DBS targets were included. For efficacy, DBS treatment was statistically beneficial for TRD, and the response, remission, and recurrence rates were 56% (ranging from 43 to 69%), 35% (ranging from 27 to 44%), and 14% (ranging from 4 to 25%), respectively. However, only two randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) considered the invalidity of DBS (RR = 1.45, 95% CI = 0.50–4.21). For safety, the AEs rate was 67% (ranging from 54 to 80%). The AEs were common and moderate, but the problems related to suicide and suicidal ideation should not be underestimated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: These findings suggest that DBS for TRD is considered promising, which should be confirmed by well-designed and large sample studies. Future basic research and comprehensive clinical trials are needed to reach better understanding on the mechanisms of action and optimal targeted structure.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;With the advent of advanced machine learning methods, the performance of brain–computer interfaces (BCIs) has improved unprecedentedly. However, electroencephalography (EEG), a commonly used brain imaging method for BCI, is characterized by a tedious experimental setup, frequent data loss due to artifacts, and is time consuming for bulk trial recordings to take advantage of the capabilities of deep learning classifiers. Some studies have tried to address this issue by generating artificial EEG signals. However, a few of these methods are limited in retaining the prominent features or biomarker of the signal. And, other deep learning-based generative methods require a huge number of samples for training, and a majority of these models can handle data augmentation of one category or class of data at any training session. Therefore, there exists a necessity for a generative model that can generate synthetic EEG samples with as few available trials as possible and generate multi-class while retaining the biomarker of the signal. Since EEG signal represents an accumulation of action potentials from neuronal populations beneath the scalp surface and as spiking neural network (SNN), a biologically closer artificial neural network, communicates via spiking behavior, we propose an SNN-based approach using surrogate-gradient descent learning to reconstruct and generate multi-class artificial EEG signals from just a few original samples. The network was employed for augmenting motor imagery (MI) and steady-state visually evoked potential (SSVEP) data. These artificial data are further validated through classification and correlation metrics to assess its resemblance with original data and in-turn enhanced the MI classification performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Despite the acceleration of knowledge and data accumulation in neuroscience over the last years, the highly prevalent neurodegenerative disease of AD remains a growing problem. Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia and represents the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease. For AD, disease-modifying treatments are presently lacking, and the understanding of disease mechanisms continues to be incomplete. In the present review, we discuss candidate contributing factors leading to AD, and evaluate novel computational brain simulation methods to further disentangle their potential roles. We first present an overview of existing computational models for AD that aim to provide a mechanistic understanding of the disease. Next, we outline the potential to link molecular aspects of neurodegeneration in AD with large-scale brain network modeling using The Virtual Brain (www.thevirtualbrain.org), an open-source, multiscale, whole-brain simulation neuroinformatics platform. Finally, we discuss how this methodological approach may contribute to the understanding, improved diagnostics, and treatment optimization of AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Ataxia is a kind of external characteristics when the human body has poor coordination and balance disorder, it often indicates diseases in certain parts of the body. Many internal factors may causing ataxia; currently, observed external characteristics, combined with Doctor’s personal clinical experience play main roles in diagnosing ataxia. In this situation, different kinds of diseases may be confused, leading to the delay in treatment and recovery. Modern high precision medical instruments would provide better accuracy but the economic cost is a non-negligible factor. In this paper, novel non-contact sensing technique is used to detect and distinguish sensory ataxia and cerebellar ataxia. Firstly, Romberg’s test and gait analysis data are collected by the microwave sensing platform; then, after some preprocessing, some machine learning approaches have been applied to train the models. For Romberg’s test, time domain features are considered, the accuracy of all the three algorithms are higher than 96%; for gait detection, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used for dimensionality reduction, and the accuracies of Back Propagation (BP) neural Network, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF) are 97.8, 98.9, and 91.1%, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 Background&lt;p&gt;Public health guidelines have recommended that elective medical procedures, including deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery for Parkinson’s disease (PD), should not be scheduled during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic to prevent further virus spread and overload on health care systems. However, delaying DBS surgery for PD may not be in the best interest of individual patients and is not called for in regions where virus spread is under control and inpatient facilities are not overloaded.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We administered a newly developed phone questionnaire to 20 consecutive patients with PD who received DBS surgery in Ruijin Hospital in Shanghai during the COVID-19 pandemic. The questionnaire was designed to gather the patients’ experiences and perceptions on the impact of COVID-19 on their everyday activities and access to medical care.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Most of the patients felt confident about the preventive measures taken by the government and hospitals, and they have changed their daily living activities accordingly. Moreover, a large majority of patients felt confident obtaining access to regular and COVID-19-related health care services if needed. Routine clinical referral, sense of security in the hospital during the outbreak, and poor control of PD symptoms were the three main reasons given by patients for seeking DBS surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic has considerably impacted medical care and patients’ lives but elective procedures, such as DBS surgery for PD, do not need to be rescheduled when the health care system is not overloaded and adequate public health regulations are in place.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Cognitive and neural processes underlying visual creativity have attracted substantial attention. The current research uses a critical time point analysis (CTPA) to examine how spontaneous activity in the primary visual area (PVA) is related to visual creativity. We acquired the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data of 16 participants at the resting state and during performing a visual creative synthesis task. According to the CTPA, we then classified spontaneous activity in the PVA into critical time points (CTPs), which reflect the most useful and important functional meaning of the entire resting-state condition, and the remaining time points (RTPs). We constructed functional brain networks based on the brain activity at two different time points and then subsequently based on the brain activity at the task state in a separate manner. We explore the relationship between resting-state and task-fMRI (T-fMRI) functional brain networks. Our results found that: (1) the pattern of spontaneous activity in the PVA may associate with mental imagery, which plays an important role in visual creativity; (2) in comparison with the RTPs-based brain network, the CTP-network showed an increase in global efficiency and a decrease in local efficiency; (3) the regional integrated properties of the CTP-network could predict the integrated properties of the creative-network while the RTP-network could not. Thus, our findings indicated that spontaneous activity in the PVA at CTPs was associated with a visual creative task-evoked brain response. Our findings may provide an insight into how the visual cortex is related to visual creativity.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;The McGurk illusion occurs when listeners hear an illusory percept (i.e., “da”), resulting from mismatched pairings of audiovisual (AV) speech stimuli (i.e., auditory/ba/paired with visual/ga/). Hearing a third percept—distinct from both the auditory and visual input—has been used as evidence of AV fusion. We examined whether the McGurk illusion is instead driven by visual dominance, whereby the third percept, e.g., “da,” represents a default percept for visemes with an ambiguous place of articulation (POA), like/ga/. Participants watched videos of a talker uttering various consonant vowels (CVs) with (AV) and without (V-only) audios of/ba/. Individuals transcribed the CV they saw (V-only) or heard (AV). In the V-only condition, individuals predominantly saw “da”/“ta” when viewing CVs with indiscernible POAs. Likewise, in the AV condition, upon perceiving an illusion, they predominantly heard “da”/“ta” for CVs with indiscernible POAs. The illusion was stronger in individuals who exhibited weak/ba/auditory encoding (examined using a control auditory-only task). In Experiment2, we attempted to replicate these findings using stimuli recorded from a different talker. The V-only results were not replicated, but again individuals predominately heard “da”/“ta”/“tha” as an illusory percept for various AV combinations, and the illusion was stronger in individuals who exhibited weak/ba/auditory encoding. These results demonstrate that when visual CVs with indiscernible POAs are paired with a weakly encoded auditory/ba/, listeners default to hearing “da”/“ta”/“tha”—thus, tempering the AV fusion account, and favoring a default mechanism triggered when both AV stimuli are ambiguous.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Gamma and theta oscillations have been functionally associated with cognitive processes, such as learning and memory. Synaptic conductances play an important role in the generation of intrinsic network rhythmicity, but few studies have examined the effects of voltage-gated ion channels (VGICs) on these rhythms. In this report, we have used a pyramidal-interneuron-gamma (PING) network consisting of excitatory pyramidal cells and two types of inhibitory interneurons. We have constructed a conductance-based neural network incorporating a persistent sodium current (I&lt;sub&gt;NaP&lt;/sub&gt;), a delayed rectifier potassium current (I&lt;sub&gt;KDR&lt;/sub&gt;), a inactivating potassium current (I&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;) and a hyperpolarization-activated current (I&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;). We have investigated the effects of several conductances on network theta and gamma frequency oscillations. Variation of all conductances of interest changed network rhythmicity. Theta power was altered by all conductances tested. Gamma rhythmogenesis was dependent on I&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; and I&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;. The I&lt;sub&gt;KDR&lt;/sub&gt; currents in excitatory pyramidal cells as well as both types of inhibitory interneurons were essential for theta rhythmogenesis and altered gamma rhythm properties. Increasing I&lt;sub&gt;NaP&lt;/sub&gt; suppressed both gamma and theta rhythms. Addition of noise did not alter these patterns. Our findings suggest that VGICs strongly affect brain network rhythms. Further investigations in vivo will be of great interest, including potential effects on neural function and cognition.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Sensing changes in the environment is crucial for survival. Animals from invertebrates to vertebrates use both visual and olfactory stimuli to direct survival behaviors including identification of food sources, finding mates, and predator avoidance. In primary sensory neurons there are signal transduction mechanisms that convert chemical or light signals into an electrical response through ligand binding or photoactivation of a receptor, that can be propagated to the olfactory and visual centers of the brain to create a perception of the odor and visual landscapes surrounding us. The fundamental principles of olfactory and phototransduction pathways within vertebrates are somewhat analogous. Signal transduction in both systems takes place in the ciliary sub-compartments of the sensory cells and relies upon the activation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to close cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) cation channels in photoreceptors to produce a hyperpolarization of the cell, or in olfactory sensory neurons open CNG channels to produce a depolarization. However, while invertebrate phototransduction also involves GPCRs, invertebrate photoreceptors can be either ciliary and/or microvillar with hyperpolarizing and depolarizing responses to light, respectively. Moreover, olfactory transduction in invertebrates may be a mixture of metabotropic G protein and ionotropic signaling pathways. This review will highlight differences of the visual and olfactory transduction mechanisms between vertebrates and invertebrates, focusing on the implications to the gain of the transduction processes, and how they are modulated to allow detection of small changes in odor concentration and light intensity over a wide range of background stimulus levels.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease of the motor system with complex determinants, including genetic and non-genetic factors. Despite this heterogeneity, a key pathological signature is the mislocalization and aggregation of specific proteins in the cytoplasm, suggesting that convergent pathogenic mechanisms focusing on disturbances in proteostasis are important in ALS. In addition, many cellular processes have been identified as potentially contributing to disease initiation and progression, such as defects in axonal transport, autophagy, nucleocytoplasmic transport, ER stress, calcium metabolism, the unfolded protein response and mitochondrial function. Here we review the evidence from in vitro and in vivo models of C9ORF72 and TDP-43-related ALS supporting a central role in pathogenesis for endoplasmic reticulum stress, which activates an unfolded protein response (UPR), and mitochondrial dysfunction. Disruption in the finely tuned signaling between the ER and mitochondria through calcium ions may be a crucial trigger of mitochondrial deficits and initiate an apoptotic signaling cascade, thus acting as a point of convergence for multiple upstream disturbances of cellular homeostasis and constituting a potentially important therapeutic target.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Much research effort is currently devoted to the development of a simple, low-cost method to determine early signs of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology. The present study employs a simple paradigm in which event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded to a single auditory stimulus that was presented rapidly or very slowly while the participant was engaged in a visual task. A multi-channel EEG was recorded in 20 healthy older adults and 20 people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). In two different conditions, a single 80 dB sound pressure level (SPL) auditory stimulus was presented every 1.5 s (fast condition) or every 12.0 s (slow condition). Participants were instructed to watch a silent video and ignore the auditory stimuli. Auditory processing thus occurred passively. When the auditory stimuli were presented rapidly (every 1.5 s), N1 and P2 amplitudes did not differ between the two groups. When the stimuli were presented very slowly, the amplitude of N1 and P2 increased in both groups and their latencies were prolonged. The amplitude of N1 did not significantly differ between the two groups. However, the subsequent positivity was reduced in people with MCI compared to healthy older adults. This late positivity in the slow condition may reflect a delayed P2 or a summation of a composite P2 + P3a. In people with MCI, the priority of processing may not be switched from the visual task to the potentially much more relevant auditory input. ERPs offer promise as a means to identify the pathology underlying cognitive impairment associated with MCI.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an aging-dependent, irreversible neurodegenerative disorder and the most common cause of dementia. The prevailing AD hypothesis points to the central role of altered cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and formation of toxic amyloid-β (Aβ) deposits in the brain. The lack of efficient AD treatments stems from incomplete knowledge on AD causes and environmental risk factors. The role of lifestyle factors, including diet, in neurological diseases is now beginning to attract considerable attention. One of them is western diet (WD), which can lead to many serious diseases that develop with age. The aim of the study was to investigate whether WD-derived systemic disturbances may accelerate the brain neuroinflammation and amyloidogenesis at the early stages of AD development. To verify this hypothesis, transgenic mice expressing human APP with AD-causing mutations (APPswe) were fed with WD from the 3rd month of age. These mice were compared to APPswe mice, in which short-term high-grade inflammation was induced by injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and to untreated APPswe mice. All experimental subgroups of animals were subsequently analyzed at 4-, 8-, and 12-months of age. APPswe mice at 4- and 8-months-old represent earlier pre-plaque stages of AD, while 12-month-old animals represent later stages of AD, with visible amyloid pathology. Already short time of WD feeding induced in 4-month-old animals such brain neuroinflammation events as enhanced astrogliosis, to a level comparable to that induced by the administration of pro-inflammatory LPS, and microglia activation in 8-month-old mice. Also, WD feeding accelerated increased Aβ production, observed already in 8-month-old animals. These brain changes corresponded to diet-induced metabolic disorders, including increased cholesterol level in 4-months of age, and advanced hypercholesterolemia and fatty liver disease in 8-month-old mice. These results indicate that the westernized pattern of nourishment is an important modifiable risk factor of AD development, and that a healthy, balanced, diet may be one of the most efficient AD prevention methods.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Recent evidence suggests increased metabolic and physiologic aging rates in premature-born adults. While the lasting consequences of premature birth on human brain development are known, its impact on brain aging remains unclear. We addressed the question of whether premature birth impacts brain age gap estimates (BrainAGE) using an accurate and robust machine-learning framework based on structural MRI in a large cohort of young premature-born adults (n = 101) and full-term (FT) controls (n = 111). Study participants are part of a geographically defined population study of premature-born individuals, which have been followed longitudinally from birth until young adulthood. We investigated the association between BrainAGE scores and perinatal variables as well as with outcomes of physical (total intracranial volume, TIV) and cognitive development (full-scale IQ, FS-IQ). We found increased BrainAGE in premature-born adults [median (interquartile range) = 1.4 (−1.3–4.7 years)] compared to full-term controls (p = 0.002, Cohen’s d = 0.443), which was associated with low Gestational age (GA), low birth weight (BW), and increased neonatal treatment intensity but not with TIV or FS-IQ. In conclusion, results demonstrate elevated BrainAGE in premature-born adults, suggesting an increased risk for accelerated brain aging in human prematurity.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

Our data suggest that AL engenders alterations in subcortical structures that likely involve processes of chronic stress and fear conditioning, and resemble those observed in general anxiety disorder, childhood maltreatment, and major depressive disorder.

Abstract
Affective loss (AL) (i.e., bereavement, relationship breakup) is a stressful life event leading to a heightened risk of developing a psychiatric disorder, for example, depression and anxiety disorder. These disorders have been associated with altered subcortical brain volumes. Little is known though, how AL in healthy subjects is linked to subcortical volumes. In a study with 196 healthy young adults, we probed the association between AL across the individual entire life span, assessed via the List of Threatening Experiences Questionnaire, and magnetic resonance imaging brain gray matter volumes (a priori selected: bilateral amygdalae, hippocampi, thalami; exploratory analyses: nuclei accumbens, caudate, putamina), segmented by use of volBrain. AL was defined as death of a first‐degree relative/spouse, close relative/friend, and breakup of a marriage or steady relationship. AL was associated with larger bilateral amygdalar volumes and, after taking into account the total number of ALs, with smaller right hippocampal volumes, both irrespective of sex. Exploratory analyses of striatal volumes yielded an association of AL with larger right nucleus accumbens volumes in men, and increased caudate volumes after the loss of a first‐degree relative irrespective of sex. Our data suggest that AL engenders alterations in limbic structures that likely involve processes of chronic stress and amygdala‐ and hippocampus‐dependent fear conditioning, and resemble those observed in general anxiety disorder, childhood maltreatment, and major depressive disorder. Our exploratory findings of striatal volume alterations hint at a modulation of reward processing by AL.</content>

 Abstract
Traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) are common with an estimated 27.1 million cases per year. Approximately 80% of TBIs are categorized as mild TBI (mTBI) based on initial symptom presentation. While in most individuals, symptoms resolve within days to weeks, in some, symptoms become chronic. Advanced neuroimaging has the potential to characterize brain morphometric, microstructural, biochemical, and metabolic abnormalities following mTBI. However, translational studies are needed for the interpretation of neuroimaging findings in humans with respect to the underlying pathophysiological processes, and, ultimately, for developing novel and more targeted treatment options. In this review, we introduce the most commonly used animal models for the study of mTBI. We then summarize the neuroimaging findings in humans and animals after mTBI and, wherever applicable, the translational aspects of studies available today. Finally, we highlight the importance of translational approaches and outline future perspectives in the field of translational neuroimaging in mTBI.</content>

Plasma glucose and insulin responses following an oral glucose challenge are representative of glucose tolerance and insulin resistance, key indicators of type 2 diabetes mellitus pathophysiology. A large heterogeneity in individuals’ challenge test responses has been shown to underlie the effectiveness of lifestyle intervention. Currently, this heterogeneity is overlooked due to a lack of methods to quantify the interconnected dynamics in the glucose and insulin time-courses. Here, a physiology-based mathematical model of the human glucose-insulin system is personalized to elucidate the heterogeneity in individuals’ responses using a large population of overweight/obese individuals (n = 738) from the DIOGenes study. The personalized models are derived from population level models through a systematic parameter selection pipeline that may be generalized to other biological systems. The resulting personalized models showed a 4-5 fold decrease in discrepancy between measurements and model simulation compared to population level. The estimated model parameters capture relevant features of individuals’ metabolic health such as gastric emptying, endogenous insulin secretion and insulin dependent glucose disposal into tissues, with the latter also showing a significant association with the Insulinogenic index and the Matsuda insulin sensitivity index, respectively.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Chldma1fi6Y&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Genome annotation conceptually consists of inferring and assigning biological information to gene products. Over the years, numerous pipelines and computational tools have been developed aiming to automate this task and assist researchers in gaining knowledge about target genes of study. However, even with these technological advances, manual annotation or manual curation is necessary, where the information attributed to the gene products is verified and enriched. Despite being called the gold standard process for depositing data in a biological database, the task of manual curation requires significant time and effort from researchers who sometimes have to parse through numerous products in various public databases. To assist with this problem, we present CODON, a tool for manual curation of genomic data, capable of performing the prediction and annotation process. This software makes use of a finite state machine in the prediction process and automatically annotates products based on information obtained from the Uniprot database. CODON is equipped with a simple and intuitive graphic interface that assists on manual curation, enabling the user to decide about the analysis based on information as to identity, length of the alignment, and name of the organism in which the product obtained a match. Further, visual analysis of all matches found in the database is possible, impacting significantly in the curation task considering that the user has at his disposal all the information available for a given product. An analysis performed on eleven organisms was used to test the efficiency of this tool by comparing the results of prediction and annotation through CODON to ones from the NCBI and RAST platforms.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/oHRVjyw2MRE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

The circadian clock exerts significance influence on the immune system and disruption of circadian rhythms has been linked to inflammatory pathologies. Shift workers often experience circadian misalignment as their irregular work schedules disrupt the natural light-dark cycle, which in turn can cause serious health problems associated with alterations in genetic expressions of clock genes. In particular, shift work is associated with impairment in immune function, and those alterations are sex-specific. The goal of this study is to better understand the mechanisms that explain the weakened immune system in shift workers. To achieve that goal, we have constructed a mathematical model of the mammalian pulmonary circadian clock coupled to an acute inflammation model in the male and female rats. Shift work was simulated by an 8h-phase advance of the circadian system with sex-specific modulation of clock genes. The model reproduces the clock gene expression in the lung and the immune response to various doses of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Under normal conditions, our model predicts that a host is more sensitive to LPS at circadian time (CT) CT12 versus CT0 due to a dynamic change of Interleukin 10 (IL-10), an anti-inflammatory cytokine. We identify REV-ERB as a key modulator of IL-10 activity throughout the circadian day. The model also predicts a reversal of the times of lowest and highest sensitivity to LPS, with males and females exhibiting an exaggerated response to LPS at CT0, which is countered by a blunted immune response at CT12. Overall, females produce fewer pro-inflammatory cytokines than males, but the extent of sequelae experienced by males and females varies across the circadian day. This model can serve as an essential component in an integrative model that will yield mechanistic understanding of how shift work-mediated circadian disruptions affect the inflammatory and other physiological responses.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/cfufBY_Sysg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Analysis of cancer mutagenic signatures provides information about the origin of mutations and can inform the use of clinical therapies, including immunotherapy. In particular, APOBEC3A (A3A) has emerged as a major driver of mutagenesis in cancer cells, and its expression results in DNA damage and susceptibility to treatment with inhibitors of the ATR and CHK1 checkpoint kinases. Here, we report the implementation of CRISPR/Cas-9 genetic screening to identify susceptibilities of multiple A3A-expressing lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) cell lines. We identify HMCES, a protein recently linked to the protection of abasic sites, as a central protein for the tolerance of A3A expression. HMCES depletion results in synthetic lethality with A3A expression preferentially in a TP53-mutant background. Analysis of previous screening data reveals a strong association between A3A mutational signatures and sensitivity to HMCES loss and indicates that HMCES is specialized in protecting against a narrow spectrum of DNA damaging agents in addition to A3A. We experimentally show that both HMCES disruption and A3A expression increase susceptibility of cancer cells to ionizing radiation (IR), oxidative stress, and ATR inhibition, strategies that are often applied in tumor therapies. Overall, our results suggest that HMCES is an attractive target for selective treatment of A3A-expressing tumors.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/i4RPokSHcKQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

The gut-neural axis plays a critical role in the control of several physiological processes, including the communication of signals from the microbiome to the nervous system, which affects learning, memory, and behavior. However, the pathways involved in gut-neural signaling of gut-governed behaviors remain unclear. We found that the intestinal distension caused by the bacterium &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; induces histone H4 Lys8 acetylation (H4K8ac) in the germline of &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt;, which is required for both a bacterial aversion behavior and its transmission to the next generation. We show that induction of H4K8ac in the germline is essential for bacterial aversion and that a 14-3-3 chaperone protein family member, PAR-5, is required for H4K8ac. Our findings highlight a role for H4K8ac in the germline not only in the intergenerational transmission of pathogen avoidance but also in the transmission of pathogenic cues that travel through the gut-neural axis to control the aversive behavior.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/0CNQdnAwvj8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Scientists routinely use images to display data. Readers often examine figures first; therefore, it is important that figures are accessible to a broad audience. Many resources discuss fraudulent image manipulation and technical specifications for image acquisition; however, data on the legibility and interpretability of images are scarce. We systematically examined these factors in non-blot images published in the top 15 journals in 3 fields; plant sciences, cell biology, and physiology (&lt;i&gt;n =&lt;/i&gt; 580 papers). Common problems included missing scale bars, misplaced or poorly marked insets, images or labels that were not accessible to colorblind readers, and insufficient explanations of colors, labels, annotations, or the species and tissue or object depicted in the image. Papers that met all good practice criteria examined for all image-based figures were uncommon (physiology 16%, cell biology 12%, plant sciences 2%). We present detailed descriptions and visual examples to help scientists avoid common pitfalls when publishing images. Our recommendations address image magnification, scale information, insets, annotation, and color and may encourage discussion about quality standards for bioimage publishing.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/LUYb_6P81As&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 Mechanosensory neurons in the human tongue and hard palate were identified using immunohistochemical methods. In fungiform taste papillae, Meissner‐like corpuscles were found within the lamina propria and putative mechanosensory neurons were identified that surround taste buds. In filiform non‐taste papillae, end bulbs of Krause were the predominant sensory ending. Novel sensory endings were also identified, including subepithelial neuronal densities and the endings of myelinated neurons that innervate epithelium. In that hard palate mucosa, Meissner’s corpuscles and glomerular endings were identified in the lamina propria and Merkel‐cell neurite complexes were identified in epithelia. This rich cadre of neuronal endings are poised to mediate mechanosensory control of feeding and speech.






Abstract
The oral somatosensory system relays essential information about mechanical stimuli to enable oral functions such as feeding and speech. The neurochemical and anatomical diversity of sensory neurons across oral cavity sites have not been systematically compared. To address this gap, we analyzed healthy human tongue and hard palate innervation. Biopsies were collected from 12 volunteers and underwent fluorescent immunohistochemistry (≥2 specimens per marker/structure). Afferents were analyzed for markers of neurons (βIII tubulin), myelinated afferents (neurofilament heavy, NFH), and Merkel cells and taste cells (keratin 20, K20). Hard‐palate innervation included Meissner’s corpuscles, glomerular endings, Merkel cell‐neurite complexes and free nerve endings. The organization of these somatosensory endings is reminiscent of fingertips, suggesting that the hard palate is equipped with a rich repertoire of sensory neurons for pressure sensing and spatial localization of mechanical inputs, which are essential for speech production and feeding. Likewise, the tongue is innervated by afferents that impart it with exquisite acuity and detection of moving stimuli that support flavor construction and speech. Filiform papillae contain end bulbs of Krause, as well as endings that have not been previously reported, including subepithelial neuronal densities, and NFH+ neurons innervating basal epithelium. Fungiform papillae had Meissner’s corpuscles and densities of NFH+ intraepithelial neurons surrounding taste buds. The differing compositions of sensory endings within filiform and fungiform papillae suggest that these structures have distinct roles in mechanosensation. Collectively, this study has identified previously undescribed neuronal endings in human oral tissues and provides an anatomical framework for understanding oral mechanosensory functions.

 Objective
Blood tests to monitor disease activity, attack severity, or treatment impact in neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) have not been developed. This study investigated the relationship between serum glial fibrillary acidic protein (sGFAP) concentration and NMOSD activity and assessed the impact of inebilizumab treatment.


Methods
N‐MOmentum was a prospective, multicenter, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, randomized clinical trial in adults with NMOSD. sGFAP levels were measured by single‐molecule arrays (SIMOA) in 1,260 serial and attack‐related samples from 215 N‐MOmentum participants (92% aquaporin 4‐immunoglobulin G‐seropositive) and in control samples (from healthy donors and patients with relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis).


Results
At baseline, 62 participants (29%) exhibited high sGFAP concentrations (≥170 pg/ml; ≥2 standard deviations above healthy donor mean concentration) and were more likely to experience an adjudicated attack than participants with lower baseline concentrations (hazard ratio [95% confidence interval], 3.09 [1.6–6.1], p = 0.001). Median (interquartile range [IQR]) concentrations increased within 1 week of an attack (baseline: 168.4, IQR = 128.9–449.7 pg/ml; attack: 2,160.1, IQR = 302.7–9,455.0 pg/ml, p = 0.0015) and correlated with attack severity (median fold change from baseline [FC], minor attacks: 1.06, IQR = 0.9–7.4; major attacks: 34.32, IQR = 8.7–107.5, p = 0.023). This attack‐related increase in sGFAP occurred primarily in placebo‐treated participants (FC: 20.2, IQR = 4.4–98.3, p = 0.001) and was not observed in inebilizumab‐treated participants (FC: 1.1, IQR = 0.8–24.6, p &amp;gt; 0.05). Five participants (28%) with elevated baseline sGFAP reported neurological symptoms leading to nonadjudicated attack assessments.


Interpretation
Serum GFAP may serve as a biomarker of NMOSD activity, attack risk, and treatment effects. ANN NEUROL 2021</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Projections from the lateral habenula (LHb) control ventral tegmental area (VTA) neuronal populations’ activity and both nuclei shape the pathological behaviors emerging during cocaine withdrawal. However, it is unknown whether cocaine withdrawal modulates LHb neurotransmission onto subsets of VTA neurons that are part of distinct neuronal circuits. Here we show that, in mice, cocaine withdrawal, drives discrete and opposing synaptic adaptations at LHb inputs onto VTA neurons defined by their output synaptic connectivity. LHb axons innervate the medial aspect of VTA, release glutamate and synapse on to dopamine and non-dopamine neuronal populations. VTA neurons receiving LHb inputs project their axons to medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), nucleus accumbens (NAc), and lateral hypothalamus (LH). While cocaine withdrawal increases glutamate release from LHb onto VTA-mPFC projectors, it reduces presynaptic release onto VTA-NAc projectors, leaving LHb synapses onto VTA-to-LH unaffected. Altogether, cocaine withdrawal promotes distinct adaptations at identified LHb-to-VTA circuits, which provide a framework for understanding the circuit basis of the negative states emerging during abstinence of drug intake.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The SOX proteins belong to the superfamily of transcription factors (TFs) that display properties of both classical TFs and architectural components of chromatin. Since the cloning of the Sox/SOX genes, remarkable progress has been made in illuminating their roles as key players in the regulation of multiple developmental and physiological processes. SOX TFs govern diverse cellular processes during development, such as maintaining the pluripotency of stem cells, cell proliferation, cell fate decisions/germ layer formation as well as terminal cell differentiation into tissues and organs. However, their roles are not limited to development since SOX proteins influence survival, regeneration, cell death and control homeostasis in adult tissues. This review summarized current knowledge of the roles of SOX proteins in control of central nervous system development. Some SOX TFs suspend neural progenitors in proliferative, stem-like state and prevent their differentiation. SOX proteins function as pioneer factors that occupy silenced target genes and keep them in a poised state for activation at subsequent stages of differentiation. At appropriate stage of development, SOX members that maintain stemness are down-regulated in cells that are competent to differentiate, while other SOX members take over their functions and govern the process of differentiation. Distinct SOX members determine down-stream processes of neuronal and glial differentiation. Thus, sequentially acting SOX TFs orchestrate neural lineage development defining neuronal and glial phenotypes. In line with their crucial roles in the nervous system development, deregulation of specific SOX proteins activities is associated with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). The overview of the current knowledge about the link between SOX gene variants and NDDs is presented. We outline the roles of SOX TFs in adult neurogenesis and brain homeostasis and discuss whether impaired adult neurogenesis, detected in neurodegenerative diseases, could be associated with deregulation of SOX proteins activities. We present the current data regarding the interaction between SOX proteins and signaling pathways and microRNAs that play roles in nervous system development. Finally, future research directions that will improve the knowledge about distinct and various roles of SOX TFs in health and diseases are presented and discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Surgical brain injury (SBI) triggers microglia to release numerous inflammatory factors, leading to brain edema and neurological dysfunction. Reducing neuroinflammation and protecting the blood-brain barrier (BBB) are key factors to improve the neurological function and prognosis after SBI. Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-Cl&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; cotransporter 1 (NKCC1) and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) have been implicated in the secretion of inflammatory cytokines by microglia in brain injury. This study aimed to establish the role of NKCC1 in inducing inflammation in SBI, as well as to determine whether NKCC1 controls the release of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) via phosphorylation of NF-κB in microglia, thus affecting BBB permeability and neuronal cell apoptosis. Male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were used to establish an SBI model. This study revealed that compared with the sham group, the expression levels of p-NKCC1, p-p65-NF-κB, and related inflammatory factor proteins in SBI model group significantly increased. After p-NKCC1 was inhibited, p-p65-NF-κB, IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α were downregulated, and nerve cell apoptosis and BBB permeability were significantly reduced. These findings suggest that the SBI-induced increase in p-NKCC1 exacerbates neuroinflammation, brain edema, and nerve function injury, which may be mediated by regulating the activity of p65-NF-κB that in turn influences the release of inflammatory factors.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Amyloid-beta (Aβ) 42/40 ratio, tau phosphorylated at threonine-181 (p-tau), and total-tau (t-tau) are considered core biomarkers for the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The use of fully automated biomarker assays has been shown to reduce the intra- and inter-laboratory variability, which is a critical factor when defining cut-off values. The calculation of cut-off values is often influenced by the composition of AD and control groups. Indeed, the clinically defined AD group may include patients affected by other forms of dementia, while the control group is often very heterogeneous due to the inclusion of subjects diagnosed with other neurological diseases (OND). In this context, unsupervised machine learning approaches may overcome these issues providing unbiased cut-off values and data-driven patient stratification according to the sole distribution of biomarkers. In this work, we took advantage of the reproducibility of automated determination of the CSF core AD biomarkers to compare two large cohorts of patients diagnosed with different neurological disorders and enrolled in two centers with established expertise in AD biomarkers. We applied an unsupervised Gaussian mixture model clustering algorithm and found that our large series of patients could be classified in six clusters according to their CSF biomarker profile, some presenting a typical AD-like profile and some a non-AD profile. By considering the frequencies of clinically defined OND and AD subjects in clusters, we subsequently computed cluster-based cut-off values for Aβ42/Aβ40, p-tau, and t-tau. This approach promises to be useful for large-scale biomarker studies aimed at providing efficient biochemical phenotyping of neurological diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;We aimed to determine the alterations in the subcortical structures of patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsy with tonic–clonic seizures (IGE-GTCS) via MRI volumetry and vertex-based shape analysis and to evaluate the relationships between MRI measures and drug responses. In a follow-up sample of 48 patients with IGE-GTCS and 48 matched normal controls (NCs), high-resolution 3D T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;WI was performed at baseline. After 1 year of follow-up, 31 patients were classified as seizure free (SF) and 17 as drug resistant (DR). The volumes of subcortical structures were extracted, and vertex-based shape analysis was performed using FSL-Integrated Registration and Segmentation Toolbox (FSL-FIRST). Comparisons among groups were calculated adjusting for covariates [age, sex, and intracranial volume (ICV)]. Analysis of the relationships among imaging biomarkers along with frequency and duration was assessed using partial correlations. The differential imaging indicators were used as features in a linear support vector machine (LSVM). The DR group displayed significant regional atrophy in the volume of the left amygdala compared with NCs (p = 0.004, false discovery rate corrected) and SF patients (p = 0.029, uncorrected). Meanwhile, vertex-based shape analysis showed focal inward deformation in the basolateral subregion of the left amygdala in DR compared with the results for SF and NC (p &amp;lt; 0.05, FWE corrected). There were significant correlations between the volume changes and seizure frequency (r = −0.324, p = 0.030) and between shape (r = −0.438, p = 0.003) changes and seizure frequency. Moreover, the volume of the left thalamus in the DR group was significantly correlated with seizure frequency (r = −0.689, p = 0.006). The SVM results revealed areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.82, 0.68, and 0.88 for the classification between SF and DR, between SF and NC, and between DR and NC, respectively. This study indicates the presence of focal atrophy in the basolateral region of the left amygdala in patients with IGE drug resistance; this finding may help predict drug responses and suggests a potential therapeutic target.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The physiological mechanisms of corticospinal excitability and factors influencing its measurement with transcranial magnetic stimulation are still poorly understood. A recent study reported an impact of functional connectivity (FC) between the primary motor cortex (M1) and the dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) on the resting motor threshold (RMT) of the dominant hemisphere. We aimed to replicate these findings in a larger sample of 38 healthy right-handed subjects with data from both hemispheres. Resting-state FC was assessed between the M1 and five a priori defined motor-relevant regions on each hemisphere as well as interhemispherically between both primary motor cortices. Following the procedure by the original authors, we included age, cortical gray matter volume, and coil-to-cortex distance (CCD) as further predictors in the analysis. We report replication models for the dominant hemisphere as well as an extension to data from both hemispheres and support the results with Bayes factors. FC between the M1 and the PMd did not explain the variability in the RMT, and we obtained moderate evidence for the absence of this effect. In contrast, CCD could be confirmed as an important predictor with strong evidence. These findings contradict the previously proposed effect, thus questioning the notion of the PMd playing a major role in modifying corticospinal excitability.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Introduction&lt;p&gt;Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has become a standard treatment option for select patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD). The selection process and surgical procedures employed have, to date, not been standardized.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;A comprehensive 58-question web-based survey was developed with a focus on DBS referral practices and peri-operative management. The survey was distributed to the Parkinson’s Foundation Centers of Excellence, members of the International Parkinson’s Disease and Movement Disorders Society, and the Parkinson Study Group (Functional Neurosurgery Working Group) between December 2015 and May 2016.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;There were 207 individual respondents (20% response rate) drawn from 59 countries and 6 continents, of whom 64% received formal training in DBS. Thirteen percent of centers reported that DBS could proceed despite a confidence level of &amp;lt; 50% for PD diagnosis. A case-based approach to DBS candidacy was applied in 51.3% of centers without a cut-off for levodopa-responsiveness. Surprisingly, 33% of centers regularly used imaging for diagnostic confirmation of idiopathic PD. Thirty-one percent of centers reported that neuropsychological evaluation did not affect DBS target selection. Approximately half of the respondents reported determination of DBS candidacy based on a multidisciplinary committee evaluation and 1/3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; reported that a committee was used for target selection. Eight percent of respondents felt that psychosocial factors should not impact DBS candidacy nor site selection. Involvement of allied health professionals in the preoperative process was sparse. There was high variability in preoperative education about DBS outcome expectations. Approximately half of the respondents did not utilize a “default brain target,” though STN was used more commonly than GPi. Specific DBS procedure techniques applied, as well as follow-up timelines, were highly variable.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Results revealed high variability on the best approaches for DBS candidate selection, brain target selection, procedure type, and postoperative practices. Cognitive and mood assessments were underutilized. There was low reliance on multidisciplinary teams or psychosocial factors to impact the decision-making process. There were small but significant differences in practice across global regions, especially regarding multidisciplinary teams. The wide variability of responses across multiple facets of DBS care highlights the need for prospective studies to inform evidence-based guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;This study investigates the procedural learning, retention, and reactivation of temporal sensorimotor sequences in children with and without developmental coordination disorder (DCD). Twenty typically-developing (TD) children and 12 children with DCD took part in this study. The children were required to tap on a keyboard, synchronizing with auditory or visual stimuli presented as an isochronous temporal sequence, and practice non-isochronous temporal sequences to memorize them. Immediate and delayed retention of the audio-motor and visuo-motor non-isochronous sequences were tested by removing auditory or visual stimuli immediately after practice and after a delay of 2 h. A reactivation test involved reintroducing the auditory and visual stimuli after the delayed recall. Data were computed via circular analyses to obtain asynchrony, the stability of synchronization and errors (i.e., the number of supplementary taps). Firstly, an overall deficit in synchronization with both auditory and visual isochronous stimuli was observed in DCD children compared to TD children. During practice, further improvements (decrease in asynchrony and increase in stability) were found for the audio-motor non-isochronous sequence compared to the visuo-motor non-isochronous sequence in both TD children and children with DCD. However, a drastic increase in errors occurred in children with DCD during immediate retention as soon as the auditory stimuli were removed. Reintroducing auditory stimuli decreased errors in the audio-motor sequence for children with DCD. Such changes were not seen for the visuo-motor non-isochronous sequence, which was equally learned, retained and reactivated in DCD and TD children. All these results suggest that TD children benefit from both auditory and visual stimuli to memorize the sequence, whereas children with DCD seem to present a deficit in integrating an audio-motor sequence in their memory. The immediate effect of reactivation suggests a specific dependency on auditory information in DCD. Contrary to the audio-motor sequence, the visuo-motor sequence was both learned and retained in children with DCD. This suggests that visual stimuli could be the best information for memorizing a temporal sequence in DCD. All these results are discussed in terms of a specific audio-motor coupling deficit in DCD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The optimal organization for functional segregation and integration in brain is made evident by the “small-world” feature of functional connectivity (FC) networks and is further supported by the loss of this feature that has been described in many types of brain disease. However, it remains unknown how such optimally organized FC networks arise from the brain's structural constrains. On the other hand, an emerging literature suggests that brain function may be supported by critical neural dynamics, which is believed to facilitate information processing in brain. Though previous investigations have shown that the critical dynamics plays an important role in understanding the relation between whole brain structural connectivity and functional connectivity, it is not clear if the critical dynamics could be responsible for the optimal FC network configuration in human brains. Here, we show that the long-range temporal correlations (LRTCs) in the resting state fMRI blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals are significantly correlated with the topological matrices of the FC brain network. Using structure-dynamics-function modeling approach that incorporates diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data and simple cellular automata dynamics, we showed that the critical dynamics could optimize the whole brain FC network organization by, e.g., maximizing the clustering coefficient while minimizing the characteristic path length. We also demonstrated with a more detailed excitation-inhibition neuronal network model that loss of local excitation-inhibition (E/I) balance causes failure of critical dynamics, therefore disrupting the optimal FC network organization. The results highlighted the crucial role of the critical dynamics in forming an optimal organization of FC networks in the brain and have potential application to the understanding and modeling of abnormal FC configurations in neuropsychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Microglia are the resident immune effector cells of the central nervous system (CNS) rapidly reacting to any perturbation in order to maintain CNS homeostasis. Although their outstanding reactive properties have been elucidated over the last decades, their heterogeneity in healthy tissue, such as across brain regions, as well as their diversity in the development and progression of brain diseases, are currently opening new avenues to understand the cellular and functional states of microglia subsets in a context-dependent manner. Here, we review the main breakthrough studies that helped in elucidating microglia heterogeneity in the healthy and diseased brain and might pave the way to critical functional screenings of the inferred cellular diversity. We suggest that unraveling the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying specific functionalities of microglial subpopulations, which may ultimately support or harm the neuronal network in neurodegenerative diseases, or may acquire pro- or anti-tumorigenic phenotypes in brain tumors, will possibly uncover new therapeutic avenues for to date non-curable neurological disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Traumatic brain injury (TBI), and related diseases such as chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and Alzheimer’s (AD), are of increasing concern in part due to enhanced awareness of their long-term neurological effects on memory and behavior. Repeated concussions, vs. single concussions, have been shown to result in worsened and sustained symptoms including impaired cognition and histopathology. To assess and compare the persistent effects of single or repeated concussive impacts on mediators of memory encoding such as synaptic transmission, plasticity, and cellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling, a closed-head controlled cortical impact (CCI) approach was used which closely replicates the mode of injury in clinical cases. Adult male rats received a sham procedure, a single impact, or three successive impacts at 48-hour intervals. After 30 days, hippocampal slices were prepared for electrophysiological recordings and 2-photon Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; imaging, or fixed and immunostained for pathogenic phospho-tau species. In both concussion groups, hippocampal circuits showed hyper-excitable synaptic responsivity upon Schaffer collateral stimulation compared to sham animals, indicating sustained defects in hippocampal circuitry. This was not accompanied by sustained LTP deficits, but resting Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; levels and voltage-gated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals were elevated in both concussion groups, while ryanodine receptor-evoked Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; responses decreased with repeat concussions. Furthermore, pathogenic phospho-tau staining was progressively elevated in both concussion groups, with spreading beyond the hemisphere of injury, consistent with CTE. Thus, single and repeated concussions lead to a persistent upregulation of excitatory hippocampal synapses, possibly through changes in postsynaptic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling/regulation, which may contribute to histopathology and detrimental long-term cognitive symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;We propose a novel biologically plausible computational model of working memory (WM) implemented by a spiking neuron network (SNN) interacting with a network of astrocytes. The SNN is modeled by synaptically coupled Izhikevich neurons with a non-specific architecture connection topology. Astrocytes generating calcium signals are connected by local gap junction diffusive couplings and interact with neurons via chemicals diffused in the extracellular space. Calcium elevations occur in response to the increased concentration of the neurotransmitter released by spiking neurons when a group of them fire coherently. In turn, gliotransmitters are released by activated astrocytes modulating the strength of the synaptic connections in the corresponding neuronal group. Input information is encoded as two-dimensional patterns of short applied current pulses stimulating neurons. The output is taken from frequencies of transient discharges of corresponding neurons. We show how a set of information patterns with quite significant overlapping areas can be uploaded into the neuron-astrocyte network and stored for several seconds. Information retrieval is organized by the application of a cue pattern representing one from the memory set distorted by noise. We found that successful retrieval with the level of the correlation between the recalled pattern and ideal pattern exceeding 90% is possible for the multi-item WM task. Having analyzed the dynamical mechanism of WM formation, we discovered that astrocytes operating at a time scale of a dozen of seconds can successfully store traces of neuronal activations corresponding to information patterns. In the retrieval stage, the astrocytic network selectively modulates synaptic connections in the SNN leading to successful recall. Information and dynamical characteristics of the proposed WM model agrees with classical concepts and other WM models.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Excitatory neurons and GABAergic interneurons constitute neural circuits and play important roles in information processing. In certain brain regions, such as the neocortex and the hippocampus, there are fewer interneurons than excitatory neurons. Interneurons have been quantified via immunohistochemistry, for example, for GAD67, an isoform of glutamic acid decarboxylase. Additionally, the expression level of other proteins varies among cell types. For example, NeuN, a commonly used marker protein for postmitotic neurons, is expressed differently across brain regions and cell classes. Thus, we asked whether GAD67-immunopositive neurons can be detected using the immunofluorescence signals of NeuN and the fluorescence signals of Nissl substances. To address this question, we stained neurons in layers 2/3 of the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) and the primary motor cortex (M1) of mice and manually labeled the neurons as either cell type using GAD67 immunosignals. We then sought to detect GAD67-positive neurons without GAD67 immunosignals using a custom-made deep learning-based algorithm. Using this deep learning-based model, we succeeded in the binary classification of the neurons using Nissl and NeuN signals without referring to the GAD67 signals. Furthermore, we confirmed that our deep learning-based method surpassed classic machine-learning methods in terms of binary classification performance. Combined with the visualization of the hidden layer of our deep learning algorithm, our model provides a new platform for identifying unbiased criteria for cell-type classification.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;To explore the evaluation of white matter structural network analysis in the differentiation of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and subcortical ischemic vascular dementia (SIVD), 67 participants [31 AD patients, 19 SIVD patients, and 19 normal control (NC)] were enrolled in this study. Each participant underwent 3.0T MRI scanning. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data were analyzed by graph theory (GRETNA toolbox). Statistical analyses of global parameters [gamma, sigma, lambda, global shortest path length (Lp), global efficiency (E&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;), and local efficiency (E&lt;sub&gt;loc&lt;/sub&gt;)] and nodal parameters [betweenness centrality (BC)] were obtained. Network-based statistical analysis (NBS) was employed to analyze the group differences of structural connections. The diagnosis efficiency of nodal BC in identifying different types of dementia was assessed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. There were no significant differences of gender and years of education among the groups. There were no significant differences of sigma and gamma in AD vs. NC and SIVD vs. NC, whereas the E&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; values of AD and SIVD were statistically decreased, and the lambda values were increased. The BC of the frontal cortex, left superior parietal gyrus, and left precuneus in AD patients were obviously reduced, while the BC of the prefrontal and subcortical regions were decreased in SIVD patients, compared with NC. SIVD patients had decreased structural connections in the frontal, prefrontal, and subcortical regions, while AD patients had decreased structural connections in the temporal and occipital regions and increased structural connections in the frontal and prefrontal regions. The highest area under curve (AUC) of BC was 0.946 in the right putamen for AD vs. SIVD. White matter structural network analysis may be a potential and promising method, and the topological changes of the network, especially the BC change in the right putamen, were valuable in differentiating AD and SIVD patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Background: Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) has been widely used to investigate structural alterations in amnesia mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). However, inconsistent results have hindered our understanding of the exact neuropathology related to aMCI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objectives: Our aim was to systematically review the literature reporting VBM on aMCI to elucidate consistent gray matter alterations, their functional characterization, and corresponding co-activation patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: The PubMed, Web of Science, and EMBASE databases were searched for VBM studies on aMCI published from inception up to June 2020. Peak coordinates were extracted from clusters that showed significant gray matter differences between aMCI patients and healthy controls (HC). Meta-analysis was performed using seed-based d mapping with the permutation of subject images (SDM-PSI), a newly improved meta-analytic method. Functional characterization and task-based co-activation patterns using the BrainMap database were performed on significant clusters to explore their functional roles. Finally, VBM was performed based on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset to further support the findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: A total of 31 studies with 681 aMCI patients and 837 HC were included in this systematic review. The aMCI group showed significant gray matter atrophy in the left amygdala and right hippocampus, which was consistent with results from the ADNI dataset. Functional characterization revealed that these regions were mainly associated with emotion, cognition, and perception. Further, meta-regression analysis demonstrated that gray matter atrophy in the left inferior frontal gyrus and the left angular gyrus was significantly associated with cognitive impairment in the aMCI group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: The findings of gray matter atrophy in the left amygdala and right hippocampus are highly consistent and robust, and not only offer a better understanding of the underlying neuropathology but also provide accurate potential biomarkers for aMCI.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26074?af=R"/>

 Objective
The link between brain function and cardiovascular dynamics is an important issue yet to be completely elucidated. The insula is a neocortical brain area that is thought to have a cardiac chronotropic regulatory function, but its role in cardiac contractility is unknown. We aim to analyze the heart rate and cardiac contractility variability after functional activation of different insular regions through direct electrical stimulation (E‐stim) in humans.


Methods
Observational, prospective study, including patients admitted for stereo‐electroencephalographic recording because of refractory epilepsy in whom the insular cortex was implanted. Patients with anatomical or electrophysiological insular abnormalities and those in whom E‐stim produced subjective symptoms were excluded. Variations in heart rate (HR), stroke volume (SV), and cardiac output (CO) were analyzed during insular E‐stim and compared with control E‐stim of non‐eloquent brain regions and sham stimulations.


Results
Ten patients were included, 5 implanted in the right insula (52 E‐stim) and 5 in the left (37 E‐stim). Demographic and clinical characteristics of both groups were similar. E‐stim of both insulas induced a significant decrease of the CO and HR, and an increase of the SV. E‐stim of control electrodes and sham stimulations were not associated with variations in cardiac function. Blood pressure and respiratory rate remained unaltered.


Interpretation.
Our results suggest a direct chronotropic and inotropic cardiac depressor function of the right and left insulas. The evidence of an insular direct cardiac regulatory function may open a path in the prevention or treatment of heart failure, arrhythmias, and SUDEP.

Combined analysis of multiple, large datasets is a common objective in the health- and biosciences. Existing methods tend to require researchers to physically bring data together in one place or follow an analysis plan and share results. Developed over the last 10 years, the DataSHIELD platform is a collection of R packages that reduce the challenges of these methods. These include ethico-legal constraints which limit researchers’ ability to physically bring data together and the analytical inflexibility associated with conventional approaches to sharing results. The key feature of DataSHIELD is that data from research studies stay on a server at each of the institutions that are responsible for the data. Each institution has control over who can access their data. The platform allows an analyst to pass commands to each server and the analyst receives results that do not disclose the individual-level data of any study participants. DataSHIELD uses Opal which is a data integration system used by epidemiological studies and developed by the OBiBa open source project in the domain of bioinformatics. However, until now the analysis of big data with DataSHIELD has been limited by the storage formats available in Opal and the analysis capabilities available in the DataSHIELD R packages. We present a new architecture (“&lt;i&gt;resources&lt;/i&gt;”) for DataSHIELD and Opal to allow large, complex datasets to be used at their original location, in their original format and with external computing facilities. We provide some real big data analysis examples in genomics and geospatial projects. For genomic data analyses, we also illustrate how to extend the resources concept to address specific big data infrastructures such as GA4GH or EGA, and make use of shell commands. Our new infrastructure will help researchers to perform data analyses in a privacy-protected way from existing data sharing initiatives or projects. To help researchers use this framework, we describe selected packages and present an online book (https://isglobal-brge.github.io/resource_bookdown).&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/FzMxYYtfM5E&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

The emerging tumor-on-chip (ToC) approaches allow to address biomedical questions out of reach with classical cell culture techniques: in biomimetic 3D hydrogels they partially reconstitute &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; the complexity of the tumor microenvironment and the cellular dynamics involving multiple cell types (cancer cells, immune cells, fibroblasts, &lt;i&gt;etc&lt;/i&gt;.). However, a clear bottleneck is the extraction and interpretation of the rich biological information contained, sometime hidden, in the cell co-culture videos. In this work, we develop and apply novel video analysis algorithms to automatically measure the cytotoxic effects on human cancer cells (lung and breast) induced either by doxorubicin chemotherapy drug or by autologous tumor-infiltrating cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). A live fluorescent dye (red) is used to selectively pre-stain the cancer cells before co-cultures and a live fluorescent reporter for caspase activity (green) is used to monitor apoptotic cell death. The here described open-source computational method, named STAMP (spatiotemporal apoptosis mapper), extracts the temporal kinetics and the spatial maps of cancer death, by localizing and tracking cancer cells in the red channel, and by counting the red to green transition signals, over 2–3 days. The robustness and versatility of the method is demonstrated by its application to different cell models and co-culture combinations. Noteworthy, this approach reveals the strong contribution of primary cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) to breast cancer chemo-resistance, proving to be a powerful strategy to investigate intercellular cross-talks and drug resistance mechanisms. Moreover, we defined a new parameter, the ‘potential of death induction’, which is computed in time and in space to quantify the impact of dying cells on neighbor cells. We found that, contrary to natural death, cancer death induced by chemotherapy or by CTL is transmissible, in that it promotes the death of nearby cancer cells, suggesting the release of diffusible factors which amplify the initial cytotoxic stimulus.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/k1J4aGyy87c&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Emerging epidemics are challenging to track. Only a subset of cases is recognized and reported, as seen with the Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic where large proportions of infection were asymptomatic. However, multiple imperfect indicators of infection provide an opportunity to estimate the underlying incidence of infection. We developed a modeling approach that integrates a generic Time-series Susceptible-Infected-Recovered epidemic model with assumptions about reporting biases in a Bayesian framework and applied it to the 2016 Zika epidemic in Puerto Rico using three indicators: suspected arboviral cases, suspected Zika-associated Guillain-Barré Syndrome cases, and blood bank data. Using this combination of surveillance data, we estimated the peak of the epidemic occurred during the week of August 15, 2016 (the 33&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; week of year), and 120 to 140 (50% credible interval [CrI], 95% CrI: 97 to 170) weekly infections per 10,000 population occurred at the peak. By the end of 2016, we estimated that approximately 890,000 (95% CrI: 660,000 to 1,100,000) individuals were infected in 2016 (26%, 95% CrI: 19% to 33%, of the population infected). Utilizing multiple indicators offers the opportunity for real-time and retrospective situational awareness to support epidemic preparedness and response.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/FD8Cea-eKX8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Microplastics (MPs), plastic particles &amp;lt;5 mm, are found in environments, including terrestrial ecosystems, planetwide. Most research so far has focused on ecotoxicology, examining effects on performance of soil biota in controlled settings. As research pivots to a more ecosystem and global change perspective, questions about soil-borne biogeochemical cycles become important. MPs can affect the carbon cycle in numerous ways, for example, by being carbon themselves and by influencing soil microbial processes, plant growth, or litter decomposition. Great uncertainty surrounds nano-sized plastic particles, an expected by-product of further fragmentation of MPs. A major concerted effort is required to understand the pervasive effects of MPs on the functioning of soils and terrestrial ecosystems; importantly, such research needs to capture the immense diversity of these particles in terms of chemistry, aging, size, and shape.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/KksWs4w7JbY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

The widespread use of plastic packaging for storing, transporting, and conveniently preparing or serving foodstuffs is significantly contributing to the global plastic pollution crisis. This has led to many efforts directed toward amending plastic packaging’s end of life, such as recycling, or alternative material approaches, like increasingly using paper for food packaging. But these approaches often neglect the critical issue of chemical migration: When contacting foodstuffs, chemicals that are present in packaging transfer into food and thus unwittingly become part of the human diet. Hazardous chemicals, such as endocrine disrupters, carcinogens, or substances that bioaccumulate, are collectively referred to as “chemicals of concern.” They can transfer from plastic packaging into food, together with other unknown or toxicologically uncharacterized chemicals. This chemical transfer is scientifically undisputed and makes plastic packaging a known, and avoidable, source of human exposure to synthetic, hazardous, and untested chemicals. Here, I discuss this issue and highlight aspects in need of improvement, namely the way that chemicals present in food packaging are assessed for toxicity. Further, I provide an outlook on how chemical contamination from food packaging could be addressed in the future. Robust innovations must attempt systemic change and tackle the issue of plastic pollution and chemical migration in a way that integrates all existing knowledge.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/jWaiXfzisa4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Public concern over the environmental and public health impacts of the emerging contaminant class “microplastics” has recently prompted government agencies to consider mitigation efforts. Microplastics do not easily fit within traditional risk-based regulatory frameworks because their persistence and extreme diversity (of size, shape, and chemical properties associated with sorbed chemicals) result in high levels of uncertainty in hazard and exposure estimates. Due to these serious complexities, addressing microplastics’ impacts requires open collaboration between scientists, regulators, and policymakers. Here we describe ongoing international mitigation efforts, with California as a case study, and draw lessons from a similarly diverse and environmentally persistent class of emerging contaminants (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) that is already disrupting traditional regulatory paradigms, discuss strategies to address challenges associated with developing health-protective regulations and policies related to microplastics, and suggest ways to maximize impacts of research.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/x9CpqB1G0yk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

We face an urgent need to overhaul and dismantle current evaluation practices that uphold inequities at multiple points along the academic pipeline. Graduate admissions and faculty advancement are two arenas of gatekeeping in which a reimagining and redistribution of weighting of commonly used evaluation metrics are warranted. We define and promote the use of dynamic, flexible holistic evaluation models that can be implemented by first recognizing and acknowledging the biases that contribute to racial and ethnic disparities in academia. Leaders of academic institutions must step up to drive adoption of these revised evaluation metrics.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/neuro/rss/current/~4/2dPgIAxNtjs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>
