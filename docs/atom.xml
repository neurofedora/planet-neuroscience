 &lt;p&gt;Simultaneous EEG-fMRI is a multi-modal neuroimaging technique that provides
complementary spatial and temporal resolution for inferring a latent source
space of neural activity. In this paper we address this inference problem
within the framework of transcoding -- mapping from a specific encoding
(modality) to a decoding (the latent source space) and then encoding the latent
source space to the other modality. Specifically, we develop a symmetric method
consisting of a cyclic convolutional transcoder that transcodes EEG to fMRI and
vice versa. Without any prior knowledge of either the hemodynamic response
function or lead field matrix, the method exploits the temporal and spatial
relationships between the modalities and latent source spaces to learn these
mappings. We show, for real EEG-fMRI data, how well the modalities can be
transcoded from one to another as well as the source spaces that are recovered,
all on unseen data. In addition to enabling a new way to symmetrically infer a
latent source space, the method can also be seen as low-cost computational
neuroimaging -- i.e. generating an 'expensive' fMRI BOLD image from 'low cost'
EEG data.

 &lt;p&gt;Similarity analysis is one of the crucial steps in most fMRI studies.
Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) can measure similarities of neural
signatures generated by different cognitive states. This paper develops Deep
Representational Similarity Learning (DRSL), a deep extension of RSA that is
appropriate for analyzing similarities between various cognitive tasks in fMRI
datasets with a large number of subjects, and high-dimensionality -- such as
whole-brain images. Unlike the previous methods, DRSL is not limited by a
linear transformation or a restricted fixed nonlinear kernel function -- such
as Gaussian kernel. DRSL utilizes a multi-layer neural network for mapping
neural responses to linear space, where this network can implement a customized
nonlinear transformation for each subject separately. Furthermore, utilizing a
gradient-based optimization in DRSL can significantly reduce runtime of
analysis on large datasets because it uses a batch of samples in each iteration
rather than all neural responses to find an optimal solution. Empirical studies
on multi-subject fMRI datasets with various tasks -- including visual stimuli,
decision making, flavor, and working memory -- confirm that the proposed method
achieves superior performance to other state-of-the-art RSA algorithms.

 &lt;p&gt;In order to gain a mechanistic understanding of how tinnitus emerges in the
brain, we must build biologically plausible computational models that mimic
both tinnitus development and perception, and test the tentative models with
brain and behavioral experiments. With a special focus on tinnitus research, we
review recent work at the intersection of artificial intelligence, psychology
and neuroscience, indicating a new research agenda that follows the idea that
experiments will yield theoretical insight only when employed to test
brain-computational models. This view challenges the popular belief, that
tinnitus research is primarily data limited, and that producing large,
multi-modal, and complex datasets, analyzed with advanced data analysis
algorithms, will finally lead to fundamental insights into how tinnitus
emerges. However, there is converging evidence that although modern
technologies allow assessing neural activity in unprecedentedly rich ways in
both, animals and humans, empirical testing one verbally defined hypothesis
about tinnitus after another, will never lead to a mechanistic understanding.
Instead, hypothesis testing needs to be complemented with the construction of
computational models that generate verifiable predictions. We argue, that even
though, contemporary artificial intelligence and machine learning approaches
largely lack biological plausibility, the models to be constructed will have to
draw on concepts from these fields, since they have already proven to do well
in modeling brain function. Nevertheless, biological fidelity will have to be
increased successively, leading to ever better and fine-grained models,
allowing at the end for even testing possible treatment strategies in silico,
before application in animal or patient studies.

 &lt;p&gt;Connectomics and network neuroscience offer quantitative scientific
frameworks for modeling and analyzing networks of structurally and functionally
interacting neurons, neuronal populations, and macroscopic brain areas. This
shift in perspective and emphasis on distributed brain function has provided
fundamental insight into the role played by the brain's network architecture in
cognition, disease, development, and aging. In this chapter, we review the core

 &lt;p&gt;This paper introduces a multi-level (m-lev) mechanism into Evolution
Strategies (ESs) in order to address a class of global optimization problems
that could benefit from fine discretization of their decision variables. Such
problems arise in engineering and scientific applications, which possess a
multi-resolution control nature, and thus may be formulated either by means of
low-resolution variants (providing coarser approximations with presumably lower
accuracy for the general problem) or by high-resolution controls. A particular
scientific application concerns practical Quantum Control (QC) problems, whose
targeted optimal controls may be discretized to increasingly higher resolution,
which in turn carries the potential to obtain better control yields. However,
state-of-the-art derivative-free optimization heuristics for high-resolution
formulations nominally call for an impractically large number of objective
function calls. Therefore, an effective algorithmic treatment for such problems
is needed. We introduce a framework with an automated scheme to facilitate
guided-search over increasingly finer levels of control resolution for the
optimization problem, whose on-the-fly learned parameters require careful
adaptation. We instantiate the proposed m-lev self-adaptive ES framework by two
specific strategies, namely the classical elitist single-child (1+1)-ES and the
non-elitist multi-child derandomized $(\mu_W,\lambda)$-sep-CMA-ES. We first
show that the approach is suitable by simulation-based optimization of QC
systems which were heretofore viewed as too complex to address. We also present
a laboratory proof-of-concept for the proposed approach on a basic experimental
QC system objective.

 &lt;p&gt;Hopfield neural networks are a possible basis for modelling associative
memory in living organisms. After summarising previous studies in the field, we
take a new look at learning rules, exhibiting them as descent-type algorithms

for learning. We discuss the role of biases (the external inputs) in the
learning process in Hopfield networks. Furthermore, we apply Newtons method for
learning memories, and experimentally compare the performances of various
learning rules. Finally, to add to the debate whether allowing connections of a
neuron to itself enhances memory capacity, we numerically investigate the

 &lt;p&gt;In model-based learning, an agent's model is commonly defined over
transitions between consecutive states of an environment even though planning
often requires reasoning over multi-step timescales, with intermediate states
either unnecessary, or worse, accumulating prediction error. In contrast,
intelligent behaviour in biological organisms is characterised by the ability
to plan over varying temporal scales depending on the context. Inspired by the
recent works on human time perception, we devise a novel approach to learning a
transition dynamics model, based on the sequences of episodic memories that
define the agent's subjective timescale - over which it learns world dynamics
and over which future planning is performed. We implement this in the framework
of active inference and demonstrate that the resulting subjective-timescale
model (STM) can systematically vary the temporal extent of its predictions
while preserving the same computational efficiency. Additionally, we show that
STM predictions are more likely to introduce future salient events (for example
new objects coming into view), incentivising exploration of new areas of the
environment. As a result, STM produces more informative action-conditioned
roll-outs that assist the agent in making better decisions. We validate
significant improvement in our STM agent's performance in the Animal-AI
environment against a baseline system, trained using the environment's
objective-timescale dynamics.

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Speech disorders such as stuttering disrupt the normal fluency of speech by
involuntary repetitions, prolongations and blocking of sounds and syllables. In
addition to these disruptions to speech fluency, most adults who stutter (AWS)
also experience numerous observable secondary behaviors before, during, and
after a stuttering moment, often involving the facial muscles. Recent studies
have explored automatic detection of stuttering using Artificial Intelligence
(AI) based algorithm from respiratory rate, audio, etc. during speech
utterance. However, most methods require controlled environments and/or
invasive wearable sensors, and are unable explain why a decision (fluent vs
stuttered) was made. We hypothesize that pre-speech facial activity in AWS,
which can be captured non-invasively, contains enough information to accurately
classify the upcoming utterance as either fluent or stuttered. Towards this
end, this paper proposes a novel explainable AI (XAI) assisted convolutional
neural network (CNN) classifier to predict near future stuttering by learning
temporal facial muscle movement patterns of AWS and explains the important
facial muscles and actions involved. Statistical analyses reveal significantly
high prevalence of cheek muscles (p&amp;lt;0.005) and lip muscles (p&amp;lt;0.005) to predict
stuttering and shows a behavior conducive of arousal and anticipation to speak.
The temporal study of these upper and lower facial muscles may facilitate early
detection of stuttering, promote automated assessment of stuttering and have
application in behavioral therapies by providing automatic non-invasive
feedback in realtime.

encode temporal information and use biologically plausible plasticity rules. In
this paper, a simpler and computationally efficient SNN model using FPGA

 &lt;p&gt;Deep learning has achieved impressive prediction accuracies in a variety of
scientific and industrial domains. However, the nested non-linear feature of
deep learning makes the learning highly non-transparent, i.e., it is still
unknown how the learning coordinates a huge number of parameters to achieve a
decision making. To explain this hierarchical credit assignment, we propose a
mean-field learning model by assuming that an ensemble of sub-networks, rather
than a single network, are trained for a classification task. Surprisingly, our
model reveals that apart from some deterministic synaptic weights connecting
two neurons at neighboring layers, there exist a large number of connections
that can be absent, and other connections can allow for a broad distribution of
their weight values. Therefore, synaptic connections can be classified into
three categories: very important ones, unimportant ones, and those of
variability that may partially encode nuisance factors. Therefore, our model
learns the credit assignment leading to the decision, and predicts an ensemble
of sub-networks that can accomplish the same task, thereby providing insights
toward understanding the macroscopic behavior of deep learning through the lens
of distinct roles of synaptic weights.

fixed structural topology: Path Processing Score (PPS) estimates how much the
brain signal has changed or has been transformed between any two brain regions
(source and target); Path Broadcasting Strength (PBS) estimates the propagation
of the signal through edges adjacent to the path being assessed. We use PPS and
PBS to explore communication dynamics in large-scale brain networks. We show
that brain communication dynamics can be divided into three main 'communication
regimes' of information transfer: absent communication (no communication
happening); relay communication (information is being transferred almost
intact); transducted communication (the information is being transformed). We
use PBS to categorize brain regions based on the way they broadcast
information. Subcortical regions are mainly direct broadcasters to multiple
receivers; Temporal and frontal nodes mainly operate as broadcast relay brain
stations; Visual and somato-motor cortices act as multi-channel transducted
broadcasters. This work paves the way towards the field of brain network
information theory by providing a principled methodology to explore
communication dynamics in large-scale brain networks.

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Over-parameterized deep neural networks trained by simple first-order methods
are known to be able to fit any labeling of data. Such over-fitting ability
hinders generalization when mislabeled training examples are present. On the
other hand, simple regularization methods like early-stopping can often achieve
highly nontrivial performance on clean test data in these scenarios, a
phenomenon not theoretically understood. This paper proposes and analyzes two
simple and intuitive regularization methods: (i) regularization by the distance
between the network parameters to initialization, and (ii) adding a trainable
auxiliary variable to the network output for each training example.
Theoretically, we prove that gradient descent training with either of these two
methods leads to a generalization guarantee on the clean data distribution
despite being trained using noisy labels. Our generalization analysis relies on
the connection between wide neural network and neural tangent kernel (NTK). The
generalization bound is independent of the network size, and is comparable to
the bound one can get when there is no label noise. Experimental results verify
the effectiveness of these methods on noisily labeled datasets.

		<link href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.02238"/>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Structural plasticity in the brain (i.e. rewiring the connectome) may be
viewed as mechanisms for dynamic reconfiguration of neural circuits. First
order computations in the brain are done by static neural circuits, whereas
higher order computations are done by dynamic reconfigurations of the links
(synapses) between the neural circuits. Static neural circuits correspond to
first order computable functions. Synapse creation (activation) between them
correspond to the mathematical notion of function composition. Functionals are
higher order functions that take functions as their arguments. The construction
of functionals is based on dynamic reconfigurations of function compositions.
Perhaps the functionals correspond to rewiring mechanisms of the connectome.
The architecture of human mind is different than the von Neumann computer
architecture. Higher order computations in the human brain (based on
functionals) may suggest a non-von Neumann computer architecture, a challenge
posed by John Backus in 1977 \cite{Backus}. The presented work is a substantial
extension and revision of the paper published in Proc. ICANN2016.

 &lt;p&gt;GABAA receptors are pentameric GABA-gated chloride channels. The existence of 19 different subunits (six α, three β, three γ, δ, ε, θ, π, and three ρ) in mammalian systems gives rise to an enormous theoretical diversity of GABAA receptor subtypes with distinct subunit composition and unique pharmacological properties. These receptors are already now the drug targets of several clinically used compounds, such as benzodiazepines, anesthetics, and many more. There is a constant quest to identify novel molecules and possible future drug targets: Currently, α6-containing GABAA receptors are being discussed in the context of treating sensorimotor gating deficits in neuropsychiatric disorders, such as tic disorders and schizophrenia. Therefore, we aim to learn more about α6-containing GABAA receptors. They are mostly expressed in the cerebellar granule cell layer, where they form the following subtypes: α6βxγ2, α1α6βxγ2, α6βxδ, and α1α6βxδ. In former studies, α1α6βxγ2-containing GABAA receptors were considered a single receptor population. In the current study, we investigate the possibility, that this population can consist of two subgroups with alternative arrangements depending if α1 neighbors γ2 (forming a “diazepam-sensitive” receptor), or if α6 neighbors γ2 (forming a “diazepam-insensitive” receptor) and aimed to prove the existence of both subtypes in native tissue. We performed immunoprecipitation experiments on rat cerebellar lysates using α1- or α6 subunit-specific antibodies followed by radioligand binding assays with either &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;H-flunitrazepam or &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;H-Ro 15-4513. Indeed, we were able to prove the existence of two distinct populations of α1α6-containing GABAA-receptors and could quantify the different receptor populations: α1βxγ2 receptors constitute approximately 60% of all γ2-containing receptors in the rat cerebellum, α6βxγ2 about 20%, and both isoforms of α1α6βxγ2 9–15% each. The simple classification of GABAA-receptors into αx-containing subtypes seems not to reflect the complexity of nature; those receptors are more diverse than previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Huntington’s disease (HD) is a fatal degenerative disorder affecting the nervous system. It is characterized by motor, cognitive, and psychiatric dysfunctions, with a late onset and an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. HD-causing mutation consists in an expansion of repeated CAG triplets in the huntingtin gene (HTT), encoding for an expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) stretch in the huntingtin protein (htt). The mutation causes neuronal dysfunction and loss through multiple mechanisms, affecting both the nucleus and cytoplasm. P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) emerged as a major player in neuroinflammation, since ATP – its endogenous ligand – is massively released under this condition. Indeed, P2X7R stimulation in the central nervous system (CNS) is known to enhance the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines from microglia and of neurotransmitters from neuronal presynaptic terminals, as well as to promote apoptosis. Previous experiments performed with neurons expressing the mutant huntingtin and exploiting HD mouse models demonstrated a role of P2X7R in HD. On the basis of those results, here, we explore for the first time the status of P2X7R in HD patients’ brain. We report that in HD postmortem striatum, as earlier observed in HD mice, the protein levels of the full-length form of P2X7R, also named P2X7R-A, are upregulated. In addition, the exclusively human naturally occurring variant lacking the C-terminus region, P2X7R-B, is upregulated as well. As we show here, this augmented protein levels can be explained by elevated mRNA levels. Furthermore, in HD patients’ striatum, P2X7R shows not only an augmented total transcript level but also an alteration of its splicing. Remarkably, P2X7R introns 10 and 11 are more retained in HD patients when compared with controls. Taken together, our data confirm that P2X7R is altered in brains of HD subjects and strengthen the notion that P2X7R may represent a potential therapeutic target for HD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Protein kinases and GTPases are the two major molecular switches that regulate much of biology, and both of these domains are embedded within the large multi-domain Leucine-Rich Repeat Kinase 2 (LRRK2). Mutations in LRRK2 are the most common cause of familial Parkinson’s disease (PD) and are also implicated in Crohn’s disease. The recent Cryo-Electron Microscopy (Cryo-EM) structure of the four C-terminal domains [ROC COR KIN WD40 (RCKW)] of LRRK2 includes both of the catalytic domains. Although the important allosteric N-terminal domains are missing in the Cryo-EM structure this structure allows us to not only explore the conserved features of the kinase domain, which is trapped in an inactive and open conformation but also to observe the direct allosteric cross-talk between the two domains. To define the unique features of the kinase domain and to better understand the dynamic switch mechanism that allows LRRK2 to toggle between its inactive and active conformations, we have compared the LRRK2 kinase domain to Src, BRaf, and PKA. We also compare and contrast the two canonical glycine-rich loop motifs in LRRK2 that anchor the nucleotide: the G-Loop in protein kinases that anchors ATP and the P-Loop in GTPases that anchors GTP. The RCKW structure also provides a template for the cross-talk between the kinase and GTPase domains and brings new mechanistic insights into the physiological function of LRRK2 and how the kinase domain, along with key phosphorylation sites, can serve as an allosteric hub for mediating conformational changes.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The locus coeruleus (LC) has long been underappreciated for its role in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), and other neurodegenerative disorders. While AD and PD are distinct in clinical presentation, both are characterized by prodromal protein aggregation in the LC, late-stage degeneration of the LC, and comorbid conditions indicative of LC dysfunction. Many of these early studies were limited to post-mortem histological techniques due to the LC’s small size and location deep in the brainstem. Thus, there is a growing interest in utilizing in vivo imaging of the LC as a predictor of preclinical neurodegenerative processes and biomarker of disease progression. Simultaneously, neuroimaging in animal models of neurodegenerative disease holds promise for identifying early alterations to LC circuits, but has thus far been underutilized. While still in its infancy, a handful of studies have reported effects of single gene mutations and pathology on LC function in disease using various neuroimaging techniques. Furthermore, combining imaging and optogenetics or chemogenetics allows for interrogation of network connectivity in response to changes in LC activity. The purpose of this article is twofold: (1) to review what magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) have revealed about LC dysfunction in neurodegenerative disease and its potential as a biomarker in humans, and (2) to explore how animal models can be used to test hypotheses derived from clinical data and establish a mechanistic framework to inform LC-focused therapeutic interventions to alleviate symptoms and impede disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The blood-brain barrier (BBB) plays an important role in both the physiological state and pharmacological state of the brain. Transiently enhancing the permeability of the BBB may allow the use of more types of medications for neuropsychiatric diseases. Our previous research revealed that electroacupuncture (EA) stimulation at certain parameters can enhance the permeability of the BBB in Sprague-Dawley rats, but this phenomenon is not well characterized. We propose that specific frequency EA can transiently open the BBB and may be related to the change of tight junctions (TJ). To find the best EA frequency among commonly used frequencies, preliminarily explore the mechanism, we detected BBB permeability by measuring the intensity of Evans Blue and 20 kDa FITC-dextran fluorescence in the cerebral cortex. Then, we used a laser spectrometer, immunofluorescence, western blotting, and transmission electron microscopy to detect the mechanism of BBB opening. Finally, measured brain water content, AQP4, GFAP, Iba1, and used the DeadEnd&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; Fluorometric TUNEL System to clear whether the stimulation caused obvious negative effects. The results show that EA stimulation at 2/100 Hz maximally increased BBB permeability, and the BBB closed within 12 h after EA stimulation was removed. EA stimulation increased blood perfusion, c-fos levels, and Substance P expression in the cerebral cortex, decreased ZO-1 and occludin levels and induced ultrastructural changes in TJ morphology. EA stimulation at specific parameters did not cause brain edema, activation of glial cells, or cell apoptosis. This study shows that EA stimulation induces a reversible, frequency-dependent alteration of BBB permeability and proposes a hypothetical mechanism of BBB opening related to vasodilation and TJ disruption. Transiently enhancing the permeability of the BBB with EA at specific parameters may be a new strategies for delivering therapeutics to the central nervous system. Further study of this technology is needed.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Alpha-Synuclein (α-Syn) is a central protein in the pathogenesis of synucleinopathies, a group of neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson’s disease (PD). Although its role in neurotransmission is well established, the precise role of this protein in disease pathogenesis is still not fully understood. It is, however, widely regarded to be associated with the misfolding and accumulation of toxic intracellular aggregates. In fact, α-Syn is the most abundant protein component of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, which are also characterized by a high lipid content. Lipids, the main constituents of cellular membranes, have been implicated in many aspects of PD-related processes. α-Syn interacts with membrane phospholipids and free fatty acids via its N-terminal domain, and altered lipid-protein complexes might enhance both its binding to synaptic and mitochondrial membranes and its oligomerization. Several studies have highlighted a specific interaction of α-Syn with the phospholipid cardiolipin (CL), a major constituent of mitochondrial membranes. By interacting with CL, α-Syn is able to disrupt mitochondrial membrane integrity, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction. Additionally, externalized CL is able to facilitate the refolding of toxic α-Syn species at the outer mitochondrial membrane. In this review, we discuss how α-Syn/lipid interactions, in particular the α-Syn/CL interaction at the mitochondrial membrane, may affect α-Syn aggregation and mitochondrial dysfunction and may thus represent an important mechanism in the pathogenesis of PD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The layer II of the adult piriform cortex (PCX) contains a numerous population of immature neurons. Interestingly, in both mice and rats, most, if not all, these cells have an embryonic origin. Moreover, recent studies from our laboratory have shown that they progressively mature into typical excitatory neurons of the PCX layer II. Therefore, the adult PCX is considered a “non-canonical” neurogenic niche. These immature neurons express the polysialylated form of the neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM), a molecule critical for different neurodevelopmental processes. Dopamine (DA) is a relevant neurotransmitter in the adult CNS, which also plays important roles in neural development and adult plasticity, including the regulation of PSA-NCAM expression. In order to evaluate the hypothetical effects of pharmacological modulation of dopaminergic neurotransmission on the differentiation of immature neurons of the adult PCX, we studied dopamine D2 receptor (D2r) expression in this region and the relationship between dopaminergic fibers and immature neurons (defined by PSA-NCAM expression). In addition, we analyzed the density of immature neurons after chronic treatments with an antagonist and an agonist of D2r: haloperidol and PPHT, respectively. Many dopaminergic fibers were observed in close apposition to PSA-NCAM-expressing neurons, which also coexpressed D2r. Chronic treatment with haloperidol significantly increased the number of PSA-NCAM immunoreactive cells, while PPHT treatment decreased it. These results indicate a prominent role of dopamine, through D2r and PSA-NCAM, on the regulation of the final steps of development of immature neurons in the adult PCX.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is one of the main forms of neonatal brain injury which could lead to neonatal disability or even cause neonatal death. Therefore, HIE strongly affects the health of newborns and brings heavy burden to the family and society. It has been well studied that N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors are involved in the excitotoxicity induced by hypoxia ischemia in adult brain. Recently, it has been shown that the NMDA receptor also plays important roles in HIE. In the present review, we made a summary of the molecular mechanism of NMDA receptor in the pathological process of HIE, focusing on the distinct role of GluN2A- and GluN2B-containing NMDA receptor subtypes and aiming to provide some insights into the clinical treatment and drug development of HIE.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness in industrialized countries among people over 60 years. It has multiple triggers and risk factors, but despite intense research efforts, its pathomechanisms are currently not completely understood. AMD pathogenesis is characterized by soft drusen in Bruch’s membrane and involves the retinal pigment epithelium–Bruch’s membrane-choroid complex and adjacent structures, like photoreceptors. This study explores the potential of novel cultivation techniques to preserve photoreceptors in retinal explants to gain better insights in AMD pathology. The porcine retina explants were cultured for 4 and 8 days using three different explantation techniques, namely, control (photoreceptors facing down, touching the filter), filter (photoreceptors facing up, turned sample using a filter), and tweezers (photoreceptors facing up, turned sample using tweezers). Optical coherence tomography revealed that the tweezers method had the best capacity to limit thinning of the retinal explants. Both novel methods displayed advantages in maintaining outer segment thickness. Additionally, immunofluorescence evaluation revealed a better preservation of opsin&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells and rhodopsin signal intensity in both novel methods, especially the tweezers method. Furthermore, RT-qPCR analysis demonstrated an upregulation of OPSIN and RHODOPSIN mRNA expression in tweezers samples at 8 days. Amacrine and bipolar cell numbers were not altered at day 4 of cultivation, while cultivation until 8 days led to reduced bipolar cell numbers. At 4 days, CALRETININ mRNA was upregulated in filter samples, but protein kinase C alpha expression was downregulated. Retinal ganglion cells were diminished in both novel techniques due to a direct physical contact with the insert. Remarkably, no difference in TUBB3 mRNA expression was detected among the techniques. Nevertheless, both novel methods exhibited an improved retention of photoreceptor cells. In conclusion, the tweezers technique was the most promising one. Due to the high homology of the porcine to the human retina, it provides a reasonable alternative to in vivo rodent models. Consequently, an adapted coculture system based on the current findings may serve as an ex vivo model suitable to analyze AMD pathomechanisms and novel therapeutic approaches.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Abnormalities in static neural activity have been widely reported in early onset schizophrenia (EOS). However, dynamic brain activity alterations over time in EOS are unclear. Here, we investigated whether temporal dynamic changes in spontaneous neural activity are influenced by EOS. A total of 78 drug-naïve first-episode patients with EOS and 90 healthy controls (HCs) were enrolled in this study. Dynamic amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (dALFF) was performed to examine the abnormal time-varying local neural activity in EOS. Furthermore, we investigated the relationships between abnormalities in dALFF variability and clinical characteristics in EOS patients. Compared to HCs, EOS patients showed significantly decreased dALFF variability in the bilateral precuneus, right superior marginal gyrus, right post-central gyrus and increased dALFF in the right middle temporal gyrus (MTG). Moreover, increased dALFF variability in MTG was negatively associated with negative symptoms in EOS. Our findings reveal increased dynamic local neural activity in higher order networks of the cortex, suggesting that enhanced spontaneous brain activity may be a predominant neural marker for brain maturation. In addition, decreased dALFF variability in the default mode network (DMN) and limbic system may reflect unusually dynamic neural activity. This dysfunctional brain activity could distinguish between patients and HCs and deepen our understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of EOS.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Interhemispheric interactions are important for arm coordination and hemispheric specialization. Unilateral voluntary static contraction is known to increase bilateral corticospinal motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitude. It is unknown how increasing and decreasing contraction affect the opposite limb. Since dynamic muscle contraction is more ecologically relevant to daily activities, we studied MEP recruitment using a novel method and short interval interhemispheric inhibition (IHI) from active to resting hemisphere at 4 phases of contralateral ECR contraction: Rest, Ramp Up [increasing at 25% of maximum voluntary contraction (MVC)], Execution (tonic at 50% MVC), and Ramp Down (relaxation at 25% MVC) in 42 healthy adults. We analyzed the linear portion of resting extensor carpi radialis (ECR) MEP recruitment by stimulating at multiple intensities and comparing slopes, expressed as mV per TMS stimulation level, via linear mixed modeling. In younger participants (age ≤ 30), resting ECR MEP recruitment slopes were significantly and equally larger both at Ramp Up (slope increase = 0.047, p &amp;lt; 0.001) and Ramp Down (slope increase = 0.031, p &amp;lt; 0.001) compared to rest, despite opposite directions of force change. In contrast, Active ECR MEP recruitment slopes were larger in Ramp Down than all other phases (Rest:0.184, p &amp;lt; 0.001; Ramp Up:0.128, p = 0.001; Execution: p = 0.003). Older (age ≥ 60) participants’ resting MEP recruitment slope was higher than younger participants across all phases. IHI did not reduce MEP recruitment slope equally in old compared to young. In conclusion, our data indicate that MEP recruitment slope in the resting limb is affected by the homologous active limb contraction force, irrespective of the direction of force change. The active arm MEP recruitment slope, in contrast, remains relatively unaffected. Older participants had steeper MEP recruitment slopes and less interhemispheric inhibition compared to younger participants.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 Background&lt;p&gt;The beneficial effects of acute exercise on executive function have been well-documented, but the influence of cardiorespiratory fitness on this effect requires further investigations, especially using imaging technique. This study aimed to examine the effects of cardiorespiratory fitness on acute exercise-induced changes on behavioral performance and on functional brain activation.&lt;/p&gt;Method&lt;p&gt;Based on their cardiorespiratory fitness level, 62 participants ranked in the top and bottom of the maximum oxygen consumption (VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; max) were finally selected and allocated to high-fit group or low-fit group. Both groups were asked to complete the Stroop task after 30 min of aerobic exercise and chair-seated rest (control session). Among them, 26 participants were randomly selected and asked to undergo the Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI).&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Behavioral results showed that individuals responded significantly faster after exercise than those in the control session. The fMRI results revealed a significant interaction effects of Group by Session in brain regions including anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and bilateral dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). For the ACC, activation in the high-fit group was significantly decreased after aerobic exercise compared to those in the control session; whereas an increased activation was noticed in the low-fit group. Regarding to the bilateral DLPFC, activation in high-fit group was significantly decreased after exercise compared to those in the control session, while no significant differences were found in the low-fit group. In addition, for the post-exercise session, a significant positive correlations between activation of the ACC and left DLPFC in the high-fit group was observed. There was a significant negative correlation between activation of the ACC and reaction time in the congruent condition after exercise in the low-fit group.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Findings further clarify the neurophysiological processes of acute exercise-induced changes in cognitive performance as they suggest that cardiorespiratory fitness is an important factor which influences changes in brain activation patterns in response to acute aerobic exercises.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Introduction: The ability to stop the execution of a movement in response to an external cue requires intact executive function. The effect of psychotropic drugs on movement inhibition is largely unknown. Movement stopping can be estimated by the Stop Signal Reaction Time (SSRT). In a recent publication, we validated an improved measure of SSRT (optimum combination SSRT, ocSSRT). Here we explored how diazepam, which enhances transmission at GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors, affects ocSSRT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Nine healthy individuals were randomized to receive placebo, 5 mg or 10 mg doses of diazepam. Each participant received both the dosage of drug and placebo orally on separate days with adequate washout. The ocSSRT and simple reaction time (RT) were estimated through a stop-signal task delivered via a battery-operated box incorporating green (Go) and red (Stop) light-emitting diodes. The task was performed just before and 1 h after dosing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Result: The mean change in ocSSRT after 10 mg diazepam was significantly higher (+27 ms) than for placebo (−1 ms; p = 0.012). By contrast, the mean change in simple response time remained comparable in all three dosing groups (p = 0.419).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Our results confirm that a single therapeutic adult dose of diazepam can alter motor inhibition in drug naïve healthy individuals. The selective effect of diazepam on ocSSRT but not simple RT suggests that GABAergic neurons may play a critical role in movement-stopping.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;We have previously shown invasive vagus nerve stimulation to improve attention and working memory and alter emotion-attention interaction in patients with refractory epilepsy, suggesting that VNS might be useful in the treatment of cognitive impairment. The current research focuses on whether non-invasive, transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS) has similar effects to VNS. Furthermore, we aimed to assess whether tVNS has an impact on cognitive control in general or on underlying brain physiology in a task that mimics everyday life demands where multiple executive functions are engaged while encountering intervening emotional stimuli. Event-related potentials (ERP) evoked in such a task, specifically centro-parietal P3 and frontal N2 were used as biomarkers for attention allocation and cognitive control required to carry out the task. A single-blinded, sham-controlled, within-subject study on healthy subjects (n = 25) was conducted using Executive Reaction Time Test (RT-test), a Go/NoGo task engaging multiple executive functions along with intervening threat-related distractors while EEG was recorded. tVNS at the left tragus and sham stimulation at the left ear lobe was alternately delivered throughout the task. To assess the impact of tVNS on neural activity underlying attention and cognitive control, centro-parietal P3 and frontal N2 peak amplitudes were measured in Go and NoGo conditions. Task performance was assessed with RTs and different error types reflecting cognitive control in general and distinct executive functions, such as working memory and response inhibition.No significant effects due to tVNS on performance in the Executive RT-test were observed. For N2 there was a main effect of stimulator status and a significant interaction of trial type (Go, NoGo) and stimulator status. Post hoc analysis revealed that tVNS resulted in a significant reduction of frontal N2 only in the NoGo condition. No significant effects were observed for P3 nor were there any effects of emotion. Diminished NoGo-N2 potential along with unaltered task performance during tVNS suggests fewer cognitive control resources were required to successfully withhold a prepotent response. Though caution is warranted, we suggest that tVNS may lead to more efficient neural processing with fewer resources needed for successful cognitive control, providing promise for its potential use in cognitive enhancement.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;This paper addresses how impairments in prediction in young adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) relate to their behavior during collaboration. To assess it, we developed a task where participants play in collaboration with a synthetic agent to maximize their score. The agent’s behavior changes during the different phases of the game, requiring participants to model the agent’s sensorimotor contingencies to play collaboratively. Our results (n = 30, 15 per group) show differences between autistic and neurotypical individuals in their behavioral adaptation to the other partner. Contrarily, there are no differences in the self-reports of that collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Introduction: The early and therapy-specific prediction of treatment success in major depressive disorder is of paramount importance due to high lifetime prevalence, and heterogeneity of response to standard medication and symptom expression. Hence, this study assessed the predictability of long-term antidepressant effects of escitalopram based on the short-term influence of citalopram on functional connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Twenty nine subjects suffering from major depression were scanned twice with resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging under the influence of intravenous citalopram and placebo in a randomized, double-blinded cross-over fashion. Symptom factors were identified for the Hamilton depression rating scale (HAM-D) and Beck's depression inventory (BDI) taken before and after a median of seven weeks of escitalopram therapy. Predictors were calculated from whole-brain functional connectivity, fed into robust regression models, and cross-validated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Significant predictive power could be demonstrated for one HAM-D factor describing insomnia and the total score (r = 0.45–0.55). Remission and response could furthermore be predicted with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.73 and 0.68, respectively. Functional regions with high influence on the predictor were located especially in the ventral attention, fronto-parietal, and default mode networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: It was shown that medication-specific antidepressant symptom improvements can be predicted using functional connectivity measured during acute pharmacological challenge as an easily assessable imaging marker. The regions with high influence have previously been related to major depression as well as the response to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, corroborating the advantages of the current approach of focusing on treatment-specific symptom improvements.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Endometriosis is a chronic and debilitating condition affecting ∼10% of women. Endometriosis is characterized by infertility and chronic pelvic pain, yet treatment options remain limited. In many respects this is related to an underlying lack of knowledge of the etiology and mechanisms contributing to endometriosis-induced pain. Whilst many studies focus on retrograde menstruation, and the formation and development of lesions in the pathogenesis of endometriosis, the mechanisms underlying the associated pain remain poorly described. Here we review the recent clinical and experimental evidence of the mechanisms contributing to chronic pain in endometriosis. This includes the roles of inflammation, neurogenic inflammation, neuroangiogenesis, peripheral sensitization and central sensitization. As endometriosis patients are also known to have co-morbidities such as irritable bowel syndrome and overactive bladder syndrome, we highlight how common nerve pathways innervating the colon, bladder and female reproductive tract can contribute to co-morbidity via cross-organ sensitization.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases are a group of inherited neurodegenerative disorders caused by the expansion of the cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeat. This mutation encodes extended glutamine (Q) tract in the disease protein, resulting in the alteration of its conformation/physiological role and in the formation of toxic fragments/aggregates of the protein. This group of heterogeneous disorders shares common molecular mechanisms, which opens the possibility to develop a pan therapeutic approach. Vast efforts have been made to develop strategies to alleviate disease symptoms. Nonetheless, there is still no therapy that can cure or effectively delay disease progression of any of these disorders. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) are promising tools for the treatment of polyQ disorders, promoting protection, tissue regeneration, and/or modulation of the immune system in animal models. Accordingly, data collected from clinical trials have so far demonstrated that transplantation of MSC is safe and delays the progression of some polyQ disorders for some time. However, to achieve sustained phenotypic amelioration in clinics, several treatments may be necessary. Therefore, efforts to develop new strategies to improve MSC’s therapeutic outcomes have been emerging. In this review article, we discuss the current treatments and strategies used to reduce polyQ symptoms and major pre-clinical and clinical achievements obtained with MSC transplantation as well as remaining flaws that need to be overcome. The requirement to cross the blood-brain-barrier (BBB), together with a short rate of cell engraftment in the lesioned area and low survival of MSC in a pathophysiological context upon transplantation may contribute to the transient therapeutic effects. We also review methods like pre-conditioning or genetic engineering of MSC that can be used to increase MSC survival in vivo, cellular-free approaches—i.e., MSC-conditioned medium (CM) or MSC-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) as a way of possibly replacing the use of MSC and methods required to standardize the potential of MSC/MSC-derived products. These are fundamental questions that need to be addressed to obtain maximum MSC performance in polyQ diseases and therefore increase clinical benefits.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Xenon has been shown to have neuroprotective effects and is clinically used as a favorable safe inhalation anesthetic. We previously confirmed the neuroprotective effects of xenon treatment in epileptic animals. However, the mechanism underlying these protective effects remains unclear. We aimed to assess the effects of xenon inhalation on autophagy in neuronal injury induced by acute generalized seizures. Kainic acid (KA) was injected into the lateral ventricle of male Sprague–Dawley rats to induce acute generalized seizures. Next, the rats were treated via inhalation of a 70% xenon/21% oxygen/9% nitrogen mixture for 60 min immediately after KA administration. The control group was treated via inhalation of a 79% nitrogen/21% oxygen mixture. Subsequently, two inhibitors (3-methyladenine or bafilomycin A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) or an autophagy inducer (rapamycin) were administered, respectively, before KA and xenon administration to determine the role of autophagy in the protective effects of xenon. The levels of apoptosis, neuronal injury, and autophagy were determined in all the rats. Xenon inhalation significantly attenuated the severity of the seizure-induced neuronal injury. Increased autophagy accompanied this inhibitive effect. Autophagy inhibition eliminated these xenon neuroprotective effects. A simulation of autophagy using rapamycin recapitulated xenon’s protective effects on KA-induced acute generalized seizures in the rats. These findings confirmed that xenon exerts strong neuroprotective effects in KA-induced acute generalized seizures. Further, they indicate that increased autophagy may underlie the protective effects of xenon. Therefore, xenon and autophagy inducers may be useful clinical options for their neuroprotective effects in epileptic seizures.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Due to their enormous surface area compared to other cell types, neurons face unique challenges in properly handling supply and retrieval of the plasma membrane (PM)—a process termed PM turnover—in their distal areas. Because of the length and extensiveness of dendritic branches in neurons, the transport of materials needed for PM turnover from soma to distal dendrites will be inefficient and quite burdensome for somatic organelles. To meet local demands, PM turnover in dendrites most likely requires local cellular machinery, such as dendritic endocytic and secretory systems, dysregulation of which may result in dendritic pathology observed in various neurodegenerative diseases (NDs). Supporting this notion, a growing body of literature provides evidence to suggest the pathogenic contribution of dysregulated PM turnover to dendritic pathology in certain NDs. In this article, we present our perspective view that impaired dendritic endocytic and secretory systems may contribute to dendritic pathology by encumbering PM turnover in NDs.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Evidence is mounting that the novel corona virus SARS-CoV2 inflicts neurological symptoms in a subgroup of COVID-19 patients. While plenty of theories on the route of neuroinvasion have been proposed, little histological evidence has been presented supporting any of these hypotheses. Therefore, we carried out immunostainings for ACE2 and TMPRSS2, two proteinases crucial for the entry of SARS-CoV2 into host cells, in the human enteric nervous system (ENS), as well as in the choroid plexus of the lateral ventricles. Both of these sites are important, yet often neglected entry gates to the nervous system. We found that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are expressed by enteric neurons and glial cells of the small and large intestine, as well as choroid plexus epithelial cells, indicating that these cells meet the molecular requirements for viral entry. Together, our results are fundamental histological evidence substantiating current theories of neuroinvasion by SARS-CoV2.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Knowledge about neuron morphology is key to understanding brain structure and function. There are a variety of software tools that are used to segment and trace the neuron morphology. However, these tools usually utilize proprietary formats. This causes interoperability problems since the information extracted with one tool cannot be used in other tools. This article aims to improve neuronal reconstruction workflows by facilitating the interoperability between two of the most commonly used software tools—Neurolucida (NL) and Imaris (Filament Tracer). The new functionality has been included in an existing tool—Neuronize—giving rise to its second version. Neuronize v2 makes it possible to automatically use the data extracted with Imaris Filament Tracer to generate a tracing with dendritic spine information that can be read directly by NL. It also includes some other new features, such as the ability to unify and/or correct inaccurately-formed meshes (i.e., dendritic spines) and to calculate new metrics. This tool greatly facilitates the process of neuronal reconstruction, bridging the gap between existing proprietary tools to optimize neuroscientific workflows.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;There is a growing number of aging populations that are more prone to the prevalence of neuropathological disorders. Two major diseases that show a late onset of the symptoms include Alzheimer’s disorder (AD) and Parkinson’s disorder (PD), which are causing an unexpected social and economic impact on the families. A large number of researches in the last decade have focused upon the role of amyloid precursor protein, Aβ-plaque, and intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles (tau-proteins). However, there is very few understanding of actin-associated paracrystalline structures formed in the hippocampus region of the brain and are called Hirano bodies. These actin-rich inclusion bodies are known to modulate the synaptic plasticity and employ conspicuous effects on long-term potentiation and paired-pulse paradigms. Since the currently known drugs have very little effect in controlling the progression of these diseases, there is a need to develop therapeutic agents, which can have improved efficacy and bioavailability, and can transport across the blood–brain barrier. Moreover, finding novel targets involving compound screening is both laborious and is an expensive process in itself followed by equally tedious Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval exercise. Finding alternative functions to the already existing FDA-approved molecules for reversing the progression of age-related proteinopathies is of utmost importance. In the current study, we decipher the role of a broad-spectrum general antibiotic (Ofloxacin) on actin polymerization dynamics using various biophysical techniques like right-angle light scattering, dynamic light scattering, circular dichroism spectrometry, isothermal titration calorimetry, scanning electron microscopy, etc. We have also performed in silico docking studies to deduce a plausible mechanism of the drug binding to the actin. We report that actin gets disrupted upon binding to Ofloxacin in a concentration-dependent manner. We have inferred that Ofloxacin, when attached to a drug delivery system, can act as a good candidate for the treatment of neuropathological diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Neurogranin (Ng) is a small protein usually expressed in granule-like structures in pyramidal cells of the hippocampus and cortex. However, its clinical value is not fully clear so far. Currently, Ng is proved to be involved in synaptic plasticity, synaptic regeneration, and long-term potentiation mediated by the calcium- and calmodulin-signaling pathways. Due to both the synaptic integrity and function as the growing concerns in the pathogenesis of a wide variety of neurological and mental diseases, a series of researches published focused on the associations between Ng and these kinds of diseases in the past decade. Therefore, in this review, we highlight several diseases, which include, but are not limited to, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson disease, Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, neuro-HIV, neurosyphilis, schizophrenia, depression, traumatic brain injury, and acute ischemic stroke, and summarize the associations between cerebrospinal fluid or blood-derived Ng with these diseases. We propose that Ng is a potential and promising biomarker to improve the diagnosis, prognosis, and severity evaluation of these diseases in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Aberrant accumulation of misfolded proteins into amyloid deposits is a hallmark in many age-related neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), Huntington’s disease (HD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Pathological inclusions and the associated toxicity appear to spread through the nervous system in a characteristic pattern during the disease. This has been attributed to a prion-like behavior of amyloid-type aggregates, which involves self-replication of the pathological conformation, intercellular transfer, and the subsequent seeding of native forms of the same protein in the neighboring cell. Molecular chaperones play a major role in maintaining cellular proteostasis by assisting the (re)-folding of cellular proteins to ensure their function or by promoting the degradation of terminally misfolded proteins to prevent damage. With increasing age, however, the capacity of this proteostasis network tends to decrease, which enables the manifestation of neurodegenerative diseases. Recently, there has been a plethora of studies investigating how and when chaperones interact with disease-related proteins, which have advanced our understanding of the role of chaperones in protein misfolding diseases. This review article focuses on the steps of prion-like propagation from initial misfolding and self-templated replication to intercellular spreading and discusses the influence that chaperones have on these various steps, highlighting both the positive and adverse consequences chaperone action can have. Understanding how chaperones alleviate and aggravate disease progression is vital for the development of therapeutic strategies to combat these debilitating diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Synapse loss occurs early in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients and animal models. Alterations at synaptic level are a major morphological correlate of the memory deficits and related symptoms of AD. Given the predominant roles of synaptic AMPA receptors (AMPARs) in excitatory synaptic transmission in the brain, changes in their dynamic regulation are also implicated in the pathophysiology of AD. Here, we used immunolocalization techniques to analyze the expression and subcellular distribution of AMPARs in the hippocampal region of APP/PS1 mouse model of AD. Immunoblots and histoblots revealed that the total amount of AMPARs and their regional expression pattern in the hippocampus was similar in APP/PS1 mice and in age-matched wild type mice. At the ultrastructural level, two synapse populations were examined using SDS-digested freeze-fracture replica labeling in the stratum radiatum in mice: (i) on spines of CA1 pyramidal cells; and (ii) on randomly found dendritic shafts of CA1 interneurons. While 1- and 6-months-old APP/PS1 mice exhibited no change, we observed a significant reduction at 12 months in AMPAR density at synapses in both pyramidal cells and interneurons, compared to wild-type. This reduction of AMPARs in dendritic spines was accompanied by a significant increase in AMPAR subunit proteins identified in intracellular compartments. Our data demonstrate an age-dependent reduction of synaptic AMPARs in APP/PS1 mice, which may contribute to impaired learning and memory at later stages of AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is commonly an age-associated dementia with neurodegeneration. The pathogenesis of AD is complex and still remains unclear. The inflammation, amyloid β (Aβ), and neurofibrillary tangles as well misfolded tau protein in the brain may contribute to the occurrence and development of AD. Compared with tau protein, Aβ is less toxic. So far, all efforts made in the treatments of AD with targeting these pathogenic factors were unsuccessful over the past decades. Recently, many studies demonstrated that changes of the intestinal environment and gut microbiota via gut–brain axis pathway can cause neurological disorders, such as AD, which may be involved in the pathogenesis of AD. Thus, remodeling the gut microbiota by various ways to maintain their balance might be a novel therapeutic strategy for AD. In the review article, we analyzed the characteristics of gut microbiota and its dysbiosis in AD and its animal models and investigated the possibility of targeting the gut microbiota in the treatment of the patients with AD in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Sex-specific synaptic connectivity is beginning to emerge as a remarkable, but little explored feature of animal brains. We describe here a novel mechanism that promotes sexually dimorphic neuronal function and synaptic connectivity in the nervous system of the nematode &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt;. We demonstrate that a phylogenetically conserved, but previously uncharacterized Doublesex/Mab-3 related transcription factor (DMRT), &lt;i&gt;dmd-4&lt;/i&gt;, is expressed in two classes of sex-shared phasmid neurons specifically in hermaphrodites but not in males. We find &lt;i&gt;dmd-4&lt;/i&gt; to promote hermaphrodite-specific synaptic connectivity and neuronal function of phasmid sensory neurons. Sex-specificity of DMD-4 function is conferred by a novel mode of posttranslational regulation that involves sex-specific protein stabilization through ubiquitin binding to a phylogenetically conserved but previously unstudied protein domain, the DMA domain.

 Neuroregeneration is a dynamic process synergizing the functional outcomes of multiple signaling circuits. Channelrhodopsin-based optogenetics shows the feasibility of stimulating neural repair but does not pin down specific signaling cascades. Here, we utilized optogenetic systems, optoRaf and optoAKT, to delineate the contribution of the ERK and AKT signaling pathways to neuroregeneration in live &lt;i&gt;Drosophila &lt;/i&gt;larvae. We showed that optoRaf or optoAKT activation not only enhanced axon regeneration in both regeneration-competent and -incompetent sensory neurons in the peripheral nervous system but also allowed temporal tuning and proper guidance of axon regrowth. Furthermore, optoRaf and optoAKT differ in their signaling kinetics during regeneration, showing a gated versus graded response, respectively. Importantly in the central nervous system, their activation promotes axon regrowth and functional recovery of the thermonociceptive behavior. We conclude that non-neuronal optogenetics target damaged neurons and signaling subcircuits, providing a novel strategy in the intervention of neural damage with improved precision.</content>

 HIV-1 specific CD8+ T cells are an important component of HIV-1 curative strategies. Viral variants in the HIV-1 reservoir may limit the capacity of T cells to detect and clear virus-infected cells. We investigated the patterns of T cell escape variants in the replication-competent reservoir of 25 persons living with HIV-1 (PLWH) durably suppressed on ART. We identified all reactive T cell epitopes in the HIV-1 proteome for each participant and sequenced HIV-1 outgrowth viruses from resting CD4+ T cells. All non-synonymous mutations in reactive T cell epitopes were tested for their effect on the size of the T cell response, with a ≥50% loss defined as an escape mutation. The majority (68%) of T cell epitopes harbored no detectable escape mutations. These findings suggest that circulating T cells in PLWH on ART could contribute to control of rebound and could be targeted for boosting in curative strategies.</content>

 For many animal species, vocal communication is a critical social behavior, often a necessary component of reproductive success. In addition to the role of vocal behavior in social interactions, vocalizations are often demanding motor acts. Through understanding the genes involved in regulating and permitting vertebrate vocalization, we can better understand the mechanisms regulating vocal and, more broadly, motor behaviors. Here, we use RNA-sequencing to investigate neural gene expression underlying the performance of an extreme vocal behavior, the courtship hum of the plainfin midshipman fish (Porichthys notatus). Single hums can last up to two hours and may be repeated throughout an evening of courtship activity. We asked whether vocal behavioral states are associated with specific gene expression signatures in key brain regions that regulate vocalization by comparing transcript levels in humming versus non-humming males. We find that the circadian-related genes period3 and Clock are significantly upregulated in the vocal motor nucleus and preoptic area-anterior hypothalamus, respectively, in humming compared to non-humming males, indicating that internal circadian clocks may differ between these divergent behavioral states. In addition, we identify suites of differentially expressed genes related to synaptic transmission, ion channels and transport, hormone signaling, and metabolism and antioxidant activity that may permit or support humming behavior. These results underscore the importance of the known circadian control of midshipman humming and provide testable candidate genes for future studies of the neuroendocrine and motor control of energetically demanding courtship behaviors in midshipman fish and other vertebrate groups.</content>

 Real-time fMRI guided neurofeedback training has gained increasing interest as a non-invasive brain regulation technique with the potential to normalize functional brain alterations in therapeutic contexts. Individual variations in learning success and treatment response have been observed, yet the neural substrates underlying the learning of self-regulation remain unclear. Against this background, we explored potential brain structural predictors for learning success with pooled data from three real-time fMRI datasets. Our analysis revealed that gray matter volume of the right putamen could predict neurofeedback learning success across the three datasets (n = 66 in total). Importantly, the original studies employed different neurofeedback paradigms during which different brain regions were trained pointing to a general association with learning success independent of specific aspects of the experimental design. Given the role of the putamen in associative learning the finding may reflect an important role of instrumental learning processes and brain structural variations in associated brain regions for successful acquisition of fMRI neurofeedback-guided self-regulation.</content>

 Human cognitive development is manifold, with different functions developing at different speeds at different ages. Attention is an important domain of this cognitive development, and involves distinct developmental trajectories in separate functions, including conflict processing, selection of sensory input and alertness. In children, several studies using the Attention Network Test (ANT) have investigated the development of three attentional networks that carry out the functions of executive control, orienting and alerting. There is, however, a lack of studies on the development of these attentional components across adolescence, limiting our understanding of their protracted development. To fill this knowledge gap, we performed a mixed cross-sectional and longitudinal study using mixed methods to examine the development of the attentional components and their intraindividual variability from late childhood to young adulthood (n = 287, n observations = 408, age range = 8.5-26.7 years, mean follow up interval = 4.4 years). The results indicated that executive control stabilized during late adolescence, while orienting and alerting continued to develop into young adulthood. In addition, a continuous development into young adulthood was observed for the intraindividual variability measures of orienting and alerting. In a subsample with available magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data (n =169, n observations = 281), higher alerting scores were associated with thicker cortices within a right prefrontal cortical region and greater age-related cortical thinning in left rolandic operculum, while higher orienting scores were associated with greater age-related cortical thinning in frontal and parietal regions. Finally, increased consistency of orienting performance was associated with thinner cortex in prefrontal regions and reduced age-related thinning in frontal regions.</content>

 In the present study we reevaluated the parcellation scheme of the macaque frontal agranular cortex by implementing quantitative cytoarchitectonic and multireceptor analyses, with the purpose to integrate and reconcile the discrepancies between previously published maps of this region. We applied an observer-independent and statistically testable approach to determine the position of cytoarchitectonic borders. Analysis of the regional and laminar distribution patterns of 13 different transmitter receptors confirmed the position of cytoarchitectonically identified borders. Receptor densities were extracted from each area and visualized as its &quot;receptor fingerprint&quot;. Hierarchical and principal components analyses were conducted to detect clusters of areas according to the degree of (dis)similarity of their fingerprints. Finally, functional connectivity pattern of each identified area was analyzed with areas of prefrontal, cingulate, somatosensory and lateral parietal cortex and the results were depicted as &quot;connectivity fingerprints&quot; and seed-to-vertex connectivity maps. We identified 16 cyto- and receptor architectonically distinct areas, including novel subdivisions of the primary motor area 4 (i.e. 4a, 4p, 4m) and of premotor areas F4 (i.e. F4s, F4d, F4v), F5 (i.e. F5s, F5d, F5v) and F7 (i.e. F7d, F7i, F7s). Multivariate analyses of receptor fingerprints revealed three clusters, which first segregated the subdivisions of area 4 with F4d and F4s from the remaining premotor areas, then separated ventrolateral from dorsolateral and medial premotor areas. The functional connectivity analysis revealed that medial and dorsolateral premotor and motor areas show stronger functional connectivity with areas involved in visual processing, whereas 4p and ventrolateral premotor areas presented a stronger functional connectivity with areas involved in somatomotor responses. For the first time, we provide a 3D atlas integrating cyto- and multi-receptor architectonic features of the macaque motor and premotor cortex. This atlas constitutes a valuable resource for the analysis of functional experiments carried out with non-human primates, for modeling approaches with realistic synaptic dynamics, as well as to provide insights into how brain functions have developed by changes in the underlying microstructure and encoding strategies during evolution.</content>

The role of alternative splicing is one of the great unanswered questions in cellular biology. There is strong evidence for alternative splicing at the transcript level, and transcriptomics experiments show that many splice events are tissue specific. It has been suggested that alternative splicing evolved in order to remodel tissue-specific protein-protein networks. Here we investigated the evidence for tissue-specific splicing among splice isoforms detected in a large-scale proteomics analysis. Although the data supporting alternative splicing is limited at the protein level, clear patterns emerged among the small numbers of alternative splice events that we could detect in the proteomics data. More than a third of these splice events were tissue-specific and most were ancient: over 95% of splice events that were tissue-specific in both proteomics and RNAseq analyses evolved prior to the ancestors of lobe-finned fish, at least 400 million years ago. By way of contrast, three in four alternative exons in the human gene set arose in the primate lineage, so our results cannot be extrapolated to the whole genome. Tissue-specific alternative protein forms in the proteomics analysis were particularly abundant in nervous and muscle tissues and their genes had roles related to the cytoskeleton and either the structure of muscle fibres or cell-cell connections. Our results suggest that this conserved tissue-specific alternative splicing may have played a role in the development of the vertebrate brain and heart.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/RaxpIoGOwSw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

We developed a computational platform including machine learning and a mechanistic mathematical model to find the optimal protocol for administration of platinum-doublet chemotherapy in a palliative setting. The platform has been applied to advanced metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The 42 NSCLC patients treated with palliative intent at Maria Sklodowska-Curie National Research Institute of Oncology, Gliwice Branch, were collected from a retrospective cohort of patients diagnosed in 2004–2014. Patients were followed-up, for three years. Clinical data collected include complete information about the clinical course of the patients including treatment schedule, response according to RECIST classification, and survival. The core of the platform is the mathematical model, in the form of a system of ordinary differential equations, describing dynamics of platinum-sensitive and platinum-resistant cancer cells and interactions reflecting competition for space and resources. The model is simulated stochastically by sampling the parameter values from a joint probability distribution function. The machine learning model is applied to calibrate the mathematical model and to fit it to the overall survival curve. The model simulations faithfully reproduce the clinical cohort at three levels long-term response (OS), the initial response (according to RECIST criteria), and the relationship between the number of chemotherapy cycles and time between two consecutive chemotherapy cycles. In addition, we investigated the relationship between initial and long-term response. We showed that those two variables do not correlate which means that we cannot predict patient survival solely based on the initial response. We also tested several chemotherapy schedules to find the best one for patients treated with palliative intent. We found that the optimal treatment schedule depends, among others, on the strength of competition among various subclones in a tumor. The computational platform developed allows optimizing chemotherapy protocols, within admissible limits of toxicity, for palliative treatment of metastatic NSCLC. The simplicity of the method allows its application to chemotherapy optimization in different cancers.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/cJ577BZUvzM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Protein binding to small molecules is fundamental to many biological processes, yet it remains challenging to predictively design this functionality &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt;. Current state-of-the-art computational design methods typically rely on existing small molecule binding sites or protein scaffolds with existing shape complementarity for a target ligand. Here we introduce new methods that utilize pools of discrete contacts between protein side chains and defined small molecule ligand substructures (ligand fragments) observed in the Protein Data Bank. We use the Rosetta Molecular Modeling Suite to recombine protein side chains in these contact pools to generate hundreds of thousands of energetically favorable binding sites for a target ligand. These composite binding sites are built into existing scaffold proteins matching the intended binding site geometry with high accuracy. In addition, we apply pools of side chain rotamers interacting with the target ligand to augment Rosetta’s conventional design machinery and improve key metrics known to be predictive of design success. We demonstrate that our method reliably builds diverse binding sites into different scaffold proteins for a variety of target molecules. Our generalizable &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; ligand binding site design method provides a foundation for versatile design of protein to interface previously unattainable molecules for applications in medical diagnostics and synthetic biology.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/tLCJEdsBOQ8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Biological excitable media, such as cardiac or neural cells and tissue, exhibit memory in which a change in the present excitation may affect the behaviors in the next excitation. For example, a change in calcium (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) concentration in a cell in the present excitation may affect the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; dynamics in the next excitation via bi-directional coupling between voltage and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, forming a delayed feedback loop. Since the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; dynamics inside the excitable cells are spatiotemporal while the membrane voltage is a global signal, the feedback loop is then a delayed global feedback (DGF) loop. In this study, we investigate the roles of DGF in the genesis and stability of spatiotemporal excitation patterns in periodically-paced excitable media using mathematical models with different levels of complexity: a model composed of coupled FitzHugh-Nagumo units, a 3-dimensional physiologically-detailed ventricular myocyte model, and a coupled map lattice model. We investigate the dynamics of excitation patterns that are temporal period-2 (P2) and spatially concordant or discordant, such as subcellular concordant or discordant Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;alternans in cardiac myocytes or spatially concordant or discordant Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and repolarization alternans in cardiac tissue. Our modeling approach allows both computer simulations and rigorous analytical treatments, which lead to the following results and conclusions. When DGF is absent, concordant and discordant P2 patterns occur depending on initial conditions with the discordant P2 patterns being spatially random. When the DGF is negative, only concordant P2 patterns exist. When the DGF is positive, both concordant and discordant P2 patterns can occur. The discordant P2 patterns are still spatially random, but they satisfy that the global signal exhibits a temporal period-1 behavior. The theoretical analyses of the coupled map lattice model reveal the underlying instabilities and bifurcations caused by the DGF for the genesis, selection, and stability of spatiotemporal excitation patterns.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/cM8FtjAYdZk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Prevalence of impetigo (skin sores) remains high in remote Australian Aboriginal communities, Fiji, and other areas of socio-economic disadvantage. Skin sore infections, driven primarily in these settings by Group A &lt;i&gt;Streptococcus&lt;/i&gt; (GAS) contribute substantially to the disease burden in these areas. Despite this, estimates for the force of infection, infectious period and basic reproductive ratio—all necessary for the construction of dynamic transmission models—have not been obtained. By utilising three datasets each containing longitudinal infection information on individuals, we estimate each of these epidemiologically important parameters. With an eye to future study design, we also quantify the optimal sampling intervals for obtaining information about these parameters. We verify the estimation method through a simulation estimation study, and test each dataset to ensure suitability to the estimation method. We find that the force of infection differs by population prevalence, and the infectious period is estimated to be between 12 and 20 days. We also find that optimal sampling interval depends on setting, with an optimal sampling interval between 9 and 11 days in a high prevalence setting, and 21 and 27 days for a lower prevalence setting. These estimates unlock future model-based investigations on the transmission dynamics of skin sores.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/TWADoKP271A&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Cooperative DNA binding is a key feature of transcriptional regulation. Here we examined the role of cooperativity in Notch signaling by CRISPR-mediated engineering of mice in which neither Notch1 nor Notch2 can homo- or heterodimerize, essential for cooperative binding to sequence-paired sites (SPS) located near many Notch-regulated genes. Although most known Notch-dependent phenotypes were unaffected in Notch1/2 dimer–deficient mice, a subset of tissues proved highly sensitive to loss of cooperativity. These phenotypes include heart development, compromised viability in combination with low gene dose, and the gut, developing ulcerative colitis in response to 1% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS). The most striking phenotypes—gender imbalance and splenic marginal zone B-cell lymphoma—emerged in combination with gene dose reduction or when challenged by chronic fur mite infestation. This study highlights the role of the environment in malignancy and colitis and is consistent with Notch-dependent anti-parasite immune responses being compromised in Notch dimer–deficient animals.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/OhWkoT8JGR4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Amyloid-β (Aβ) accumulation in the brain is a hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology. However, the molecular mechanism controlling microglial Aβ phagocytosis is poorly understood. Here we found that the E3 ubiquitin ligase Pellino 1 (Peli1) is induced in the microglia of AD-like five familial AD (5×FAD) mice, whose phagocytic efficiency for Aβ was then impaired, and therefore &lt;i&gt;Peli1&lt;/i&gt; depletion suppressed the Aβ deposition in the brains of 5×FAD mice. Mechanistic characterizations indicated that Peli1 directly targeted CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP)β, a major transcription factor responsible for the transcription of scavenger receptor CD36. Peli1 functioned as a direct E3 ubiquitin ligase of C/EBPβ and mediated its ubiquitination-induced degradation. Consequently, loss of Peli1 increased the protein levels of C/EBPβ and the expression of CD36 and thus, promoted the phagocytic ability in microglial cells. Together, our findings established Peli1 as a critical regulator of microglial phagocytosis and highlighted the therapeutic potential by targeting Peli1 for the treatment of microglia-mediated neurological diseases.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/FApN5VBcNuo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Antibiotics that inhibit multiple bacterial targets offer a promising therapeutic strategy against resistance evolution, but developing such antibiotics is challenging. Here we demonstrate that a rational design of balanced multitargeting antibiotics is feasible by using a medicinal chemistry workflow. The resultant lead compounds, ULD1 and ULD2, belonging to a novel chemical class, almost equipotently inhibit bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV complexes and interact with multiple evolutionary conserved amino acids in the ATP-binding pockets of their target proteins. ULD1 and ULD2 are excellently potent against a broad range of gram-positive bacteria. Notably, the efficacy of these compounds was tested against a broad panel of multidrug-resistant &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; clinical strains. Antibiotics with clinical relevance against staphylococcal infections fail to inhibit a significant fraction of these isolates, whereas both ULD1 and ULD2 inhibit all of them (minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC] ≤1 μg/mL). Resistance mutations against these compounds are rare, have limited impact on compound susceptibility, and substantially reduce bacterial growth. Based on their efficacy and lack of toxicity demonstrated in murine infection models, these compounds could translate into new therapies against multidrug-resistant bacterial infections.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/SHPpibAf0pQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

What enables the mental activities of thinking verbally or humming in our mind? We hypothesized that the interaction between motor and sensory systems induces speech and melodic mental representations, and this motor-to-sensory transformation forms the neural basis that enables our verbal thinking and covert singing. Analogous with the neural entrainment to auditory stimuli, participants imagined singing lyrics of well-known songs rhythmically while their neural electromagnetic signals were recorded using magnetoencephalography (MEG). We found that when participants imagined singing the same song in similar durations across trials, the delta frequency band (1–3 Hz, similar to the rhythm of the songs) showed more consistent phase coherence across trials. This neural phase tracking of imagined singing was observed in a frontal-parietal-temporal network: the proposed motor-to-sensory transformation pathway, including the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), insula (INS), premotor area, intra-parietal sulcus (IPS), temporal-parietal junction (TPJ), primary auditory cortex (Heschl’s gyrus [HG]), and superior temporal gyrus (STG) and sulcus (STS). These results suggest that neural responses can entrain the rhythm of mental activity. Moreover, the theta-band (4–8 Hz) phase coherence was localized in the auditory cortices. The mu (9–12 Hz) and beta (17–20 Hz) bands were observed in the right-lateralized sensorimotor systems that were consistent with the singing context. The gamma band was broadly manifested in the observed network. The coherent and frequency-specific activations in the motor-to-sensory transformation network mediate the internal construction of perceptual representations and form the foundation of neural computations for mental operations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/r81mYLnIko4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Growing evidence has suggested an association between sleep duration and Alzheimer's disease (AD), but it is unclear if sleep duration is a manifestation of the AD disease process. We studied whether genetic liability for AD predicts sleep duration using a genetic risk score (GRS) for AD (AD‐GRS), in 406,536 UK Biobank participants with European ancestry and without dementia at enrollment. Higher AD‐GRS score was associated with shorter sleep (b = −0.014, 95% confidence interval [CI] = −0.022 to −0.006), especially in those aged 55+. Using AD‐GRS as an instrumental variable for AD diagnosis, incipient AD reduced sleep duration by 1.87 hours (95% CI = 0.96, 2.78). Short sleep duration might be an early marker of AD.

 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To evaluate if the cognitive benefit of rivastigmine is affected by the presence of orthostatic hypotension (OH) in patients with Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We conducted a post‐hoc analysis on 1,047 PDD patients from two randomized controlled trials comparing rivastigmine vs. placebo at week 24 (n = 501) and rivastigmine patch vs. capsule at week 76 (n = 546). A drop ≥20 mm Hg in systolic or ≥ 10 in diastolic blood pressure upon standing classified subjects as OH+; otherwise, OH‐. The primary endpoint was the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale‐Cognitive subscale (ADAS‐Cog) at week 24 and the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (MDRS) at week 76, using intention‐to‐treat with retrieved dropout at week 24 and observed cases, at week 76, consistent with the original analyses.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall safety was comparable between OH+ (n = 288, 27.5%) and OH‐ (n = 730, 69.7%), except for higher frequency of syncope (9.2%) in the OH+ placebo arm. The placebo‐adjusted effect of rivastigmine on ADAS‐Cog at week 24 was 5.6 ± 1.2 for OH+ and 1.9 ± 0.9 in OH‐ (p = 0.0165). Among OH+ subjects, the MDRS change from baseline at week 76 was higher for rivastigmine capsules vs. patch (10.6 ± 2.9 vs. ‐1.5 ± 3.0) (p = 0.031). The overall prevalence of OH+ was lower for rivastigmine than placebo at week 24 (28.3% vs 44.6%) (p = 0.0476).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cognitive benefit from rivastigmine is larger in PDD patients with OH, possibly mediated by a direct antihypotensive effect.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;The diencephalon of two carnivore species: The feliform banded mongoose and the caniform domestic ferret&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/99601dc1-3990-4a39-a661-73851ccecb4b/cne25036-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low power photomicrographs of vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (left image of banded mongoose) and calretinin (right image of domestic ferret) immunostaining through the lateral geniculate nucleus showing the inverted and rotated organization of this nucleus in the domestic ferret, which contrasts with the more typically carnivoran organization of this nucleus in the banded mongoose. A and C—laminae A and C of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus; MIN—medial interlaminar nucleus, OT—optic tract, P—perigeniculate nucleus. Scale bars in each image = 1 mm.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study provides an analysis of the cytoarchitecture, myeloarchitecture, and chemoarchitecture of the diencephalon (dorsal thalamus, ventral thalamus, and epithalamus) of the banded mongoose (&lt;i&gt;Mungos mungo&lt;/i&gt;) and domestic ferret (&lt;i&gt;Mustela putorius furo&lt;/i&gt;). Using architectural and immunohistochemical stains, we observe that the nuclear organization of the diencephalon is very similar in the two species, and similar to that reported in other carnivores, such as the domestic cat and dog. The same complement of putatively homologous nuclei were identified in both species, with only one variance, that being the presence of the perireticular nucleus in the domestic ferret, that was not observed in the banded mongoose. The chemoarchitecture was also mostly consistent between species, although there were a number of minor variations across a range of nuclei in the density of structures expressing the calcium‐binding proteins parvalbumin, calbindin, and calretinin. Thus, despite almost 53 million years since these two species of carnivores shared a common ancestor, strong phylogenetic constraints appear to limit the potential for adaptive evolutionary plasticity within the carnivore order. Apart from the presence of the perireticular nucleus, the most notable difference between the species studied was the physical inversion of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus, as well as the lateral posterior and pulvinar nuclei in the domestic ferret compared to the banded mongoose and other carnivores, although this inversion appears to be a feature of the Mustelidae family. While no functional sequelae are suggested, this inversion is likely to result from the altricial birth of Mustelidae species.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Antennal‐lobe neurons in the moth Helicoverpa armigera: Morphological features of projection neurons, local interneurons, and centrifugal neurons&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/cb1fd67f-ab3f-4da7-a74d-c741b42e4f87/cne25034-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current study investigated morphological features of all three neuronal populations in the primary olfactory center of the moth, &lt;i&gt;Helicoverpa armigera&lt;/i&gt;, by means of intracellular iontophoretic staining combined with confocal microscopy. The detailed characterizations of individual antennal‐lobe neurons—covering projection neurons, local interneurons, and centrifugal neurons—include several novel categories not previously described. Amira reconstructions were used to visualize the distinct neuronal types and sub‐types. Confocal images of all 190 neurons demonstrate the impressive morphological variety, suggesting complex signal processing already at this level of the insect olfactory pathway.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relatively large primary olfactory center of the insect brain, the antennal lobe (AL), contains several heterogeneous neuronal types. These include projection neurons (PNs), providing olfactory information to higher‐order neuropils via parallel pathways, and local interneurons (LNs), which provide lateral processing within the AL. In addition, various types of centrifugal neurons (CNs) offer top‐down modulation onto the other AL neurons. By performing iontophoretic intracellular staining, we collected a large number of AL neurons in the moth, &lt;i&gt;Helicoverpa armigera&lt;/i&gt;, to examine the distinct morphological features of PNs, LNs, and CNs. We characterize 190 AL neurons. These were allocated to 25 distinct neuronal types or sub‐types, which were reconstructed and placed into a reference brain. In addition to six PN types comprising 15 sub‐types, three LN and seven CN types were identified. High‐resolution confocal images allowed us to analyze AL innervations of the various reported neurons, which demonstrated that all PNs innervating ventroposterior glomeruli contact a protocerebral neuropil rarely targeted by other PNs, that is the posteriorlateral protocerebrum. We also discuss the functional roles of the distinct CNs, which included several previously uncharacterized types, likely involved in computations spanning from multisensory processing to olfactory feedback signalization into the AL.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;The hippocampal formation of two carnivore species: the feliform banded mongoose and the caniform domestic ferret&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/dfb51c27-25a4-4237-b0c6-c1f919a88702/cne25047-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immunohistochemical staining for calbindin reveals a variety regions of the ventral hippocampus within the brain of the banded mongoose. These regions include the dentate gyrus (&lt;b&gt;DG&lt;/b&gt;), cornu Ammonis regions 3 (&lt;b&gt;CA3&lt;/b&gt;) and 1 (&lt;b&gt;CA1&lt;/b&gt;), the ventral subiculum (&lt;b&gt;VS&lt;/b&gt;), presubiculum (&lt;b&gt;PrS&lt;/b&gt;), and parasubiculum (&lt;b&gt;PaS&lt;/b&gt;). Scale bar = 1 mm.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employing cyto‐, myelo‐ and chemoarchitectural staining techniques, we analysed the structure of the hippocampal formation in the banded mongoose and domestic ferret, species belonging to the two carnivoran superfamilies, which have had independent evolutionary trajectories for the past 55 million years. Our observations indicate that, despite the time since sharing a last common ancestor, these species show extensive similarities. The four major portions of the hippocampal formation (cornu Ammonis, dentate gyrus, subicular complex and entorhinal cortex) were readily observed, contained the same internal subdivisions, and maintained the topological relationships of these subdivisions that could be considered typically mammalian. In addition, adult hippocampal neurogenesis was observed in both species, occurring at a rate similar to that observed in other mammals. Despite the overall similarities, several differences to each other, and to other mammalian species, were observed. We could not find evidence for the presence of the CA2 and CA4 fields of the cornu Ammonis region. In the banded mongoose the dentate gyrus appears to be comprised of up to seven lamina, through the sublamination of the molecular and granule cell layers, which is not observed in the domestic ferret. In addition, numerous subtle variations in chemoarchitecture between the two species were observed. These differences may contribute to an overall variation in the functionality of the hippocampal formation between the species, and in comparison to other mammalian species. These similarities and variations are important to understanding to what extent phylogenetic affinities and constraints affect potential adaptive evolutionary plasticity of the hippocampal formation.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cortical spreading depression (SD) is an intense depolarization underlying migraine aura. Despite the weight of evidence linking SD to the pain phase of migraine, controversy remains over a causal role of SD in cephalgia because of the invasive nature of previous SD induction methods. To overcome this problem, we employed a novel minimally invasive optogenetic SD induction method and examined the effect SD on behavior.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Optogenetic SD was induced as a single event or repeatedly every other day for 2 weeks. Endpoints including periorbital and hindpaw mechanical allodynia, mouse grimace, anxiety, and working memory were examined in male and female mice.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A single SD produced bilateral periorbital mechanical allodynia that developed within 1 hour and resolved within 2 days. Sumatriptan prevented periorbital allodynia when administered immediately after SD. Repeated SDs also produced bilateral periorbital allodynia that lasted 4 days and resolved within 2 weeks after the last SD. In contrast, the hindpaw withdrawal thresholds did not change after repeated SDs suggesting that SD‐induced allodynia was limited to the trigeminal region. Moreover, repeated SDs increased mouse grimace scores 2 days after the last SD, while single SD did not. Repeated SD also increased thigmotaxis scores as a measure of anxiety. In contrast, neither single nor repeated SDs affected visuospatial working memory. We did not detect sexual dimorphism in any endpoint.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Altogether, these data show a clinically congruent causal relationship between SD, trigeminal pain and anxiety behavior possibly reflecting SD modulation of hypothalamic, thalamic and limbic mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;NOTCH2NLC&lt;/i&gt; GGC repeat expansions were recently identified in neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID); however, it remains unclear whether they occur in other neurodegenerative disorders. This study aimed to investigate the role of intermediate‐length &lt;i&gt;NOTCH2NLC&lt;/i&gt; GGC repeat expansions in Parkinson's disease (PD). We screened for GGC repeat expansions in a cohort of 1011 PD patients and identified 11 patients with intermediate‐length repeat expansions ranging 41–52 repeats, with no repeat expansions in 1134 controls. Skin biopsy revealed phospho‐alpha synuclein deposition, confirming the PD diagnosis in two patients harboring intermediate‐length repeat expansions, who had previously been diagnosed with NIID or essential tremors. Fibroblasts from PD patients harboring intermediate‐length repeat expansions revealed &lt;i&gt;NOTCH2NLC&lt;/i&gt; upregulation and autophagic dysfunction. Our results suggest that intermediate‐length repeat expansions in &lt;i&gt;NOTCH2NLC&lt;/i&gt; are potentially associated with PD.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Predictive coding is an influential theory of cortical function which posits
that the principal computation the brain performs, which underlies both
perception and learning, is the minimization of prediction errors. While
motivated by high-level notions of variational inference, detailed
neurophysiological models of cortical microcircuits which can implements its
computations have been developed. Moreover, under certain conditions,
predictive coding has been shown to approximate the backpropagation of error
algorithm, and thus provides a relatively biologically plausible
credit-assignment mechanism for training deep networks. However, standard
implementations of the algorithm still involve potentially neurally implausible
features such as identical forward and backward weights, backward nonlinear
derivatives, and 1-1 error unit connectivity. In this paper, we show that these
features are not integral to the algorithm and can be removed either directly
or through learning additional sets of parameters with Hebbian update rules
without noticeable harm to learning performance. Our work thus relaxes current
constraints on potential microcircuit designs and hopefully opens up new
regions of the design-space for neuromorphic implementations of predictive
coding.

 &lt;p&gt;Modern machine learning models are typically highly accurate but have been
shown to be vulnerable to small, adversarially-chosen perturbations of the
input. There are two main models of attacks considered in the literature:
black-box and white-box. We consider these threat models as two ends of a
fine-grained spectrum, indexed by the number of queries the adversary can ask.
Using this point of view we investigate how many queries the adversary needs to
make to design an attack that is comparable to the best possible attack in the
white-box model. We analyze two classical learning algorithms on two synthetic
tasks for which we prove meaningful security guarantees. The obtained bounds
suggest that some learning algorithms are inherently more robust against
query-bounded adversaries than others.

 &lt;p&gt;Many Differential Evolution (DE) algorithms with various parameter control
methods (PCMs) have been proposed. However, previous studies usually considered
PCMs to be an integral component of a complex DE algorithm. Thus the
characteristics and performance of each method are poorly understood. We
present an in-depth review of 24 PCMs for the scale factor and crossover rate
in DE and a large scale benchmarking study. We carefully extract the 24 PCMs
from their original, complex algorithms and describe them according to a
systematic manner. Our review facilitates the understanding of similarities and
differences between existing, representative PCMs. The performance of DEs with
the 24 PCMs and 16 variation operators is investigated on 24 black-box
benchmark functions. Our benchmarking results reveal which methods exhibit high
performance when embedded in a standardized framework under 16 different
conditions, independent from their original, complex algorithms. We also
investigate how much room there is for further improvement of PCMs by comparing
the 24 methods with an oracle-based model, which can be considered to be a
conservative lower bound on the performance of an optimal method.

 &lt;p&gt;We consider how an (almost) optimal parameter adaptation process for an
adaptive DE might behave, and compare the behavior and performance of this
approximately optimal process to that of existing, adaptive mechanisms for DE.
An optimal parameter adaptation process is an useful notion for analyzing the
parameter adaptation methods in adaptive DE as well as other adaptive
evolutionary algorithms, but it cannot be known generally. Thus, we propose a
Greedy Approximate Oracle method (GAO) which approximates an optimal parameter
adaptation process. We compare the behavior of GAODE, a DE algorithm with GAO,
to typical adaptive DEs on six benchmark functions and the BBOB benchmarks, and
show that GAO can be used to (1) explore how much room for improvement there is
in the performance of the adaptive DEs, and (2) obtain hints for developing
future, effective parameter adaptation methods for adaptive DEs.

 &lt;p&gt;Multimodality is one of the biggest difficulties for optimization as local
optima are often preventing algorithms from making progress. This does not only
challenge local strategies that can get stuck. It also hinders meta-heuristics
like evolutionary algorithms in convergence to the global optimum. In this
paper we present a new concept of gradient descent, which is able to escape
local traps. It relies on multiobjectivization of the original problem and
applies the recently proposed and here slightly modified multi-objective local
search mechanism MOGSA. We use a sophisticated visualization technique for
multi-objective problems to prove the working principle of our idea. As such,
this work highlights the transfer of new insights from the multi-objective to
the single-objective domain and provides first visual evidence that
multiobjectivization can link single-objective local optima in multimodal
landscapes.

 &lt;p&gt;Circuits of biological neurons, such as in the functional parts of the brain
can be modeled as networks of coupled oscillators. Inspired by the ability of
these systems to express a rich set of outputs while keeping (gradients of)
state variables bounded, we propose a novel architecture for recurrent neural
networks. Our proposed RNN is based on a time-discretization of a system of
second-order ordinary differential equations, modeling networks of controlled
nonlinear oscillators. We prove precise bounds on the gradients of the hidden
states, leading to the mitigation of the exploding and vanishing gradient
problem for this RNN. Experiments show that the proposed RNN is comparable in
performance to the state of the art on a variety of benchmarks, demonstrating
the potential of this architecture to provide stable and accurate RNNs for
processing complex sequential data.

 &lt;p&gt;Identifying causal relationships is a challenging yet a crucial problem in
many fields of science like epidemiology, climatology, ecology, genomics,
economics and neuroscience, to mention only a few. Recent studies have
demonstrated that ordinal partition transition networks (OPTNs) allow to infer
the coupling direction between two dynamical systems. In this work, we
generalize this concept to the interaction between multiple dynamical systems
and propose a new method to detect causality in multivariate observational
data. We demonstrate that our approach can reliably identify the direction of
interaction and the corresponding delays with numerical simulations using
linear stochastic systems as well as nonlinear dynamical systems such as a
network of neural mass models. Finally, we apply our method to real-world
observational microelectrode array data from rodent brain slices to study the
causal effect networks underlying epileptic activity. Our results from
simulations as well as real-world data suggest that OPTNs can provide a
complementary approach to reliably infer causal effect networks from
multivariate observational data.

 &lt;p&gt;The significant role of dendritic processing within neuronal networks has
become increasingly clear. This letter explores the effects of including a
simple dendrite-inspired mechanism into neuroevolution. The phenomenon of
separate dendrite activation thresholds on connections is allowed to emerge
under an evolutionary process. It is shown how such processing can be
positively selected for, particularly for connections between the hidden and
output layer, and increases performance.

 &lt;p&gt;Evaluating solutions to optimization problems is arguably the most important
step for heuristic algorithms, as it is used to guide the algorithms towards
the optimal solution in the solution search space. Research has shown
evaluation functions to some optimization problems to be impractical to compute
and have thus found surrogate less expensive evaluation functions to those
problems. This study investigates the extent to which supervised learning
algorithms can be used to find approximations to evaluation functions for the
university course timetabling problem. Up to 97 percent of the time, the
traditional evaluation function agreed with the supervised learning regression
model on the result of comparison of the quality of pair of solutions to the
university course timetabling problem, suggesting that supervised learning
regression models can be suitable alternatives for optimization problems'
evaluation functions.

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;An unbounded external archive (UEA), which stores all nondominated solutions
found during the search process, is frequently used to evaluate the performance
of multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) in recent studies. A recent
benchmarking study also shows that decomposition-based MOEA (MOEA/D) is
competitive with state-of-the-art MOEAs when the UEA is incorporated into
MOEA/D. However, a parameter study of MOEA/D using the UEA has not yet been
performed. Thus, it is unclear how control parameter settings influence the
performance of MOEA/D with the UEA. In this paper, we present an analysis of
control parameters of MOEA/D under two performance evaluation scenarios. One is
a final population scenario where the performance assessment of MOEAs is
performed based on all nondominated solutions in the final population, and the
other is a reduced UEA scenario where it is based on a pre-specified number of
selected nondominated solutions from the UEA. Control parameters of MOEA/D
investigated in this paper include the population size, scalarizing functions,
and the penalty parameter of the penalty-based boundary intersection (PBI)
function. Experimental results indicate that suitable settings of the three
control parameters significantly depend on the choice of an optimization
scenario. We also analyze the reason why the best parameter setting is totally
different for each scenario.

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Loss-function metalearning can be used to discover novel, customized loss
functions for deep neural networks, resulting in improved performance, faster
training, and improved data utilization. A likely explanation is that such
functions discourage overfitting, leading to effective regularization. This
paper theoretically demonstrates that this is indeed the case: decomposition of
learning rules makes it possible to characterize the training dynamics and show
that loss functions evolved through TaylorGLO regularize both in the beginning
and end of learning, and maintain an invariant in between. The invariant can be
utilized to make the metalearning process more efficient in practice, and the
regularization can train networks that are robust against adversarial attacks.
Loss-function optimization can thus be seen as a well-founded new aspect of
metalearning in neural networks.

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;The psychosis spectrum is associated with structural dysconnectivity
concentrated in transmodal association cortex. However, understanding of this
pathophysiology has been limited by an exclusive focus on the direct
connections to a region. Using Network Control Theory, we measured variation in
both direct and indirect structural connections to a region to gain new
insights into the pathophysiology of the psychosis spectrum.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used psychosis symptom data and structural connectivity in 1,068 youths
aged 8 to 22 years from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort. Applying a
Network Control Theory metric called average controllability, we estimated each
brain region's capacity to leverage its direct and indirect structural
connections to control linear brain dynamics. Next, using non-linear
regression, we determined the accuracy with which average controllability could
predict negative and positive psychosis spectrum symptoms in out-of-sample
testing. We also compared prediction performance for average controllability
versus strength, which indexes only direct connections to a region. Finally, we
assessed how the prediction performance for psychosis spectrum symptoms varied
over the functional hierarchy spanning unimodal to transmodal cortex.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Average controllability outperformed strength at predicting positive
psychosis spectrum symptoms, demonstrating that indexing indirect structural
connections to a region improved prediction performance. Critically, improved
prediction was concentrated in association cortex for average controllability,
whereas prediction performance for strength was uniform across the cortex,
suggesting that indexing indirect connections is crucial in association cortex.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examining inter-individual variation in direct and indirect structural
connections to association cortex is crucial for accurate prediction of
positive psychosis spectrum symptoms.

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This study aimed to determine the prevalence and mechanism of linear vertigo reported by the patients during the attacks of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). We prospectively evaluated the characteristics (rotational vs. linear) of positional vertigo in 70 patients with posterior and horizontal canal BPPV using a questionnaire allowing multiple choices. In patients with linear vertigo, we further assessed the directionality of linear vertigo. We adopted the velocity-storage model to explain the occurrence and direction of linear vertigo in these patients with BPPV. Patients reported only rotational vertigo in 46 (46/70, 65.7%), only linear vertigo in 10 (14.3%), and both rotational and linear vertigo in 14 (20%). The patients experienced fear from rotational vertigo in 54 (54/70, 77.1%) and from linear vertigo in 20 (20/70, 28.6%). The direction of linear vertigo was concordant with the direction of inertial acceleration predicted by the velocity-storage model. Patients with BPPV may experience linear as well as rotational vertigo during the attacks. This linear vertigo may be ascribed to centrally estimated inertial acceleration.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Studying the structural alterations occurring during diseases of the nervous system requires imaging heterogeneous cell populations at the circuit, cellular and subcellular levels. Recent advancements in brain tissue clearing and expansion methods allow unprecedented detailed imaging of the nervous system through its entire scale, from circuits to synapses, including neurovascular and brain lymphatics elements. Here, we review the state-of-the-art of brain tissue clearing and expansion methods, mentioning their main advantages and limitations, and suggest their parallel implementation for circuits-to-synapses brain imaging using conventional (diffraction-limited) light microscopy -such as confocal, two-photon and light-sheet microscopy- to interrogate the cellular and molecular basis of neurodegenerative diseases. We discuss recent studies in which clearing and expansion methods have been successfully applied to study neuropathological processes in mouse models and postmortem human brain tissue. Volumetric imaging of cleared intact mouse brains and large human brain samples has allowed unbiased assessment of neuropathological hallmarks. In contrast, nanoscale imaging of expanded cells and brain tissue has been used to study the effect of protein aggregates on specific subcellular structures. Therefore, these approaches can be readily applied to study a wide range of brain processes and pathological mechanisms with cellular and subcellular resolution in a time- and cost-efficient manner. We consider that a broader implementation of these technologies is necessary to reveal the full landscape of cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 In vitro work revealed that excitatory synaptic inputs to hippocampal inhibitory interneurons could undergo Hebbian, associative or non-associative plasticity. Both behavioral and learning-dependent reorganization of these connections has also been demonstrated by measuring spike transmission probabilities in pyramidal cell-interneuron spike cross-correlations that indicate monosynaptic connections. Here we investigated the activity-dependent modification of these connections during exploratory behavior in rats by optogenetically inhibiting pyramidal cell and interneuron subpopulations. Light application and associated firing alteration of pyramidal and interneuron populations led to lasting changes of pyramidal-interneuron connection weights as indicated by spike transmission changes. Spike transmission alterations were predicted by the light-mediated changes in the number of pre- and postsynaptic spike pairing events and by firing rate changes of interneurons but not pyramidal cells. This work demonstrates the presence of activity-dependent associative and non-associative reorganization of pyramidal-interneuron connections triggered by the optogenetic modification of the firing rate and spike synchrony of cells.</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;i&gt;SNORD115&lt;/i&gt; has been proposed to promote the activity of serotonin (HTR2C) receptor via its ability to base-pair with its pre-mRNA and regulate alternative RNA splicing and/or A-to-I RNA editing. Because &lt;i&gt;SNORD115&lt;/i&gt; genes are deleted in most patients with the Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), diminished HTR2C receptor activity could contribute to the impaired emotional response and/or compulsive overeating characteristic of this disease. In order to test this appealing but never demonstrated hypothesis &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, we created a CRISPR/Cas9-mediated &lt;i&gt;Snord115&lt;/i&gt; knockout mouse. Surprisingly, we uncovered only modest region-specific alterations in &lt;i&gt;Htr2c&lt;/i&gt; RNA editing profiles while &lt;i&gt;Htr2c &lt;/i&gt;alternative RNA splicing was unchanged. These subtle changes, whose functional relevance remains uncertain, were not accompanied by any discernible defects in anxio-depressive-like phenotypes. Energy balance and eating behaviour were also normal, even after exposure to high fat diet. Our study raises questions concerning the physiological role of &lt;i&gt;SNORD115&lt;/i&gt;, notably its involvement in behavioural disturbance associated with PWS.</content>

 Cortical neural activity is coupled to local arterial diameter and blood flow. However, which neurons control the dynamics of cerebral arteries is not well understood. We dissected the cellular mechanisms controlling the basal diameter and evoked dilation in cortical arteries in awake, head-fixed mice. Locomotion drove robust arterial dilation, increases in gamma band power in the local field potential (LFP), and increases calcium signals in pyramidal and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS)-expressing neurons. Chemogenetic or pharmocological modulation of overall neural activity up or down caused corresponding increases or decreases in basal arterial diameter. Modulation of pyramidal neuron activity alone had little effect on basal or evoked arterial dilation, despite pronounced changes in the LFP. Modulation of the activity of nNOS-expressing neurons drove changes in the basal and evoked arterial diameter without corresponding changes in population neural activity.</content>

 Vitamin B12 is an essential micronutrient that functions in two metabolic pathways: the canonical propionate breakdown pathway and the methionine/S-adenosylmethionine (Met/SAM) cycle. In &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans,&lt;/i&gt; low vitamin B12, or genetic perturbation of the canonical propionate breakdown pathway results in propionate accumulation and the transcriptional activation of a propionate shunt pathway. This propionate-dependent mechanism requires &lt;i&gt;nhr-10&lt;/i&gt; and is referred to as 'B12-mechanism-I'. Here, we report that vitamin B12 represses the expression of Met/SAM cycle genes by a propionate-independent mechanism we refer to as 'B12-mechanism-II'. This mechanism is activated by perturbations in the Met/SAM cycle, genetically or due to low dietary vitamin B12. B12-mechanism-II requires &lt;i&gt;nhr-114&lt;/i&gt; to activate Met/SAM cycle gene expression, the vitamin B12 transporter, &lt;i&gt;pmp-5&lt;/i&gt;, and adjust influx and efflux of the cycle by activating msra-1 and repressing &lt;i&gt;cbs-1&lt;/i&gt;, respectively. Taken together, Met/SAM cycle activity is sensed and transcriptionally adjusted to be in a tight metabolic regime.</content>

 Filoviruses such as Ebola and Marburg virus bud from the host membrane as enveloped virions. This process is achieved by the matrix protein VP40. When expressed alone, VP40 induces budding of filamentous virus-like particles, suggesting that localization to the plasma membrane, oligomerization into a matrix layer, and generation of membrane curvature are intrinsic properties of VP40. There has been no direct information on the structure of VP40 matrix layers within viruses or virus-like particles. We present structures of Ebola and Marburg VP40 matrix layers in intact virus-like particles, and within intact Marburg viruses. VP40 dimers assemble extended chains via C-terminal domain interactions. These chains stack to form 2D matrix lattices below the membrane surface. These lattices form a patchwork assembly across the membrane and suggesting that assembly may begin at multiple points. Our observations define the structure and arrangement of the matrix protein layer that mediates formation of filovirus particles.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Huntington’s disease (HD) is a neurological disorder characterized by motor disturbances. HD pathology is most prominent in the striatum, the central hub of the basal ganglia. The cerebral cortex is the main striatal afferent, and progressive cortico-striatal disconnection characterizes HD. We mapped striatal network dysfunction in HD mice to ultimately modulate the activity of a specific cortico-striatal circuit to ameliorate motor symptoms and recover synaptic plasticity. Multimodal MRI in vivo indicates cortico-striatal and thalamo-striatal functional network deficits and reduced glutamate/glutamine ratio in the striatum of HD mice. Moreover, optogenetically-induced glutamate release from M2 cortex terminals in the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) was undetectable in HD mice and striatal neurons show blunted electrophysiological responses. Remarkably, repeated M2-DLS optogenetic stimulation normalized motor behavior in HD mice and evoked a sustained increase of synaptic plasticity. Overall, these results reveal that selective stimulation of the M2-DLS pathway can become an effective therapeutic strategy in HD.</content>

		<content type="html">
 The dependency of cancer cells on glutamine may be exploited therapeutically as a new strategy for treating cancers that lack druggable driver genes. Here we found that human liver cancer was dependent on extracellular glutamine. However, targeting glutamine addiction using the glutaminase inhibitor CB-839 as monotherapy had a very limited anticancer effect, even against the most glutamine addicted human liver cancer cells. Using a chemical library, we identified V-9302, a novel inhibitor of glutamine transporter ASCT2, as sensitizing glutamine dependent (GD) cells to CB-839 treatment. Mechanically, a combination of CB-839 and V-9302 depleted glutathione and induced reactive oxygen species (ROS), resulting in apoptosis of GD cells. Moreover, this combination also showed tumor inhibition in HCC xenograft mouse models in vivo. Our findings indicate that dual inhibition of glutamine metabolism by targeting both glutaminase and glutamine transporter ASCT2 represents a potential novel treatment strategy for glutamine addicted liver cancers.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Modifications in the tRNA anticodon loop, adjacent to the three-nucleotide anticodon, influence translation fidelity by stabilizing the tRNA to allow for accurate reading of the mRNA genetic code. One example is the N1-methylguaonosine modification at guanine nucleotide 37 (m&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;G37) located in the anticodon loop, immediately adjacent to the anticodon nucleotides 34-36. The absence of m&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;G37 in tRNA&lt;sup&gt;Pro&lt;/sup&gt; causes +1 frameshifting on polynucleotide, slippery codons. Here, we report structures of the bacterial ribosome containing tRNA&lt;sup&gt;Pro&lt;/sup&gt; bound to either cognate or slippery codons to determine how the m&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;G37 modification prevents mRNA frameshifting. The structures reveal that certain codon-anticodon contexts and m&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;G37 destabilize interactions of tRNA&lt;sup&gt;Pro&lt;/sup&gt; with the peptidyl site, causing large conformational changes typically only seen during EF-G mediated translocation of the mRNA-tRNA pairs. These studies provide molecular insights into how m&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;G37 stabilizes the interactions of tRNA&lt;sup&gt;Pro&lt;/sup&gt; with the ribosome and the influence of slippery codons on the mRNA reading frame.</content>

		<content type="html">
 The activity of basal ganglia input receiving motor thalamus (BGMT) makes a critical impact on motor cortical processing, but modification in BGMT processing with Parkinsonian conditions have not be investigated at the cellular level. Such changes may well be expected due to homeostatic regulation of neural excitability in the presence of altered synaptic drive with dopamine depletion. We addressed this question by comparing BGMT properties in brain slice recordings between control and unilaterally 6-OHDA treated adult mice. At a minimum of 1 month post 6-OHDA treatment, BGMT neurons showed a highly significant increase in intrinsic excitability, which was primarily due to a decrease in M-type potassium current. BGMT neurons after 6-OHDA treatment also showed an increase in T-type calcium rebound spikes following hyperpolarizing current steps. Biophysical computer modeling of a thalamic neuron demonstrated that an increase in rebound spiking can also be accounted for by a decrease in the M-type potassium current. Modeling also showed that an increase in sag with hyperpolarizing steps found after 6-OHDA treatment could in part but not fully be accounted for by the decrease in M-type current. These findings support the hypothesis that homeostatic changes in BGMT neural properties following 6-OHDA treatment likely influence the signal processing taking place in basal ganglia thalamocortical processing in Parkinson's disease.</content>

 Background Quorum sensing peptides (QSPs) are bacterial peptides produced by Gram-positive bacteria to communicate with their peers in a cell-density dependent manner. These peptides do not only act as interbacterial communication signals, but can also have effects on the host. Compelling evidence demonstrates the presence of a gut-brain axis and more specifically, the role of the gut microbiota in microglial functioning. The aim of this study is to investigate microglial activating properties of a selected QSP (PapRIV) which is produced by Bacillus cereus species. Methods Gastro-intestinal transport of the peptide is investigated using the in vitro Caco-2 model while transport over the blood-brain barrier is investigated in mice using multiple time regression experiments. Microglial activation is assessed using ELISA, fluorometry, immunoblotting, qPCR and phase-contrast microscopy. In vivo plasma detection and ex vivo metabolization experiments are performed using UHPLC-MS/MS and UHPLC-UV/MS, respectively. Results PapRIV showed in vitro activating properties of BV-2 microglia cells and was able to cross the in vitro Caco-2 cell model and pass the blood-brain barrier in vivo. In vivo peptide presence was also demonstrated in mouse plasma. The peptide caused induction of IL-6, TNF and ROS expression and increased the fraction of ameboid BV-2 microglia cells in an NF-{kappa}B dependent manner. Different metabolites were identified in serum, of which the main metabolite (DLPFEH) still remained active. Conclusions PapRIV is thus able to cross the gastro-intestinal tract and the blood-brain barrier and shows in vitro activating properties in BV-2 microglia cells, hereby indicating a potential role of this quorum sensing peptide in gut-brain interaction.</content>

 Reinforcement learning, the ability to change motor behavior based on external reward, has been suggested to play a critical role in early stages of speech motor development and is widely used in clinical rehabilitation for speech motor disorders. However, no current evidence exists that demonstrates the capability of reinforcement to drive changes in human speech behavior. While the effects of reinforcement learning have been studied more extensively in upper limb control, speech provides a unique test of the universality of reinforcement learning across motor domains. Speech is a complex, high-dimensional motor task whose goals are unique in that they do not specify a task to be performed in the environment but ultimately must be self-generated by each speaker such that they are understood by those around them. Reinforcement learning may thus be more difficult for speech, given its high-dimensional and redundant motor system, while speech may also be particularly responsive to reinforcement given the ultimate goal is typically reliant on such feedback from our interlocutors. Across four experiments, we establish whether reinforcement learning alone is sufficient to drive changes in speech behavior and parametrically test two features known to affect reinforcement learning in reaching: how informative the reinforcement signal is as well as the availability of sensory feedback (here, auditory feedback) about the outcomes of one's motor behavior. Our results show that reinforcement learning can indeed drive changes in speech behavior and that more informative reward signals lead to greater learning. However, contrary to results from upper limb control, masking feedback about movement outcomes has no effect on speech learning. Our results suggest reinforcement learning is active in speech but may operate differently than in other motor domains.</content>

 Neuronal representations in the hippocampus and related structures gradually change over time despite no changes in the environment or behavior. The extent to which such representational drift occurs in sensory cortical areas and whether the hierarchy of information flow across areas affects neural-code stability have remained elusive. Here, we address these questions by analyzing large-scale optical and electrophysiological recordings from six visual cortical areas in behaving mice that were repeatedly presented with the same natural movies. We found representational drift over timescales spanning minutes to days across multiple visual areas. The drift was driven mostly by changes in individual cells' activity rates, while their tuning changed to a lesser extent. Despite these changes, the structure of relationships between the population activity patterns remained stable and stereotypic, allowing robust maintenance of information over time. Such population-level organization may underlie stable visual perception in the face of continuous changes in neuronal responses.</content>

 In mammalian cerebral neocortex, different regions have different cytoarchitecture, neuronal birthdates and functions. In most regions, neuronal migratory profiles have been speculated similar to each other based on observations using thymidine analogues. Few reports investigated regional migratory differences from mitosis at the ventricular surface. Here, in mice, we applied FlashTag technology, in which dyes are injected intraventricularly, to describe migratory profiles. We revealed a mediolateral regional difference in migratory profiles of neurons that is dependent on the developmental stages, e.g., neurons labeled at E12.5-15.5 reached their destination earlier dorsomedially than dorsolaterally even where there were underlying ventricular surfaces, reflecting sojourning below the subplate. This difference was hardly recapitulated by thymidine analogues, which visualize neurogenic gradient, suggesting biological significance different from neurogenic gradient. These observations advance understanding of cortical development, portraying strength of FlashTag in studying migration, and are thus a resource for studies of normal and abnormal neurodevelopment.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Goal-directed aiming movements toward visuo-haptic targets (i.e., seen and handheld targets) are generally more precise than those toward visual only or haptic only targets. This multisensory advantage stems from a continuous inflow of haptic and visual target information during the movement planning and execution phases. However, in everyday life, multisensory movements often occur without the support of continuous visual information. Here we investigated whether and to what extent limiting visual information to the initial stage of the action still leads to a multisensory advantage. Participants were asked to reach a handheld target while vision was briefly provided during the movement planning phase (50 ms, 100 ms, 200 ms of vision before movement onset), or during the planning and early execution phases (400 ms of vision), or during the entire movement. Additional conditions were performed in which only haptic target information was provided, or, only vision was provided either briefly (50 ms, 100 ms, 200 ms, 400 ms) or throughout the entire movement. Results showed that 50 ms of vision before movement onset were sufficient to trigger a direction-specific visuo-haptic integration process that increased movement precision. We conclude that, when a continuous support of vision is not available, movement precision is determined by the less recent, but most reliable multisensory information rather than by the latest unisensory (haptic) inputs.</content>

 Current techniques to estimate directed functional connectivity from magnetoencephalography (MEG) signals involve two sequential steps; 1) Estimation of the sources and their amplitude time series from the MEG data by solving the inverse problem, and 2) fitting a multivariate autoregressive (MVAR) model to these time series for the estimation of AR coefficients, which reflect the directed interactions between the sources. However, such a sequential approach is not optimal since i) source estimation algorithms typically assume that the sources are independent, ii) the information provided by the connectivity structure is not used to inform the estimation of source amplitudes, and iii) the limited spatial resolution of source estimates often leads to spurious connectivity due to spatial leakage. Here, we present an algorithm to jointly estimate the source and connectivity parameters using Bayesian filtering, which does not require anatomical constraints in form of structural connectivity or a-priori specified regions-of-interest. By formulating a state-space model for the locations and amplitudes of a given number of sources, we show that estimation of functional connectivity can be reduced to a system identification problem. We derive a solution to this problem using a variant of the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm known as stochastic approximation EM (SAEM). Compared to the traditional two-step approach, the joint approach using the SAEM algorithm provides a more accurate reconstruction of connectivity parameters, which we show with a connectivity benchmark simulation as well as with an electrocorticography-based simulation of MEG data. Using real MEG responses to visually presented faces in 16 subjects, we also demonstrate that our method gives source and connectivity estimates that are both physiologically plausible and largely consistent across subjects. In conclusion, the proposed joint-estimation approach based on the SAEM algorithm outperforms the traditional two-step approach in determining functional connectivity structure in MEG data.</content>

		<content type="html">
 The mu opioid receptor (MOR) is a G protein-coupled receptor that plays an essential role in reward and hedonic processes, and that has been implicated in disorders such as depression and addiction. Over the last decade, several brain imaging studies in depressed patients have consistently found that dysregulation of MOR function occurs in particular in the anterior insular cortex, an important brain site for the perception of internal states and emotional regulation. To investigate molecular mechanisms that may underlie these effects, here we assessed genetic polymorphisms, expression, and functional G-protein coupling of MOR in a large post-mortem cohort (N=95) composed of depressed individuals who died by suicide, and healthy controls. Results indicated that depression, but not comorbid substance use disorder or acute opiate consumption, was associated with increased MOR activity. This effect was partly explained by a specific increase in expression of the inhibitory alpha G-protein subunit GNAI2. Consistent with previous neuroimaging studies, our findings support the notion that enhanced endogenous opioidergic tone in the anterior insula may buffer negative affective states in depressed individuals, a mechanism that could potentially contribute to the antidepressant efficacy of emerging opioid-based medications.</content>

 In a traditional view, in social cognition, attention is equated with gaze and people track attention by tracking other people's gaze. Here we used fMRI to test whether the brain represents attention in a richer manner. People read stories describing an agent (either oneself or someone else) directing attention to an object in one of two ways: either internally directed (endogenous) or externally induced (exogenous). We used multivoxel pattern analysis to examine how brain areas within the theory-of-mind network encoded attention type and agent type. Brain activity patterns in the left temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) showed significant decoding of information about endogenous versus exogenous attention. The left TPJ, left superior temporal sulcus (STS), precuneus, and medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) significantly decoded agent type (self versus other). These findings show that the brain constructs a rich model of one's own and others' attentional state, possibly aiding theory of mind.</content>

 It has been proposed that the activity of dopamine neurons approximates temporal difference (TD) prediction error, a teaching signal developed in reinforcement learning, a field of machine learning. However, whether this similarity holds true during learning remains elusive. In particular, some TD learning models predict that the error signal gradually shifts backward in time from reward delivery to a reward-predictive cue, but previous experiments failed to observe such a gradual shift in dopamine activity. Here we demonstrate conditions in which such a shift can be detected experimentally. These shared dynamics of TD error and dopamine activity narrow the gap between machine learning theory and biological brains, tightening a long-sought link.</content>

 Slow-timescale (tonic) changes in dopamine (DA) contribute to a wide variety of processes in reinforcement learning, interval timing, and other domains. Furthermore, changes in tonic DA exert distinct effects depending on when they occur (e.g., during learning vs. performance) and what task the subject is performing (e.g., operant vs. classical conditioning). Two influential theories of tonic DA -- the average reward theory and the Bayesian theory in which DA controls precision -- have each been successful at explaining a subset of empirical findings. But how the same DA signal performs two seemingly distinct functions without creating crosstalk is not well understood. Here we reconcile the two theories under the unifying framework of 'rational inattention,' which (1) conceptually links average reward and precision, (2) outlines how DA manipulations affect this relationship, and in so doing, (3) captures new empirical phenomena. In brief, rational inattention asserts that agents can increase their precision in a task (and thus improve their performance) by paying a cognitive cost. Crucially, whether this cost is worth paying depends on average reward availability, reported by DA. The monotonic relationship between average reward and precision means that the DA signal contains the information necessary to retrieve the precision. When this information is needed after the task is performed, as presumed by Bayesian inference, acute manipulations of DA will bias behavior in predictable ways. We show how this framework reconciles a remarkably large collection of experimental findings. In reinforcement learning, the rational inattention framework predicts that learning from positive and negative feedback should be enhanced in high and low DA states, respectively, and that DA should tip the exploration-exploitation balance toward exploitation. In interval timing, this framework predicts that DA should increase the speed of the internal clock and decrease the extent of interference by other temporal stimuli during temporal reproduction (the central tendency effect). Finally, rational inattention makes the new predictions that these effects should be critically dependent on the controllability of rewards, that post-reward delays in intertemporal choice tasks should be underestimated, and that average reward manipulations should affect the speed of the clock -- thus capturing empirical findings that are unexplained by either theory alone. Our results suggest that a common computational repertoire may underlie the seemingly heterogeneous roles of DA.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Hidden hearing loss (HHL) is an auditory neuropathy characterized by normal hearing thresholds but reduced amplitude of the sound-evoked auditory nerve compound action potential (CAP). It has been proposed that in humans HHL leads to speech discrimination and intelligibility deficits, particularly in noisy environments. Animal models originally indicated that HHL can be caused by moderate noise exposures or aging, and that loss of inner hair cell (IHC) synapses could be its cause. A recent study provided evidence that transient loss of cochlear Schwann cells also causes permanent auditory deficits in mice which have characteristics of HHL. Histological analysis of the cochlea after auditory nerve remyelination showed a permanent disruption of the myelination patterns at the heminode of type I spiral ganglion neuron (SGN) peripheral terminals, suggesting that this defect could be contributing to HHL. To shed light on the mechanisms of different HHL scenarios and to test their impact on type I SGN activity, we constructed a reduced biophysical model for a population of SGN peripheral axons. We found that the amplitudes of simulated sound-evoked SGN CAPs are lower and have greater latencies when the heminodes are disorganized, i.e. they are placed at different distances from the hair cell rather than at the same distance as seen in the normal cochlea. Thus, our model confirms that disruption of the position of the heminode causes desynchronization of SGN spikes leading to a loss of temporal resolution and reduction of the sound-evoked SGN CAP. We also simulated synaptopathy by removing high threshold IHC-SGN synapses and found that the amplitude of simulated sound-evoked SGN CAPs decreases while latencies remain unchanged, corresponding to what has been observed in noise exposed animals. This model can be used to further study the effects of synaptopathy or demyelination on auditory function.</content>

 Music plays a more important role in our life than just being an entertainment. It is an even anti-anxiety therapy of human and animals. However, the unsafe listening of loud music triggers hearing loss in millions of young people and professional musicians (rock, jazz, and symphony orchestra) due to exposure to damaging levels of sound using personal audio devices or at noisy entertainment venues including nightclubs, discotheques, bars, and concerts. Therefore, it is important to understand how loud music affects us. In this pioneering study on healthy mice, we discover that loud rock music below the safety threshold causes opening of the blood-brain barrier (OBBB ), which plays an important role in protecting the brain from viruses, bacteria and toxins. We clearly demonstrate that listening loud music during 2 hrs in an intermittent adaptive regime is accompanied by delayed (1h after music exposure) and short-lasting (during 1-4 hrs) OBBB to low and high molecular weight compounds without cochlear and brain impairments. We present the systemic and molecular mechanisms responsible for music-induced OBBB. Finally, a revision of our traditional knowledge about the BBB nature and the novel strategies in optimization of sound-mediated methods for brain drug delivery are discussed.</content>

 A successful class of models link decision-making to brain signals by assuming that evidence accumulates to a decision threshold. These evidence accumulation models have identified neuronal activity that appears to reflect sensory evidence and decision variables that drive behavior. More recently, an additional evidence-independent and time-variant signal, named urgency, has been hypothesized to accelerate decisions in the face of insufficient evidence. However, most decision-making paradigms tested with fMRI or EEG in humans have not been designed to disentangle evidence accumulation from urgency. Here we use a face-morphing decision-making task in combination with EEG and a hierarchical Bayesian model to identify neural signals related to sensory and decision variables, and to test the urgency-gating model. We find that an evoked potential time-locked to the decision, the centroparietal positivity, reflects the decision variable from the computational model. We further show that the unfolding of this signal throughout the decision process best reflects the product of sensory evidence and an evidence-independent urgency signal. Urgency varied across subjects, suggesting that it may represent an individual trait. Our results show that it is possible to use EEG to distinguish neural signals related to sensory evidence accumulation, decision variables, and urgency. These mechanisms expose principles of cognitive function in general and may have applications to the study of pathological decision-making as in impulse control and addictive disorders.</content>

		<content type="html">
 The effects of threatening stimuli, including threatening language, on trait anxiety have been widely studied. However, whether anxiety levels have a direct effect on language processing has not been so consistently explored. The present study focuses on event-related potential (ERP) patterns resulting from electroencephalographic (EEG) measurement of participants' (n = 36) brain activity while they perform a dichotic listening task. Participants' anxiety level was measured via a behavioural inhibition system scale (BIS). Later, participants listened to dichotically paired sentences, one neutral and the other threatening, and indicated at which ear they heard the threatening stimulus. Threatening sentences expressed threat semantically-only, prosodically-only, or both combined (congruent threat). ERPs showed a late positivity, interpreted as a late positive complex (LPC). Results from Bayesian hierarchical models provided strong support for an association between LPC and BIS score. This was interpreted as an effect of trait anxiety on deliberation processes, which provides evidence of a fourth processing phase of an originally three-phasic model of emotional language processing.</content>

		<content type="html">
 A growing body of evidence suggests that, during decision-making, BOLD signal in the VMPFC correlates both with motivational variables - such as incentives and expected values - and metacognitive variables - such as confidence judgments, which reflect the subjective probability of being correct. At the behavioral level, we recently demonstrated that the value of monetary stakes bias confidence judgments, with gain (respectively loss) prospects increasing (respectively decreasing) confidence judgments, even for similar levels of difficulty and performance. If and how this value-confidence interaction is also reflected in VMPFC signals remains unknown. Here, we used an incentivized perceptual decision-making task that dissociates key decision-making variables, thereby allowing to test several hypotheses about the role of the VMPFC in the incentive-confidence interaction. While initial analyses seemingly indicate that VMPFC combines incentives and confidence to form an expected value signal, we falsified this conclusion with a meticulous dissection of qualitative activation patterns. Rather, our results show that strong VMPFC confidence signals observed in trials with gain prospects are disrupted in trials with no - or negative (loss) monetary prospects. Deciphering how decision variables are represented and interact at finer scales (population codes, individual neurons) seems necessary to better understand biased (meta)cognition.</content>

		<content type="html">
 The insula contributes to behavioral control and is disrupted by substance abuse, yet we know little about the neural signals underlying these functions or how they are disrupted after chronic drug self-administration. Here, rats self-administered either cocaine (experimental group) or sucrose (control) for twelve consecutive days. After a one-month withdrawal period, we recorded from anterior insula while rats performed a previously learned reward-guided decision-making task. Cocaine-exposed rats were more sensitive to value manipulations and were faster to respond. These behavioral changes were accompanied by elevated counts of neurons in the insula that increased firing to reward. These neurons also fired more strongly at the start of long delay trials- when a more immediate reward would be expected, and fired less strongly in anticipation of the actual delivery of delayed rewards. Although reward-related firing to immediate reward was enhanced after cocaine self-administration, reward-predicting cue and context signals were attenuated.</content>

		<content type="html">
 In an effort to better characterize the transcriptomic changes that accompany early Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology in living patients and correlate with contemporaneous cognitive data, we performed RNA-seq on 106 cortical biopsies that were taken during shunt placement for adult onset hydrocephalus with varying degrees of comorbid AD pathology. A restricted set of genes correlate with AD pathology in these biopsies, and co-expression network analysis demonstrates an evolution from microglial homeostasis to a disease-associated microglial phenotype in conjunction with increasing AD pathologic burden, along with a subset of additional astrocytic and neuronal genes that accompany these changes. Further analysis demonstrates that these correlations are driven by patients that report mild cognitive symptoms, despite similar levels of {beta}-amyloid and tau pathology in comparison to patients who report no cognitive symptoms. Interestingly, downregulation of homeostatic genes and upregulation of disease-associated genes also correlate with microglial plaque invasion and an activated microglial morphology, and this change is not sensitive to cognitive status, suggesting that an initial microglial response to AD pathology is eventually maladaptive. Taken together, these findings highlight a restricted set of microglial and non-microglial genes and suggest that early AD pathology is largely characterized by a loss of homeostatic genes and an activated microglial phenotype that continues to evolve in conjunction with accumulating AD pathology in the setting of subjective cognitive decline.</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Topographic gradients define the projection patterns of the claustrum core and shell in mice&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/8132d85a-78da-4bfb-bfcb-1279e0131d0b/cne25043-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Claustrocortical projections are organized across the dorsoventral axis and map onto the rostrocaudal axis of the cortex. Interneuron subtypes are differentially localized to the core and shell of the claustrum. The lines linking claustrum and cortex highlight some of the most numerous and divergent claustrocortical pathways identified in this study.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The claustrum is densely connected to the cortex and participates in brain functions such as attention and sleep. Although some studies have reported the widely divergent organization of claustrum projections, others describe parallel claustrocortical connections to different cortical regions. Therefore, the details underlying how claustrum neurons broadcast information to cortical networks remain incompletely understood. Using multicolor retrograde tracing we determined the density, topography, and co‐projection pattern of 14 claustrocortical pathways, in mice. We spatially registered these pathways to a common coordinate space and found that the claustrocortical system is topographically organized as a series of overlapping spatial modules, continuously distributed across the dorsoventral claustrum axis. The claustrum core projects predominantly to frontal‐midline cortical regions, whereas the dorsal and ventral shell project to the cortical motor system and temporal lobe, respectively. Anatomically connected cortical regions receive common input from a subset of claustrum neurons shared by neighboring modules, whereas spatially separated regions of cortex are innervated by different claustrum modules. Therefore, each output module exhibits a unique position within the claustrum and overlaps substantially with other modules projecting to functionally related cortical regions. Claustrum inhibitory cells containing parvalbumin, somatostatin, and neuropeptide Y also show unique topographical distributions, suggesting different output modules are controlled by distinct inhibitory circuit motifs. The topographic organization of excitatory and inhibitory cell types may enable parallel claustrum outputs to independently coordinate distinct cortical networks.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The syndrome of cerebellar ataxia with neuropathy and bilateral vestibular areflexia (CANVAS) has emerged progressively during the last 30 years. It was first outlined by the neurootology/neurophysiology community in the vestibular areflexic patients, through the description of patients slowly developing late-onset cerebellar ataxia and bilateral vestibulopathy. The characteristic deficit of visuo-vestibulo-ocular reflex (VVOR) due to the impaired slow stabilizing eye movements was put forward and a specific disease subtending this syndrome was suggested. The association to a peripheral sensory axonal neuropathy was described later on, with neuropathological studies demonstrating that both sensory neuropathy and vestibular areflexia were diffuse ganglionopathy. Clinical and electrophysiological criteria of CANVAS were then proposed in 2016. Besides the classical triad, frequent chronic cough, signs of dysautonomia and neurogenic pains were frequently observed. From the beginning of published cohorts, sporadic as well as familial cases were reported, the last suggestive of an autosomal recessive mode of transmission. The genetic disorder was discovered in 2019, under the form of abnormal biallelic expansion in the replication factor C subunit 1 (RFC1) in a population of late-onset ataxia. This pathological expansion was found in 100% of the familial form and 92% of sporadic ones when the triad was complete. But using the genetic criteria, the phenotype of CANVAS seems to expand, for exemple including patients with isolated neuronopathy. We propose here to review the clinical, electrophysiological, anatomical, genetic aspect of CANVAS in light of the recent discovery of the genetic aetiology, and discuss differential diagnosis, neuropathology and physiopathology.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 Noxious cold sensation is commonly associated with peripheral neuropathies, however, there has been limited progress in understanding the mechanism of cold pain. Transient receptor potential (TRP) A1 channels facilitate the perception of noxious cold at the level of dorsal root ganglia (DRG), where kappa opioid receptors (KOR) are also expressed but have not previously been implicated in cold sensation. Here we identify a new role for KOR in enhancing cold hypersensitivity. First, we show that systemic KOR agonism (U50,488, KOR agonist), significantly potentiates the latency to jump and the number of jumps on the cold plate compared controls at 3oC. Importantly, NorBNI (KOR antagonist) attenuates U50,488-induced cold hypersensitivity. However, the central administration of NorBNI does not block U50,488-induced cold hypersensitivity suggesting that peripheral KOR likely modulate this effect. Furthermore, the peripherally-restricted KOR agonist, ff(nle)r-NH2 also induces cold hypersensitivity. Using fluorescent in situ hybridization, we show that KOR mRNA colocalizes with the transcripts for the cold-activated TRPA1 and TRPM8 channels in DRG. Finally, using calcium imaging in DRG, we show that intracellular calcium release is potentiated during the simultaneous application of a TRPA1 agonist, mustard oil (MO), and a KOR agonist (U50,488), when compared to MO alone. This potentiated calcium response is absent in TRPA1 KO mice. Together our data suggest that KOR-induces cold hypersensitivity through modulation of peripheral TRPA1 channels. These findings indicate that whether activation of peripheral KOR is protective or not may be dependent on the pain modality.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Serotonin (5-HT) receptors have been implicated in responses to aversive stimuli in mammals and fish, but its precise role is still unknown. Moreover, since at least seven families of 5-HT receptors exist in vertebrates, the role of specific receptors is still debated. Aversive stimuli can be classified as indicators of proximal, distal, or potential threat, initiating responses that are appropriate for each of these threat levels. Responses to potential threat usually involve cautious exploration and increased alertness, while responses to distal and proximal threat involve a fight-flight-freeze reaction. We exposed adult zebrafish to a conspecific alarm substance (CAS) and observed behavior during (distal threat) and after (proximal threat) exposure, and treated with the 5-HT2C receptor agonists MK-212 or WAY-161503 or with the antagonist RS-102221. The agonists blocked CAS-elicited defensive behavior (distal threat), but not post-exposure increases in defensive behavior (potential threat), suggesting a phasic inhibition of responses to distal threat. MK-212 did not block changes in behavior elicited by acute restraint stress, a model of proximal threat, suggesting that the phasic role of the 5-HT2C receptor is specific to distal threat. We also found that RS-10221, a 5-HT2C receptor antagonist, did not change behavior during exposure, but it produced a small effect on behavior after exposure to CAS, suggesting a tonic facilitation of responses to potential threat.</content>

 Cluster-wise statistical inference is the most widely used technique for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data analyses. Cluster-wise statistical inference consists of two steps: i) primary thresholding that excludes less significant voxels by a pre-specified cut-off (e.g., p&amp;lt;0.001 ); and ii) cluster-wise thresholding that controls the family-wise error rate (FWER) caused by clusters consisting of false positive supra-threshold voxels. It has been well known that the selection of the primary threshold is critical because it determines both statistical power and false discovery rate. However, in most existing statistical packages, the primary threshold is selected based on prior knowledge (e.g., p&amp;lt;0.001) without taking into account the information in the data. In this manuscript, we propose a data-driven approach to objectively select the optimal primary threshold based on an empirical Bayes framework. We evaluate the proposed model using extensive simulation studies and an fMRI data example. The results show that our method can effectively increase statistical power while effectively controlling the false discovery rate.</content>

 Animal behavior and metabolism are tightly coordinated with sleep-wake cycles governed by the brain in harmony with environmental light:dark cycles. Within the brain, the dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus (DMH) has been implicated in the integrative control of feeding, energy homeostasis, and circadian rhythms, but the underlying cell types are unknown. Here, we identify a role for DMH leptin receptor-expressing neurons (DMHLepR) in these effects. Using a viral approach, we show that silencing DMHLepR neurons in adult mice not only increases body weight and adiposity, but also shifts circadian rhythms in feeding and metabolism into the light-cycle. Moreover, DMHLepR silencing abolishes the normal increase in dark-cycle locomotor activity characteristic of nocturnal rodents. Furthermore, DMHLepR-silenced mice fail to entrain to a restrictive change in food availability. Together, these findings identify DMHLepR neurons as critical determinants of the daily time of feeding and associated metabolic rhythms.</content>

		<content type="html">
 The hippocampal formation is linked to spatial navigation but direct evidence in primates during active, unconstrained navigation is lacking. Combined with accurate behavioral tracking of eye and head, we record neurons across hippocampal regions in rhesus macaques during free foraging in an open arena. We find that neurons encode a broad spectrum of spatial variables beyond place fields. Most neurons show mixed selectivity, with diverse representations covering the entire space. The allocentric representations are dominated by facing location and tilt orientation, and a rather low fraction of neurons shows place or grid fields. Spatial facing selectivity mainly reflects head-, rather than gaze-related, properties. These findings reveal that the macaque hippocampal formation represents space using a multiplexed code, with heading properties dominating over simple place coding during free behavior.</content>

 Up to now, disrupted functional organization of the brain in Alzheimers disease (AD) has mostly been examined by assessing static functional connectivity (FC). However, recent studies have provided clear evidence that brain FC exhibits intrinsic spatiotemporal dynamic organization also being significantly affected in AD. However, inconsistency in former studies is a motivation for further investigation of impaired dynamic profile of brain FC networks in Alzheimers disease. In this work, we identified recurring FC states during rest (eyes-open) in 24 AD patients and 37 healthy controls (HC) by combining sliding window-based method (examining dynamic FC) and k-means clustering algorithm (identifying recurring FC states over time). To define the optimum number of recurring FC states in k-means algorithm, we employed non-supervised validity criteria such as silhouette value and Dunn index over bootstrap samples. Then, we examined differences in dynamic properties of recurring FC states including probability of occurrence, lifetime and switching profile between groups. Afterward, association between impaired dynamic profile of recurring FC states and cognitive performance was assessed in AD patients. Our findings revealed three recurring FC states and among them, FC state with the most significant differences in probability of occurrence (corrected p-value &amp;lt; 0.0001) included brain regions involved in default mode, frontoparietal and salience networks. This recurring FC state occurred significantly less and lasted shorter in patients with AD than in the HC. Further, the probability of occurrence in this recurring FC state significantly correlated positively with cognitive decline in patients with AD. Our findings suggest more decreased in cognitive performance in patients with AD associated with more reduced ability of AD patients to access clinically relevant impaired brain FC networks. Impaired dynamic profile of recurring FC states in AD provide greater understanding of ADs pathophysiology.</content>

 In this pilot study, we evaluated the use of electrophysiological measures at rest as paradigm-independent predictors of L2 development for the first time in older adult learners. We then assessed EEG correlates of the learning outcome in a language-switching paradigm after the training, which to date has only been done in younger adults and at intermediate to advanced L2 proficiency. Ten (Swiss) German-speaking adults between 65-74 years of age participated in an intensive three-weeks English training for beginners. A resting-state EEG was recorded before the training to predict the ensuing L2 development (Experiment 1). A language-switching ERP experiment was conducted after the training to assess the learning outcome (Experiment 2). All participants improved their L2 skills but differed noticeably in their individual development. Experiment 1 showed that beta1 oscillations at rest (13-14.5Hz) predicted these individual differences. We interpret resting-state beta1 oscillations as correlates of attentional capacities and semantic working memory that facilitate the extraction and processing of novel forms and meanings from the L2 input. In Experiment 2, we found that language-switching from the L2 into the native language (L1) elicited an N400 component, which was reduced in the more advanced learners. Thus, for learners beginning the acquisition of an L2 in third age, language switching appears to become less effortful with increasing proficiency, suggesting that the lexicons of the L1 and L2 become more closely linked. In sum, our findings indicate that individual differences in L2 development and proficiency in older adults operate through similar electrophysiological mechanisms as those observed in younger adults.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Osmotic equilibrium and membrane potential in animal cells depend on concentration gradients of sodium (Na+) and potassium (K+) ions across the plasma membrane, a function that is catalyzed by the Na,K-ATPase 3 subunit. In vertebrates, four paralogous genes, ATP1A1-4, encode distinct alpha subunit isoforms ( 1- 4), three of which ( 1,  2,  3; are expressed in the brain, and two ( 1,  3) predominantly in neurons. The  3 isoform, encoded by ATP1A3, is critical to neuronal physiology, and a growing spectrum of neurological diseases are associated with ATP1A3 pathogenic variants, with ages of onset ranging from early childhood to adulthood. Here, we describe ATP1A3 variants encoding dysfunctional 3 subunits in children affected by polymicrogyria, a developmental malformation of the cerebral cortex characterized by abnormal folding and laminar organization. To gain cell-biological insights into the spatiotemporal dynamics of prenatal ATP1A3 expression, we established a transcriptional atlas of ATP1A3 expression during cortical development using mRNA in situ hybridization and transcriptomic profiling of ~125,000 individual cells with single-cell RNA sequencing (Drop-Seq) from various areas of the midgestational human neocortex. We find that fetal expression of ATP1A3 is restricted to a subset of excitatory neurons carrying transcriptional signatures of neuronal activity and maturation characteristic of the developing subplate. Furthermore, by performing Drop-Seq on ~52,000 nuclei from four different areas of an infant human neocortex, we show that ATP1A3 expression persists throughout early postnatal development, not only within excitatory neurons across all cortical layers, but also and more predominantly in inhibitory neurons, with specific enrichment in fast-spiking basket cells. In addition, we show that ATP1A3 expression, both in fetal and postnatal neurons, tends to be higher in frontal cortical areas than in occipital areas, in a pattern consistent with the rostro-caudal maturation gradient of the human neocortex. Finally, we discover distinct co-expression patterns linking catalytic  and {beta} ; subunit isoforms (ATP1A1,2,3) and auxiliary isoforms (ATP1B1,2,3), suggesting the ATPase pump may form non-redundant, cell-type specific alpha-beta combinations. Together, the importance of the developmental phenotypes and dynamic expression patterns of ATP1A3 point to a key role for  3 in the development and function of human cortex.</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;The amygdaloid body of two carnivore species: the feliform banded mongoose and the caniform domestic ferret&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/b2c6d6ec-0fe9-4815-b20f-5120940a12f5/cne25046-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low power photomicrographs of myelin staining in the basolateral amygdala of the banded mongoose (left) and domestic ferret (right). Note the overall lower density of myelin in the domestic ferret, which may relate to either a smaller brain mass or be an effect of the domestication process. Scale bars in each image = 1 mm.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current study provides an analysis of the cytoarchitecture, myeloarchitecture and chemoarchitecture of the amygdaloid body of the banded mongoose (&lt;i&gt;Mungos mungo&lt;/i&gt;) and domestic ferret (&lt;i&gt;Mustela putorius furo&lt;/i&gt;). Using architectural and immunohistochemical stains, we observe that the organization of the nuclear and cortical portions of the amygdaloid complex is very similar in both species. The one major difference is the presence of a cortex‐amygdala transition zone observed in the domestic ferret that is absent in the banded mongoose. In addition, the chemoarchitecture is, for the most part, quite similar in the two species, but several variances, such as differing densities of neurons expressing the calcium‐binding proteins in specific nuclei are noted. Despite this, certain aspects of the chemoarchitecture, such as the cholinergic innervation of the magnocellular division of the basal nuclear cluster and the presence of doublecortin expressing neurons in the shell division of the accessory basal nuclear cluster, appear to be consistent features of the Eutherian mammal amygdala. The domestic ferret presented with an overall lower myelin density throughout the amygdaloid body than the banded mongoose, a feature that may reflect artificial selection in the process of domestication for increased juvenile‐like behaviour in the adult domestic ferret, such as a muted fear response. The shared, but temporally distant, ancestry of the banded mongoose and domestic ferret allows us to generate observations relevant to understanding the relative influence that phylogenetic constraints, adaptive evolutionary plasticity, and the domestication process may play in the organization and chemoarchitecture of the amygdaloid body.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;The central nervous system of whip spiders (Amblypygi): Large mushroom bodies receive olfactory and visual input&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/c2f93c09-1b59-4ab4-8732-abe68fd2fd04/cne25045-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The front legs in whip spiders are modified into very long feelers (antenniform legs) equipped with sensory structures, including tens of thousands olfactory receptor neurons. Olfactory afferents terminate on hundreds of primary olfactory glomeruli in the first leg neuromere. Projection neurons relay this information to secondary olfactory glomeruli in the brain's exceptionally large mushroom bodies. The mushroom bodies also comprise thousands of considerably smaller glomeruli that receive visual information. Mushroom bodies are supposed to underlie the whip spiders' advanced multimodal navigation abilities.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whip spiders (Amblypygi) are known for their nocturnal navigational abilities, which rely on chemosensory and tactile cues and, to a lesser degree, on vision. Unlike true spiders, the first pair of legs in whip spiders is modified into extraordinarily long sensory organs (antenniform legs) covered with thousands of mechanosensory, olfactory, and gustatory sensilla. Olfactory neurons send their axons through the leg nerve into the corresponding neuromere of the central nervous system, where they terminate on a particularly large number (about 460) of primary olfactory glomeruli, suggesting an advanced sense of smell. From the primary glomeruli, olfactory projection neurons ascend to the brain and terminate in the mushroom body calyx on a set of secondary olfactory glomeruli, a feature that is not known from olfactory pathways of other animals. Another part of the calyx receives visual input from the secondary visual neuropil (the medulla). This calyx region is composed of much smaller glomeruli (“microglomeruli”). The bimodal input and the exceptional size of their mushroom bodies may support the navigational capabilities of whip spiders. In addition to input to the mushroom body, we describe other general anatomical features of the whip spiders' central nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recessive biallelic repeat expansion, (AAGGG)&lt;sub&gt;exp&lt;/sub&gt;, in the &lt;i&gt;RFC1&lt;/i&gt; gene has been reported to be a frequent cause of late‐onset ataxia. For cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy, and vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS), the recessive biallelic (AAGGG)&lt;sub&gt;exp&lt;/sub&gt; genotype was present in ~92% of cases. This study aimed to examine whether the pentanucleotide repeat (PNR) was related to multiple system atrophy (MSA), which shares a spectrum of symptoms with CANVAS.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, we screened the pathogenic (AAGGG)&lt;sub&gt;exp&lt;/sub&gt; repeat and 5 other PNRs in 104 Chinese sporadic adult‐onset ataxia of unknown aetiology (SAOA) patients, 282 MSA patients, and 203 unaffected individuals. Multiple molecular genetic tests were used, including long‐range polymerase chain reaction (PCR), repeat‐primed PCR (RP‐PCR), Sanger sequencing, and Southern blot. Comprehensive clinical assessments were conducted, including neurological examination, neuroimaging, nerve electrophysiology, and examination of vestibular function.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified biallelic (AAGGG)&lt;sub&gt;exp&lt;/sub&gt; in 1 SAOA patient and 3 MSA patients. Additionally, 1 MSA patient had the (AAGGG)&lt;sub&gt;exp&lt;/sub&gt;/(AAAGG)&lt;sub&gt;exp&lt;/sub&gt; genotype with uncertain pathogenicity. We also described the carrier frequency for different PNRs in our cohorts. Furthermore, we summarized the distinct phenotypes of affected patients, suggesting that biallelic (AAGGG)&lt;sub&gt;exp&lt;/sub&gt; in &lt;i&gt;RFC1&lt;/i&gt; could be associated with MSA and should be screened routinely in the MSA diagnostic workflow.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our results expanded the clinical phenotypic spectrum of &lt;i&gt;RFC1&lt;/i&gt;‐related disorders and raised the possibility that MSA might share the same genetic background as CANVAS, which is crucial for re‐evaluating the current CANVAS and MSA diagnostic criteria.

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Cervical dystonia (CD) is a movement disorder characterized by a stereotyped pattern of involuntary turning or tilting of the head, often combined with jerky or tremulous movements. Hypotheses for the origin of CD have traditionally focused on the basal ganglia, but the contemporary discussion has considered the potential role of altered cerebellar function. As basal ganglia and the cerebellum largely project to the different thalamic nuclei, alterations in pallidal versus cerebellar output could be reflected in the activity of these thalamic regions. In this study, we analyzed a unique historic database where the single-unit activity of pallidal and cerebellar receiving thalamic nuclei was measured en route to the mesencephalon. We compared the single-unit activity of pallidal and cerebellar receiving thalamic neurons in three groups of CD patients manifesting as pure dystonia, pure jerky head oscillations, and dystonia plus jerky head oscillations. We found that among different CD manifestations, the characteristics of neuronal firing, such as burst versus a single-spike pattern, vary in cerebellar thalamic receiving nuclei. The cerebellar receiving region in patients with jerky oscillations had single-spikes neurons primarily. Wherein the manifestation of CD did not influence pattern distribution in the pallidal receiving thalamic area. We also found increased neuronal firing rate correlated with strength of theta-band neuronal oscillations during muscle contractions associated with dystonia. These results demonstrate that the manifestations of CD, such as pure dystonia, pure jerky head oscillations, or dystonia and jerky head oscillations, determine the thalamic neuronal properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;A 50-year-old patient was admitted with symptoms of intracranial hypotension. MRI revealed a cervical myelomalacia caused by engorged epidural veins leading to a stenosis of the spinal canal. This condition is rarely described in patients with hydrocephalus and ventricular shunts suffering from chronic overdrainage. However, the reason in this patient was a CSF leak caused by an intradural disc herniation at T12/L1. After surgery, symptoms resolved and the cervical &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus emphasis type-underline&quot;&gt;myelomalacia&lt;/span&gt; and the swollen epidural veins disappeared on postoperative MRI.
      In patients with engorged cervical epidural veins without a ventricular shunt, a CSF leak has to be considered.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

The results of six randomized clinical trials including five different monoclonal antibodies targeting four molecules and three distinct pathophysiological pathways have recently been published.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Literature search on clinical trials and case studies in NMOSD up to July 10. 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We review mechanism of action, efficacy and side effects, and consequences for reproductive health from traditional immunosuppressants and monoclonal antibodies including rituximab, inebilizumab, eculizumab, tocilizumab and satralizumab.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;In NMOSD patients with antibodies against aquaporin 4, monoclonal antibodies that deplete B cells (rituximab and inebilizumab) or interfere with interleukin 6 signaling (tocilizumab and satralizumab) or complement activation (eculizumab) have superior efficacy compared to placebo. Tocilizumab and rituximab were also superior to azathioprine in head-to-head studies. Rituximab, tocilizumab and to some extent eculizumab have well-known safety profiles for other inflammatory diseases, and rituximab and azathioprine may be safe during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec1&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;There are no effective symptomatic treatments for progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). Recent studies report benefits of spinal cord stimulation (SCS) for freezing of gait (FOG) and gait disorders in Parkinson’s disease and atypical Parkinsonism patients. This is the first study to report therapeutic effects of SCS in Richardson’s syndrome PSP (PSP-RS) patients.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Epidural SCS was implanted in three female PSP-RS participants (3.2 ± 1.3 years with disease). Six programs (300–400 µs/30–130 Hz) were randomly tested at suprathreshold intensity on separate days. The setting that best improved gait/FOG was used daily by each participant in the study. Protokinetics walkway captured spatiotemporal gait measures and FOG episodes (turning on the spot and while walking) and clinical scales including FOG questionnaire, UPDRS-III (OFF-/ON-&lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus emphasis type-small-caps&quot;&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-dopa), and participant-perceived global impression of change (GISC) were collected at pre-SCS, and 3, 6, 12 months post-SCS.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Participant #1 demonstrated the highest GISC score (6.5/10) with a consistent reduction of FOGs by 43.8%, UPDRS-III score (− 5 points), and improved step length and stride velocity (33.6%) while maintaining a &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus emphasis type-small-caps&quot;&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-dopa response of ~ 12% over the 12 months. Participant #2, walking FOG frequency and turning duration was reduced by 39.0% (OFF-&lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus emphasis type-small-caps&quot;&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-dopa), and ON-&lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus emphasis type-small-caps&quot;&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-dopa UPDRS-III score worsened (+ 5 points) at 12 months. Participant #3, FOG frequency reduced by 75% up to 6 months rating a GISC 3/10 score, however disease severity worsened at 12 months. Ambulatory gait parameters universally improved by 29.6% in all participants.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The results support the benefit of SCS for FOG and gait symptoms in PSP-RS and suggests early SCS intervention for dopaminergic-resistant gait should be considered.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Snakes have proven to drive early attentional capture due to their evolutionary importance, as reflected by the early posterior negativity (EPN). The EPN snake effect might be partly driven by the proximity of the animal. In this study, by employing full-body (medium shot) and head-focused (close-up) pictures, we investigated whether the relative nearness (proximity) of the animal on the picture affects the snake EPN effect. We presented thirty participants with medium shot and close-up snake, spider and bird pictures in a rapid serial presentation paradigm at a presentation rate of three frames per second. We extracted the mean EPN activity from the 225–330 ms time frame after stimulus onset at the parietal–occipital cluster (PO3, O1, Oz, O2, PO4). The results indicate enhanced EPN for snake pictures as compared to spider and bird pictures. In addition, medium-shot snake pictures elicited higher EPN amplitudes than close-up snake pictures, suggesting that the EPN is higher when local, high spatial frequency attributes are visible. Spatial frequency analysis of the stimuli indicated that medium-shot snake pictures possess more power in the high spatial frequency bands, compared to medium-shot spider and bird pictures.

Deep feedforward neural network models of vision dominate in both computational neuroscience and engineering. The primate visual system, by contrast, contains abundant recurrent connections. Recurrent signal flow enables recycling of limited computational resources over time, and so might boost the performance of a physically finite brain or model. Here we show: (1) Recurrent convolutional neural network models outperform feedforward convolutional models matched in their number of parameters in large-scale visual recognition tasks on natural images. (2) Setting a confidence threshold, at which recurrent computations terminate and a decision is made, enables flexible trading of speed for accuracy. At a given confidence threshold, the model expends more time and energy on images that are harder to recognise, without requiring additional parameters for deeper computations. (3) The recurrent model’s reaction time for an image predicts the human reaction time for the same image better than several parameter-matched and state-of-the-art feedforward models. (4) Across confidence thresholds, the recurrent model emulates the behaviour of feedforward control models in that it achieves the same accuracy at approximately the same computational cost (mean number of floating-point operations). However, the recurrent model can be run longer (higher confidence threshold) and then outperforms parameter-matched feedforward comparison models. These results suggest that recurrent connectivity, a hallmark of biological visual systems, may be essential for understanding the accuracy, flexibility, and dynamics of human visual recognition.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/O-ZEKwc_nYY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Uncovering the underlying biophysical principles of emergent collective computational abilities, such as working memory, in neural circuits is one of the most essential concerns in modern neuroscience. Working memory system is often desired to be robust against noises. Such systems can be highly flexible for adapting environmental demands. How neural circuits reconfigure themselves according to the cognitive task requirement remains unclear. Previous studies explored the robustness and the flexibility in working memory by tracing individual dynamical trajectories in a limited time scale, where the accuracy of the results depends on the volume of the collected statistical data. Inspired by thermodynamics and statistical mechanics in physical systems, we developed a non-equilibrium landscape and flux framework for studying the neural network dynamics. Applying this approach to a biophysically based working memory model, we investigated how changes in the recurrent excitation mediated by slow NMDA receptors within a selective population and mutual inhibition mediated by GABAergic interneurons between populations affect the robustness against noises. This is realized through quantifying the underlying non-equilibrium potential landscape topography and the kinetics of state switching. We found that an optimal compromise for a working memory circuit between the robustness and the flexibility can be achieved through the emergence of an intermediate state between the working memory states. An optimal combination of both increased self-excitation and inhibition can enhance the flexibility to external signals without significantly reducing the robustness to the random fluctuations. Furthermore, we found that the enhanced performance in working memory is supported by larger energy consumption. Our approach can facilitate the design of new network structure for cognitive functions with the optimal balance between performance and cost. Our work also provides a new paradigm for exploring the underlying mechanisms of many cognitive functions based on non-equilibrium physics.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/1_XeN3HW1Lw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

The complement system is a powerful mechanism of innate immunity poised to eliminate foreign cells and pathogens. It is an intricate network of &amp;gt;35 proteins, which, once activated, leads to the tagging of the surface to be eliminated, produces potent chemoattractants to recruit immune cells, and inserts cytotoxic pores into nearby lipid surfaces. Although it can be triggered via different pathways, its net output is largely based on the direct or indirect activation of the alternative pathway. Complement dysregulation or deficiencies may cause severe pathologies, such as paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), where a lack of complement control proteins leads to hemolysis and life-threatening anemia. The complexity of the system poses a challenge for the interpretation of experimental data and the design of effective pharmacological therapies. To address this issue, we developed a mathematical model of the alternative complement pathway building on previous modelling efforts. The model links complement activation to the hemolytic activity of the terminal alternative pathway, providing an accurate description of pathway activity as observed in vitro and in vivo, in health and disease. Through adjustment of the parameters describing experimental conditions, the model was capable of reproducing the results of an array of standard assays used in complement research. To demonstrate its clinical applicability, we compared model predictions with clinical observations of the recovery of hematological biomarkers in PNH patients treated with the complement inhibiting anti-C5 antibody eculizumab. In conclusion, the model can enhance the understanding of complement biology and its role in disease pathogenesis, help identifying promising targets for pharmacological intervention, and predict the outcome of complement-targeting pharmacological interventions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/oAxIvuJpFf8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Metastases are the main reason for cancer-related deaths. Initiation of metastases, where newly seeded tumor cells expand into colonies, presents a tremendous bottleneck to metastasis formation. Despite its importance, a quantitative description of metastasis initiation and its clinical implications is lacking. Here, we set theoretical grounds for the metastatic bottleneck with a simple stochastic model. The model assumes that the proliferation-to-death rate ratio for the initiating metastatic cells increases when they are surrounded by more of their kind. For a total of 159,191 patients across 13 cancer types, we found that a single cell has an extremely low median probability of successful seeding of the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt;. With increasing colony size, a sharp transition from very unlikely to very likely successful metastasis initiation occurs. The median metastatic bottleneck, defined as the critical colony size that marks this transition, was between 10 and 21 cells. We derived the probability of metastasis occurrence and patient outcome based on primary tumor size at diagnosis and tumor type. The model predicts that the efficacy of patient treatment depends on the primary tumor size but even more so on the severity of the metastatic bottleneck, which is estimated to largely vary between patients. We find that medical interventions aiming at tightening the bottleneck, such as immunotherapy, can be much more efficient than therapies that decrease overall tumor burden, such as chemotherapy.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-3xBb9QVb78&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has created an unprecedented need for rapid diagnostic testing. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a standard assay that includes an RNA extraction step from a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab followed by reverse transcription–quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) to detect the purified SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The current global shortage of RNA extraction kits has caused a severe bottleneck to COVID-19 testing. The goal of this study was to determine whether SARS-CoV-2 RNA could be detected from NP samples via a direct RT-qPCR assay that omits the RNA extraction step altogether. The direct RT-qPCR approach correctly identified 92% of a reference set of blinded NP samples (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 155) demonstrated to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by traditional clinical diagnostic RT-qPCR that included an RNA extraction. Importantly, the direct method had sufficient sensitivity to reliably detect those patients with viral loads that correlate with the presence of infectious virus. Thus, this strategy has the potential to ease supply choke points to substantially expand COVID-19 testing and screening capacity and should be applicable throughout the world.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/wb1ocz_B5Hc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report natural history data in a large cohort of 199 patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) type III assessed using the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded (HFMSE). The aim of the study was to establish the annual rate and possible patterns of progression according to a number of variables, such as age of onset, age at assessment, &lt;i&gt;SMN2&lt;/i&gt; copy number, and functional status.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HFMSE longitudinal changes were assessed using piecewise linear mixed‐effects models. The dependency in the data due to repeated measures was accounted for by a random intercept per individual and an unstructured covariance R matrix was used as correlation structure. An additional descriptive analysis was performed for 123 patients, for a total of 375 12‐month assessments.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A break point at age 7 years was set for the whole cohort and for SMA IIIA and IIIB. Age, SMA type, and ambulatory status were significantly associated with changes in mean HFMSE score, whereas gender and &lt;i&gt;SMN2&lt;/i&gt; copy number were not. The increase in response before the break point of age 7 years is significant only for SMA IIIA (β = 1.79, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001). After the break point, the change in the rate of HFMSE score significantly decrease for both SMA IIIA (β = −1.15, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001) and IIIB (β = −0.69, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.002).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our findings contribute to the understanding of the natural history of SMA type III and will be helpful in the interpretation of the real‐world data of patients treated with commercially available drugs. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;h2&gt;Purpose&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In acute ischemic stroke with unknown time of onset, magnetic resonance (MR)‐based diffusion‐weighted imaging (DWI) and fluid‐attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) estimates lesion age to guide intravenous thrombolysis. Computed tomography (CT)‐based quantitative net water uptake (NWU) may be a potential alternative. The purpose of this study was to directly compare CT‐based NWU to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at identifying patients with lesion age &amp;lt; 4.5 hours from symptom onset.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifty patients with acute anterior circulation stroke were analyzed with both imaging modalities at admission between 0.5 and 8.0 hours after known symptom onset. DWI‐FLAIR lesion mismatch was rated and NWU was measured in admission CT. An established NWU threshold (11.5%) was used to classify patients within and beyond 4.5 hours. Multiparametric MRI signal was compared with NWU using logistic regression analyses. The empirical distribution of NWU was analyzed in a consecutive cohort of patients with wake‐up stroke.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The median time between CT and MRI was 35 minutes (interquartile range [IQR] = 24–50). The accuracy of DWI‐FLAIR mismatch was 68.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 53.7–81.3%) with a sensitivity of 58% and specificity of 82%. The accuracy of NWU threshold was 86.0% (95% CI = 73.3–94.2%) with a sensitivity of 91% and specificity of 78%. The area under the curve (AUC) of multiparametric MRI signal to classify lesion age &amp;lt;4.5 hours was 0.86 (95% CI = 0.64–0.97), and the AUC of quantitative NWU was 0.91 (95% CI = 0.78–0.98). Among 87 patients with wake‐up stroke, 46 patients (53%) showed low NWU (&amp;lt; 11.5%).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The predictive power of CT‐based lesion water imaging to identify patients within the time window of thrombolysis was comparable to multiparametric DWI‐FLAIR MRI. A significant proportion of patients with wake‐up stroke exhibit low NWU and may therefore be potentially suitable for thrombolysis. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perirolandic atrophy occurs in corticobasal syndrome (CBS) but is not specific versus progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). There is heterogeneity in the locations of atrophy outside the perirolandic cortex and it remains unknown why atrophy in different locations would cause the same CBS‐specific symptoms. In prior work, we used a wiring diagram of the brain called the human connectome to localize lesion‐induced disorders to symptom‐specific brain networks. Here, we use a similar technique termed “atrophy network mapping” to localize single‐subject atrophy maps to symptom‐specific brain networks.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single‐subject atrophy maps were generated by comparing cortical thickness in patients with CBS versus controls. Next, we performed seed‐based functional connectivity using a large normative connectome to determine brain regions functionally connected to each patient's atrophied locations.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients with CBS had perirolandic atrophy versus controls at the group level, but locations of atrophy in CBS were heterogeneous outside of the perirolandic cortex at the single‐subject level (mean spatial correlation = 0.04). In contrast, atrophy occurred in locations functionally connected to the perirolandic cortex in all patients with CBS (spatial correlation = 0.66). Compared with PSP, patients with CBS had atrophy connected to a network of higher‐order sensorimotor regions beyond perirolandic cortex, matching a CBS atrophy network from a recent meta‐analysis. Finally, atrophy network mapping identified a symptom‐specific network for alien limb, matching a lesion‐induced alien limb network and a network associated with agency in healthy subjects.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified a syndrome‐specific network for CBS and symptom‐specific network for alien limb using single‐subject atrophy maps and the human connectome. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Role of β3‐adrenergic receptor in the modulation of synaptic transmission and plasticity in mouse cerebellar cortex&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/c4aaaad2-75c6-4dcf-a5b4-4e99acaa808b/jnr24712-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The present study is the first to investigate the localization and function of β3‐adrenoreceptor (AR) in the mouse cerebellum. The immunohistochemical analysis allowed us to demonstrate that β3‐AR is mainly expressed on Purkinje cells. In addition, we found that blocking β3‐AR interfered with motor learning and synaptic plasticity at the parallel fiber–Purkinje cell. The molecular mechanisms underlying the β3‐AR action are likely related to the activation of the PI3K signaling pathway in Purkinje cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Convergent lines of evidence have recently highlighted β3‐adrenoreceptors (ARs) as a potentially critical target in the regulation of nervous and behavioral functions, including memory consolidation, anxiety, and depression. Nevertheless, the role of β3‐ARs in the cerebellum has been never investigated. To address this issue, we first examined the effects of pharmacological manipulation of β3‐ARs on motor learning in mice. We found that blockade of β3‐ARs by SR 59230A impaired the acquisition of the rotarod task with no effect on general locomotion. Since the parallel fiber–Purkinje cell (PF–PC) synapse is considered to be the main cerebellar locus of motor learning, we assessed β3‐AR modulatory action on this synapse as well as its expression in cerebellar slices. We demonstrate, for the first time, a strong expression of β3‐ARs on Purkinje cell soma and dendrites. In addition, whole‐cell patch‐clamp recordings revealed that bath application of β3‐AR agonist CL316,243 depressed the PF–PC excitatory postsynaptic currents via a postsynaptic mechanism mediated by the PI3K signaling pathway. Application of CL316,243 also interfered with the expression of PF long‐term potentiation, whereas SR 59230A prevented the induction of LTD at PF–PC synapse. These results underline the critical role of β3‐AR on cerebellar synaptic transmission and plasticity and provide a new mechanism for adrenergic modulation of motor learning.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Mechanisms underlying the enhancement of γ‐aminobutyric acid responses in the external globus pallidus of R6/2 Huntington’s disease model mice&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/f377046c-4556-4d82-b405-6d28b4ef52a9/jnr24710-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;γ‐aminobutyric acid (GABA) responses evoked by selective stimulation of indirect pathway striatal neurons are increased in the external globus pallidus (GPe) of R6/2 mice. Using electrophysiology, optogenetics, immunohistochemistry and Western blots we demonstrate that GABA transporter, GAT‐3 function is reduced. This could explain increased decay time of evoked responses in the GPe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Huntington's disease (HD), the output of striatal indirect pathway medium‐sized spiny neurons (MSNs) is altered in its target region, the external globus pallidus (GPe). In a previous study we demonstrated that selective optogenetic stimulation of indirect pathway MSNs induced prolonged decay time of γ‐aminobutyric acid (GABA) responses in GPe neurons. Here we identified the mechanism underlying this alteration. Electrophysiological recordings in slices from symptomatic R6/2 and wildtype (WT) mice were used to evaluate, primarily, the effects of GABA transporter (GAT) antagonists on responses evoked by optogenetic activation of indirect pathway MSNs. In addition, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Western blots (WBs) were used to examine GAT‐3 expression in HD and WT mice. A GAT‐3 blocker (SNAP5114) increased decay time of GABA responses in WT and HD GPe neurons, but the effect was significantly greater in WT neurons. In contrast, a GAT‐1 antagonist (NO‐711) or a GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; receptor antagonist (CGP 54626) produced small increases in decay time but no differential effects between genotypes. IHC and WBs showed reduction of GAT‐3 expression in the GPe of HD mice. Thus, reduced expression or dysfunction of GAT‐3 could underlie alterations of GPe responses to GABA inputs from striatum and could be a target for therapeutic intervention.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Role of peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptors (PPARs) in the pathophysiology of stroke and protective effects of PPAR ligands have been widely investigated in the last 20 years. Activation of all three PPAR isoforms, but especially PPAR‐γ, was documented to limit postischemic injury in the numerous &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, as well as in &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; studies. PPARs have been demonstrated to act on multiple mechanisms and were shown to activate multiple protective pathways related to inflammation, apoptosis, BBB protection, neurogenesis, and oxidative stress. The aim of this review was to summarize two decades of PPAR research in stroke with emphasis on &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; animal studies. We focus on each PPAR receptor separately and detail their implication in stroke. This review also discusses recent clinical efforts in the field and the epidemiological data with regard to role of PPAR polymorphisms in susceptibility to stroke, and tries to draw conclusions and describe future perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Melatonin alters neuronal architecture and increases cysteine‐rich protein 1 signaling in the male mouse hippocampus&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/0aec9295-07a8-415c-a143-0195472ed973/jnr24708-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exogenous melatonin significantly alters hippocampal neuronal micromorphometry, increases cysteine‐rich protein 1 (crp‐1) expression, and improves memory retention in mice. These findings expand our knowledge about the beneficial effects of melatonin on hippocampal neurons, and implicates alterations of structural neuroplasticity and crp‐1 upregulation as possible key players in this process of cognitive function improvement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neuronal plasticity describes changes in structure, function, and connections of neurons. The hippocampus, in particular, has been shown to exhibit considerable plasticity regarding both physiological and morphological functions. Melatonin, a hormone released by the pineal gland, promotes cell survival and dendrite maturation of neurons in the newborn brain and protects against neurological disorders. In this study, we investigated the effect of exogenous melatonin on neuronal architecture and its possible mechanism in the hippocampus of adult male C57BL/6 mice. Melatonin treatment significantly increased the total length and complexity of dendrites in the apical and basal &lt;i&gt;cornu ammonis&lt;/i&gt; (CA) 1 and in the dentate gyrus in mouse hippocampi. Spine density in CA1 apical dendrites was increased, but no significant differences in other subregions were observed. In primary cultured hippocampal neurons, the length and arborization of neurites were significantly augmented by melatonin treatment. Additionally, western blot and immunohistochemical analyses in both &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; systems revealed significant increases in the level of cysteine‐rich protein 1 (crp‐1) protein, which is known to be involved in dendritic branching in mouse hippocampal neurons after melatonin treatment. Our results suggest that exogenous melatonin leads to significant alterations of neuronal micromorphometry in the adult hippocampus, possibly via crp‐1 signaling.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Quantification of aromatase binding in the female human brain using [11C]cetrozole positron emission tomography&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/f4a4bc0d-59f4-4b35-bfd4-0cdcf58e1084/jnr24707-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quantification of the binding of [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]cetrozole to aromatase in the brain is best done using the two‐tissue reversible compartment model, or the simplified reference tissue model with the cerebellum as reference region. Receptor parametric mapping and Logan reference tissue model are suitable for parametric mapping. One hour of data acquisition is sufficient for the quantification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aromatase, the enzyme that in the brain converts testosterone and androstenedione to estradiol and estrone, respectively, is a putative key factor in psychoneuroendocrinology. &lt;i&gt;In vivo&lt;/i&gt; assessment of aromatase was performed to evaluate tracer kinetic models and optimal scan duration, for quantitative analysis of the aromatase positron emission tomography (PET) ligand [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]cetrozole. Anatomical magnetic resonance and 90‐min dynamic [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]cetrozole PET‐CT scans were performed on healthy women. Volume of interest (VOI)‐based analyses with a plasma‐input function were performed using the single‐tissue and two‐tissue (2TCM) reversible compartment models and plasma‐input Logan analysis. Additionally, the simplified reference tissue model (SRTM), Logan reference tissue model (LRTM), and standardized uptake volume ratio model, with cerebellum as reference region, were evaluated. Parametric images were generated and regionally averaged voxel values were compared with VOI‐based analyses of the reference tissue models. The optimal reference model was used for evaluation of a decreased scan duration. Differences between the plasma‐input‐ and reference tissue‐based methods and comparisons between scan durations were assessed by linear regression. The [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]cetrozole time–activity curves were best described by the 2TCM. SRTM nondisplaceable binding potential (BP&lt;sub&gt;ND&lt;/sub&gt;), with cerebellum as reference region, can be used to estimate [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]cetrozole binding and generated robust and quantitatively accurate results for a reduced scan duration of 60 min. Receptor parametric mapping, a basis function implementation of SRTM, as well as LRTM, produced quantitatively accurate parametric images, showing BP&lt;sub&gt;ND&lt;/sub&gt; at the voxel level.

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Insulin deficiency, but not resistance, exaggerates cognitive deficits in transgenic mice expressing human amyloid and tau proteins. Reversal by Exendin‐4 treatment&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/950831d0-aede-4425-a43f-45442741700c/jnr24706-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insulin deficiency, rather than insulin resistance, induces AD‐like features in wild type and transgenic mice carrying amyloid β and tau genes. Treatment with Exendin‐4 ameliorates these features in an intervention paradigm when deficits were already present, reflecting the more likely scenario when patients will consult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epidemiological studies have pointed at diabetes as a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and this has been supported by several studies in animal models of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. However, side‐by‐side comparison of the two types of diabetes is limited. We investigated the role of insulin deficiency and insulin resistance in the development of memory impairments and the effect of Exendin‐4 (Ex4) treatment in a mouse model of AD. Three–4‐month‐old female wild type (WT) mice and mice overexpressing human tau and amyloid precursor protein (TAPP) were injected with streptozotocin (STZ) or fed a high‐fat diet (HFD). A second study was performed in TAPP‐STZ mice treated with Ex4, a long‐lasting analog of GLP‐1. Plasma and brain were collected at study termination for ELISA, Western blot, and immunohistochemistry analysis. Learning and memory deficits were impaired in TAPP transgenic mice compared with WT mice at the end of the study. Deficits were exaggerated by insulin deficiency in TAPP mice but 12 weeks of insulin resistance did not affect memory performances in either WT or TAPP mice. Levels of phosphorylated tau were increased in the brain of WT‐STZ and TAPP‐STZ mice but not in the brain of WT or TAPP mice on HFD. In the TAPP‐STZ mice, treatment with Ex4 initiated after established cognitive deficits ameliorated learning, but not memory, impairments. This was accompanied by the reduction of amyloid β and phosphorylated tau expression. Theses studies support the role of Ex4 in AD, independently from its actions on diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Investigation of the effect of dietary intake of omega‐3 polyunsaturated fatty acids on trauma‐induced white matter injury with quantitative diffusion MRI in mice&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/12ea5afd-5447-47db-be3d-5167b35c05db/jnr24705-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We investigated potential neuroprotective effects of dietary omega‐3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) on white matter damage following closed‐head injury in mice. While injured animals exhibited reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) in the optic tract and brachium compared to the uninjured animals, there was no evidence of neuroprotection from dietary omega‐3 PUFAs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous studies suggest that long‐term supplementation and dietary intake of omega‐3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) may have neuroprotective effects following brain injury. The objective of this study was to investigate potential neuroprotective effects of omega‐3 PUFAs on white matter following closed‐head trauma. The closed‐head injury model of engineered rotational acceleration (CHIMERA) produces a reproducible injury in the optic tract and brachium of the superior colliculus in mice. Damage is detectable using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics, particularly fractional anisotropy (FA), with sensitivity comparable to histology. We acquired &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 38) and &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 41) DTI data in mice divided into sham and CHIMERA groups with two dietary groups: one deficient in omega‐3 PUFAs and one adequate in omega‐3 PUFAs. We examined injury effects (reduction in FA) and neuroprotection (FA reduction modulated by diet) in the optic tract and brachium. We verified that diet did not affect FA in sham animals. In injured animals, we found significantly reduced FA in the optic tract and brachium (~10% reduction, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001), and Bayes factor analysis showed strong evidence to reject the null hypothesis. However, Bayes factor analysis showed substantial evidence to accept the null hypothesis of no diet‐related FA differences in injured animals in the &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; samples. Our results indicate no neuroprotective effect from adequate dietary omega‐3 PUFA intake on white matter damage following traumatic brain injury. Since damage from CHIMERA mainly affects white matter, our results do not necessarily contradict previous findings showing omega‐3 PUFA‐mediated neuroprotection in gray matter.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Neuroanatomy of transgender persons in a Non‐Western population and improving reliability in clinical neuroimaging&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/9be9bef8-9612-4aeb-a0d6-c59db828e9df/jnr24702-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study assesses the reproducibility of previous neuroanatomical findings in Western transgender persons in a Non‐Western population. It then shows that repeating an anatomical MRI sequence can increase data reliability especially in brain regions that have previously been implicated to differ between transgender and cisgender persons. This &lt;i&gt;scan–rescan&lt;/i&gt; method might enhance the power of studies with small samples due to low prevalence of target population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the neuroanatomy of transgender persons is slowly being charted, findings are presently discrepant. Moreover, the major body of work has focused on Western populations. One important factor is the issue of power and low signal‐to‐noise (SNR) ratio in neuroimaging studies of rare study populations including endocrine or neurological patient groups. The present study focused on the structural neuroanatomy of a Non‐Western (Iranian) sample of 40 transgender men (TM), 40 transgender women (TW), 30 cisgender men (CM), and 30 cisgender women (CW), while assessing whether the reliability of findings across structural anatomical measures including gray matter volume (GMV), cortical surface area (CSA), and cortical thickness (CTh) could be increased by using two back‐to‐back within‐session structural MRI scans. Overall, findings in transgender persons were more consistent with sex assigned at birth in GMV and CSA, while no group differences emerged for CTh. Repeated measures analysis also indicated that having a second scan increased SNR in all regions of interest, most notably bilateral frontal poles, pre‐ and postcentral gyri and putamina. The results suggest that a simple time and cost‐effective measure to improve SNR in rare clinical populations with low prevalence rates is a second anatomical scan when structural MRI is of interest.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Toward quantitative neuroimaging biomarkers for Friedreich's ataxia at 7 Tesla: Susceptibility mapping, diffusion imaging, R2 and R1 relaxometry&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/220e1312-d799-4d4e-a584-4d3ebf3dee91/jnr24701-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quantitative 7 Tesla MRI (susceptibility, relaxation, fractional anisotropy) found differences between ten Friedreich's ataxia patients and matched healthy controls in eight structures of brainstem and cerebellum which correlated with disease characteristics. Voxel‐based morphometry revealed white matter atrophy in partially overlapping volumes of interest (VOI) used for the VOI‐based evaluation. *Statistically significant differences between patients and controls; middle cerebellar peduncle (MCP), pontine crossing tract (PCT), corticospinal tract (CS), medial lemniscus (ML), inferior cerebellar peduncle (ICP), superior cerebellar peduncle (SCP), cerebral peduncle (CP), posterior thalamic radiation (PTR), sagittal stratum (SS), dentate nuclei (DN), red nuclei (RN), substantia nigra (SN).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is a rare genetic disorder leading to degenerative processes. So far, no effective treatment has been found. Therefore, it is important to assist the development of medication with imaging biomarkers reflecting disease status and progress. Ten FRDA patients (mean age 37 ± 14 years; four female) and 10 age‐ and sex‐matched controls were included. Acquisition of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data for quantitative susceptibility mapping, &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; relaxometry and diffusion imaging was performed at 7 Tesla. Results of volume of interest (VOI)‐based analyses of the quantitative data were compared with a voxel‐based morphometry (VBM) evaluation. Differences between patients and controls were assessed using the analysis of covariance (ANCOVA; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01) with age and sex as covariates, effect size of group differences, and correlations with disease characteristics with Spearman correlation coefficient. For the VBM analysis, a statistical threshold of 0.001 for uncorrected and 0.05 for corrected &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;‐values was used. Statistically significant differences between FRDA patients and controls were found in five out of twelve investigated structures, and statistically significant correlations with disease characteristics were revealed. Moreover, VBM revealed significant white matter atrophy within regions of the brainstem, and the cerebellum. These regions overlapped partially with brain regions for which significant differences between healthy controls and patients were found in the VOI‐based quantitative MRI evaluation. It was shown that two independent analyses provided overlapping results. Moreover, positive results on correlations with disease characteristics were found, indicating that these quantitative MRI parameters could provide more detailed information and assist the search for effective treatments.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Central nervous system‐infiltrated immune cells induce calcium increase in astrocytes via astroglial purinergic signaling&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/f4d5b155-7dba-48a1-bc0d-01dbf95a13a6/jnr24699-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Application of the central nervous system (CNS)‐infiltrated immune cells induces a rapid increase in intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in cultured naïve astrocytes through glial purinergic receptor‐mediated signaling. This provides an insight into the astroglial response to the immune cells in their local environment in CNS autoimmunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interaction between autoreactive immune cells and astroglia is an important part of the pathologic processes that fuel neurodegeneration in multiple sclerosis. In this inflammatory disease, immune cells enter into the central nervous system (CNS) and they spread through CNS parenchyma, but the impact of these autoreactive immune cells on the activity pattern of astrocytes has not been defined. By exploiting naïve astrocytes in culture and CNS‐infiltrated immune cells (CNS IICs) isolated from rat with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), here we demonstrate previously unrecognized properties of immune cell–astrocyte interaction. We show that CNS IICs but not the peripheral immune cell application, evokes a rapid and vigorous intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; increase in astrocytes by promoting glial release of ATP. ATP propagated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; elevation through glial purinergic P2X7 receptor activation by the hemichannel‐dependent nucleotide release mechanism. Astrocyte Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; increase is specifically triggered by the autoreactive CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T‐cell application and these two cell types exhibit close spatial interaction in EAE. Therefore, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals may mediate a rapid astroglial response to the autoreactive immune cells in their local environment. This property of immune cell–astrocyte interaction may be important to consider in studies interrogating CNS autoimmune disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;The role of nucleus accumbens CREB attenuation in rescuing low voluntary running behavior in female rats&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/3e1d9b59-c935-4f2e-9c9f-76ea3bbe3568/jnr24698-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) was evaluated for its role in physical activity motivation of wild‐type (WT) and low voluntary wheel‐running (LVR) rats. Elevated CREB activity has been associated with reward deficits and was found to be higher in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) of LVR rats. Reducing NAc activity through Gi‐DREADDs, pharmacology (C646/SR11302), and environmental enrichment increased LVR wheel‐running behavior. These findings highlight a potential molecular pathway important for the motivation to be physically active.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the integral role of nucleus accumbens (NAc) cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) activity in motivational processes, the goal of the current study was to determine whether blunting chronic NAc CREB activity could rescue the low physical activity motivation of female, low voluntary running (LVR) rats. NAc CREB phosphorylation is elevated in these rats, a state previously attributed to deficits in reward valuation. It was recently shown that overexpression of the upstream CREB inhibitor, protein kinase inhibitor alpha (PKIα), increased LVR nightly running by ~threefold. Therefore, the current study addresses the extent to which NAc CREB attenuation influences female LVR and wild‐type (WT) wheel‐running behavior. Inducible reductions in NAc neuronal activity using Gi‐coupled hM4Di DREADDs increased running behavior in LVR, but not in WT, rats. Similarly, site‐directed pharmacological inhibition of NAc CREB activity significantly increased LVR nightly running distance and time by ~twofold, with no effect in WT rats. Finally, environmentally enriched LVR rats exhibit higher levels of running compared to socially isolated rats in what appeared to be a CREB‐related manner. Considering the positive outcomes of upstream CREB modulation and environmental enrichment on LVR behavior, we believe that blunting NAc CREB activity has the neuromolecular potential to partially reverse low physical activity motivation, as exemplified by the LVR model. The positive physical activity outcome of early life enrichment adds translatable value to human childhood enrichment and highlights its importance on motivational processes later in life.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Plasma endothelial microvesicles and their carrying miRNA‐155 serve as biomarkers for ischemic stroke&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/5d4fcaf4-11b1-4668-a262-fc5c75fc4a70/jnr24696-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our population study found that the area under ROC curve (AUC) of plasma endothelial microvesicles (EMVs) and EMVs‐miR‐155 levels in ischemic stroke (IS) was 0.778 (sensitivity 85.9% and specificity 58%) and 0.851 (sensitivity 75% and specificity 81.2%), respectively, and AUC of their combination was 0.892 (sensitivity 75% and specificity 91.3%). Our study suggests that plasma EMVs and EMVs‐miR‐155 levels are promising biomarkers for IS. The diagnostic value of EMVs‐miR‐155 is higher and their combination is the best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Endothelial microvesicles (EMVs) could reflect the status of endothelial cells (ECs) which are involved in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke (IS). MiR‐155 could regulate EC functions. However, their roles in IS remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the levels of plasma EMVs and EMVs carrying miRNA‐155 (EMVs‐miR‐155) in IS patients to explore their potential roles as biomarkers. Ninety‐three IS patients and 70 controls were recruited in this study. The levels of circulating EMVs and EMVs‐miR‐155 were detected by fluorescence nanoparticle tracking analysis and quantitative real‐time PCR, respectively. The correlations between level of EMVs/EMVs‐miR‐155 and the onset time, severity, infarct volume, and subtypes of IS were analyzed. The severity and infarct volume were assessed by NIHSS and magnetic resonance imaging, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to investigate the risk factors of IS. The ROC curve and area under ROC curve (AUC) of EMVs and EMVs‐miR‐155 were determined. The levels of plasma EMVs and EMVs‐miR‐155 were increased significantly in acute and subacute stages of IS and remained unchanged in chronic stage, and were positively related to the infarct volume and NIHSS scores and were associated with large artery atherosclerosis and cardioembolism subtypes defined by Trial of Org 10 172 in acute stroke treatment (TOAST) classification. Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that plasma EMVs and EMVs‐miR‐155 were significant and independent risk factors of IS and their AUC were 0.778 and 0.851, respectively, and increased to 0.892 after combination. Our study suggests that plasma EMVs and EMVs‐miR‐155 are promising biomarkers for IS. The diagnostic value of EMVs‐miR‐155 is higher and their combination is the best.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;CB1R knockout mice showed decreased neuronal dendritic arborization and changes in synaptic structure, as such as lower thickness of postsynaptic density and a reduction in synaptophysin levels in hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1R) modulates synaptic activity and is widely distributed in brain areas such as the hippocampus, cerebellum, cerebral cortex, and striatum, among others. CB1R is involved in processes such as memory, learning, motor coordination, and mood. Genetic deletion of CB1R causes behavioral alterations. In this work, we evaluated neuronal morphology and synaptic structure in the hippocampus of adult male CB1R knockout mice (CB1R&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt;). Morphological changes in the CB1R&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; hippocampus evidenced a decrease in the expression of cytoskeletal proteins neurofilaments 160 KDa, neurofilaments 200 KDa, and microtubule‐associated protein 2. CA1 neurons showed decreased arborization and changes in synaptic structure such as lower thickness of postsynaptic density and a reduction in synaptophysin levels. Results obtained in the present work provide evidence of the participation of CB1R in the establishment of neuronal structure and networks that could have an important role in neuronal plasticity. In addition, these changes observed in CB1R&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; could be correlated with behavioral alterations reported.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;Graphical representation of presented data also showing RhoGTPase regulators that localize to nascent synapses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excitatory synapse formation begins in mid‐fetal gestation. However, due to our inability to image fetal synaptogenesis, the initial formation of synapses remains understudied. The recent development of human fetal brain spheroids provides access to this critical period of synapse formation. Using human neurons and brain spheroids, we address how altered actin regulation impacts the formation of excitatory synapses during fetal brain development. Prior to synapse formation, inhibition of RhoA kinase (ROCK) signaling promotes neurite elongation and branching. In addition to increasing neural complexity, ROCK inhibition increases the length of protrusions along the neurite, ultimately promoting excitatory synapse formation in human cortical brain spheroids. A corresponding increase in Rac1‐driven actin polymerization drives this increase in excitatory synaptogenesis. Using STORM super‐resolution microscopy, we demonstrate that actomyosin regulators, including the Rac1 regulator, α‐PIX, and the RhoA regulator, p115‐RhoGEF, localize to nascent excitatory synapses, where they preferentially localize to postsynaptic compartments. These results demonstrate that coordinated RhoGTPase activities underlie the initial formation of excitatory synapses and identify critical cytoskeletal regulators of early synaptogenic events.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a severe and complex psychiatric disorder characterized by intense fear about weight gain and finalized to food‐related control behaviors. Growing interest has been demonstrated about neurobiological processes subtend to AN physiopathology. The present review aimed to collect neurostructural and neurofunctional available data from 2010 to 2019. Results have been organized according to the neuroimaging technique employed, also including a specific section on electroencephalographic results, mostly neglected in previous reviews. Diffuse cerebral vulnerability has been demonstrated and the contribution of several structures has been identified. Insula, cingulate cortex, parietal and frontal areas are primarily involved both by structural and functional perspectives. Moreover, consistent alterations in white matter integrity and brain electrical activity have been reported. Neuroimaging findings give a substantial contribution to AN pathophysiological description, also in order to understand altered but reversible processes in the passage from acute illness phase to disorder's remission, useful also for defining therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The corticostriatal pathway that carries sensory, motor, and limbic information to the striatum plays a critical role in motor control, action selection, and reward. Dysfunction of this pathway is associated with many neurological and psychiatric disorders. Corticostriatal synapses have unique features in their cortical origins and striatal targets. In this review, we first describe axonal growth and synaptogenesis in the corticostriatal pathway during development, and then summarize the current understanding of the molecular bases of synaptic transmission and plasticity at mature corticostriatal synapses. Genes associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have been implicated in axonal growth abnormalities, imbalance of the synaptic excitation/inhibition ratio, and altered long‐term synaptic plasticity in the corticostriatal pathway. Here, we review a number of ASD‐associated high‐confidence genes, including &lt;i&gt;FMR1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;KMT2A&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;GRIN2B&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;SCN2A&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;NLGN1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;NLGN3&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;MET&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;CNTNAP2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;FOXP2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;TSHZ3&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;SHANK3&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;PTEN&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;CHD8&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;MECP2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;DYRK1A&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;RELN&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;FOXP1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;SYNGAP1&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;NRXN&lt;/i&gt;, and discuss their relevance to proper corticostriatal function.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key developmental milestone events of the human brain, such as neurogenesis, synapse formation, maturation, and plasticity, are determined by a myriad of molecular signaling events, including those mediated by a number of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and their cognate ligands. Aberrant or mistimed brain development and plasticity can lead to maladaptive changes, such as dysregulated synaptic connectivity and breakdown of circuit functions necessary for cognition and adaptive behaviors, which are hypothesized pathophysiologies of many neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders. Here we review recent literature that supports autism spectrum disorder as a likely result of aberrant synapse development due to &lt;i&gt;mistimed&lt;/i&gt; maturation and plasticity. We focus on MET RTK, a prominent genetic risk factor for autism, and discuss how a pleiotropic molecular signaling system engaged by MET exemplifies a genetic program that controls cortical circuit development and plasticity by modulating the anatomical and functional connectivity of cortical circuits, thus conferring genetic risk for neurodevelopmental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The perceived color of a stimulus depends not only on its spectral
properties, but also on those of its surround. For instance, a patch that looks
gray on an achromatic surround appears reddish when surrounded by green, and
greenish when surrounded by red. Previous studies showed that the effect of the
surround is repulsive: It enhances the perceptual difference between stimulus
and surround. Here, we performed psychophysical experiments to quantify the
repulsion. To report the results, a notion of distance in color space was
required. We therefore proposed an individually tailored metric in color space
that captured the perceptual abilities of each observer. To define the metric,
we determined the minimal chromatic difference between a stimulus and its
surround required by each subject to detect the stimulus. Next, observers
performed discrimination experiments between two spatially localized stimuli
presented on a surround of a different chromaticity. The surround color
affected the discrimination thresholds. Quite remarkably, when these thresholds
were expressed in the color coordinates defined before, the change in
thresholds followed a simple law that only depended on the distance between the
surround and the two compared stimuli. Perceptual coordinates, hence, reveal
the symmetry of the repulsion effect. This finding was confirmed and modeled
with a third experiment, in which subjects were asked to match the color of two
stimuli surrounded by two different chromaticities.

 &lt;p&gt;Cortical pyramidal neurons receive inputs from multiple distinct neural
populations and integrate these inputs in separate dendritic compartments. We
explore the possibility that cortical microcircuits implement Canonical
Correlation Analysis (CCA), an unsupervised learning method that projects the
inputs onto a common subspace so as to maximize the correlations between the
projections. To this end, we seek a multi-channel CCA algorithm that can be
implemented in a biologically plausible neural network. For biological
plausibility, we require that the network operates in the online setting and
its synaptic update rules are local. Starting from a novel CCA objective
function, we derive an online optimization algorithm whose optimization steps
can be implemented in a single-layer neural network with multi-compartmental
neurons and local non-Hebbian learning rules. We also derive an extension of
our online CCA algorithm with adaptive output rank and output whitening.
Interestingly, the extension maps onto a neural network whose neural
architecture and synaptic updates resemble neural circuitry and synaptic
plasticity observed experimentally in cortical pyramidal neurons.

 &lt;p&gt;Visual perception is critically influenced by the focus of attention. Due to
limited resources, it is well known that neural representations are biased in
favor of attended locations. Using concurrent eye-tracking and functional
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) recordings from a large cohort of human
subjects watching movies, we first demonstrate that leveraging gaze
information, in the form of attentional masking, can significantly improve
brain response prediction accuracy in a neural encoding model. Next, we propose
a novel approach to neural encoding by including a trainable soft-attention
module. Using our new approach, we demonstrate that it is possible to learn
visual attention policies by end-to-end learning merely on fMRI response data,
and without relying on any eye-tracking. Interestingly, we find that attention
locations estimated by the model on independent data agree well with the
corresponding eye fixation patterns, despite no explicit supervision to do so.
Together, these findings suggest that attention modules can be instrumental in
neural encoding models of visual stimuli.

 &lt;p&gt;Recently, researchers have found time cells in the hippocampus that appear to
contain information about the timing of past events. Some researchers have
argued that time cells are taking a Laplace transform of their input in order
to reconstruct the past stimulus. We argue that stimulus prediction, not
stimulus reconstruction or redundancy reduction, is in better agreement with
observed responses of time cells. In the process, we introduce new analyses of

 &lt;p&gt;Multi-modal neuroimaging projects are advancing our understanding of human
brain architecture, function, connectivity using high-quality non-invasive data
from many subjects. However, ground truth validation of connectivity using
invasive tracers is not feasible in humans. Our NonHuman Primate Neuroimaging &amp;amp;
Neuroanatomy Project (NHP_NNP) is an international effort (6 laboratories in 5
countries) to: (i) acquire and analyze high-quality multi-modal brain imaging
data of macaque and marmoset monkeys using protocols and methods adapted from
the HCP; (ii) acquire quantitative invasive tract-tracing data for cortical and
subcortical projections to cortical areas; and (iii) map the distributions of
different brain cell types with immunocytochemical stains to better define
brain areal boundaries. We are acquiring high-resolution structural,
functional, and diffusion MRI data together with behavioral measures from over
100 individual macaques and marmosets in order to generate non-invasive
measures of brain architecture such as myelin and cortical thickness maps, as
well as functional and diffusion tractography-based connectomes. We are using
classical and next-generation anatomical tracers to generate quantitative
connectivity maps based on brain-wide counting of labeled cortical and
subcortical neurons, providing ground truth measures of connectivity. Advanced
statistical modeling techniques address the consistency of both kinds of data
across individuals, allowing comparison of tracer-based and non-invasive
MRI-based connectivity measures. We aim to develop improved cortical and
subcortical areal atlases by combining histological and imaging methods.
Finally, we are collecting genetic and sociality-associated behavioral data in
all animals in an effort to understand how genetic variation shapes the
connectome and behavior.

                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Accumulating evidence has elucidated that human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) exert profound analgesic effects on numerous animal models of neuropathic pain, including drug-induced peripheral nerves, diabetes-induced neuropathy, and chronic constriction injury. We aimed to address whether forcing expression of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) can enhance the efficacy of hMSCs on alleviation of pain sensation. A rat model of chronic constriction injury (CCI) mimicking peripheral nerve injury was incorporated in the study. Paw withdrawal threshold (PWT) and paw withdrawal latency (PWL) testing were used to measure pain-related behavior. Our results demonstrated that SIRT1 was decreased post-CCI surgery. Compared to hMSCs-control implantation, the hMSCs-SIRT1 (hMSCs overexpressing SIRT1) implantation exhibited superior effects on reducing pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in serum and spinal dorsal horn, while ameliorating neuropathic pain in CCI rat. Engineering hMSCs such as overexpressing SIRT1 may serve as a promising strategy for the treatment of patients with neuropathic pain.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The spinal cord is essential to the control of locomotion in legged animals and humans. However, the actual circuitry of the spinal controller remains only vaguely understood. Here we approach this problem from the viewpoint of learning. More precisely, we assume the circuitry evolves through the transfer of control from the brain to the spinal cord, propose a specific learning mechanism for this transfer based on the error between the cord and brain contributions to muscle control, and study the resulting structure of the spinal controller in a simplified neuromuscular model of human locomotion. The model focuses on the leg rebound behavior in stance and represents the spinal circuitry with 150 muscle reflexes. We find that after learning a spinal controller has evolved that produces leg rebound motions in the absence of a central brain input with only three structural reflex groups. These groups contain individual reflexes well known from physiological experiments but thought to serve separate purposes in the control of human locomotion. Our results suggest a more holistic interpretation of the role of individual sensory projections in spinal networks than is common. In addition, we discuss potential neural correlates for the proposed learning mechanism that may be probed in experiments. Together with such experiments, neuromuscular models of spinal learning likely will become effective tools for uncovering the structure and development of the spinal control circuitry.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Recent studies have shown an unexpectedly high degree of synapse diversity arising from molecular and morphological differences among individual synapses. Diverse synapse types are spatially distributed within individual dendrites, between different neurons, and across and between brain regions, producing the synaptome architecture of the brain. The spatial organization of synapse heterogeneity is important because the physiological activation of heterogeneous excitatory synapses produces a non-uniform spatial output of synaptic potentials, which confounds the interpretation of measurements obtained from population-averaging electrodes, optrodes and biochemical methods that lack single-synapse resolution. Population-averaging measurements cannot distinguish between changes in the composition of populations of synapses and changing synaptic physiology. Here we consider the implications of synapse diversity and its organization into synaptome architecture for studies of synapse physiology, plasticity, development and behavior, and for the interpretation of phenotypes arising from pharmacological and genetic perturbations. We conclude that prevailing models based on population-averaging measurements need reconsideration and that single-synapse resolution physiological recording methods are required to confirm or refute the major synaptic models of behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Cerebrovascular disease (CeVD) is one of the leading global causes of death and severe disability. To date, retinal microangiopathy has become a reflection of cerebral microangiopathy, mirroring the vascular pathological modifications in vivo. To evaluate the retinal structure and microvasculature in patients with CeVD, we conducted a cross-sectional study in Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center and Department of Neurology of Third Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA). CeVD patients (n = 121; 238 eyes) and healthy controls (n = 44; 57 eyes) were included in the analysis. The CeVD group showed significant thinning of the peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL) thickness in the temporal and nasal quadrants, and thinning of the macular ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (GC-IPL) in the inferior quadrant, while macular microvasculature reduction was prominent in all nine quadrants. There were significant correlations between OCTA parameters, visual acuity, and transcranial doppler parameters in the CeVD group. The specific structural parameters combining microvasculature indices showed the best diagnostic accuracies (AUC = 0.918) to discriminate CeVD group from healthy controls. To conclude, we proved that OCTA reveals specific patterns of retinal structural changes and extensive macular microvascular changes in CeVD. Additionally, these retinal abnormalities could prove useful disease biomarkers in the management of individuals at high risk of debilitating complications from a cerebrovascular event.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) represents an enormous public health challenge currently and with increasing urgency in the coming decades. Our understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis of AD is rather incomplete, which is manifested in stagnated therapeutic developments. Apart from the well-established Amyloid Hypothesis of AD, gaining traction in recent years is the Pathogen Hypothesis, which postulates a causal role of infectious agents in the development of AD. Particularly, infection by viruses, among a diverse range of microorganisms, has been implicated. Recently, we described a prominent antiviral immune response in human AD brains as well as murine amyloid beta models, which has consequential effects on neuropathology. Such findings expectedly allude to the question about viral infections and AD. In this Perspective, we would like to discuss the molecular mechanism underlying the antiviral immune response, highlight how such pathway directly promotes AD pathogenesis, and depict a multilayered connection between antiviral immune response and other agents and factors relevant to AD. By tying together these threads of evidence, we provide a cohesive perspective on the uprising of antiviral immune response in AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Complex dynamic cellular networks have been studied in physiological and pathological processes under the light of single-cell calcium imaging (SCCI), a method that correlates functional data based on calcium shifts operated by different intracellular and extracellular mechanisms integrated with their cell phenotypes. From the classic synaptic structure to tripartite astrocytic model or the recent quadripartite microglia added ensemble, as well as other physiological tissues, it is possible to follow how cells signal spatiotemporally to cellular patterns. This methodology has been used broadly due to the universal properties of calcium as a second messenger. In general, at least two types of receptor operate through calcium permeation: a fast-acting ionotropic receptor channel and a slow-activating metabotropic receptor, added to exchangers/transporters/pumps and intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; release activated by messengers. These prototypes have gained an enormous amount of information in dynamic signaling circuits. SCCI has also been used as a method to associate phenotypic markers during development and stage transitions in progenitors, stem, vascular cells, neuro- and glioblasts, neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia that operate through ion channels, transporters, and receptors. Also, cancer cells or inducible cell lines from human organoids characterized by transition stages are currently being used to model diseases or reconfigure healthy cells in terms of the expression of calcium-binding/permeable molecules and shed light on therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;This paper reports on a benchmark dataset acquired with a brain–computer interface (BCI) system based on the rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) paradigm. The dataset consists of 64-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) data from 64 healthy subjects (sub1,…, sub64) while they performed a target image detection task. For each subject, the data contained two groups (“A” and “B”). Each group contained two blocks, and each block included 40 trials that corresponded to 40 stimulus sequences. Each sequence contained 100 images presented at 10 Hz (10 images per second). The stimulus images were street-view images of two categories: target images with human and non-target images without human. Target images were presented randomly in the stimulus sequence with a probability of 1∼4%. During the stimulus presentation, subjects were asked to search for the target images and ignore the non-target images in a subjective manner. To keep all original information, the dataset was the raw continuous data without any processing. On one hand, the dataset can be used as a benchmark dataset to compare the algorithms for target identification in RSVP-based BCIs. On the other hand, the dataset can be used to design new system diagrams and evaluate their BCI performance without collecting any new data through offline simulation. Furthermore, the dataset also provides high-quality data for characterizing and modeling event-related potentials (ERPs) and steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) in RSVP-based BCIs. The dataset is freely available from http://bci.med.tsinghua.edu.cn/download.html.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Studies aimed at neurological drug discovery have been carried out both in vitro and in vivo. In vitro cell culture models have showed potential as drug testing platforms characterized by high throughput, low cost, good reproducibility and ease of handling and observation. However, in vitro neuronal culture models are facing challenges in replicating in vivo-like activity patterns. This work reports an in vitro culture technique that is capable of producing micro three-dimensional (μ3D) cultures of only a few tens of neurons. The μ3D cultures generated by this method were uniform in size and density of neurons. These μ3D cultures had complex spontaneous synchronized neuronal activity patterns which were similar to those observed in the developing cortex and in much larger 3D cultures, but not in 2D cultures. Bursts could be reliably evoked by stimulation of single neurons. Synchronized bursts in μ3D cultures were abolished by inhibitors of glutamate receptors, while inhibitors of GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors had a more complex effect. This pharmacological profile is similar to bursts in neonatal cortex. Since large numbers of reproducible μ3D cultures can be created and observed in parallel, this model of the developing cortex may find applications in high-throughput drug discovery experiments.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) plays an essential role in early postnatal brain development. Extra-axial CSF (EA-CSF) volume, which is characterized by CSF in the subarachnoid space surrounding the brain, is a promising marker in the early detection of young children at risk for neurodevelopmental disorders. Previous studies have focused on global EA-CSF volume across the entire dorsal extent of the brain, and not regionally-specific EA-CSF measurements, because no tools were previously available for extracting local EA-CSF measures suitable for localized cortical surface analysis. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for the localized, cortical surface-based analysis of EA-CSF. The proposed processing framework combines probabilistic brain tissue segmentation, cortical surface reconstruction, and streamline-based local EA-CSF quantification. The quantitative analysis of local EA-CSF was applied to a dataset of typically developing infants with longitudinal MRI scans from 6 to 24 months of age. There was a high degree of consistency in the spatial patterns of local EA-CSF across age using the proposed methods. Statistical analysis of local EA-CSF revealed several novel findings: several regions of the cerebral cortex showed reductions in EA-CSF from 6 to 24 months of age, and specific regions showed higher local EA-CSF in males compared to females. These age-, sex-, and anatomically-specific patterns of local EA-CSF would not have been observed if only a global EA-CSF measure were utilized. The proposed methods are integrated into a freely available, open-source, cross-platform, user-friendly software tool, allowing neuroimaging labs to quantify local extra-axial CSF in their neuroimaging studies to investigate its role in typical and atypical brain development.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Functional integration among neural units is one of the fundamental principles in brain organization that could be examined using resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC). Interhemispheric functional integration plays a critical role in human cognition. Homotopic functional connectivity (HoFC) under resting state provide an avenue to investigate functional integration between the two brain hemispheres, which can improve the present understanding of how interhemispheric interactions affect cognitive processing. In this review, we summarize the progress of HoFC studies under resting state and highlight how these findings have enhanced our understanding of interhemispheric functional organization of the human brain. Future studies are encouraged to address particular methodological issues and to further ascertain behavioral correlates, brain disease’s modulation, task influence, and genetic basis of HoFC.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Background: FMRI signal amplitude can change during stimulus presentation due to underlying neural function and hemodynamic responses limiting the accuracy of fMRI in pre-surgical planning. To account for these changes in fMRI activation signal, we used breath-hold tasks to mimic hemodynamic changes in brain tumor subjects and scaled the activation response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Motor and/or language fMRI was performed in 21 subjects with brain tumor. A breath-hold task was also performed in these subjects to obtain the hemodynamic response changes independent of neural changes. The task activation signals were calibrated on a voxel wise basis for all the subjects. Direct cortical stimulation was used to verify the scaled results of task-based fMRI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: After scaling for the hemodynamic response function (HRF) on a voxel wise basis, the spatial extent of the scaled activation was more clustered together and appeared to minimize false positives. Similarly, accounting for the underlying canonical HRF, the percentage increase of active voxels after scaling had lower standard non-deviation suggesting that the activation response across voxels were more similar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Although preliminary in nature, this study suggests that the variation in hemodynamic changes can be calibrated using breath-hold in brain tumor subjects and can also be used for other clinical cases where the underlying HRF has been altered.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Autophagy is a conserved process to maintains homeostasis via the degradation of toxic cell contents, which can either promote cell survival or accelerate cellular demise. Ferroptosis is a recently discovered iron-dependent cell death pathway associated with the accumulation of lethal reactive lipid species. In the past few years, an increasing number of studies have suggested the crosstalk between autophagy and ferroptosis. Ischemic stroke is a complex brain disease regulated by several cell death pathways, including autophagy and ferroptosis. However, the potential links between autophagy and ferroptosis in ischemic stroke have not yet been explored. In this review, we briefly overview the mechanisms of ferroptosis and autophagy, as well as their possible connections in ischemic stroke. The elucidation of crosstalk between different cell death pathways may provide insight into new future ischemic stroke therapies.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Congenital heart diseases (CHDs), including hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS), are genetically complex and poorly understood. Here, a multi-disciplinary platform was established to functionally evaluate novel CHD gene candidates, based on whole genome and iPSC RNA sequencing of a HLHS family-trio. Filtering for rare variants and altered expression in proband iPSCs prioritized 10 candidates. siRNA/RNAi-mediated knockdown in generic human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CM) and in developing &lt;i&gt;Drosophila &lt;/i&gt;and zebrafish hearts revealed that LDL receptor-related protein &lt;i&gt;LRP2&lt;/i&gt; is required for cardiomyocyte proliferation and differentiation. Consistent with hypoplastic heart defects, compared to patents the proband's iPSC-CMs exhibited reduced proliferation. Interestingly, rare, predicted-damaging LRP2 variants were enriched in a HLHS cohort; however, understanding their contribution to HLHS requires further investigation. Collectively, we have established a multi-species high-throughput platform to rapidly evaluate candidate genes and their interactions during heart development, which are crucial first steps towards deciphering oligogenic underpinnings of CHDs, including maladaptive left hearts.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Osteoporosis is a common systemic skeletal disorder resulting in bone fragility and increased fracture risk. It is still necessary to explore its detailed mechanisms and identify novel targets for the treatment of osteoporosis. Previously, we found that a lncRNA named &lt;i&gt;GAS5&lt;/i&gt; in human could negatively regulate the lipoblast/adipocyte differentiation. However, it is still unclear whether &lt;i&gt;GAS5&lt;/i&gt; affects osteoblast differentiation and whether&lt;i&gt; GAS5 &lt;/i&gt;is associated with osteoporosis. Our current research found that &lt;i&gt;GAS5 &lt;/i&gt;was decreased in the bones and BMSCs, a major origin of osteoblast, of osteoporosis patients. Mechanistically,&lt;i&gt; GAS5&lt;/i&gt; promotes the osteoblast differentiation by interacting with UPF1 to degrade &lt;i&gt;SMAD7&lt;/i&gt; mRNA. Moreover, a decreased bone mass and impaired bone repair ability were observed in &lt;i&gt;Gas5&lt;/i&gt; heterozygous mice, manifesting in osteoporosis. The systemic supplement of &lt;i&gt;Gas5&lt;/i&gt;-overexpressing adenoviruses significantly ameliorated bone loss in an osteoporosis mouse model. In conclusion, &lt;i&gt;GAS5&lt;/i&gt; promotes osteoblast differentiation by targeting the UPF1/SMAD7 axis and protects against osteoporosis.</content>

 LRRK2 is a kinase expressed in striatal spiny projection neurons (SPNs), cells which lose dopaminergic input in Parkinson’s disease (PD). R1441C and G2019S are the most common pathogenic mutations of LRRK2. How these mutations alter the structure and function of individual synapses on direct and indirect pathway SPNs is unknown and may reveal pre-clinical changes in dopamine-recipient neurons that predispose towards disease. Here, R1441C and G2019S knock-in mice enabled thorough evaluation of dendritic spines and synapses on pathway-identified SPNs. Biochemical synaptic preparations and super-resolution imaging revealed increased levels and altered organization of glutamatergic AMPA receptors in LRRK2 mutants. Relatedly, decreased frequency of miniature excitatory post-synaptic currents accompanied changes in dendritic spine nano-architecture, and single-synapse currents, evaluated using 2-photon glutamate uncaging. Overall, LRRK2 mutations reshaped synaptic structure and function, an effect exaggerated in R1441C dSPNs. These data open the possibility of new neuroprotective therapies aimed at SPN synapse function, prior to disease onset.</content>

		<content type="html">
 Despite a common understanding that Gli TFs are utilized to reiterate a Hh morphogen gradient, genetic analyses suggest craniofacial development does not completely fit this paradigm. Using the mouse model (&lt;i&gt;Mus musculus&lt;/i&gt;), we demonstrated that rather than being driven by a Hh threshold, robust Gli3 transcriptional activity during skeletal and glossal development required interaction with the basic helix-loop-helix TF Hand2. Not only did genetic and expression data support a co-factorial relationship, but genomic analysis revealed that Gli3 and Hand2 were enriched at regulatory elements for genes essential for mandibular patterning and development. Interestingly, motif analysis at sites co-occupied by Gli3 and Hand2 uncovered mandibular-specific, low-affinity, 'divergent' Gli binding motifs (&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;d&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;GBMs). Functional validation revealed these &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;d&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;GBMs conveyed synergistic activation of Gli targets essential for mandibular patterning and development. In summary, this work elucidates a novel, sequence-dependent mechanism for Gli transcriptional activity within the craniofacial complex that is independent of a graded Hh signal.</content>

Polygenic scores quantify the genetic risk associated with a given phenotype and are widely used to predict the risk of complex diseases. There has been recent interest in developing methods to construct polygenic risk scores using summary statistic data. We propose a method to construct polygenic risk scores via penalized regression using summary statistic data and publicly available reference data. Our method bears similarity to existing method LassoSum, extending their framework to the Truncated Lasso Penalty (TLP) and the elastic net. We show via simulation and real data application that the TLP improves predictive accuracy as compared to the LASSO while imposing additional sparsity where appropriate. To facilitate model selection in the absence of validation data, we propose methods for estimating model fitting criteria AIC and BIC. These methods approximate the AIC and BIC in the case where we have a polygenic risk score estimated on summary statistic data and no validation data. Additionally, we propose the so-called quasi-correlation metric, which quantifies the predictive accuracy of a polygenic risk score applied to out-of-sample data for which we have only summary statistic information. In total, these methods facilitate estimation and model selection of polygenic risk scores on summary statistic data, and the application of these polygenic risk scores to out-of-sample data for which we have only summary statistic information. We demonstrate the utility of these methods by applying them to GWA studies of lipids, height, and lung cancer.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/yMeWG-JLNWc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

As continued COVID-19 disruption looks likely across the world, perhaps until 2021, contingency plans are evolving in case of further disruption in the 2020–2021 academic year. This includes delivering face-to-face programs fully online for at least part of the upcoming academic year for new and continuing cohorts. This temporary pivot will necessitate distance teaching and learning across almost every conceivable pedagogy, from fundamental degrees to professionally accredited ones. Each institution, program, and course will have its own myriad of individualized needs; however, there is a common question that unites us all: how do we provide teaching and assessment to students in a manner that is accessible, fair, equitable, and provides the best learning whilst acknowledging the temporary nature of the pivot? No “one size fits all” solution exists, and many of the choices that need to be made will be far from simple; however, this paper provides a starting point and basic principles to facilitate discussions taking place around the globe by balancing what we know from the pedagogy of online learning with the practicalities imposed by this crisis and any future crises.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/e9Z_LqD26FY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

In order to assess the efficacy of novel HIV-1 treatments leading to a functional cure, the time to viral rebound is frequently used as a surrogate endpoint. The longer the time to viral rebound, the more efficacious the therapy. In support of such an approach, mathematical models serve as a connection between the size of the latent reservoir and the time to HIV-1 rebound after treatment interruption. The simplest of such models assumes that a single successful latent cell reactivation event leads to observable viremia after a period of exponential viral growth. Here we consider a generalization developed by Pinkevych &lt;i&gt;et al&lt;/i&gt;. and Hill &lt;i&gt;et al&lt;/i&gt;. of this simple model in which multiple reactivation events can occur, each contributing to the exponential growth of the viral load. We formalize and improve the previous derivation of the dynamics predicted by this model, and use the model to estimate relevant biological parameters from SIV rebound data. We confirm a previously described effect of very early antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation on the rate of recrudescence and the viral load growth rate after treatment interruption. We find that every day ART initiation is delayed results in a 39% increase in the recrudescence rate (95% credible interval: [18%, 62%]), and a 11% decrease of the viral growth rate (95% credible interval: [4%, 20%]). We show that when viral rebound occurs early relative to the viral load doubling time, a model with multiple successful reactivation events fits the data better than a model with only a single successful reactivation event.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/cZno1WDWtqo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

The combination of bulk and single-cell DNA sequencing data of the same tumor enables the inference of high-fidelity phylogenies that form the input to many important downstream analyses in cancer genomics. While many studies simultaneously perform bulk and single-cell sequencing, some studies have analyzed initial bulk data to identify which mutations to target in a follow-up single-cell sequencing experiment, thereby decreasing cost. Bulk data provide an additional untapped source of valuable information, composed of candidate phylogenies and associated clonal prevalence. Here, we introduce PhyDOSE, a method that uses this information to strategically optimize the design of follow-up single cell experiments. Underpinning our method is the observation that only a small number of clones uniquely distinguish one candidate tree from all other trees. We incorporate distinguishing features into a probabilistic model that infers the number of cells to sequence so as to confidently reconstruct the phylogeny of the tumor. We validate PhyDOSE using simulations and a retrospective analysis of a leukemia patient, concluding that PhyDOSE’s computed number of cells resolves tree ambiguity even in the presence of typical single-cell sequencing errors. We also conduct a retrospective analysis on an acute myeloid leukemia cohort, demonstrating the potential to achieve similar results with a significant reduction in the number of cells sequenced. In a prospective analysis, we demonstrate the advantage of selecting cells to sequence across multiple biopsies and that only a small number of cells suffice to disambiguate the solution space of trees in a recent lung cancer cohort. In summary, PhyDOSE proposes cost-efficient single-cell sequencing experiments that yield high-fidelity phylogenies, which will improve downstream analyses aimed at deepening our understanding of cancer biology.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/yp0s25yvZoM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Contributing to broader impacts is an important aspect of scientific research. Engaging practicing K–12 teachers as part of a research project can be an effective approach for addressing broader impacts requirements of grants, while also advancing researcher and teacher professional growth. Our focus is on leveraging teachers’ professional expertise to develop science education materials grounded in emerging scientific research. In this paper, we describe ten simple rules for planning, implementing, and evaluating teacher engagement to support the broader impact goals of your research project. These collaborations can lead to the development of instructional materials or activities for students in the classroom or provide science research opportunities for teachers. We share our successes and lessons learned while collaborating with high school biology teachers to create technology-based, instructional materials developed from basic biological research. The rules we describe are applicable across teacher partnerships at any grade level in that they emphasize eliciting and respecting teachers’ professionalism and expertise.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/r-dFiGtlm1Y&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Demographics of the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce and student body in the US and Europe continue to show severe underrepresentation of Black, Indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC). Among the documented causes of the persistent lack of diversity in STEM are bias, discrimination, and harassment of members of underrepresented minority groups (URMs). These issues persist due to continued marginalization, power imbalances, and lack of adequate policies against misconduct in academic and other scientific institutions. All scientists can play important roles in reversing this trend by shifting the culture of academic workplaces to intentionally implement equitable and inclusive policies, set norms for acceptable workplace conduct, and provide opportunities for mentorship and networking. As scientists are increasingly acknowledging the lack of racial and ethnic diversity in science, there is a need for clear direction on how to take antiracist action. Here we present 10 rules to help labs develop antiracists policies and action in an effort to promote racial and ethnic diversity, equity, and inclusion in science.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/hkcDpMKWOWY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Genotype imputation estimates the genotypes of unobserved variants using the genotype data of other observed variants based on a collection of haplotypes for thousands of individuals, which is known as a haplotype reference panel. In general, more accurate imputation results were obtained using a larger size of haplotype reference panel. Most of the existing genotype imputation methods explicitly require the haplotype reference panel in precise form, but the accessibility of haplotype data is often limited, due to the requirement of agreements from the donors. Since de-identified information such as summary statistics or model parameters can be used publicly, imputation methods using de-identified haplotype reference information might be useful to enhance the quality of imputation results under the condition where the access of the haplotype data is limited. In this study, we proposed a novel imputation method that handles the reference panel as its model parameters by using bidirectional recurrent neural network (RNN). The model parameters are presented in the form of de-identified information from which the restoration of the genotype data at the individual-level is almost impossible. We demonstrated that the proposed method provides comparable imputation accuracy when compared with the existing imputation methods using haplotype datasets from the 1000 Genomes Project (1KGP) and the Haplotype Reference Consortium. We also considered a scenario where a subset of haplotypes is made available only in de-identified form for the haplotype reference panel. In the evaluation using the 1KGP dataset under the scenario, the imputation accuracy of the proposed method is much higher than that of the existing imputation methods. We therefore conclude that our RNN-based method is quite promising to further promote the data-sharing of sensitive genome data under the recent movement for the protection of individuals’ privacy.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/evfPJ-IpVhw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Metabolic inference from genomic sequence information is a necessary step in determining the capacity of cells to make a living in the world at different levels of biological organization. A common method for determining the metabolic potential encoded in genomes is to map conceptually translated open reading frames onto a database containing known product descriptions. Such gene-centric methods are limited in their capacity to predict pathway presence or absence and do not support standardized rule sets for automated and reproducible research. Pathway-centric methods based on defined rule sets or machine learning algorithms provide an adjunct or alternative inference method that supports hypothesis generation and testing of metabolic relationships within and between cells. Here, we present mlLGPR, &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;ulti-&lt;i&gt;l&lt;/i&gt;abel based on &lt;i&gt;l&lt;/i&gt;ogistic re&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;ression for &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;athway p&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;ediction, a software package that uses supervised multi-label classification and rich pathway features to infer metabolic networks in organismal and multi-organismal datasets. We evaluated mlLGPR performance using a corpora of 12 experimental datasets manifesting diverse multi-label properties, including manually curated organismal genomes, synthetic microbial communities and low complexity microbial communities. Resulting performance metrics equaled or exceeded previous reports for organismal genomes and identify specific challenges associated with features engineering and training data for community-level metabolic inference.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/fVk9wRrKtV8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) modulates brain activity by passing electrical current through electrodes that are attached to the scalp. Because it is safe and noninvasive, tACS holds great promise as a tool for basic research and clinical treatment. However, little is known about how tACS ultimately influences neural activity. One hypothesis is that tACS affects neural responses directly, by producing electrical fields that interact with the brain’s endogenous electrical activity. By controlling the shape and location of these electric fields, one could target brain regions associated with particular behaviors or symptoms. However, an alternative hypothesis is that tACS affects neural activity indirectly, via peripheral sensory afferents. In particular, it has often been hypothesized that tACS acts on sensory fibers in the skin, which in turn provide rhythmic input to central neurons. In this case, there would be little possibility of targeted brain stimulation, as the regions modulated by tACS would depend entirely on the somatosensory pathways originating in the skin around the stimulating electrodes. Here, we directly test these competing hypotheses by recording single-unit activity in the hippocampus and visual cortex of alert monkeys receiving tACS. We find that tACS entrains neuronal activity in both regions, so that cells fire synchronously with the stimulation. Blocking somatosensory input with a topical anesthetic does not significantly alter these neural entrainment effects. These data are therefore consistent with the direct stimulation hypothesis and suggest that peripheral somatosensory stimulation is not required for tACS to entrain neurons.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/VtB0bViwC7g&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To examine the association between cerebellar hemorrhage (CBH) size and location and preschool‐age neurodevelopment in very preterm neonates.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preterm magnetic resonance images of 221 very preterm neonates (median gestational age = 27.9 weeks) were manually segmented for CBH quantification and location. Neurodevelopmental assessments at chronological age 4.5 years included motor (Movement Assessment Battery for Children, 2nd Edition [MABC‐2]), visuomotor integration (Beery‐Buktenica Developmental Test of Visual‐Motor Integration, 6th Edition), cognitive (Wechsler Primary and Preschool Scale of Intelligence, 3rd Edition), and behavioral (Child Behavior Checklist) outcomes. Multivariable linear regression models examined the association between CBH size and 4.5‐year outcomes accounting for sex, gestational age, and supratentorial injury. Probabilistic maps assessed CBH location and likelihood of a lesion to predict adverse outcome.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirty‐six neonates had CBH: 14 (6%) with only punctate CBH and 22 (10%) with ≥1 larger CBH. CBH occurred mostly in the inferior aspect of the posterior lobes. CBH total volume was independently associated with MABC‐2 motor scores at 4.5 years (β = −0.095, 95% confidence interval = −0.184 to −0.005), with a standardized β coefficient (−0.16) that was similar to that of white matter injury volume (standardized β = −0.22). CBH size was similarly associated with visuomotor integration and externalizing behavior but not cognition. Voxelwise odds ratio and lesion‐symptom maps demonstrated that CBH extending more deeply into the cerebellum predicted adverse motor, visuomotor, and behavioral outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CBH size and location on preterm magnetic resonance imaging were associated with reduced preschool motor and visuomotor function and more externalizing behavior independent of supratentorial brain injury in a dose‐dependent fashion. The volumetric quantification and localization of CBH, even when punctate, may allow opportunity to improve motor and behavioral outcomes by providing targeted intervention.

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;PSEN1&lt;/em&gt; gene is considered to be the most common gene, which is responsible for the development of an autosomal dominant Alzheimer disease with early onset and sometimes broad phenotype. We present a patient with a spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA)-like phenotype who was found to carry an M233V mutation. General and neurological exam was carried out. Brain MRI as well as genetic testing for SCAs 1, 2, 3, 6, and 17 were performed. The patient was then referred for a next-generation sequencing-based gene panel test with 723 genes included. A 26-year-old man of an Azerbaijani origin presented with a progressive impairment of coordination followed by memory impairment. Family history was positive for a similar disorder suggesting autosomal dominant inheritance. Brain MRI showed bilateral hippocampal atrophy (more pronounced in the left), as well as mild atrophy of the left temporoparietal cortex. Tests for SCAs 1, 2, 3, 6, and 17 came negative. Gene panel test showed c.697A &amp;gt; G heterozygous variant in the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;PSEN1&lt;/em&gt; gene leading to a M233V amino acid change, which was validated by a Sanger sequencing. So far, M233V mutation has not been associated with a combination of cerebellar and cognitive features at onset. Our case contributes to a better characterization of the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;PSEN1&lt;/em&gt; mutations and expands the phenotype of the M233V carriers. We propose to consider &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;PSEN1&lt;/em&gt; mutations in patients presenting with an SCA-like phenotype but negative for common types of SCA.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;A prompt diagnosis and treatment of patients with autoimmune cerebellar ataxia (CA) with antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD-Abs) may lead to a better prognosis. Herein, we report prodromal transient neurological symptoms that should raise clinical suspicion of CA with GAD-Abs. We initially identified a 70-year-old man who presented a first acute episode of vertigo, diplopia, and ataxia lasting 2 weeks. Two months later, he experienced a similar episode along with new-onset gaze-evoked nystagmus. After 4 months, downbeat nystagmus, left limb dysmetria, and gait ataxia progressively appeared, and an autoimmune CA was diagnosed based on the positivity of GAD-Abs in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). We searched retrospectively for similar presentations in a cohort of 31 patients diagnosed with CA and GAD-Abs. We found 11 (35.4%) patients (all women, median age 62 years; 8/11 [72.7%] with autoimmune comorbidities) with transient neurological symptoms antedating CA onset by a median of 3 months, including vertigo in 9 (81.8%; described as paroxysmal in 8) and fluctuating diplopia in 3 (27.3%) patients. The identification of transient neurological symptoms of unknown etiology, such as paroxysmal vertigo and fluctuating diplopia, should lead to GAD-Abs testing in serum and CSF, especially in patients with autoimmune comorbidities.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by storage of unesterified glycolipids and cholesterol in lysosome. NPC’s clinical presentation is highly heterogeneous, depending on the time of onset. It encompasses visceral, neurological, and/or psychiatric manifestations. As the motor findings are so important and devastating in this disease, there is a lack of description about non-motor symptoms, even though they play important role in quality of life of NPC patients. We described the most common non-motor findings in NPC like cognitive dysfunction, neuroimaging, psychiatric symptoms, sleep disorders, seizures, hearing problems, respiratory and other systemic features, bladder and fecal dysfunction, hypersalivation, and malnutrition. In this review, we highlighted the importance of these undervalued symptoms and their management. Specific measures of all aforementioned clinical features may work as relevant biomarkers in order to evaluate successful therapies in future clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) represent a large group of heredodegenerative diseases, with great phenotypic and genotypic heterogeneity. However, in the clinical neurological practice, some symptoms and signs might help differentiate the SCAs. This study’s aims were to evaluate the frequency of upward gaze palsy (UGP) and investigate its role in assisting in the clinical differentiation of SCAs. We included 419 patients with SCAs (248 with SCA3, 95 with SCA10, 38 with SCA2, 22 with SCA1, 12 with SCA7, and 4 with SCA6). This study compared UGP with other known markers of disease severity—age of onset, disease duration, SARA score, and size of CAG expansion, and also other semiologic features, as bulging eyes. This sign was significantly more prevalent in SCA3 (64.11%), compared with SCA10 (3.16%; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) and other SCAs (SCA1, SCA2, SCA7–11.84%; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). UGP showed very high sensibility ins SCA3 (92.9), although lacking of specificity (64.1%). The odds ratio (OR) of UGP were also very high, 23.52 (95% CI 12.38–44.69), and was significantly correlated with larger CAG expansions, age, and disease duration in SCA3 patients, but not with age of onset or severity of the ataxic syndrome. This study showed that UGP is highly suggestive of SCA3 and has high sensitivity for the differential diagnosis among SCAs, and it could be of great value for bedside semiologic tool.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Communication difficulties have considerable impact on people with progressive ataxia, yet there are currently no evidence-based treatments. LSVT LOUD® focuses on the production of healthy vocal loudness whilst also improving breath support, vocal quality, loudness and articulation in participating patients. This study aimed to investigate whether Lee Silverman Voice Treatment (LSVT LOUD®) can improve communication effectiveness in these patients. We performed a rater-blinded, single-arm study investigating LSVT LOUD® treatment in a population of patients with progressive ataxia including Friedreich’s ataxia (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 18), spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 1), idiopathic cerebellar ataxia (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 1), and spastic paraplegia 7 (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 1). Twenty-one patients were recruited to the study, with 19 completing treatment. Sessions were administered via Skype in the LSVT-X format, meaning two sessions per week over a period of 8 weeks. Assessments included two baseline and two post-treatment measures and focused on outcome measures covering aspects ranging from physiological function to impact and participation. Results indicate improvements in patient-perceived outcomes for 14 of the 19 participants, in both speech and psychosocial domains. Speech data furthermore demonstrate significant improvements in prolonged vowel duration, and voice quality measures. Intelligibility and naturalness evaluations showed no change post-treatment. Patients reported high acceptability of the treatment itself, as well as administration by Skype. This is the largest treatment study for people with progressive ataxia published to date. It provides an indication that LSVT LOUD® can have a positive impact on communication in this patient group and could form the basis for larger-scale trials.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Immune-mediated ataxias account for a substantial number of sporadic otherwise idiopathic ataxias. Despite some well-characterised entities such as paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration where diagnostic markers exist, the majority of immune ataxias remained undiagnosed and untreated. We present here our experience in the treatment of suspected primary autoimmune cerebellar ataxia (PACA) using mycophenolate. All patients reported attend the Sheffield Ataxia Centre on a regular basis and had undergone extensive investigations, including genetic testing using next-generation sequencing, with other causes of ataxia excluded. The diagnosis of PACA was strongly suspected based on investigations, pattern of disease progression, and cerebellar involvement. Patients were treated with mycophenolate and monitored using MR spectroscopy of the cerebellar vermis. Thirty patients with PACA are reported here. Of these, 22 received mycophenolate (group 1). The remaining 8 were not on treatment (group 2-control group). Out of the 22 treated patients, 4 underwent serial MR spectroscopy prior to starting treatment and thus were used as controls making the total number of patients in the control group 12. The mean change of the MRS within the vermis (NAA/Cr area ratio) in the treatment group was + 0.144 ± 0.09 (improved) and in the untreated group − 0.155 ± 0.06 (deteriorated). The difference was significant. We also demonstrated a strong correlation between the spectroscopy and the SARA score. We have demonstrated the effectiveness of mycophenolate in the treatment of PACA. The results suggest that immune-mediated ataxias are potentially treatable, and that there is a need for early diagnosis to prevent permanent neurological deficit. The recently published diagnostic criteria for PACA would hopefully aid the diagnosis and treatment of this entity.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Speech production relies on motor control and cognitive processing and is linked to cerebellar function. In diseases where the cerebellum is impaired, such as multiple sclerosis (MS), speech abnormalities are common and can be detected by instrumental assessments. However, the potential of speech assessments to be used to monitor cerebellar impairment in MS remains unexplored. The aim of this study is to build an objectively measured speech score that reflects cerebellar function, pathology and quality of life in MS. Eighty-five people with MS and 21 controls participated in the study. Speech was independently assessed through objective acoustic analysis and blind expert listener ratings. Cerebellar function and overall disease disability were measured through validated clinical scores; cerebellar pathology was assessed via magnetic resonance imaging, and validated questionnaires informed quality of life. Selected speech variables were entered in a regression model to predict cerebellar function. The resulting model was condensed into one composite speech score and tested for prediction of abnormal 9-hole peg test (9HPT), and for correlations with the remaining cerebellar scores, imaging measurements and self-assessed quality of life. Slow rate of syllable repetition and increased free speech pause percentage were the strongest predictors of cerebellar impairment, complemented by phonatory instability. Those variables formed the acoustic composite score that accounted for 54% of variation in cerebellar function, correlated with cerebellar white matter volume (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; = 0.3, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p =&lt;/em&gt; 0.017), quality of life (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; = 0.5, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) and predicted an abnormal 9HPT with 85% accuracy. An objective multi-feature speech metric was highly representative of motor cerebellar impairment in MS.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) is relatively prevalent among the Yemenite Jewish subpopulation living in Israel. Currently, there is no treatment able to modify the disease progression. Trehalose is a disaccharide with protein-stabilizing and autophagy-enhancing properties. In animal models of MJD, trehalose showed reduction of cerebellar lesion size and improved motor function. This study was designed to be a proof-of-concept, phase 2 study lasting 6 to 12 months, to determine the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of weekly IV administration of 15 g or 30 g 10% trehalose solution in 14 MJD patients. Primary endpoints were safety and tolerability, which were assessed by various clinical and laboratory tests. Secondary endpoints were changes in the Scale for Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) score, Neurological Examination Score for Spinocerebellar Ataxia (NESSCA), time to do 9-hole peg test (9HPT), time to do 8-meter walk (8MW), and quality of life assessed by the World Health Organization Quality-of-Life Questionnaire-BREF (WHOQoL-BREF). Trehalose was well tolerated, and no serious drug-related adverse events were noted. The average SARA score, NESSCA, and time to do 9HPT and 8MW and the WHOQoL-BREF for all patients remained stable at 6 months. Six patients received treatment for as long as 12 months and continued to remain stable on all the above tests. IV trehalose seems to be safe in humans and probably effective to stabilize neurological impairment in MJD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Corticomuscular and intermuscular coherence (CMC, IMC) reflect connectivity between neuronal activity in the motor cortex measured by electroencephalography (EEG) and muscular activity measured by electromyography (EMG), or between activity in different muscles, respectively. There is an ongoing debate on the appropriateness of EMG rectification prior to coherence estimation. This work examines the effects of EMG rectification in CMC and IMC estimation in 20 spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) patients, 16 prodromal SCA2 gene mutation carriers, and 26 healthy controls during a repetitive upper or lower limb motor task. Coherence estimations were performed using the non-rectified raw EMG signal vs. the rectified EMG signal. EMG rectification decreases the level of significance of lower beta-frequency band CMC and IMC values in SCA2 patients and prodromal SCA2 mutation carriers vs. healthy controls, and also results in overall lower coherence values. EMG rectification is detrimental for beta-frequency band CMC and IMC estimation. One likely reason for this effect is distortion of coherence estimation in high-frequency signals, where the level of amplitude cancelation is high.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The cerebellum plays a critical role in promoting learning of new motor tasks, which is an essential function for motor recovery. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the cerebellum can be used to enhance learning. In this study, we investigated the effects of cerebellar intermittent theta burst stimulation (c-iTBS), a high-frequency rTMS protocol, on visuo-motor learning in a sample of hemiparetic patients due to recent stroke in the territory of the contralateral middle cerebral artery. Eight stroke patients were enrolled for the purposes of the study in the chronic stage of recovery (i.e., at least 6 months after stroke). In two sessions, Patients were randomly assigned to treatment with real or sham c-iTBS applied over the cerebellar hemisphere ipsilateral to the affected body side. c-iTBS was applied immediately before the learning phase of a visuo-motor adaptation task. Real, but not sham, c-iTBS improved visuo-motor learning as revealed by an increased performance in of the learning phase of the visuo-moto adaptation task. Moreover, we also found that real but not sham c-iTBS induced a sustained improvement in the re-adaptation of the recently learned skill (i.e., when patients were re-tested after 30 min). Taken together, these data point to c-iTBS as a potential novel strategy to promote motor learning in patients with stroke.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Chromosomal microarray analysis is commonly used as screening test for children with neurodevelopmental issues, also in case of complex neurological phenotypes. Developmental delay/intellectual disability is a common presentation sign in pediatric ataxias, diseases with high clinical and genetic heterogeneity. In order to determine the diagnostic yield of Array-CGH in such conditions, all the tests performed in the last 10-year activity of a single referral center in children who present, besides the neurodevelopmental impairment, cerebellar abnormalities have been systematically gathered. The study demonstrates that, except for Dandy-Walker malformation or poly-malformative phenotypes, chromosomal microarray analysis should be discouraged as first-line diagnostic test in pediatric ataxias with neurodevelopmental disability.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We sought to assess structural and functional patterns of cerebellum in multiple system atrophy (cerebellar type), and investigate the associations of structural and functional cerebellar gray matter abnormalities. We collected magnetic resonance imaging data of 18 patients with multiple system atrophy (cerebellar type) and 18 health control subjects. The gray matter loss across the motor and cognitive cerebellar territories in patients was assessed using voxel-based morphometry. And change in the connectivity between the cerebellum and large-scale cortical networks was assessed using resting-state functional MRI analysis. Furthermore, we assessed the relationship between the extent of cerebellar atrophy and reduced-activation in the cerebellar-cortical and subthalamo-cerebellar functional connectivities. We confirmed the gray matter loss across the motor and cognitive cerebellar territories in patients and found that the extent of cerebellar atrophy was correlated with decreased connectivity between the cerebellum and large-scale cortical networks, including the default, frontal parietal, and sensorimotor networks. The volume reduction in the motor cerebellum was closely associated with the clinical motor severity. A post hoc analysis showed reduced-activation in the subthalamo-cerebellar functional connectivity without the subthalamic nucleus atrophy. These results emphasized significant atrophy in the cerebellar subsystem and its association with the large-scale cortical networks in multiple system atrophy (cerebellar type), which may improve our understanding of the neural pathophysiology mechanisms of disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Cerebellar volume, in particular vermal lobule areas VI–VII, have been extensively researched in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), although findings are often unclear. The aim of the present study is to consolidate all existing cerebellar and age data of individuals with ASD, and compare this data to typically developing (TD) controls. Raw data, or the means and standard deviations of cerebellar volume and age, were obtained from 17 studies (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;N&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Cerebellum&lt;/sub&gt;: 421 ASD and 370 TD participants; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;N&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;VI–VII&lt;/sub&gt;: 506 ASD and 290 TD participants). Total cerebellar volume, or VI–VII area, was plotted against age and lines of fit of ASD and TD data were compared. Mean differences in cerebellar volume and VI–VII area between participants with ASD and TD participants were then compared via ANCOVA analyses. Findings revealed multiple differences in VI–VII area between participants with ASD and TD participants below 18 years of age. Additionally, cerebellar volume was greater in males with ASD than TD males between 2 and 4 years. In the present study, cerebellar volume and VI–VII area show different rates of change across age for those with autism compared with those without. These morphological differences provide a neurobiological justification to investigate related behavioural correlates.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Cerebellar granule neuron progenitors (CGNPs) give rise to the cerebellar granule neurons in the developing cerebellum. Generation of large number of these neurons is made possible by the high proliferation rate of CGNPs in the external granule layer (EGL) in the dorsal cerebellum. Here, we show that upregulation of β-catenin can maintain murine CGNPs in a state of proliferation. Further, we show that β-catenin mRNA and protein levels can be regulated by the mitogen Sonic hedgehog (Shh). Shh signaling led to an increase in the level of the transcription factor N-myc. N-myc was found to bind the β-catenin promoter, and the increase in β-catenin mRNA and protein levels could be prevented by blocking N-myc upregulation downstream of Shh signaling. Furthermore, blocking Wingless-type MMTV integration site (Wnt) signaling by Wnt signaling pathway inhibitor Dickkopf 1 (Dkk-1) in the presence of Shh did not prevent the upregulation of β-catenin. We propose that in culture, Shh signaling regulates β-catenin expression through N-myc and results in increased CGNP proliferation.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The advent of preclinical research scanners for in vivo imaging of small animals has added confidence into the multi-step decision-making process of radiotracer discovery and development. Furthermore, it has expanded the utility of imaging techniques available to dissect clinical questions, fostering a cyclic interaction between the clinical and the preclinical worlds. Significant efforts from medicinal chemistry have also made available several high-affinity and selective compounds amenable for radiolabeling, that target different receptors, transporters and enzymes in vivo. This substantially increased the range of applications of molecular imaging using positron emission tomography (PET) or single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). However, the process of developing novel radiotracers for in vivo imaging of the human brain is a multi-step process that has several inherent pitfalls and technical difficulties, which often hampers the successful translation of novel imaging agents from preclinical research into clinical use. In this paper, the process of radiotracer development and its relevance in brain research is discussed; as well as, its pitfalls, technical challenges and future promises. Examples of successful and unsuccessful translation of brain radiotracers will be presented.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;It has long been hypothesized that pretend play is beneficial to social and cognitive development. However, there is little evidence regarding the neural regions that are active while children engage in pretend play. We examined the activation of prefrontal and posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) regions using near-infrared spectroscopy while 42 4- to 8-year-old children freely played with dolls or tablet games with a social partner or by themselves. Social play activated right prefrontal regions more than solo play. Children engaged the pSTS during solo doll play but not during solo tablet play, suggesting they were rehearsing social cognitive skills more with dolls. These findings suggest social play utilizes multiple neural regions and highlight how doll play can achieve similar patterns of activation, even when children play by themselves. Doll play may provide a unique opportunity for children to practice social interactions important for developing social-emotional skills, such as empathy.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Reaction time testing is widely used in online computerized concussion assessments, and most concussion studies utilizing the metric have demonstrated varying degrees of difference between concussed and non-concussed individuals. The problem with most of these online concussion assessments is that they predominantly rely on consumer grade technology. Typical administration of these reaction time tests involves presenting a visual stimulus on a computer monitor and prompting the test subject to respond as quickly as possible via keypad or computer mouse. However, inherent delays and variabilities are introduced to the reaction time measure by both computer and associated operating systems that the concussion assessment tool is installed on. The authors hypothesized systems that are typically used to collect concussion reaction time data would demonstrate significant errors in reaction time measurements. To remove human bias, a series of experiments was conducted robotically to assess timing errors introduced by reaction time tests under four different conditions. In the first condition, a visual reaction time test was conducted by flashing a visual stimulus on a computer monitor. Detection was via photodiode and mechanical response was delivered via computer mouse. The second condition employed a mobile device for the visual stimulus, and the mechanical response was delivered to the mobile device's touchscreen. The third condition simulated a tactile reaction time test, and mechanical response was delivered via computer mouse. The fourth condition also simulated a tactile reaction time test, but response was delivered to a dedicated device designed to store the interval between stimulus delivery and response, thus bypassing any problems hypothesized to be introduced by computer and/or computer software. There were significant differences in the range of responses recorded from the four different conditions with the reaction time collected from visual stimulus on a mobile device being the worst and the device with dedicated hardware designed for the task being the best. The results suggest that some of the commonly used visual tasks on consumer grade computers could be (and have been) introducing significant errors for reaction time testing and that dedicated hardware designed for the reaction time task is needed to minimize testing errors.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Many species, including rats, are sensitive to social signals and their valuation is important in social learning. Here we introduce a task that investigates if mutual reward delivery in male rats can drive associative learning. We found that when actor rats have fully learned a stimulus-self-reward association, adding a cue that predicted additional reward to a partner unblocked associative learning about this cue. By contrast, additional cues that did not predict partner reward remained blocked from acquiring positive associative value. Importantly, this social unblocking effect was still present when controlling for secondary reinforcement but absent when social information exchange was impeded, when mutual reward outcomes were disadvantageously unequal to the actor or when the added cue predicted reward delivery to an empty chamber. Taken together, these results suggest that mutual rewards can drive associative learning in rats and is dependent on vicariously experienced social and food-related cues.</content>

 Growth and maintenance of skeletal muscle fibres depend on coordinated activation and return to quiescence of resident muscle stem cells (MuSCs). The transcription factor Myogenin (Myog) regulates myocyte fusion during development, but its role in adult myogenesis remains unclear. In contrast to mice, &lt;i&gt;myog&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; zebrafish are viable, but have hypotrophic muscles. By isolating adult myofibres with associated MuSCs we found that &lt;i&gt;myog&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; myofibres have severely reduced nuclear number, but increased myonuclear domain size. Expression of fusogenic genes is decreased, Pax7 upregulated, MuSCs are fivefold more numerous and mis-positioned throughout the length of &lt;i&gt;myog&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; myofibres instead of localising at myofibre ends as in wild-type. Loss of Myog dysregulates mTORC1 signalling, resulting in an 'alerted' state of MuSCs, which display precocious activation and faster cell cycle entry ex vivo, concomitant with &lt;i&gt;myod&lt;/i&gt; upregulation. Thus, beyond controlling myocyte fusion, Myog influences the MuSC:niche relationship, demonstrating a multi-level contribution to muscle homeostasis throughout life.</content>

 Understanding the emergence of novel viruses requires an accurate and comprehensive annotation of their genomes. Overlapping genes (OLGs) are common in viruses and have been associated with pandemics, but are still widely overlooked. We identify and characterize &lt;i&gt;ORF3d&lt;/i&gt;, a novel OLG in SARS-CoV-2 that is also present in Guangxi pangolin-CoVs but not other closely related pangolin-CoVs or bat-CoVs. We then document evidence of &lt;i&gt;ORF3d&lt;/i&gt; translation, characterize its protein sequence, and conduct an evolutionary analysis at three levels: between taxa (21 members of &lt;i&gt;Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus&lt;/i&gt;), between human hosts (3978 SARS-CoV-2 consensus sequences), and within human hosts (401 deeply sequenced SARS-CoV-2 samples). &lt;i&gt;ORF3d&lt;/i&gt; has been independently identified and shown to elicit a strong antibody response in COVID-19 patients. However, it has been misclassified as the unrelated gene &lt;i&gt;ORF3b&lt;/i&gt;, leading to confusion. Our results liken &lt;i&gt;ORF3d&lt;/i&gt; to other accessory genes in emerging viruses and highlight the importance of OLGs.</content>

 Terminal selectors are transcription factors (TFs) that establish during development and maintain throughout life post-mitotic neuronal identity. We previously showed that UNC-3/Ebf, the terminal selector of &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; cholinergic motor neurons (MNs), acts indirectly to prevent alternative neuronal identities (Feng et al., 2020). Here, we globally identify the direct targets of UNC-3. Unexpectedly, we find that the suite of UNC-3 targets in MNs is modified across different life stages, revealing ‘temporal modularity’ in terminal selector function. In all larval and adult stages examined, UNC-3 is required for continuous expression of various protein classes (e.g. receptors, transporters) critical for MN function. However, only in late larvae and adults, UNC-3 is required to maintain expression of MN-specific TFs. Minimal disruption of UNC-3’s temporal modularity via genome engineering affects locomotion. Another &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; terminal selector (UNC-30/Pitx) also exhibits temporal modularity, supporting the potential generality of this mechanism for the control of neuronal identity.</content>

		<content type="html">
 We can be motivated when reward depends on performance, or merely by the prospect of a guaranteed reward. Performance-dependent (contingent) reward is instrumental, relying on an internal action-outcome model, whereas motivation by guaranteed reward may minimise opportunity cost in reward-rich environments. Competing theories propose that each type of motivation should be dependent on dopaminergic activity. We contrasted these two types of motivation with a rewarded saccade task, in patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD). When PD patients were ON dopamine, they had greater response vigour (peak saccadic velocity residuals) for &lt;i&gt;contingent&lt;/i&gt; rewards, whereas when PD patients were OFF medication, they had greater vigour for &lt;i&gt;guaranteed&lt;/i&gt; rewards. These results support the view that reward expectation and contingency drive distinct motivational processes, and can be dissociated by manipulating dopaminergic activity. We posit that dopamine promotes goal-directed motivation, but dampens reward-driven vigour, contradictory to the prediction that increased tonic dopamine amplifies reward expectation</content>

		<content type="html">
 Aberrant &lt;i&gt;HOXA9&lt;/i&gt; expression is a hallmark of most aggressive acute leukemias, notably those with KMT2A (MLL) gene rearrangements. &lt;i&gt;HOXA9&lt;/i&gt; overexpression not only predicts poor diagnosis and outcome but also plays a critical role in leukemia transformation and maintenance. However, our current understanding of &lt;i&gt;HOXA9&lt;/i&gt; regulation in leukemia is limited, hindering development of therapeutic strategies. Here, we generated the &lt;i&gt;HOXA9-mCherry&lt;/i&gt; knock-in reporter cell lines to dissect &lt;i&gt;HOXA9&lt;/i&gt; regulation. By utilizing the reporter and CRISPR/Cas9 screens, we identified transcription factors controlling &lt;i&gt;HOXA9&lt;/i&gt; expression, including a novel regulator, USF2, whose depletion significantly down-regulated &lt;i&gt;HOXA9&lt;/i&gt; expression and impaired MLLr leukemia cell proliferation. Ectopic expression of Hoxa9 rescued impaired leukemia cell proliferation upon USF2 loss. Cut&amp;amp;Run analysis revealed the direct occupancy of USF2 at &lt;i&gt;HOXA9&lt;/i&gt; promoter in MLLr leukemia cells. Collectively, the &lt;i&gt;HOXA9&lt;/i&gt; reporter facilitated the functional interrogation of the &lt;i&gt;HOXA9&lt;/i&gt; regulome and has advanced our understanding of the molecular regulation network in &lt;i&gt;HOXA9&lt;/i&gt;-driven leukemia.</content>

		<content type="html">
 In the vertebrate central nervous system, groups of functionally-related neurons, including cranial motor neurons of the brainstem, are frequently organised as nuclei. The molecular mechanisms governing the emergence of nuclear topography and circuit function are poorly understood. Here we investigate the role of cadherin-mediated adhesion in the development of zebrafish ocular motor (sub)nuclei. We find that developing ocular motor (sub)nuclei differentially express classical cadherins. Perturbing cadherin function in these neurons results in distinct defects in neuronal positioning, including scattering of dorsal cells and defective contralateral migration of ventral subnuclei. In addition, we show that cadherin-mediated interactions between adjacent subnuclei are critical for subnucleus position. We also find that disrupting cadherin adhesivity in dorsal oculomotor neurons impairs the larval optokinetic reflex, suggesting that neuronal clustering is important for co-ordinating circuit function. Our findings reveal that cadherins regulate distinct aspects of cranial motor neuron positioning and establish subnuclear topography and motor function.</content>

The field of transcriptomics uses and measures mRNA as a proxy of gene expression. There are currently two major platforms in use for quantifying mRNA, microarray and RNA-Seq. Many comparative studies have shown that their results are not always consistent. In this study we aim to find a robust method to increase comparability of both platforms enabling data analysis of merged data from both platforms. We transformed high dimensional transcriptomics data from two different platforms into a lower dimensional, and biologically relevant dataset by calculating enrichment scores based on gene set collections for all samples. We compared the similarity between data from both platforms based on the raw data and on the enrichment scores. We show that the performed data transforms the data in a biologically relevant way and filters out noise which leads to increased platform concordance. We validate the procedure using predictive models built with microarray based enrichment scores to predict subtypes of breast cancer using enrichment scores based on sequenced data. Although microarray and RNA-Seq expression levels might appear different, transforming them into biologically relevant gene set enrichment scores significantly increases their correlation, which is a step forward in data integration of the two platforms. The gene set collections were shown to contain biologically relevant gene sets. More in-depth investigation on the effect of the composition, size, and number of gene sets that are used for the transformation is suggested for future research.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/QAKeFKz1bhY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Healthy adults flexibly adapt their learning strategies to ongoing changes in uncertainty, a key feature of adaptive behaviour. However, the developmental trajectory of this ability is yet unknown, as developmental studies have not incorporated trial-to-trial variation in uncertainty in their analyses or models. To address this issue, we compared adolescents’ and adults’ trial-to-trial dynamics of uncertainty, learning rate, and exploration in two tasks that assess learning in noisy but otherwise stable environments. In an estimation task—which provides direct indices of trial-specific learning rate—both age groups reduced their learning rate over time, as self-reported uncertainty decreased. Accordingly, the estimation data in both groups was better explained by a Bayesian model with dynamic learning rate (Kalman filter) than by conventional reinforcement-learning models. Furthermore, adolescents’ learning rates asymptoted at a higher level, reflecting an over-weighting of the most recent outcome, and the estimated Kalman-filter parameters suggested that this was due to an overestimation of environmental volatility. In a choice task, both age groups became more likely to choose the higher-valued option over time, but this increase in choice accuracy was smaller in the adolescents. In contrast to the estimation task, we found no evidence for a Bayesian expectation-updating process in the choice task, suggesting that estimation and choice tasks engage different learning processes. However, our modeling results of the choice task suggested that both age groups reduced their degree of exploration over time, and that the adolescents explored overall more than the adults. Finally, age-related differences in exploration parameters from fits to the choice data were mediated by participants’ volatility parameter from fits to the estimation data. Together, these results suggest that adolescents overestimate the rate of environmental change, resulting in elevated learning rates and increased exploration, which may help understand developmental changes in learning and decision-making.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/q_oMUJUHLS8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

During these days of global emergency for the COVID-19 disease outbreak, there is an urgency to share reliable information able to help worldwide life scientists to get better insights and make sense of the large amount of data currently available. In this study we used the results presented in [1] to perform two different Systems Biology analyses on the HCoV-host interactome. In the first one, we reconstructed the interactome of the HCoV-host proteins, integrating it with highly reliable miRNA and drug interactions information. We then added the IL-6 gene, identified in recent publications [2] as heavily involved in the COVID-19 progression and, interestingly, we identified several interactions with the reconstructed interactome. In the second analysis, we performed a Gene Ontology and a Pathways enrichment analysis on the full set of the HCoV-host interactome proteins and on the ones belonging to a significantly dense cluster of interacting proteins identified in the first analysis. Results of the two analyses provide a compact but comprehensive glance on some of the current state-of-the-art regulations, GO, and pathways involved in the HCoV-host interactome, and that could support all scientists currently focusing on SARS-CoV-2 research.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/JzU-epzTyFw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Psychiatric disorders are ubiquitously characterized by debilitating social impairments. These difficulties are thought to emerge from aberrant social inference. In order to elucidate the underlying computational mechanisms, patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder (N = 29), schizophrenia (N = 31), and borderline personality disorder (N = 31) as well as healthy controls (N = 34) performed a probabilistic reward learning task in which participants could learn from social and nonsocial information. Patients with schizophrenia and borderline personality disorder performed more poorly on the task than healthy controls and patients with major depressive disorder. Broken down by domain, borderline personality disorder patients performed better in the social compared to the non-social domain. In contrast, controls and MDD patients showed the opposite pattern and SCZ patients showed no difference between domains. In effect, borderline personality disorder patients gave up a possible overall performance advantage by concentrating their learning in the social at the expense of the non-social domain. We used computational modeling to assess learning and decision-making parameters estimated for each participant from their behavior. This enabled additional insights into the underlying learning and decision-making mechanisms. Patients with borderline personality disorder showed slower learning from social and non-social information and an exaggerated sensitivity to changes in environmental volatility, both in the non-social and the social domain, but more so in the latter. Regarding decision-making the modeling revealed that compared to controls and major depression patients, patients with borderline personality disorder and schizophrenia showed a stronger reliance on social relative to non-social information when making choices. Depressed patients did not differ significantly from controls in this respect. Overall, our results are consistent with the notion of a general interpersonal hypersensitivity in borderline personality disorder and schizophrenia based on a shared computational mechanism characterized by an over-reliance on beliefs about others in making decisions and by an exaggerated need to make sense of others during learning specifically in borderline personality disorder.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/MrkTPYrQlV8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

A basic—yet nontrivial—function which neocortical circuitry must satisfy is the ability to maintain stable spiking activity over time. Stable neocortical activity is asynchronous, critical, and low rate, and these features of spiking dynamics contribute to efficient computation and optimal information propagation. However, it remains unclear how neocortex maintains this asynchronous spiking regime. Here we algorithmically construct spiking neural network models, each composed of 5000 neurons. Network construction synthesized topological statistics from neocortex with a set of objective functions identifying naturalistic low-rate, asynchronous, and critical activity. We find that simulations run on the same topology exhibit sustained asynchronous activity under certain sets of initial membrane voltages but truncated activity under others. Synchrony, rate, and criticality do not provide a full explanation of this dichotomy. Consequently, in order to achieve mechanistic understanding of sustained asynchronous activity, we summarized activity as functional graphs where edges between units are defined by pairwise spike dependencies. We then analyzed the intersection between functional edges and synaptic connectivity- i.e. recruitment networks. Higher-order patterns, such as triplet or triangle motifs, have been tied to cooperativity and integration. We find, over time in each sustained simulation, low-variance periodic transitions between isomorphic triangle motifs in the recruitment networks. We quantify the phenomenon as a Markov process and discover that if the network fails to engage this stereotyped regime of motif dominance “cycling”, spiking activity truncates early. Cycling of motif dominance generalized across manipulations of synaptic weights and topologies, demonstrating the robustness of this regime for maintenance of network activity. Our results point to the crucial role of excitatory higher-order patterns in sustaining asynchronous activity in sparse recurrent networks. They also provide a possible explanation why such connectivity and activity patterns have been prominently reported in neocortex.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/JIKiGK-cDv0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Small membrane proteins represent a largely unexplored yet abundant class of proteins in pro- and eukaryotes. They essentially consist of a single transmembrane domain and are associated with stress response mechanisms in bacteria. How these proteins are inserted into the bacterial membrane is unknown. Our study revealed that in &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;, the 27-amino-acid-long model protein YohP is recognized by the signal recognition particle (SRP), as indicated by in vivo and in vitro site-directed cross-linking. Cross-links to SRP were also observed for a second small membrane protein, the 33-amino-acid-long YkgR. However, in contrast to the canonical cotranslational recognition by SRP, SRP was found to bind to YohP posttranslationally. In vitro protein transport assays in the presence of a SecY inhibitor and proteoliposome studies demonstrated that SRP and its receptor FtsY are essential for the posttranslational membrane insertion of YohP by either the SecYEG translocon or by the YidC insertase. Furthermore, our data showed that the &lt;i&gt;yohP&lt;/i&gt; mRNA localized preferentially and translation-independently to the bacterial membrane in vivo. In summary, our data revealed that YohP engages an unique SRP-dependent posttranslational insertion pathway that is likely preceded by an mRNA targeting step. This further highlights the enormous plasticity of bacterial protein transport machineries.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/J1Buzevc9iA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Matrix proteins are encoded by many enveloped viruses, including influenza viruses, herpes viruses, and coronaviruses. Underneath the viral envelope of influenza virus, matrix protein 1 (M1) forms an oligomeric layer critical for particle stability and pH-dependent RNA genome release. However, high-resolution structures of full-length monomeric M1 and the matrix layer have not been available, impeding antiviral targeting and understanding of the pH-dependent transitions involved in cell entry. Here, purification and extensive mutagenesis revealed protein–protein interfaces required for the formation of multilayered helical M1 oligomers similar to those observed in virions exposed to the low pH of cell entry. However, single-layered helical oligomers with biochemical and ultrastructural similarity to those found in infectious virions before cell entry were observed upon mutation of a single amino acid. The highly ordered structure of the single-layered oligomers and their likeness to the matrix layer of intact virions prompted structural analysis by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). The resulting 3.4-Å–resolution structure revealed the molecular details of M1 folding and its organization within the single-shelled matrix. The solution of the full-length M1 structure, the identification of critical assembly interfaces, and the development of M1 assembly assays with purified proteins are crucial advances for antiviral targeting of influenza viruses.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/oIHtLnau1qM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Detection of memory‐ and learning‐related brain connectivity changes following trace eyeblink‐conditioning using resting‐state functional magnetic resonance imaging in the awake rabbit&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/61e4eefb-c733-4407-aa17-1d7e702a3fc7/cne25042-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mammalian brain can adapt to life experiences and reorganize its functional network to learn a new task. In our study we were able to detect and characterize rs‐fMRI signals from alert rabbits to track the functional reorganization of the neural networks that mediate acquisition and retention of eyeblink conditioning.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Animal imaging studies have the potential to further establish resting‐state fMRI (rs‐fMRI) and enable its validation for clinical use. The rabbit subjects used in this work are an ideal model system for studying learning and behavior and are also an excellent established test subject for awake scanning given their natural tolerance for restraint. We found that analysis of rs‐fMRI conducted on a cohort of rabbits undergoing eyeblink conditioning can reveal functional brain connectivity changes associated with learning, and that rs‐fMRI can be used to capture differences between subjects with different levels of cognitive performance. rs‐fMRI sessions were conducted on a cohort of rabbits before and after trace eyeblink conditioning. MRI results were analyzed using independent component analysis (ICA) and network analysis. Behavioral data were collected with standard methods using an infrared reflective sensor aimed at the cornea to detect blinks. Behavioral results were analyzed, and a median split was used to create two groups of rabbits based on their performance. The cohort of rabbits undergoing eyeblink conditioning exhibited increased functional connectivity in the cingulate cortex, retrosplenial cortex, and thalamus consistent with brain reorganization associated with increased learning. Differences in the striatum and right cerebellum were also identified between rabbits in the top or bottom halves of the group as measured by the behavioral assay. Thus, rs‐fMRI can provide not only a tool to detect and monitor functional brain changes associated with learning, but also to discriminate between different levels of cognitive performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;h2&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Three weeks of anti‐Lingo‐1 antibody injection at a dose of 8 mg/(kg • d) significantly improved the spatial memory ability of rats under chronic stress
The synapses of the DG, CA1, and CA3 fields of the hippocampus were significantly decreased after 7 weeks of CS stimulation
Three weeks of anti‐Lingo‐1 antibody treatment reversed the CS‐induced decrease in the synapses in the DG, CA1, and CA3 fields of the hippocampus



&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chronic stress can induce cognitive impairment, and synapse number was significantly decreased in the hippocampus of rats suffering from chronic stress. Lingo‐1 is a potent negative regulator of axonal outgrowth and synaptic plasticity. In the current study, the effects of anti‐Lingo‐1 antibody on the spatial learning and memory abilities and hippocampal synapses of stressed rats were investigated. After 4 weeks of stress exposure, the model group was randomly divided into a chronic stress group and an anti‐Lingo‐1 group. Then, the anti‐Lingo‐1 group rats were treated with anti‐Lingo‐1 antibody (8 mg/kg) for 3 weeks. The effects of anti‐Lingo‐1 antibody on the spatial learning and memory abilities were investigated with the Morris water maze test. Immunohistological staining and an unbiased stereological method were used to estimate the total number of dendritic spine synapses in the hippocampus. At the behavioral level, after 3 weeks of treatment, the anti‐Lingo‐1 group rats displayed significantly more platform location crossings in the Morris water maze test than the chronic stress group rats. Anti‐Lingo‐1 significantly prevented the declines in dendritic spine synapses and postsynaptic density protein‐95 (PSD‐95) expression in the dentate gyrus and the CA1 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus. The present results indicated that anti‐Lingo‐1 antibody may be a safe and effective drug for alleviating memory impairment in rats after chronic stress and protecting synapses in the hippocampus of stressed rats.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To evaluate in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and acute ischaemic stroke the association of prior anticoagulation with vitamin‐K antagonists (VKA) or direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) with stroke severity, intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) utilization, safety of IVT, and 3‐months outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cohort study of consecutive patients (2013–2019) on anticoagulation versus those without (controls) with regard to stroke severity, rates of IVT/MT, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH), and favorable outcome (mRS 0–2) at 3 months.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of 8179 patients (mean[SD]age, 79.8[9.6] years;49%women), 1486(18%) were on VKA treatment, 1634(20%) on DOAC treatment at stroke onset, and 5059 controls. Stroke severity was lower in patients on DOACs (median NIHSS 4,[IQR2–11]) as compared to VKA (6,[2–14]) and controls (7,[3–15], P&amp;lt;0.001; quantile regression: β ‐2.1, 95%CI ‐2.6 – ‐1.7). The IVT‐rate in potentially eligible patients was significantly lower in patients on VKA (156/247 (63%);aOR 0.67; 95%CI 0.50–0.90) and particularly in patients on DOACs (69/464 (15%); aOR 0.06; 95%CI 0.05–0.08) as compared to controls (1544/2504 (74%)). sICH after IVT occurred in 3.6%(2.6–4.7%) of controls, 9/195 (4.6%; 1.9–9.2%; aOR 0.93;0.46‐1.90) of patients on VKA and 2/65 (3.1%; 0.4–10.8%, aOR 0.56;0.28–1.12) of those on DOACs. After adjustments for prognostic confounders, DOAC pretreatment was associated with favorable 3‐month outcome (aOR 1.24,1.01–1.51).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior DOAC therapy in patients with AF was associated with decreased admission stroke severity at onset and a remarkably low rate of IVT. Overall, patients on DOAC might have better functional outcome at 3 months. Further research is needed to overcome potential restrictions for IVT in patients taking DOACs.&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.536246"/>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Adaptive context-dependent behaviors necessitate the flexible selection of multiple behavioral tactics, i.e., internal protocols for selecting an action. Previous primate studies have shown that the posterior medial prefrontal cortex (pmPFC) contributes to the selection, retention, and use of tactics, but the manner in which this area employs selected tactics to convert sensory information into action and how that manner differs from downstream cortical motor areas have yet to be fully elucidated. To address this issue, the present study recorded neuronal activity in two monkeys as they performed a two-choice arm reaching task that required the selection of multiple tactics when converting spatial cue information into the direction of arm reaching. Neuronal populations in both pmPFC and presupplementary motor area (pre-SMA) represented tactics during their selection, maintenance in memory, and their use in determining an action. Additionally, they represented the monkeys’ action in the behavioral epoch in which the direction of reaching was determined. A striking contrast between the pmPFC and the pre-SMA was the representation of the spatial cue location in the former and its absence in the latter area. In individual neurons, neurons in pmPFC and pre-SMA had either single or mixed representation of tactics and action. Some of the pmPFC neurons additionally encoded cue location. Finally, neurons in the supplementary motor area mainly represented the action. Taken together, the present results indicate that, of these three areas, the pmPFC plays a cardinal role during the integration of behavioral tactics and visuospatial information when selecting an action.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Dendritic spines are small protrusions from the dendrite membrane, where contact with neighboring axons is formed in order to receive synaptic input. Changes in size, shape, and density of synaptic spines are associated with learning and memory, and observed after drug abuse in a variety of neurodegenerative, neurodevelopmental, and psychiatric disorders. Due to the preeminent importance of synaptic spines, there have been major efforts into developing techniques that enable visualization and analysis of dendritic spines in cultured neurons, in fixed slices and in intact brain tissue. The classification of synaptic spines into predefined morphological groups is a standard approach in neuroscience research, where spines are divided into fixed categories such as thin, mushroom, and stubby subclasses. This study examines accumulated evidence that supports the existence of dendritic spine shapes as a continuum rather than separated classes. Using new approaches and software tools we reflect on complex dendritic spine shapes, positing that understanding of their highly dynamic nature is required to perform analysis of their morphology. The study discusses and compares recently developed algorithms that rely on clusterization rather than classification, therefore enabling new levels of spine shape analysis. We reason that improved methods of analysis may help to investigate a link between dendritic spine shape and its function, facilitating future studies of learning and memory as well as studies of brain disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The blood–brain barrier (BBB) plays a crucial role in maintaining the specialized microenvironment of the central nervous system (CNS). In aging, the stability of the BBB declines and the permeability increases. The list of CNS pathologies involving BBB dysfunction is growing. The opening of the BBB and subsequent infiltration of serum components to the brain can lead to a host of processes resulting in progressive synaptic, neuronal dysfunction, and detrimental neuroinflammatory changes. Such processes have been implicated in different diseases, including vascular dementia, stroke, Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, hypoxia, ischemia, and diabetes mellitus. The BBB damage is also observed in tauopathies that lack amyloid-β overproduction, suggesting a role for tau in BBB damage. Tauopathies represent a heterogeneous group of around 20 different neurodegenerative diseases characterized by abnormal deposition of the MAPT in cells of the nervous system. Neuropathology of tauopathies is defined as intracellular accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) consisting of aggregated hyper- and abnormal phosphorylation of tau protein and neuroinflammation. Disruption of the BBB found in tauopathies is driven by chronic neuroinflammation. Production of pro-inflammatory signaling molecules such as cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules by glial cells, neurons, and endothelial cells determine the integrity of the BBB and migration of immune cells into the brain. The inflammatory processes promote structural changes in capillaries such as fragmentation, thickening, atrophy of pericytes, accumulation of laminin in the basement membrane, and increased permeability of blood vessels to plasma proteins. Here, we summarize the knowledge about the role of tau protein in BBB structural and functional changes.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Background: Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease worldwide and involves deficiencies in alpha-synuclein (α-Syn) degradation. Effective therapeutic strategies for PD are urgently needed. L-asparaginase (L-ASNase) has been developed for therapeutic applications in many fields because it catalyzes the hydrolysis of asparagine and glutamine in cancer cells, which may also activate autophagy and induce the degradation of accumulated α-Syn. However, the efficacy and related mechanism of L-ASNase in PD remain poorly understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We determined the correlation between L-ASNase and autophagic degradation of α-Syn in a cell model of PD. Mitochondrial function and apoptosis were examined in the presence or absence of L-ASNase. Then, we applied GC-MS/MS targeted amino acid metabolomics analysis to validate the amino acid regulation induced by L-ASNase treatment. Glutamine was added to verify whether the neuroprotective effect was induced by deprivation of glutamine. α-Syn-related autophagy and mitochondrial fusion/fission dynamics were detected to explore the mechanism of L-ASNase-based therapy in PD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: L-ASNase activated the autophagic degradation of α-Syn in a cell model of PD without cytotoxicity at specific concentrations/times. Under these conditions, L-ASNase showed substantial neuroprotective effects, including improvements in mitochondrial function and decreased apoptosis. Through GC-MS/MS targeted analysis, glutamine metabolism was identified as the target of L-ASNase in PD treatment, and the neuroprotective effect of L-ASNase was reduced after glutamine supplementation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Our study demonstrated for the first time that L-ASNase had a neuroprotective effect on a cell model of PD through a moderate deprivation of glutamine, which induced autophagic activation and mitochondrial fusion. Therefore, we demonstrated that L-ASNase could be a promising and effective drug for PD treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Ketamine inhibits neural stem/progenitor cell (NSPC) proliferation and disrupts normal neurogenesis in the developing brain. 17β-Estradiol alleviates neurogenesis damage and enhances behavioral performance after ketamine administration. However, the receptor pathway of 17β-estradiol that protects NSPCs from ketamine-induced injury remains unknown. In the present study, we investigated the role of estrogen receptor α (ER-α) and estrogen receptor β (ER-β) in 17β-estradiol’s protection against ketamine-exposed NSPCs and explored its potential mechanism. The primary cultured NSPCs were identified by immunofluorescence and then treated with ketamine and varying doses of ER-α agonist 4,4′,4″-(4-propyl-[1H]-pyrazole-1,3,5-triyl) trisphenol (PPT) or ER-β agonist 2,3-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-propionitrile (DPN) for 24 h. NSPC proliferation was analyzed by 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine incorporation test. The expression of phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase-3β (p-GSK-3β) was quantified by western blotting. It was found that treatment with different concentrations of PPT did not alter the inhibition of ketamine on NSPC proliferation. However, treatment with DPN attenuated the inhibition of ketamine on NSPC proliferation at 24 h after their exposure (P &amp;lt; 0.05). Furthermore, treatment with DPN increased p-GSK-3β expression in NSPCs exposed to ketamine. These findings indicated that ER-β mediates probably the protective effects of 17β-estradiol on ketamine-damaged NSPC proliferation and GSK-3β is involved in this process&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is generally regarded as a prodromal stage of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In coping with the challenges caused by AD, we analyzed resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data of 82 MCI subjects and 93 normal controls (NCs). The alteration of brain functional network in MCI was investigated on three scales, including global metrics, nodal characteristics, and modular properties. The results supported the existence of small worldness, hubs, and community structure in the brain functional networks of both groups. Compared with NCs, the network altered in MCI over all the three scales. In scale I, we found significantly decreased characteristic path length and increased global efficiency in MCI. Moreover, altered global network metrics were associated with cognitive level evaluated by neuropsychological assessments. In scale II, the nodal betweenness centrality of some global hubs, such as the right Crus II of cerebellar hemisphere (CERCRU2.R) and fusiform gyrus (FFG.R), changed significantly and associated with the severity and cognitive impairment in MCI. In scale III, although anatomically adjacent regions tended to be clustered into the same module regardless of group, discrepancies existed in the composition of modules in both groups, with a prominent separation of the cerebellum and a less localized organization of community structure in MCI compared with NC. Taking advantages of random forest approach, we achieved an accuracy of 91.4% to discriminate MCI patients from NCs by integrating cognitive assessments and network analysis. The importance of the used features fed into the classifier further validated the nodal characteristics of CERCRU2.R and FFG.R could be potential biomarkers in the identification of MCI. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that the brain functional connectome data altered at the stage of MCI and could assist the automatic diagnosis of MCI patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Inter-subject transfer learning is a long-standing problem in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and has not yet been fully realized due to high inter-subject variability in the brain signals related to motor imagery (MI). The recent success of deep learning-based algorithms in classifying different brain signals warrants further exploration to determine whether it is feasible for the inter-subject continuous decoding of MI signals to provide contingent neurofeedback which is important for neurorehabilitative BCI designs. In this paper, we have shown how a convolutional neural network (CNN) based deep learning framework can be used for inter-subject continuous decoding of MI related electroencephalographic (EEG) signals using the novel concept of Mega Blocks for adapting the network against inter-subject variabilities. These Mega Blocks have the capacity to repeat a specific architectural block several times such as one or more convolutional layers in a single Mega Block. The parameters of such Mega Blocks can be optimized using Bayesian hyperparameter optimization. The results, obtained on the publicly available BCI competition IV-2b dataset, yields an average inter-subject continuous decoding accuracy of 71.49% (κ = 0.42) and 70.84% (κ = 0.42) for two different training methods such as adaptive moment estimation (Adam) and stochastic gradient descent (SGDM), respectively, in 7 out of 9 subjects. Our results show for the first time that it is feasible to use CNN based architectures for inter-subject continuous decoding with a sufficient level of accuracy for developing calibration-free MI-BCIs for practical purposes.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by loss of dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). Although the exact cause of cell death is not clear, the hypothesis that metabolic deficiency is a key factor has been gaining attention in recent years. In the present study, we investigated this hypothesis using a multi-scale computational model of the subsystem of the basal ganglia comprising the subthalamic nucleus (STN), globus pallidus externa (GPe), and SNc. The proposed model is a multiscale model in that interaction among the three nuclei are simulated using more abstract Izhikevich neuron models, while the molecular pathways involved in cell death of SNc neurons are simulated in terms of detailed chemical kinetics. Simulation results obtained from the proposed model showed that energy deficiencies occurring at cellular and network levels could precipitate the excitotoxic loss of SNc neurons in PD. At the subcellular level, the models show how calcium elevation leads to apoptosis of SNc neurons. The therapeutic effects of several neuroprotective interventions are also simulated in the model. From neuroprotective studies, it was clear that glutamate inhibition and apoptotic signal blocker therapies were able to halt the progression of SNc cell loss when compared to other therapeutic interventions, which only slowed down the progression of SNc cell loss.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Attention deficits are among the most common cognitive impairments observed after experiencing stroke. However, a very limited number of studies have investigated the effectiveness of interventions that specifically focus on the rehabilitation of attention deficits among subjects with impaired attention. Although several interventions have included the use of computerized programs to provide dynamic stimuli, real-time performance feedback, and motivating tasks, existing studies have not exploited the potential benefits of multi-user interactions. Group-based and competitive interventions have been reported to be more enjoyable and motivating, depending on individual traits, and may potentially be more demanding, which may increase their effectiveness. This study investigated the effectiveness and motivating abilities of an intervention specifically designed to address attention deficits. This intervention combined paper-and-pencil tasks and interactive, computerized, multi-touch exercises, which were administered, either non-competitively or competitively, to a group of 43 individuals with chronic stroke. The mediating effects of competitiveness were evaluated for both intervention effectiveness and motivation. Participants were randomly sorted into two groups and underwent 20 one-hour group-based sessions, during which they either worked individually or competed with peers, according to their group allocation. Participants were assessed before and after the intervention, using the Conners' Continuous Performance Test, the d2 Test of Attention, the Color Trail Test, the Digit Span Test, and the Spatial Span Test. The competitiveness and subjective experiences of the participants after the intervention were investigated with the Revised Competitiveness Index and the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory, respectively. The results showed that participants who competed demonstrated significantly greater improvements in all cognitive abilities, except for divided attention, and reported greater enjoyment than their non-competitive peers. Both groups reported comparable levels of perceived competence, pressure, and usefulness. Interestingly, the competitiveness of the participants did not alter either the effectiveness or the subjective experience of the intervention. These findings suggest that competition might enhance the effectiveness and enjoyment of rehabilitation interventions designed to address attention deficits in individuals post-stroke, regardless of their level of competitiveness and without having a negative effect on their perceived pressure and competence.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between olfactory recognition and morphological changes in olfactory brain regions including the amygdala, hippocampus, rectus, parahippocampus, orbitofrontal cortex, and medial frontal cortex in 27 elderly subjects and 27 younger healthy controls. The specific aim of the study was to determine which brain areas are associated with the initial decline of olfaction in elderly subjects, which occurs before the onset of dementia. All subjects underwent magnetic resonance imaging to measure anatomical brain volume and cortical thickness, and subjects were assessed using tests of olfactory acuity and cognitive function measured with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. Overall brain volume reductions were observed in elderly subjects compared with young healthy controls, but only reduction in the volume of the left hippocampus was associated with decreased olfactory ability. The parahippocampus of elderly subjects was not different from that of controls; the extent of the reduction of parahippocampus volume varied among individuals, and reduction in this region was associated with olfactory decline. Similarly, parahippocampus thinning was associated with decreased olfactory function. The path analysis showed direct and indirect effects of hippocampus and parahippocampus volume on olfactory ability and that volume reductions in these areas were not associated with cognitive function. Parahippocampus volume reduction and thinning exhibited individual variation; this may be the first appearance of pathological changes and may lead to dysfunction in the connection of olfactory memory to the neocortex. Parahippocampus change may reflect the first sign of olfactory impairment prior to pathological changes in the hippocampus, amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Segmented deep brain stimulation leads feature directional electrodes that allow for a finer spatial control of electrical stimulation compared to traditional ring-shaped electrodes. These segmented leads have demonstrated enlarged therapeutic windows and have thus the potential to improve the treatment of Parkinson’s disease patients. Moreover, they provide a unique opportunity to record directional local field potentials. Here, we investigated whether directional local field potentials can help identify the best stimulation direction to assist device programming. Four Parkinson’s disease patients underwent routine implantation of the subthalamic nucleus. Firstly, local field potentials were recorded in three directions for two conditions: In one condition, the patient was at rest; in the other condition, the patient’s arm was moved. Secondly, current thresholds for therapeutic and side effects were identified intraoperatively for directional stimulation. Therapeutic windows were calculated from these two thresholds. Thirdly, the spectral power of the total beta band (13–35 Hz) and its sub-bands low, high, and peak beta were analyzed post hoc. Fourthly, the spectral power was used by different algorithms to predict the ranking of directions. The spectral power profiles were patient-specific, and spectral peaks were found both in the low beta band (13–20 Hz) and in the high beta band (20.5–35 Hz). The direction with the highest spectral power in the total beta band was most indicative of the 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; best direction when defined by therapeutic window. Based on the total beta band, the resting condition and the moving condition were similarly predictive about the direction ranking and classified 83.3% of directions correctly. However, different algorithms were needed to predict the ranking defined by therapeutic window or therapeutic current threshold. Directional local field potentials may help predict the best stimulation direction. Further studies with larger sample sizes are needed to better distinguish the informative value of different conditions and the beta sub-bands.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Synapses are highly stochastic transmission units. A classical model describing this stochastic transmission is called the binomial model, and its underlying parameters can be estimated from postsynaptic responses to evoked stimuli. The accuracy of parameter estimates obtained via such a model-based approach depends on the identifiability of the model. A model is said to be structurally identifiable if its parameters can be uniquely inferred from the distribution of its outputs. However, this theoretical property does not necessarily imply practical identifiability. For instance, if the number of observations is low or if the recording noise is high, the model's parameters can only be loosely estimated. Structural identifiability, which is an intrinsic property of a model, has been widely characterized; but practical identifiability, which is a property of both the model and the experimental protocol, is usually only qualitatively assessed. Here, we propose a formal definition for the practical identifiability domain of a statistical model. For a given experimental protocol, this domain corresponds to the set of parameters for which the model is correctly identified as the ground truth compared to a simpler alternative model. Considering a model selection problem instead of a parameter inference problem allows to derive a non-arbitrary criterion for practical identifiability. We apply our definition to the study of neurotransmitter release at a chemical synapse. Our contribution to the analysis of synaptic stochasticity is three-fold: firstly, we propose a quantitative criterion for the practical identifiability of a statistical model, and compute the identifiability domains of different variants of the binomial release model (uni or multi-quantal, with or without short-term plasticity); secondly, we extend the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), a classically used tool for model selection, to models with correlated data (which is the case for most models of chemical synapses); finally, we show that our approach allows to perform data free model selection, i.e., to verify if a model used to fit data was indeed identifiable even without access to the data, but having only access to the fitted parameters.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The aim of this study was to characterize the EEG alterations in inter-band interactions along the Alzheimer's disease (AD) continuum. For this purpose, EEG background activity from 51 healthy control subjects, 51 mild cognitive impairment patients, 50 mild AD patients, 50 moderate AD patients, and 50 severe AD patients was analyzed by means of bispectrum. Three inter-band features were extracted from bispectrum matrices: bispectral relative power (BispRP), cubic bispectral entropy (BispEn), and bispectral median frequency (BispMF). BispRP results showed an increase of delta and theta interactions with other frequency bands and the opposite behavior for alpha, beta-1, and beta-2. Delta and theta interactions, along with the rest of the spectrum, also experimented a decrease of BispEn with disease progression, suggesting these bands interact with a reduced variety of components in advanced stages of dementia. Finally, BispMF showed a consistent reduction along the AD continuum in all bands, which is reflective of an interaction of the global spectrum with lower frequency bands as the disease develops. Our results indicate a progressive decrease in inter-band interactions with the severity of the disease, especially those involving high frequency components. Since inter-band coupling oscillations are related to complex and multi-scaled brain processes, these alterations likely reflect the neurodegeneration associated with the AD continuum.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Background&lt;p&gt;Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been employed for motor function rehabilitation for stroke patients, but its effects on post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI) remains controversial.&lt;/p&gt;Objective&lt;p&gt;To identify the effects of rTMS intervention on PSCI patients and its potential neural correlates to behavioral improvements.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We recruited 34 PSCI patients for 20 sessions of 10 Hz rTMS or no-stim control treatments over the left dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Cognitive function was evaluated with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale, Victoria Stroop Test, Rivermead Behavior Memory Test, and Activities of Daily Living (ADL) assessed with the Modified Barthel Index. 14 patients received functional MRI scan, a useful non-invasive technique of determining how structurally segregated and functionally specialized brain areas were interconnected, which was reflected by blood oxygenation level–dependent signals. The amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and functional connectivity (FC) were applied as the analytical approaches, which were used to measure the resting-state brain activity and functional connection.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;rTMS improved cognitive functions and ADLs for PSCI patients relative to patients who received no-stim control treatment. The cognitive improvements correlated to increased ALFF of the left medial prefrontal cortex, and increased FC of right medial prefrontal cortex and right ventral anterior cingulate cortex.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;10 Hz rTMS at DLPFC could improve cognitive function and quality of life for PSCI patients, which is associated with an altered frontal cortical activity.&lt;/p&gt;Clinical Registration&lt;p&gt;Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, ChiCTR-IPR-17011908, http://www.chictr.org.cn/index.aspx.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The lack of effective treatments for most neurological diseases has prompted the search for novel therapeutic options. Interestingly, neuroinflammation is emerging as a common feature to target in most CNS pathologies. Recent studies suggest that targeted delivery of small molecules to reduce neuroinflammation can be beneficial. However, suboptimal drug delivery to the CNS is a major barrier to modulate inflammation because neurotherapeutic compounds are currently being delivered systemically without spatial or temporal control. Emerging nanomaterial technologies are providing promising and superior tools to effectively access neuropathological tissue in a controlled manner. Here we highlight recent advances in nanomaterial technologies for drug delivery to the CNS. We propose that state-of-the-art nanoparticle drug delivery platforms can significantly impact local CNS bioavailability of pharmacological compounds and treat neurological diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;During postnatal development of the visual cortex between eye-opening to puberty, visual experience promotes a gradual increase in the strength of inhibitory synaptic connections from parvalbumin-positive interneurons (PV-INs) onto layer 2/3 pyramidal cells. However, the detailed connectivity properties and molecular mechanisms underlying these developmental changes are not well understood. Using dual-patch clamp in brain slices from G42 mice, we revealed that both connection probability and the number of synaptic release sites contributed to the enhancement of synaptic strength. The increase of release site number was hindered by dark rearing from eye-opening and rescued by 3-days re-exposure to the normal visual environment. The effect of light re-exposure on restoring synaptic release sites in dark reared mice was mimicked by the agonist of cannabinoid-1 (CB1) receptors and blocked by an antagonist of these receptors, suggesting a role for endocannabinoid signaling in light-induced maturation of inhibitory connectivity from PV-INs to pyramidal cells during postnatal development.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Since it was first described almost 30 years ago, homeostatic synaptic plasticity (HSP) has been hypothesized to play a key role in maintaining neuronal circuit function in both developing and adult animals. While well characterized in vitro, determining the in vivo roles of this form of plasticity remains challenging. Since the discovery that the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) mediates some forms of HSP, it has been possible to probe some of the in vivo contribution of TNF-mediated HSP. Work from our lab and others has found roles for TNF-HSP in a variety of functions, including the developmental plasticity of sensory systems, models of drug addiction, and the response to psychiatric drugs.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Enhanced spontaneous GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor activity is associated with focal cortical dysplasia (FCD), a developmental malformation of the cerebral cortex. Clinical manifestations in FCD vary with age at epilepsy onset with a more favorable prognosis in patients with late-onset (LO) compared to that in cases with early-onset (EO). This study was designed to test the hypothesis in FCD that spontaneous GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor-mediated epileptogenicity depends on the age at epilepsy onset and varies between patients with early and late-onset age in FCD. To this end, brain specimens were obtained from the maximal spiking region (MAX) and minimal spiking region (MIN) of the epileptic foci of EO (n = 14, mean age = 10.6 ± 2.9 years) and LO (n = 10, mean age = 27 ± 5.6 years) patients undergoing electrocorticography (ECoG) guided surgery. The whole-cell patch-clamp technique was used to record spontaneous GABAergic currents from normal-looking pyramidal neurons in slice preparations of resected brain samples. We detected higher frequency and amplitude of GABAergic events in MAX samples compared to MIN samples of LO patients, while they were comparable in MIN and MAX samples of EO patients. Further GABAergic activity in the MIN and MAX samples of EO patients was higher than the MIN samples of LO patients. This suggests that in LO patients, GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor-mediated epileptogenicity is confined only to the high spiking areas, but in EO patients, it affects low spiking regions as well.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Multiple system atrophy (MSA), an atypical parkinsonism of alpha-synucleinopathies, has no specific biomarker of diagnosis. According to different combinations of symptoms, MSA can be classified as parkinsonism-type MSA (MSA-P) and cerebellar-type MSA (MSA-C; Watanabe et al., 2018). Amide proton transfer (APT) imaging is by far the most studied chemical exchange saturation transfer imaging for its sensitivity to mobile protons and peptides in tissues. We hypothesize that APT imaging may be a feasible biomarker of MSA-P. Twenty MSA-P patients and 20 age-matched normal controls were enrolled in this study and underwent MR exams on a 3.0-T MR scanner. Magnetization transfer spectra at 3.5 ppm were acquired at two transverse slices of the head, including the midbrain and the basal ganglia. Mann–Whitney U test was used to compare the asymmetrical magnetization transfer ratio (MTR&lt;sub&gt;asym&lt;/sub&gt;) difference between MSA-P patients and normal controls. The APT MTR&lt;sub&gt;asym&lt;/sub&gt; values of MSA patients in the red nucleus (RN) (SN; P = 0.000), substantia nigra (P = 0.000), thalamus (P = 0.000), and putamen (P = 0.013) were significantly higher than those in normal controls. There was a negative correlation between APT MTR&lt;sub&gt;asym&lt;/sub&gt; and the score of part III of the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (R = −0.338, P = 0.044) in the putamen, while there was a positive correlation between the APT MTR&lt;sub&gt;asym&lt;/sub&gt; and the rate of motor symptom progression (R = 0.406, P = 0.017) in the RN. These findings suggest that APT MTR&lt;sub&gt;asym&lt;/sub&gt; changes are found and may be of value in the diagnosis of MSA-P.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Audio-visual integration (AVI) is higher in attended conditions than in unattended conditions. Here, we explore the AVI effect when the attentional recourse is competed by additional visual distractors, and its aging effect using single- and dual-tasks. The results showed the highest AVI effect under single-task-attentional-load condition than under no- and dual-task-attentional-load conditions (all P &amp;lt; 0.05) in both older and younger groups, but the AVI effect was weaker and delayed for older adults compared to younger adults for all attentional-load conditions (all P &amp;lt; 0.05). The non-phase-locked oscillation for AVI analysis illustrated the highest theta and alpha oscillatory activity for single-task-attentional-load condition than for no- and dual-task-attentional-load conditions, and the AVI oscillatory activity mainly occurred in the Cz, CP1 and Oz of older adults but in the Fz, FC1, and Cz of younger adults. The AVI effect was significantly negatively correlated with FC1 (r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.1468, P = 0.05) and Cz (r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.1447, P = 0.048) theta activity and with Fz (r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.1557, P = 0.043), FC1 (r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.1042, P = 0.008), and Cz (r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.0897, P = 0.010) alpha activity for older adults but not for younger adults in dual task. These results suggested a reduction in AVI ability for peripheral stimuli and a shift in AVI oscillation from anterior to posterior regions in older adults as an adaptive mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 We previously identified and modeled a principle of visual map alignment in the midbrain involving the mapping of the retinal projections and concurrent transposition of retinal guidance cues into the superior colliculus providing positional information for the organization of cortical V1 projections onto the retinal map (Savier et al., 2017). This principle relies on mechanisms involving Epha/Efna signaling, correlated neuronal activity and axon competition. Here, using the 3-step map alignment computational model, we predict and validate in vivo the visual mapping defects in a well-characterized mouse model. Our results challenge previous hypotheses and provide an alternative, although complementary, explanation for the phenotype observed. In addition, we propose a new quantification method to assess the degree of alignment and organization between maps, allowing inter-model comparisons. This work generalizes the validity and robustness of the 3-step map alignment algorithm as a predictive tool and confirms the basic mechanisms of visual map organization.</content>

 An important challenge of crop improvement strategies is assigning function to paralogs in polyploid crops. Here, we describe the circadian transcriptome in the polyploid crop &lt;i&gt;Brassica rapa&lt;/i&gt;. Strikingly, almost three quarters of expressed genes exhibited circadian rhythmicity. Genetic redundancy resulting from whole genome duplication is thought to facilitate evolutionary change through sub- and neo-functionalization among paralogous gene pairs. We observed genome-wide expansion of circadian expression phase among retained paralogous pairs. Using gene regulatory network models, we compared transcription factor targets between &lt;i&gt;B. rapa&lt;/i&gt; and Arabidopsis circadian networks to reveal evidence for divergence between &lt;i&gt;B. rapa&lt;/i&gt; paralogs that may be driven in part by variation in conserved non-coding sequences (CNS). Additionally, differential drought response among retained paralogous pairs suggests further functional diversification. These findings support the rapid expansion and divergence of the transcriptional network in a polyploid crop and offer a new approach for assessing paralog activity at the transcript level.</content>

 Natural sounds convey information via frequency and amplitude modulations (FM and AM). Humans are acutely sensitive to the slow rates of FM that are crucial for speech and music. This sensitivity has long been thought to rely on precise stimulus-driven auditory-nerve spike timing (time code), whereas a coarser code, based on variations in the cochlear place of stimulation (place code), represents faster FM rates. We tested this theory in listeners with normal and impaired hearing, spanning a wide range of place-coding fidelity. Contrary to predictions, sensitivity to both slow and fast FM correlated with place-coding fidelity. We also used incoherent AM on two carriers to simulate place coding of FM and observed poorer sensitivity at high carrier frequencies and fast rates, two properties of FM detection previously ascribed to the limits of time coding. The results suggest a unitary place-based neural code for FM across all rates and carrier frequencies.</content>

 Adhesion-type GPCRs (aGPCRs) participate in a vast range of physiological processes. Their frequent association with mechanosensitive functions suggests that processing of mechanical stimuli may be a common feature of this receptor family. Previously, we reported that the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; aGPCR CIRL sensitizes sensory responses to gentle touch and sound by amplifying signal transduction in low-threshold mechanoreceptors (Scholz et al., 2017). Here, we show that &lt;i&gt;Cirl&lt;/i&gt; is also expressed in high-threshold mechanical nociceptors where it adjusts nocifensive behaviour under physiological and pathological conditions. Optogenetic &lt;i&gt;in vivo &lt;/i&gt;experiments indicate that CIRL lowers cAMP levels in both mechanosensory submodalities. However, contrasting its role in touch-sensitive neurons, CIRL dampens the response of nociceptors to mechanical stimulation. Consistent with this finding, rat nociceptors display decreased &lt;i&gt;Cirl1&lt;/i&gt; expression during allodynia. Thus, cAMP-downregulation by CIRL exerts opposing effects on low-threshold mechanosensors and high-threshold nociceptors. This intriguing bipolar action facilitates the separation of mechanosensory signals carrying different physiological information.</content>

 The CNS accommodates a diverse myeloid immune cell compartment that maintains CNS homeostasis in the steady state while contributing to tissue injury during infectious, autoimmune, and neurodegenerative disease conditions. Autophagy and autophagy proteins play fundamental roles in myeloid cell–related immune functions. Many of these processes do not necessarily involve the canonical formation of a double-membrane structure known as the ‘autophagosome’ and reflect noncanonical functions of the autophagy machinery.</content>

 How do four-legged animals adapt their locomotion to the environment? How do central and peripheral mechanisms interact within the spinal cord to produce adaptive locomotion and how is locomotion recovered when spinal circuits are perturbed? Salamanders are the only tetrapods that regenerate voluntary locomotion after full spinal transection. Given their evolutionary position, they provide a unique opportunity to bridge discoveries made in fish and mammalian models. Genetic dissection of salamander neural circuits is becoming feasible with new methods for precise manipulation, elimination, and visualisation of cells.</content>

Understanding evolution requires detailed knowledge of genotype-phenotype maps; however, it can be a herculean task to measure every phenotype in a combinatorial map. We have developed a computational strategy to predict the missing phenotypes from an incomplete, combinatorial genotype-phenotype map. As a test case, we used an incomplete genotype-phenotype dataset previously generated for the malaria parasite’s ‘chloroquine resistance transporter’ (PfCRT). Wild-type PfCRT (PfCRT&lt;sup&gt;3D7&lt;/sup&gt;) lacks significant chloroquine (CQ) transport activity, but the introduction of the eight mutations present in the ‘Dd2’ isoform of PfCRT (PfCRT&lt;sup&gt;Dd2&lt;/sup&gt;) enables the protein to transport CQ away from its site of antimalarial action. This gain of a transport function imparts CQ resistance to the parasite. A combinatorial map between PfCRT&lt;sup&gt;3D7&lt;/sup&gt; and PfCRT&lt;sup&gt;Dd2&lt;/sup&gt; consists of 256 genotypes, of which only 52 have had their CQ transport activities measured through expression in the &lt;i&gt;Xenopus laevis&lt;/i&gt; oocyte. We trained a statistical model with these 52 measurements to infer the CQ transport activity for the remaining 204 combinatorial genotypes between PfCRT&lt;sup&gt;3D7&lt;/sup&gt; and PfCRT&lt;sup&gt;Dd2&lt;/sup&gt;. Our best-performing model incorporated a binary classifier, a nonlinear scale, and additive effects for each mutation. The addition of specific pairwise- and high-order-epistatic coefficients decreased the predictive power of the model. We evaluated our predictions by experimentally measuring the CQ transport activities of 24 additional PfCRT genotypes. The R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; value between our predicted and newly-measured phenotypes was 0.90. We then used the model to probe the accessibility of evolutionary trajectories through the map. Approximately 1% of the possible trajectories between PfCRT&lt;sup&gt;3D7&lt;/sup&gt; and PfCRT&lt;sup&gt;Dd2&lt;/sup&gt; are accessible; however, none of the trajectories entailed eight successive increases in CQ transport activity. These results demonstrate that phenotypes can be inferred with known uncertainty from a partial genotype-phenotype dataset. We also validated our approach against a collection of previously published genotype-phenotype maps. The model therefore appears general and should be applicable to a large number of genotype-phenotype maps.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ACe5JeGOk7c&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Dynamic flux balance analysis uses a quasi-steady state assumption to calculate an organism’s metabolic activity at each time-step of a dynamic simulation, using the well-known technique of flux balance analysis. For microbial communities, this calculation is especially costly and involves solving a linear constrained optimization problem for each member of the community at each time step. However, this is unnecessary and inefficient, as prior solutions can be used to inform future time steps. Here, we show that a basis for the space of internal fluxes can be chosen for each microbe in a community and this basis can be used to simulate forward by solving a relatively inexpensive system of linear equations at most time steps. We can use this solution as long as the resulting metabolic activity remains within the optimization problem’s constraints (i.e. the solution to the linear system of equations remains a feasible to the linear program). As the solution becomes infeasible, it first becomes a feasible but degenerate solution to the optimization problem, and we can solve a different but related optimization problem to choose an appropriate basis to continue forward simulation. We demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of our method by comparing with currently used methods on a four species community, and show that our method requires at least 91% fewer optimizations to be solved. For reproducibility, we prototyped the method using Python.

Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) produced by gastrointestinal microbiota regulate immune responses, but host molecular mechanisms remain unknown. Unbiased screening using SCFA-conjugated affinity nanobeads identified apoptosis-associated speck-like protein (ASC), an adaptor protein of inflammasome complex, as a noncanonical SCFA receptor besides GPRs. SCFAs promoted inflammasome activation in macrophages by binding to its ASC PYRIN domain. Activated inflammasome suppressed survival of &lt;i&gt;Salmonella enterica&lt;/i&gt; serovar Typhimurium (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. Typhimurium) in macrophages by pyroptosis and facilitated neutrophil recruitment to promote bacterial elimination and thus inhibit systemic dissemination in the host. Administration of SCFAs or dietary fibers, which are fermented to SCFAs by gut bacteria, significantly prolonged the survival of &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. Typhimurium–infected mice through ASC-mediated inflammasome activation. SCFAs penetrated into the inflammatory region of the infected gut mucosa to protect against infection. This study provided evidence that SCFAs suppress &lt;i&gt;Salmonella&lt;/i&gt; infection via inflammasome activation, shedding new light on the therapeutic activity of dietary fiber.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/QtDva5UmCgg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

The Myriapoda, composed of millipedes and centipedes, is a fascinating but poorly understood branch of life, including species with a highly unusual body plan and a range of unique adaptations to their environment. Here, we sequenced and assembled 2 chromosomal-level genomes of the millipedes &lt;i&gt;Helicorthomorpha holstii&lt;/i&gt; (assembly size = 182 Mb; shortest scaffold/contig length needed to cover 50% of the genome [N50] = 18.11 Mb mainly on 8 pseudomolecules) and &lt;i&gt;Trigoniulus corallinus&lt;/i&gt; (assembly size = 449 Mb, N50 = 26.78 Mb mainly on 17 pseudomolecules). Unique genomic features, patterns of gene regulation, and defence systems in millipedes, not observed in other arthropods, are revealed. Both repeat content and intron size are major contributors to the observed differences in millipede genome size. Tight Hox and the first loose ecdysozoan ParaHox homeobox clusters are identified, and a myriapod-specific genomic rearrangement including &lt;i&gt;Hox3&lt;/i&gt; is also observed. The Argonaute (AGO) proteins for loading small RNAs are duplicated in both millipedes, but unlike in insects, an AGO duplicate has become a pseudogene. Evidence of post-transcriptional modification in small RNAs—including species-specific microRNA arm switching—providing differential gene regulation is also obtained. Millipedes possesses a unique ozadene defensive gland unlike the venomous forcipules found in centipedes. We identify sets of genes associated with the ozadene that play roles in chemical defence as well as antimicrobial activity. Macro-synteny analyses revealed highly conserved genomic blocks between the 2 millipedes and deuterostomes. Collectively, our analyses of millipede genomes reveal that a series of unique adaptations have occurred in this major lineage of arthropod diversity. The 2 high-quality millipede genomes provided here shed new light on the conserved and lineage-specific features of millipedes and centipedes. These findings demonstrate the importance of the consideration of both centipede and millipede genomes—and in particular the reconstruction of the myriapod ancestral situation—for future research to improve understanding of arthropod evolution, and animal evolutionary genomics more widely.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/kaYcF_lVjGc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parkinson's disease (PD) has useful symptomatic treatments that do not slow the neurodegenerative process, and no significant disease‐modifying treatments are approved. A key therapeutic target in PD is α‐synuclein (αS), which is both genetically implicated and accumulates in Lewy bodies rich in vesicles and other lipid membranes. Reestablishing αS homeostasis is a central goal in PD. Based on previous lipidomic analyses, we conducted a mouse trial of a stearoyl‐CoA desaturase (SCD) inhibitor (“5b”) that prevented αS‐positive vesicular inclusions and cytotoxicity in cultured human neurons.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oral dosing and brain activity of 5b were established in non‐tg mice. 5b in drinking water was given to mice expressing WT human αS (WT) or an amplified familial PD αS mutation [E35K+E46K+E61K (‘3K’)] beginning near the onset of nigral and cortical neurodegeneration and the robust PD‐like motor syndrome in 3K. Motor phenotypes, brain cytopathology and SCD‐related lipid changes were quantified in 5b‐ vs. placebo‐treated mice. Outcomes were compared to effects of crossing 3K to SCD1&lt;sup&gt;‐/‐&lt;/sup&gt; mice.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5b treatment reduced αS hyperphosphorylation in E46K‐expressing human neurons, in 3K neural cultures and in both WT and 3K αS mice. 5b prevented subtle gait deficits in WT αS mice and the PD‐like resting tremor and progressive motor decline of 3K αS mice. 5b also increased αS tetramers and reduced PK‐resistant lipid‐rich aggregates. Similar benefits accrued from genetically deleting one SCD allele, providing target validation.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prolonged reduction of brain SCD activity prevented PD‐like neuropathology in multiple PD models. Thus, an orally available SCD inhibitor potently ameliorates PD phenotypes, positioning this approach to treat human α‐synucleinopathies.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The longitudinal association of the blood biomarkers total tau (t‐tau), neurofilament light (Nf‐L), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) with common sporadic Alzheimer disease (AD) and cognitive decline is not established.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a single molecule array technology, ultrasensitive immunoassays for serum concentrations of t‐tau, Nf‐L, and GFAP were measured in a population sample of 1,327 participants (60% African Americans and women) who had a clinical evaluation for AD, had completed in‐home cognitive assessments, and had undergone 1.5T structural magnetic resonance imaging.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higher concentrations of serum biomarkers were associated with the development of clinical AD; especially, the time‐specific associations were notable: t‐tau 8 to 16 years, and Nf‐L and GFAP 4 to 8 years prior to clinical AD. Serum biomarkers were associated with faster cognitive decline over 16 years; baseline t‐tau &amp;gt; 0.40pg/ml had 30% faster decline, Nf‐L &amp;gt; 25.5pg/ml had 110% faster decline, and GFAP &amp;gt; 232pg/ml had 130% faster decline compared to those in the lowest quartile. Participants with baseline GFAP &amp;gt; 232pg/ml showed 160% faster decline in hippocampal volume compared to those with values &amp;lt; 160pg/ml. Additionally, higher baseline t‐tau was associated with faster increase in 3rd ventricular volume, and baseline Nf‐L and GFAP were associated with faster decline in cortical thickness.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serum t‐tau, Nf‐L, and GFAP predict the development of sporadic AD and cognitive decline, and changes in structural brain characteristics, suggesting their usefulness not only as screening and predictive biomarkers, but also in capturing the pathogenesis of Alzheimer dementia.

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Neural anatomy of echinoid early juveniles and comparison of nervous system organization in echinoderms&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/677feba9-8624-4ed1-853c-dbce1e16120b/cne25012-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Graphical Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whole mount immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy were used on juveniles of three echinoderm species to characterize their neuroanatomy. Detailed comparisons confirmed the conservation, among the three species, of a similar general neuroanatomical organization and revealed equivalent innervation patterns at the level of the appendages (i.e., the podia and the spines).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The echinoderms are a phylum of marine deuterostomes characterized by the pentaradial (five fold) symmetry of their adult bodies. Due to this unusual body plan, adult echinoderms have long been excluded from comparative analyses aimed at understanding the origin and evolution of deuterostome nervous systems. Here, we investigated the neural anatomy of early juveniles of representatives of three of the five echinoderm classes: the echinoid &lt;i&gt;Paracentrotus lividus&lt;/i&gt;, the asteroid &lt;i&gt;Patiria miniata&lt;/i&gt;, and the holothuroid &lt;i&gt;Parastichopus parvimensis&lt;/i&gt;. Using whole mount immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy, we found that the nervous system of echinoid early juveniles is composed of three main structures: a basiepidermal nerve plexus, five radial nerve cords connected by a circumoral nerve ring, and peripheral nerves innervating the appendages. Our whole mount preparations further allowed us to obtain thorough descriptions of these structures and of several innervation patterns, in particular at the level of the appendages. Detailed comparisons of the echinoid juvenile nervous system with those of asteroid and holothuroid juveniles moreover supported a general conservation of the main neural structures in all three species, including at the level of the appendages. Our results support the previously proposed hypotheses for the existence of two neural units in echinoderms: one consisting of the basiepidermal nerve plexus to process sensory stimuli locally and one composed of the radial nerve cords and the peripheral nerves constituting a centralized control system. This study provides the basis for more in‐depth comparisons of the echinoderm adult nervous system with those of other animals, in particular hemichordates and chordates, to address the long‐standing controversies about deuterostome nervous system evolution.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Homeostasis is indispensable to counteract the destabilizing effects of Hebbian plasticity. Although it is commonly assumed that homeostasis modulates synaptic strength, membrane excitability, and firing rates, its role at the neural circuit and network level is unknown.

		<id>/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25918?af=R</id>

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To infer causal relationships between 22 previously reported risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and the “AD phenome”: AD, AD age of onset (AAOS), hippocampal volume, cortical surface area and thickness, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of Aβ&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt;, tau, and ptau&lt;sub&gt;181&lt;/sub&gt;, and the neuropathological burden of neuritic plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and vascular brain injury (VBI).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polygenic risk scores (PRS) for the 22 risk factors were computed in 26,431 AD cases/controls and the association with AD was evaluated using logistic regression. Two‐sample Mendelian randomization was used to infer the causal effect of risk factors on the AD phenome.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PRS for increased education and diastolic blood pressure were associated with reduced risk for AD. MR indicated that only education was causally associated with reduced risk of AD, delayed AAOS, and increased cortical surface area and thickness. Total‐ and LDL‐cholesterol levels were causally associated with increased neuritic plaque burden, though the effects were driven by SNPs within the &lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt; locus. Diastolic blood pressure and pulse pressure are causally associated with increased risk of VBI. Furthermore, total cholesterol was associated with decreased hippocampal volume; smoking initiation with decreased cortical thickness; type 2 diabetes with an earlier AAOS; and sleep duration with increased cortical thickness.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our comprehensive examination of the genetic evidence for the causal relationships between previously reported risk factors in AD using PRS and MR, supports a causal role for education, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, smoking, and diabetes with the AD phenome.&lt;/p&gt;

		<link href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.581075"/>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;It was long thought that astrocytes, given their lack of electrical signaling, were not involved in communication with neurons. However, we now know that one astrocyte on average maintains and regulates the extracellular neurotransmitter and potassium levels of more than 140,000 synapses, both excitatory and inhibitory, within their individual domains, and form a syncytium that can propagate calcium waves to affect distant cells via release of “gliotransmitters” such as glutamate, ATP, or adenosine. Neuromodulators can affect signal-to-noise and frequency transmission within cortical circuits by effects on inhibition, allowing for the filtering of relevant vs. irrelevant stimuli. Moreover, synchronized “resting” and desynchronized “activated” brain states are gated by short bursts of high-frequency neuromodulatory activity, highlighting the need for neuromodulation that is robust, rapid, and far-reaching. As many neuromodulators are released in a volume manner where degradation/uptake and the confines of the complex CNS limit diffusion distance, we ask the question—are astrocytes responsible for rapidly extending neuromodulator actions to every synapse? Neuromodulators are known to influence transitions between brain states, leading to control over plasticity, responses to salient stimuli, wakefulness, and sleep. These rapid and wide-spread state transitions demand that neuromodulators can simultaneously influence large and diverse regions in a manner that should be impossible given the limitations of simple diffusion. Intriguingly, astrocytes are ideally situated to amplify/extend neuromodulator effects over large populations of synapses given that each astrocyte can: (1) ensheath a large number of synapses; (2) release gliotransmitters (glutamate/ATP/adenosine) known to affect inhibition; (3) regulate extracellular potassium that can affect excitability and excitation/inhibition balance; and (4) express receptors for all neuromodulators. In this review article, we explore the hypothesis that astrocytes extend and amplify neuromodulatory influences on neuronal networks via alterations in calcium dynamics, the release of gliotransmitters, and potassium homeostasis. Given that neuromodulatory networks are at the core of our sleep-wake cycle and behavioral states, and determine how we interact with our environment, this review article highlights the importance of basic astrocyte function in homeostasis, general cognition, and psychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Conditioning, extinction, and reinstatement are fundamental learning processes of animal adaptation, also strongly involved in human pathologies such as post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, depression, and dependencies. Cued fear conditioning, extinction, restatement, and systematic manipulations of the underlying brain amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex, represent key experimental paradigms to study such processes. Numerous empirical studies have revealed several aspects and the neural systems and plasticity underlying them, but at the moment we lack a comprehensive view. Here we propose a computational model based on firing rate leaky units that contributes to such integration by accounting for 25 different experiments on fear conditioning, extinction, and restatement, on the basis of a single neural architecture having a structure and plasticity grounded in known brain biology. This allows the model to furnish three novel contributions to understand these open issues: (a) the functioning of the central and lateral amygdala system supporting conditioning; (b) the role played by the endocannabinoids system in within- and between-session extinction; (c) the formation of three important types of neurons underlying fear processing, namely fear, extinction, and persistent neurons. The model integration of the results on fear conditioning goes substantially beyond what was done in previous models.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) biomarkers require complex processing routines that are time-consuming and labor-intensive for clinical users. The Single Subject Brain Analysis Toolbox (SeSBAT) is a fully automated MATLAB toolbox with a graphical user interface (GUI) that offers standardized and optimized protocols for the pre-processing and analysis of anatomical MRI data at the single-subject level. In this study, the two-fold strategy provided by SeSBAT is illustrated through its application on a cohort of 42 patients with Huntington’s disease (HD), in pre-manifest and early manifest stages, as a suitable model of neurodegenerative processes. On the one hand, hypothesis-driven analysis can be used to extract biomarkers of neurodegeneration in specific brain regions of interest (ROI-based analysis). On the other hand, an exploratory voxel-based morphometry (VBM) approach can detect volume changes due to neurodegeneration throughout the whole brain (whole-brain analysis). That illustration reveals the potential of SeSBAT in providing potential prognostic biomarkers in neurodegenerative processes in clinics, which could be critical to overcoming the limitations of current qualitative evaluation strategies, and thus improve the diagnosis and monitoring of neurodegenerative disorders. Furthermore, the importance of the availability of tools for characterization at the single-subject level has been emphasized, as there is high interindividual variability in the pattern of neurodegeneration. Thus, tools like SeSBAT could pave the way towards more effective and personalized medicine.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;A growing body of evidence indicates that microglia actively remove synapses in vivo, thereby playing a key role in synaptic refinement and modulation of brain connectivity. This phenomenon was mainly investigated in immunofluorescence staining and confocal microscopy. However, a quantification of synaptic material in microglia using these techniques is extremely time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address this issue, we aimed to quantify synaptic proteins in microglia using flow cytometry. With this approach, we first showed that microglia from the healthy adult mouse brain contain a detectable level of VGLUT1 protein. Next, we found more than two-fold increased VGLUT1 immunoreactivity in microglia from the developing brain (P15) as compared to adult microglia. These data indicate that microglia-mediated synaptic pruning mostly occurs during the brain developmental period. We then quantified the VGLUT1 staining in microglia in two transgenic models characterized by pathological microglia-mediated synaptic pruning. In the 5xFAD mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) microglia exhibited a significant increase in VGLUT1 immunoreactivity before the onset of amyloid pathology. Moreover, conditional deletion of TDP-43 in microglia, which causes a hyper-phagocytic phenotype associated with synaptic loss, also resulted in increased VGLUT1 immunoreactivity within microglia. This work provides a quantitative assessment of synaptic proteins in microglia, under homeostasis, and in mouse models of disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Optic neuritis (ON) is one of the most frequent symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS) that results in progressive loss of axons and neurons. In clinical trials of Traditional Chinese Medicine, needling at the GB20 acupoint has been widely used for the treatment of ocular diseases, including ON. However, the molecular mechanisms of needling at this site are still unclear. In this study, we generated an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model and investigated the effects of needling treatment at the GB20 acupoint on retina with EAE-associated ON. RNA sequencing of the retinal transcriptome revealed that, of the 234 differentially expressed genes induced by ON, 100 genes were upregulated, and 134 genes were downregulated by ON, while needling at the GB20 acupoint specifically reversed the expression of 21 genes compared with control treatment at GV16 acupoint. Among the reversed genes, Nr4a3, Sncg, Uchl1, and Tppp3 were involved in axon development and regeneration and were downregulated by ON, indicating the beneficial effect of needling at GB20. Further gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis revealed that needling at GB20 affected the molecular process of Circadian rhythm in mouse retina with ON. Our study first reported that needling treatment after ON at the GB20 acupoint regulated gene expression of the retina and reversed the expression of downregulated axon development-related genes. This study also demonstrated that GV16 was a perfect control treatment site for GB20 in animal research. Our study provided a scientific basis for needling treatments at GB20 for ocular diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Objective&lt;p&gt;Neuroaxonal damage is reflected by serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL) values in a variety of acute and degenerative diseases of the brain. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of febrile and epileptic seizures on sNfL, serum copeptin, and prolactin levels in children compared with children with febrile infections without convulsions.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;A prospective cross-sectional study was performed in children aging 6 months to 5 years presenting with fever (controls, n = 61), febrile seizures (FS, n = 78), or epileptic seizures (ES, n = 16) at our emergency department. sNfL, copeptin, and prolactin were measured within a few hours after the event in addition to standard clinical, neurophysiological, and laboratory assessment. All children were followed up for at least 1 year after presentation concerning recurrent seizures.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Serum copeptin values were on average 4.1-fold higher in FS and 3.2-fold higher in ES compared with controls (both p &amp;lt; 0.01). Serum prolactin values were on average 1.3-fold higher in FS compared with controls ( p &amp;lt; 0.01) and without difference between ES and controls. There was no significant difference of mean sNfL values (95% CI) between all three groups, FS 21.7 pg/ml (19.6–23.9), ES 17.7 pg/ml (13.8–21.6), and controls 23.4 pg/ml (19.2–27.4). In multivariable analysis, age was the most important predictor of sNfL, followed by sex and C reactive protein. Neither the duration of seizures nor the time elapsed from seizure onset to blood sampling had an impact on sNfL. None of the three biomarkers were related to recurrent seizures.&lt;/p&gt;Significance&lt;p&gt;Serum neurofilament light is not elevated during short recovery time after FS when compared with children presenting febrile infections without seizures. We demonstrate an age-dependent decrease of sNfL from early childhood until school age. In contrast to sNfL levels, copeptin and prolactin serum levels are elevated after FS.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is considered the earliest preclinical stage of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) that precedes mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Effective and accurate diagnosis of SCD is crucial for early detection of and timely intervention in AD. In this study, brain functional connectome (i.e., functional connections and graph theory metrics) based on the resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) provided multiple information about brain networks and has been used to distinguish individuals with SCD from normal controls (NCs). The consensus connections and the discriminative nodal graph metrics selected by group least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) mainly distributed in the prefrontal and frontal cortices and the subcortical regions corresponded to default mode network (DMN) and frontoparietal task control network. Nodal efficiency and nodal shortest path showed the most significant discriminative ability among the selected nodal graph metrics. Furthermore, the comparison results of topological attributes suggested that the brain network integration function was weakened and network segregation function was enhanced in SCD patients. Moreover, the combination of brain connectome information based on multiple kernel-support vector machine (MK-SVM) achieved the best classification performance with 83.33% accuracy, 90.00% sensitivity, and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.927. The findings of this study provided a new perspective to combine machine learning methods with exploration of brain pathophysiological mechanisms in SCD and offered potential neuroimaging biomarkers for diagnosis of early-stage AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Peripheral nerve injury repair has been considered a difficult problem in the field of trauma for a long time. Conventional surgical methods are not applicable in some special types of nerve injury, prompting scholars to seek to develop more effective nerve translocation repair technologies. The purpose of this study was to explore the functional state of neurons in injured lower limbs after translocation repair, with a view to preliminarily clarify the molecular mechanisms underlying this process. Eighteen Sprague–Dawley rats were divided into the normal, tibial nerve in situ repair, and common peroneal nerve transposition repair tibial nerve groups. Nerve function assessment and immunohistochemical staining of neurofilament 200 (NF-200), protein kinase B (Akt), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K) in the dorsal root ganglia were performed at 12 weeks after surgery. Tibial nerve function and neuroelectrophysiological analysis, osmic acid staining, muscle strength testing, and muscle fiber staining showed that the nerve translocation repair could restore the function of the recipient nerve to a certain extent; however, the repair was not as efficient as the in situ repair. Immunohistochemical staining showed that the translocation repair resulted in changes in the microstructure of neuronal cell bodies, and the expressions of Akt, mTOR, and p70S6K in the three dorsal root ganglia groups were significantly different (p &amp;lt; 0.05). This study demonstrates that the nerve translocation repair technology sets up a new reflex loop, with the corresponding neuroskeletal adjustments, in which, donor neurons dominate the recipient nerves. This indicates that nerve translocation repair technology can lead to neuronal remodeling and is important as a supplementary treatment for a peripheral nerve injury. Furthermore, the Akt/mTOR/p70S6K signaling pathway may be involved in the formation of the new neural reflex loop created as a result of the translocation repair.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Background&lt;p&gt;Cognitive impairment is a well-defined complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD), but the neural mechanisms are largely unknown.&lt;/p&gt;Objectives&lt;p&gt;The study aimed to assess white matter (WM) microstructure changes and their relationship with cognitive impairment development during CKD progression.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) datasets were acquired from 38 patients with CKD (19 patients were at stage 3; 19 patients were at stage 4) and 22 healthy controls (HCs). Tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) was implemented to assess the differences in WM integrity among the three groups. The associations between abnormal WM integrity and clinical indicators (digit symbol test scores, the type A number connection test scores, hemoglobin, serum urea, serum creatinine, serum calcium, and serum potassium levels) were also computed.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Compared with patients with CKD at stage 3 and HCs, patients with CKD at stage 4 showed significantly lower fractional anisotropy (FA) and higher mean diffusivity (MD) in the corpus callosum (CC), anterior thalamic radiation, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, and inferior longitudinal fasciculus. Correlation analysis showed that the MD in the genu of CC was negatively associated with the digit symbol test scores (r = -0.61, p = 0.01), and the FA in the left anterior thalamic radiation was positively associated with the level of serum calcium (r = 0.58, p = 0.01).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Patients with non-end-stage CKD have multiple abnormalities in WM regions. DTI metrics change with the progression of CKD and are primarily associated with cognitive impairment. The reduced integrity of WM tracts may be related to a low level of blood calcium.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an effective surgical therapy for Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, limitations of the DBS systems have led to great interest in adaptive neuromodulation systems that can dynamically adjust stimulation parameters to meet concurrent therapeutic demand. Constant high-frequency motor cortex stimulation has not been remarkably efficacious, which has led to greater focus on modulation of subcortical targets. Understanding of the importance of timing in both cortical and subcortical stimulation has generated an interest in developing more refined, parsimonious stimulation techniques based on critical oscillatory activities of the brain. Concurrently, much effort has been put into identifying biomarkers of both parkinsonian and physiological patterns of neuronal activities to drive next generation of adaptive brain stimulation systems. One such biomarker is beta-gamma phase amplitude coupling (PAC) that is detected in the motor cortex. PAC is strongly correlated with parkinsonian specific motor signs and symptoms and respond to therapies in a dose-dependent manner. PAC may represent the overall state of the parkinsonian motor network and have less instantaneously dynamic fluctuation during movement. These findings raise the possibility of novel neuromodulation paradigms that are potentially less invasiveness than DBS. Successful application of PAC in neuromodulation may necessitate phase-dependent stimulation technique, which aims to deliver precisely timed stimulation pulses to a specific phase to predictably modulate to selectively modulate pathological network activities and behavior in real time. Overcoming current technical challenges can lead to deeper understanding of the parkinsonian pathophysiology and development of novel neuromodulatory therapies with potentially less side-effects and higher therapeutic efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The simultaneous transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) offers a unique opportunity to non-invasively stimulate brain circuits while simultaneously monitoring changes in brain activity. However, to take advantage of this multimodal technique, some technical issues need to be considered/addressed. In this work, we evaluated technical issues associated with the setup and utilization of this multimodal tool, such as the use of a large single-channel radio frequency (rf) coil, and the artifacts induced by TMS when interleaved with the echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence. We demonstrated that good image quality can be achieved with this rf coil and that the adoption of axial imaging orientation in conjunction with a safe interval of 100 ms, between the TMS pulse and imaging acquisition, is a suitable combination to eliminate potential image artifacts when using the combined TMS-fMRI technique in 3-T MRI scanners.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Growing evidence indicates that electroacupuncture (EA) has a definite effect on the treatment of peripheral nerve injury (PNI), but its mechanism is not completely clear. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in the regulation of a variety of biological processes, and EA may enhance PNI repair by regulating miRNAs. In this study, the rat sciatic nerve injury model was treated with EA for 4 weeks. Acupoints Huantiao (GB30) and Zusanli (ST36) were stimulated by EA 20 min once a day, 6 days a week for 4 weeks. We found that EA treatment downregulated the expression of miR-1b in the local injured nerve. In vitro experiments showed that overexpression of miR-1b inhibited the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in rat Schwann cell (SC) line, while BDNF knockdown inhibited the proliferation, migration, and promoted apoptosis of SCs. Subsequently, the rat model of sciatic nerve injury was treated by EA treatment and injection of agomir-1b or antagomir-1b. The nerve conduction velocity ratio (NCV), sciatic functional index (SFI), and S100 immunofluorescence staining were examined and showed that compared with the model group, NCV, SFI, proliferation of SC, and expression of BDNF in the injured nerves of rats treated with EA or EA + anti-miR-1b were elevated, while EA + miR-1b was reduced, indicating that EA promoted sciatic nerve function recovery and SC proliferation through downregulating miR-1b. To summarize, EA may promote the proliferation, migration of SC, and nerve repair after PNI by regulating miR-1b, which targets BDNF.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Background: In the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), microglia play an increasingly important role. Molecular imaging of neuroinflammatory targeting microglia activation and the high expression of 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO) has become a hot topic of research in recent years. Dynamic monitoring neuroinflammation is crucial for discovering the best time point of anti-inflammatory therapy. Motivated by this, Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging in an APP/PS1 mouse model of AD, using &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-labeled DPA-714 to monitor microglia activation and neuroinflammation, were performed in this paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We prepared [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]DPA714 and tested the biological characteristics of the molecular probe in normal mice. To obtain a higher radiochemical yield, we improved the [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]-fluorination conditions in the precursor dosage, reaction temperature, and synthesis time. We performed [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]DPA714 PET scanning on APP/PS1 mice at 6–7, 9–10, 12–13, and 15–16 months of age, respectively. The same experiments were conducted in Wild-type (Wt) mice as a control. Referring to the [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]DPA714 concentrated situation in the brain, we performed blocking experiments with PK11195 (1 mg/kg) in 12–13-months-old APP/PS1 mice to confirm the specificity of [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]DPA714 for TSPO in the APP/PS1 mice. Reconstructed brain PET images, fused with the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) template atlas, and the volumes of interests (VOIs) of the hippocampus and cortex were determined. The distribution of [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]DPA714 in the brain tissues of 15–16-months-old APP/PS1 and Wt mice were studied by immunofluorescence staining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Through the reaction of &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F, with 2 mg precursor dissolved in 300 ul acetonitrile at 105°C for 10 min, we obtained the optimal radiochemical yield of 42.3 ± 5.1% (non-decay correction). Quantitative analysis of brain PET images showed that the [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]DPA714 uptake in the cortex and hippocampus of 12–13-months-old APP/PS1 mice was higher than that of the control mice of the same age (cortex/muscle: 2.77 ± 0.13 vs. 1.93 ± 0.32, p = 0.0014; hippocampus/muscle: 3.33 ± 0.10 vs. 2.10 ± 0.35, p = 0.0008). The same significant difference was found between 15- and 16-months-old APP/PS1 mice (cortex/muscle: 2.64 ± 0.14 vs. 1.86 ± 0.52, p=0.0159; hippocampus/muscle: 2.89 ± 0.53 vs. 1.77 ± 0.48, p = 0.0050). Immunofluorescence staining showed that the activation of microglia and the level of TSPO expression in the cortex and hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice were significantly higher than Wt mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]DPA714, a molecular probe for targeting TSPO, showed great potential in monitoring microglia activation and neuroinflammation, which can be helpful in discovering the best time point for anti-inflammatory therapy in AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;To more efficiently communicate the results of neuropsychological assessment to interdisciplinary teams, the University of Florida Neuropsychology Service developed a Deep Brain Stimulation-Cognitive Rating Scale (DBS-CRS). This tool condensed results of a 3-h exam into a five-point scale ranging from 1 (least) to 5 (most) cognitive concern for DBS surgery. In this study, we evaluated the role of the DBS-CRS in clinical decisions by the interdisciplinary team to proceed to surgery, its relationship to objective neuropsychological scores, and its predictive utility for clinical outcome. We retrospectively examined 189 patients with Parkinson’s disease who were evaluated for DBS candidacy (mean age 64.8 [SD 9.2], disease duration 8.9 years [SD 5.0], UPDRS-Part III off medication 38.5 [SD 10.5], Dementia Rating Scale-II 135.4 [SD 6.0]). Approximately 19% of patients did not proceed to surgery, with neuropsychological red flags being the most commonly documented reason (57%). Patients who underwent DBS surgery had significantly better DBS-CRS scores than those who did not (p &amp;lt; 0.001). The two strongest and unique neuropsychological contributors to DBS-CRS ratings were delayed memory and executive function, followed by language and visuoperception, based on hierarchical linear regression that accounted for 77.2% of the variance. In terms of outcome, DBS-CRS scores were associated with higher quality of life, less severe motor symptoms, and better daily functioning 6 months following DBS surgery. Together, these findings support the construct and predictive validity of the DBS-CRS as a concise tool for effectively communicating pre-DBS cognitive concerns to an interdisciplinary team, thereby aiding decision making in potential DBS candidates.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Gait analysis involving cognitive-motor dual task (DT) is a diagnostic tool in geriatrics. Cognitive-motor interference effects during DT, such as decreased walking speed and increased step-to-step variability, have a high predictive value for fall risk and cognitive decline. Previously we showed the feasibility of DT during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) using an MRI-compatible stepping device. Here, we improved the DT-fMRI protocol with respect to task difficulty and signal robustness, making it more suitable for individualized analysis to better understand the neuronal substrates of cognitive-motor interference effects. Thirty healthy elderly subjects performed cognitive and motor single tasks (ST; stepping or finger tapping), as well as combined cognitive-motor DT during fMRI. After whole brain group level analysis, a region-of-interest (ROI) analysis and the computation of dual task costs (DTC = activation difference ratio ST/DT) at individual level were performed. Activations in the primary (M1) and secondary motor as well as in parietal and prefrontal cortex were measured at the group level during DT. Motor areas showed decreased activation whereas parietal and prefrontal areas showed increased activation in DT vs. ST. Stepping yielded more distinctive activations in DT vs. ST than finger tapping. At the individual level, the most robust activations (based on occurrence probability and signal strength) were measured in the stepping condition, in M1, supplementary motor area (SMA) and superior parietal lobule/intraparietal sulcus (SPL/IPS). The distribution of individual DTC in SPL/IPS during stepping suggested a separation of subjects in groups with high vs. low DTC. This study proposes an improved cognitive-motor DT-fMRI protocol and a standardized analysis routine of functional neuronal markers for cognitive-motor interference at the individual level.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Although theta-burst stimulation (TBS) is known to differentially modify motor cortical excitability according to stimulus conditions in humans, whether similar effects can be seen in animals, in particular rats, remains to be defined. Given the importance of experimental rat models for humans, this study explored this stimulation paradigm in rats. Specifically, this study aimed to explore corticospinal excitability after TBS in anesthetized animals to confirm its comparability with human results. Both inhibition-facilitation configurations using paired electrical stimulation protocols and the effects of the TBS paradigm on motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) in rat descending motor pathways were assessed. Paired-stimulation MEPs showed inhibition [interstimulus interval (ISI): 3 ms] and facilitation (11 ms) patterns under medetomidine/midazolam/butorphanol (MMB) anesthesia. Furthermore, while ketamine and xylazine (K/X) anesthesia completely blocked facilitation at 11-ms ISI, inhibition at a 3-ms ISI was preserved. Continuous and intermittent TBS strongly facilitated MEPs depending on stimulus intensity, persisting for up to 25 min under both MMB and K/X anesthesia. These findings are similar to the intracortical inhibition and facilitation observed in the human motor cortex using paired-pulse magnetic stimulation, particularly the glutamate-mediated facilitation phase. However, different TBS facilitatory mechanisms occur in the rat motor cortex. These different TBS facilitatory mechanisms affect the comparability and interpretations of TBS between rat and human models.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Research over the last couple of decades has provided novel insights into lactate neurobiology and the implications of lactate transport-driven neuroenergetics in health and diseases of peripheral nerve and the brain. The expression pattern of lactate transporters in glia and neurons has now been described, though notable controversies and discrepancies remain. Importantly, down- and up-regulation experiments are underway to better understand the function of these transporters in different systems. Lactate transporters in peripheral nerves are important for maintenance of axon and myelin integrity, motor end-plate integrity, the development of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN), and the functional recovery following nerve injuries. Similarly, brain energy metabolism and functions ranging from development to synaptic plasticity to axonal integrity are also dependent on lactate transport primarily between glia and neurons. This review is focused on critically analysing the expression pattern and the functions of lactate transporters in peripheral nerves and the brain and highlighting their role in glia-neuron metabolic crosstalk in physiological and pathological conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) is considered a preclinical condition of mild cognitive impairment and thought to precede dementia. However, as the principal cholinergic source of hippocampus, whether the septo-hippocampal neurocircuit was impaired after CCH is still unknown. In this study, we established the CCH rat model by bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (2VO). Under anesthesia, the medial septum (MS) of rats was stimulated to evoke the field excitatory post-synaptic potential (fEPSP) in the pyramidal cell layer of dCA1. Consequently, we observed decreased amplitude of fEPSP and increased paired-pulse ratio (PPR) after 8-week CCH. After tail pinch, we also found decreased peak frequency and shortened duration of hippocampal theta rhythm in 2VO rats, indicating the dysfunction of septo-hippocampal neurocircuit. Besides, by intracerebroventricularly injecting GABAergic inhibitor (bicuculline) and cholinergic inhibitors (scopolamine and mecamylamine), we found that CCH impaired both the pre-synaptic cholinergic release and the post-synaptic nAChR function in MS–dCA1 circuits. These results gave an insight into the role of CCH in the impairment of cholinergic MS–dCA1 neurocircuits. These findings may provide a new idea about the CCH-induced neurodegenerative changes.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Convincing evidence has repeatedly shown that new neurons are produced in the mammalian brain into adulthood. Adult neurogenesis has been best described in the hippocampus and the subventricular zone (SVZ), in which a series of distinct stages of neuronal development has been well characterized. However, more recently, new neurons have also been found in other brain regions of the adult mammalian brain, including the hypothalamus, striatum, substantia nigra, cortex, and amygdala. While some studies have suggested that these new neurons originate from endogenous stem cell pools located within these brain regions, others have shown the migration of neurons from the SVZ to these regions. Notably, it has been shown that the generation of new neurons in these brain regions is impacted by neurologic processes such as stroke/ischemia and neurodegenerative disorders. Furthermore, numerous factors such as neurotrophic support, pharmacologic interventions, environmental exposures, and stem cell therapy can modulate this endogenous process. While the presence and significance of adult neurogenesis in the human brain (and particularly outside of the classical neurogenic regions) is still an area of debate, this intrinsic neurogenic potential and its possible regulation through therapeutic measures present an exciting alternative for the treatment of several neurologic conditions. This review summarizes evidence in support of the classic and novel neurogenic zones present within the mammalian brain and discusses the functional significance of these new neurons as well as the factors that regulate their production. Finally, it also discusses the potential clinical applications of promoting neurogenesis outside of the classical neurogenic niches, particularly in the hypothalamus, cortex, striatum, substantia nigra, and amygdala.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Neurons are polarized in structure with a cytoplasmic compartment extending into dendrites and a long axon that terminates at the synapse. The high level of compartmentalization imposes specific challenges for protein quality control in neurons making them vulnerable to disturbances that may lead to neurological dysfunctions including neuropsychiatric diseases. Synapse and dendrites undergo structural modulations regulated by neuronal activity involve key proteins requiring strict control of their turnover rates and degradation pathways. Recent advances in the study of the unfolded protein response (UPR) and autophagy processes have brought novel insights into the specific roles of these processes in neuronal physiology and synaptic signaling. In this review, we highlight recent data and concepts about UPR and autophagy in neuropsychiatric disorders and synaptic plasticity including a brief outline of possible therapeutic approaches to influence UPR and autophagy signaling in these diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Cognitive impairment and memory loss are commonly seen after stroke and a third of patients will develop signs of dementia a year after stroke. Despite a large number of studies on the beneficial effects of neuroprotectants, few studies have examined the effects of these compounds/interventions on long-term cognitive impairment. Our previous work showed that the microRNA mir363-3p reduced infarct volume and sensory-motor impairment in the acute stage of stroke in middle-aged females but not males. Thus, the present study determined the impact of mir363-3p treatment on stroke-induced cognitive impairment in middle-aged females. Sprague–Dawley female rats (12 months of age) were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo; or sham surgery) and injected (iv) with mir363-3p mimic (MCAo + mir363-3p) or scrambled oligos (MCAo + scrambled) 4 h later. Sensory-motor performance was assessed in the acute phase (2–5 days after stroke), while all other behaviors were tested 6 months after MCAo (18 months of age). Cognitive function was assessed by the novel object recognition test (declarative memory) and the Barnes maze (spatial memory). The MCAo + scrambled group showed reduced preference for a novel object after the stroke and poor learning in the spatial memory task. In contrast, mir363-3p treated animals were similar to either their baseline performance or to the sham group. Histological analysis showed significant deterioration of specific white matter tracts due to stroke, which was attenuated in mir363-3p treated animals. The present data builds on our previous finding to show that a neuroprotectant can abrogate the long-term effects of stroke.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by the loss of neurons and/or myelin sheath, which deteriorate over time and cause dysfunction. Interleukin 17A is the signature cytokine of a subset of CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; helper T cells known as Th17 cells, and the IL-17 cytokine family contains six cytokines and five receptors. Recently, several studies have suggested a pivotal role for the interleukin-17A (IL-17A) cytokine family in human inflammatory or autoimmune diseases and neurodegenerative diseases, including psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and glaucoma. Studies in recent years have shown that the mechanism of action of IL-17A is more subtle than simply causing inflammation. Although the specific mechanism of IL-17A in neurodegenerative diseases is still controversial, it is generally accepted now that IL-17A causes diseases by activating glial cells. In this review article, we will focus on the function of IL-17A, in particular the proposed roles of IL-17A, in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Vertebrates have acquired complex high-order functions facilitated by the dispersion of vascular and neural networks to every corner of the body. Blood vessels deliver oxygen and nutrients to all cells and provide essential transport systems for removing waste products. For these functions, tissue vascularization must be spatiotemporally appropriate. Recent studies revealed that blood vessels create a tissue-specific niche, thus attracting attention as biologically active sites for tissue development. Each capillary network is critical for maintaining proper brain function because age-related and disease-related impairment of cognitive function is associated with the loss or diminishment of brain capillaries. This review article highlights how structural and functional alterations in the brain vessels may change with age and neurogenerative diseases. Capillaries are also responsible for filtering toxic byproducts, providing an appropriate vascular environment for neuronal function. Accumulation of amyloid β is a key event in Alzheimer’s disease pathogenesis. Recent studies have focused on associations reported between Alzheimer’s disease and vascular aging. Furthermore, the glymphatic system and meningeal lymphatic systems contribute to a functional unit for clearance of amyloid β from the brain from the central nervous system into the cervical lymph nodes. This review article will also focus on recent advances in stem cell therapies that aim at repopulation or regeneration of a degenerating vascular system for neural diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Mismatch negativity (MMN) is suitable for studies of preattentive auditory discriminability and the auditory memory trace. Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is an ideal target for early therapeutic intervention because SCD occurs at preclinical stages many years before the onset of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). According to a novel lifespan-based model of dementia risk, hearing loss is considered the greatest potentially modifiable risk factor of dementia among nine health and lifestyle factors, and hearing impairment is associated with cognitive decline. Therefore, we propose a neurofeedback training based on MMN, which is an objective index of auditory discriminability, to regulate sensory ability and memory as a non-pharmacological intervention (NPI) in SCD patients. Seventeen subjects meeting the standardized clinical evaluations for SCD received neurofeedback training. The auditory frequency discrimination test, the visual digital N-back (1-, 2-, and 3-back), auditory digital N-back (1-, 2-, and 3-back), and auditory tone N-back (1-, 2-, and 3-back) tasks were used pre- and post-training in all SCD patients. The intervention schedule comprised five 60-min training sessions over 2 weeks. The results indicate that the subjects who received neurofeedback training had successfully improved the amplitude of MMN at the parietal electrode (Pz). A slight decrease in the threshold of auditory frequency discrimination was observed after neurofeedback training. Notably, after neurofeedback training, the working memory (WM) performance was significantly enhanced in the auditory tone 3-back test. Moreover, improvements in the accuracy of all WM tests relative to the baseline were observed, although the changes were not significant. To the best of our knowledge, our preliminary study is the first to investigate the effects of MMN neurofeedback training on WM in SCD patients, and our results suggest that MMN neurofeedback may represent an effective treatment for intervention in SCD patients and the elderly with aging memory decline.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 With implantation mouse stromal cells begin to transform into epithelial-like cells surrounding the implantation chamber forming an avascular zone called the primary decidual zone (PDZ). In mouse, the PDZ forms a transient, size-dependent permeable barrier to protect the embryo from maternal circulating harmful agents. The process of decidualization is critical for early pregnancy maintenance in mice and humans. Mice deficient in cannabinoid receptors, CB1 and CB2, show compromised PDZ with dysregulated angiogenic factors, resulting in the retention of blood vessels and macrophages. This phenotype is replicated in &lt;i&gt;Cnr1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, but not in &lt;i&gt;Cnr2&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice. &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;n vitro&lt;/i&gt; decidualization models suggest that &lt;i&gt;Cnr1&lt;/i&gt; levels substantially increase in mouse and human decidualizing stromal cells, and that neutralization of CB1 signaling suppresses decidualization and misregulates angiogenic factors. In sum, we propose that implantation quality depends on appropriate angiogenic events driven by the integration of CB2 in endothelial cells and CB1 in decidual cells.</content>

 The latent reservoir is a major barrier to HIV cure. As latently infected cells cannot be phenotyped directly, the features of the in vivo reservoir have remained elusive. Here, we describe a method that leverages high-dimensional phenotyping using CyTOF to trace latently infected cells reactivated ex vivo to their original pre-activation states. Our results suggest that, contrary to common assumptions, the reservoir is not randomly distributed among cell subsets, and is remarkably conserved between individuals. However, reservoir composition differs between tissues and blood, as do cells successfully reactivated by different latency reversing agents. By selecting 8–10 of our 39 original CyTOF markers, we were able to isolate highly purified populations of unstimulated in vivo latent cells. These purified populations were highly enriched for replication-competent and intact provirus, transcribed HIV, and displayed clonal expansion. The ability to isolate unstimulated latent cells from infected individuals enables previously impossible studies on HIV persistence.</content>

 Verma et al. show that the bacterial photoreceptor BphP phytochrome is a light-sensing phosphodiesterase that modulates the intracellular secondary messenger cyclic di-GMP to regulate diverse social traits and virulence-associated functions in Xanthomonas. The light-dependent phosphodiesterase activity of BphP triggers changes in c-di-GMP and regulates virulence-associated functions.</content>

Mutation is a biased stochastic process, with some types of mutations occurring more frequently than others. Previous work has used synthetic genotype-phenotype landscapes to study how such mutation bias affects adaptive evolution. Here, we consider 746 empirical genotype-phenotype landscapes, each of which describes the binding affinity of target DNA sequences to a transcription factor, to study the influence of mutation bias on adaptive evolution of increased binding affinity. By using empirical genotype-phenotype landscapes, we need to make only few assumptions about landscape topography and about the DNA sequences that each landscape contains. The latter is particularly important because the set of sequences that a landscape contains determines the types of mutations that can occur along a mutational path to an adaptive peak. That is, landscapes can exhibit a composition bias—a statistical enrichment of a particular type of mutation relative to a null expectation, throughout an entire landscape or along particular mutational paths—that is independent of any bias in the mutation process. Our results reveal the way in which composition bias interacts with biases in the mutation process under different population genetic conditions, and how such interaction impacts fundamental properties of adaptive evolution, such as its predictability, as well as the evolution of genetic diversity and mutational robustness.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/hNnBJaMhiPI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

According to many experimental observations, neurons in cerebral cortex tend to operate in an asynchronous regime, firing independently of each other. In contrast, many other experimental observations reveal cortical population firing dynamics that are relatively coordinated and occasionally synchronous. These discrepant observations have naturally led to competing hypotheses. A commonly hypothesized explanation of asynchronous firing is that excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs are precisely correlated, nearly canceling each other, sometimes referred to as ‘balanced’ excitation and inhibition. On the other hand, the ‘criticality’ hypothesis posits an explanation of the more coordinated state that also requires a certain balance of excitatory and inhibitory interactions. Both hypotheses claim the same qualitative mechanism—properly balanced excitation and inhibition. Thus, a natural question arises: how are asynchronous population dynamics and critical dynamics related, how do they differ? Here we propose an answer to this question based on investigation of a simple, network-level computational model. We show that the strength of inhibitory synapses relative to excitatory synapses can be tuned from weak to strong to generate a family of models that spans a continuum from critical dynamics to asynchronous dynamics. Our results demonstrate that the coordinated dynamics of criticality and asynchronous dynamics can be generated by the same neural system if excitatory and inhibitory synapses are tuned appropriately.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/pQLDDxBo8Qc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Genome organization is critical for setting up the spatial environment of gene transcription, and substantial progress has been made towards its high-resolution characterization. The underlying molecular mechanism for its establishment is much less understood. We applied a deep-learning approach, variational autoencoder (VAE), to analyze the fluctuation and heterogeneity of chromatin structures revealed by single-cell imaging and to identify a reaction coordinate for chromatin folding. This coordinate connects the seemingly random structures observed in individual cohesin-depleted cells as intermediate states along a folding pathway that leads to the formation of topologically associating domains (TAD). We showed that folding into wild-type-like structures remain energetically favorable in cohesin-depleted cells, potentially as a result of the phase separation between the two chromatin segments with active and repressive histone marks. The energetic stabilization, however, is not strong enough to overcome the entropic penalty, leading to the formation of only partially folded structures and the disappearance of TADs from contact maps upon averaging. Our study suggests that machine learning techniques, when combined with rigorous statistical mechanical analysis, are powerful tools for analyzing structural ensembles of chromatin.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/YdoedOR0Mho&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Universal observations in Biology are sometimes described as “laws”. In &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt;, experimental studies performed over the past six decades have revealed major growth laws relating ribosomal mass fraction and cell size to the growth rate. Because they formalize complex emerging principles in biology, growth laws have been instrumental in shaping our understanding of bacterial physiology. Here, we discovered a novel size law that connects cell size to the inverse of the metabolic proteome mass fraction and the active fraction of ribosomes. We used a simple whole-cell coarse-grained model of cell physiology that combines the proteome allocation theory and the structural model of cell division. This integrated model captures all available experimental data connecting the cell proteome composition, ribosome activity, division size and growth rate in response to nutrient quality, antibiotic treatment and increased protein burden. Finally, a stochastic extension of the model explains non-trivial correlations observed in single cell experiments including the adder principle. This work provides a simple and robust theoretical framework for studying the fundamental principles of cell size determination in unicellular organisms.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/O3t0l5JUN98&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Gene expression atlases have transformed our understanding of the development, composition and function of human tissues. New technologies promise improved cellular or molecular resolution, and have led to the identification of new cell types, or better defined cell states. But as new technologies emerge, information derived on old platforms becomes obsolete. We demonstrate that it is possible to combine a large number of different profiling experiments summarised from dozens of laboratories and representing hundreds of donors, to create an integrated molecular map of human tissue. As an example, we combine 850 samples from 38 platforms to build an integrated atlas of human blood cells. We achieve robust and unbiased cell type clustering using a variance partitioning method, selecting genes with low platform bias relative to biological variation. Other than an initial rescaling, no other transformation to the primary data is applied through batch correction or renormalisation. Additional data, including single-cell datasets, can be projected for comparison, classification and annotation. The resulting atlas provides a multi-scaled approach to visualise and analyse the relationships between sets of genes and blood cell lineages, including the maturation and activation of leukocytes in vivo and in vitro.
In allowing for data integration across hundreds of studies, we address a key reproduciblity challenge which is faced by any new technology. This allows us to draw on the deep phenotypes and functional annotations that accompany traditional profiling methods, and provide important context to the high cellular resolution of single cell profiling. Here, we have implemented the blood atlas in the open access Stemformatics.org platform, drawing on its extensive collection of curated transcriptome data. The method is simple, scalable and amenable for rapid deployment in other biological systems or computational workflows.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-bcs3i7bY_U&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

Obesity and related metabolic diseases show clear sex-related differences. The growing burden of these diseases calls for better understanding of the age- and sex-related metabolic consequences. High-throughput lipidomic analyses of population-based cohorts offer an opportunity to identify disease-risk–associated biomarkers and to improve our understanding of lipid metabolism and biology at a population level. Here, we comprehensively examined the relationship between lipid classes/subclasses and molecular species with age, sex, and body mass index (BMI). Furthermore, we evaluated sex specificity in the association of the plasma lipidome with age and BMI. Some 747 targeted lipid measures, representing 706 molecular lipid species across 36 classes/subclasses, were measured using a high-performance liquid chromatography coupled mass spectrometer on a total of 10,339 participants from the Australian Diabetes, Obesity and Lifestyle Study (AusDiab), with 563 lipid species being validated externally on 4,207 participants of the Busselton Health Study (BHS). Heat maps were constructed to visualise the relative differences in lipidomic profile between men and women. Multivariable linear regression analyses, including sex-interaction terms, were performed to assess the associations of lipid species with cardiometabolic phenotypes. Associations with age and sex were found for 472 (66.9%) and 583 (82.6%) lipid species, respectively. We further demonstrated that age-associated lipidomic fingerprints differed by sex. Specific classes of ether-phospholipids and lysophospholipids (calculated as the sum composition of the species within the class) were inversely associated with age in men only. In analyses with women alone, higher triacylglycerol and lower lysoalkylphosphatidylcholine species were observed among postmenopausal women compared with premenopausal women. We also identified sex-specific associations of lipid species with obesity. Lysophospholipids were negatively associated with BMI in both sexes (with a larger effect size in men), whilst acylcarnitine species showed opposing associations based on sex (positive association in women and negative association in men). Finally, by utilising specific lipid ratios as a proxy for enzymatic activity, we identified stearoyl CoA desaturase (SCD-1), fatty acid desaturase 3 (FADS3), and plasmanylethanolamine Δ1-desaturase activities, as well as the sphingolipid metabolic pathway, as constituent perturbations of cardiometabolic phenotypes. Our analyses elucidate the effect of age and sex on lipid metabolism by offering a comprehensive view of the lipidomic profiles associated with common cardiometabolic risk factors. These findings have implications for age- and sex-dependent lipid metabolism in health and disease and suggest the need for sex stratification during lipid biomarker discovery, establishing biological reference intervals for assessment of disease risk.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/FBmePFK0DOA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In rodents, gene‐expression, neuronal tuning, connectivity and neurogenesis studies have postulated that the dorsal, the intermediate and the ventral hippocampal formation (HF) are distinct entities. These findings are underpinned by behavioral studies showing a dissociable role of dorsal and ventral HF in learning, memory, stress and emotional processing. However, up to now, the molecular basis of such differences in relation to discrete boundaries is largely unknown. Therefore, we analyzed binding site densities for glutamatergic AMPA, NMDA, kainate and mGluR&lt;sub&gt;2/3&lt;/sub&gt;, GABAergic GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; (including benzodiazepine binding sites), GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;, dopaminergic D&lt;sub&gt;1/5&lt;/sub&gt; and noradrenergic α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptors as key modulators for signal transmission in hippocampal functions, using quantitative in vitro receptor autoradiography along the dorsal‐ventral axis of the mouse HF. Beside general different receptor profiles of the dentate gyrus (DG) and Cornu Ammonis fields (CA1, CA2, CA3, CA4/hilus), we detected substantial differences between dorsal, intermediate and ventral subdivisions and individual layers for all investigated receptor types, except GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;. For example, striking higher densities of α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptors were detected in the ventral DG, while the dorsal DG possesses higher numbers of kainate, NMDA, GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; and D&lt;sub&gt;1/5&lt;/sub&gt; receptors. CA1 dorsal and intermediate subdivisions showed higher AMPA, NMDA, mGluR&lt;sub&gt;2/3&lt;/sub&gt;, GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;, D&lt;sub&gt;1/5&lt;/sub&gt; receptors, while kainate receptors are higher expressed in ventral CA1, and noradrenergic α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptors in the intermediate region of CA1. CA2 dorsal was distinguished by higher kainate, α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptors in the intermediate region, while CA3 showed a more complex dissociation. Our findings resulted not only in a clear segmentation of the mouse hippocampus along the dorsal‐ventral axis, but also provides insights into the neurochemical basis and likely associated physiological processes in hippocampal functions. Therein, the presented data has a high impact for future studies modeling and investigating dorsal, intermediate and ventral hippocampal dysfunction in relation to neurodegenerative diseases or psychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mutations in phosphatidylinositol‐4,5‐bisphosphate 3‐kinase (PI3K) complex have been associated with a broad spectrum of brain and organ overgrowth syndromes. For example, mutations in phosphatidylinositol‐3‐kinase regulatory subunit 2 (&lt;i&gt;PIK3R2&lt;/i&gt;) have been identified in human patients with megalencephaly polymicrogyria polydactyly hydrocephalus (MPPH) syndrome, which includes brain overgrowth. To better understand the pathogenesis of &lt;i&gt;PIK3R2&lt;/i&gt;‐related mutations, we have developed and characterized a murine model.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We generated a knock‐in mouse model for the most common human &lt;i&gt;PIK3R2&lt;/i&gt; mutation, p.G373R (p.G367R in mice) using CRISPR/Cas9. The mouse phenotypes, including brain size, seizure activity, cortical lamination, cell proliferation/size/density, interneuron migration, and PI3K pathway activation, were analyzed using standard methodologies. For human patients with &lt;i&gt;PIK3R2&lt;/i&gt; mutations, clinical data (occipitofrontal circumference [OFC] and epilepsy) were retrospectively obtained from our clinical records (published / unpublished).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PI3K‐AKT pathway was hyperactivated in these mice, confirming the p.G367R mutation is an activating mutation in vivo. Similar to human patients with &lt;i&gt;PIK3R2&lt;/i&gt; mutations, these mice have enlarged brains. We found cell size to be increased but not cell numbers. The embryonic brain showed mild defects in cortical lamination, although not observed in the mature brain. Furthermore, electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings from mutant mice showed background slowing and rare seizures, again similar to our observations in human patients.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have generated a &lt;i&gt;PIK3R2&lt;/i&gt; mouse model that exhibits megalencephaly and EEG changes, both of which overlap with human patients. Our data provide novel insight into the pathogenesis of the human disease caused by PIK3R2 p.G373R mutation. We anticipate this model will be valuable in testing therapeutic options for human patients with MPPH. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Developmental distribution of primary cilia in the retinofugal visual pathway&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/2f94e0fb-4596-49d0-a46a-54650ff312d0/cne25029-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, we show that both the number of primary cilia and the number of ciliated neurons declines with age in major retinorecipient targets. Our data suggests that the maturation timing of neuronal and non‐neural cilia differs with maturation of neuronal cilia occurring over a longer postnatal period.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mammalian visual system is composed of circuitry connecting sensory input from the retina to the processing core of the visual cortex. The two main retinorecipient brain targets, the superior colliculus (SC) and dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN), bridge retinal input and visual output. The primary cilium is a conserved organelle increasingly viewed as a critical sensor for the regulation of developmental and homeostatic pathways in most mammalian cell types. Moreover, cilia have been described as crucial for neurogenesis, neuronal maturation, and survival in the cortex and retina. However, cilia in the visual relay center remain to be fully described. In this study, we characterized the ciliation profile of the SC and dLGN and found that the overall number of ciliated cells declined during development. Interestingly, shorter ciliated cells in both regions were identified as neurons, whose numbers remained stable over time, suggesting that cilia retention is a critical feature for optimal neuronal function in SC and dLGN. Our study suggests that primary cilia are important for neuronal maturation and function in cells of the SC and dLGN.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Remodeling of projections from ventral hippocampus to prefrontal cortex in Alzheimer's mice&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/2418eb20-0077-4d2f-965d-12a90c91b504/cne25032-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Axon terminal branches, originating from the ventral hippocampus and distributed in the prefrontal cortex, undergo more frequent bifurcation but bear less numerous varicosities, which are putative synaptic sites, in Alzheimer's than wild‐type mice. This projection appears to be more widely spread, with scantier synapses, and therefore diluted in Alzheimer's mice.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emotional dysregulation often accompanies cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The hippocampus, most notably damaged by AD pathology, is classified into the cognition‐bound posterior and emotion‐bound anterior hippocampi. Since the anterior hippocampus or its rodent counterpart, the ventral hippocampus (VH), sends dense afferents to the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the basolateral amygdala (BLA), the two structures implicated in fear responses, we investigated whether these afferents are modified in 3xTg AD model mice. An anterograde dextrin tracer injected into VH revealed that axons in PFC were more ramified in 3xTg than wild‐type (WT) mice, with the synaptic density reduced. The VH projections to BLA were not affected. Intracellular accumulation of amyloid β (Aβ) or Aβ‐like immunoreactivity was found in PFC and BLA neurons alike. Behaviorally, in the 2‐way active avoidance test, the frequency of chamber change was higher, with the test performance better, in 3xTg than WT mice, suggesting a distorted contextual fear in the 3xTg group. Given the essential involvement of parts of PFC in contextual fear responses and that of BLA in fear responses in general, the observed remodeling of VH‐to‐PFC afferents and the accumulation of intracellular Aβ in BLA and PFC pyramidal cells might exercise critical influences on enhanced avoidance behavior in 3xTg mice.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

Sympathetic postganglionic iWAT innervation reaches its target organ via lateral cutaneous rami of intercostal nerves T11–L1 and anterior cutaneous femoral nerve (as part of the lumbar plexus, L1)
White adipocytes are sparsely innervated (sparse varicosities), while brown adipocytes (beige islands) show dense innervation (dense varicosities) in iWAT.



&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adipose tissue plays an important role in metabolic homeostasis and its prominent role as endocrine organ is now well recognized. Adipose tissue is controlled via the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). New viral, molecular‐genetic tools will soon allow a more detailed study of adipose tissue innervation in metabolic function, yet, the precise anatomical extent of preganglionic and postganglionic inputs to the inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) is limited. Furthermore, several viral, molecular‐genetic tools will require the use of cre/loxP mouse models, while the available studies on sympathetic iWAT innervation were established in larger species. In this study, we generated a detailed map for the sympathetic innervation of iWAT in male and female mice. We adapted iDISCO tissue clearing to process large, whole‐body specimens for an unprecedented view of the natural abdominal SNS. Combined with pseudorabies virus retrograde tracing from the iWAT, we defined the preganglionic and postganglionic sympathetic input to iWAT. We used fluorescence‐guided anatomical dissections of sympathetic nerves in reporter mice to further clarify that postganglionic axons connect to iWAT via lateral cutaneous rami (dorsolumbar iWAT portion) and the lumbar plexus (inguinal iWAT portion). Importantly, these rami carry axons that branch to iWAT, as well as axons that travel further to innervate the skin and vasculature, and their functional impact will require consideration in denervation studies. Our study may serve as a comprehensive map for future experiments that employ virally driven neuromodulation techniques to predict anatomy‐based viral labeling.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the discovery of Rett Syndrome (RTT) genetic mutations, animal models have been developed. Sleep research in RTT animal models may unravel novel neural mechanisms for this severe neurodevelopmental heritable rare disease. In this systematic literature review we summarize the findings on sleep research of 13 studies in animal models of RTT. We found disturbed efficacy and continuity of sleep in all genetically mutated models of mice, cynomolgus monkeys, and &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;. Models presented highly fragmented sleep with distinct differences in 24‐hr sleep/wake cyclicity and circadian arrhythmicity. Overall, animal models mimic sleep complaints reported in individuals with RTT. However, contrary to human studies, in mutant mice, attenuated sleep delta waves, and sleep apneas in non‐rapid eye movement sleep were reported. Future studies may focus on sleep structure and EEG alterations, potential central mechanisms involved in sleep fragmentation and the occurrence of sleep apnea across different sleep stages. Given that locomotor dysfunction is characteristic of individuals with RTT, studies may consider to integrate its potential impact on the behavioral analysis of sleep.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;In neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) including autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia, impairment/malfunctioning of a subpopulation of interneurons expressing the calcium-binding protein parvalbumin (PV) –here termed Pvalb neurons– has gradually emerged as a possible cause. These neurons may represent a hub or point-of-convergence in the etiology of NDD. Increased oxidative stress associated with mitochondria impairment in Pvalb neurons is discussed as an essential step in schizophrenia etiology. Since PV downregulation is a common finding in ASD and schizophrenia individuals and PV-deficient (PV−/−) mice show a strong ASD-like behavior phenotype, we investigated the putative link between PV expression, alterations in mitochondria and oxidative stress. In a longitudinal study with 1, 3, and 6-months old PV−/− and wild type mice, oxidative stress was investigated in 9 Pvalb neuron subpopulations in the hippocampus, striatum, somatosensory cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) and cerebellum. In Pvalb neuron somata in the striatum and TRN, we additionally determined mitochondria volume and distribution at these three time points. In all Pvalb neuron subpopulations, we observed an age-dependent increase in oxidative stress and the increase strongly correlated with PV expression levels, but not with mitochondria density in these Pvalb neurons. Moreover, oxidative stress was elevated in Pvalb neurons of PV−/− mice and the magnitude of the effect was again correlated with PV expression levels in the corresponding wild type Pvalb neuron subpopulations. The PV-dependent effect was insignificant at 1 month and relative differences between WT and PV−/− Pvalb neurons were largest at 3 months. Besides the increase in mitochondria volume in PV’s absence in TRN and striatal PV−/− Pvalb neurons fully present already at 1 month, we observed a redistribution of mitochondria from the perinuclear region toward the plasma membrane at all time points. We suggest that in absence of PV, slow Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; buffering normally exerted by PV is compensated by a (mal)adaptive, mostly sub-plasmalemmal increase in mitochondria resulting in increased oxidative stress observed in 3- and 6-months old mice. Since PV−/− mice display core ASD-like symptoms already at 1 month, oxidative stress in Pvalb neurons is not a likely cause for their ASD-related behavior observed at this age.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain are commonly encoded by IGHV3-53 and most have a short CDR H3. Wu et al. show that IGHV3-53 antibodies with a long CDR H3 adopt an alternative binding mode, demonstrating that IGHV3-53 is even more versatile than previously thought in targeting SARS-CoV-2.</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;The effects of internal jugular vein compression for modulating and preserving white matter following a season of American tackle football: A prospective longitudinal evaluation of differential head impact exposure&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/4b47412f-b661-47a7-a430-5f5ff80eb20e/jnr24727-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internal jugular vein compression, by means of an externally worn neck collar (right side of image), is a potentially viable solution to intervene on the diffusion and anisotropic properties of white matter that change following a season of American tackle football. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this clinical trial was to examine whether internal jugular vein compression (JVC)—using an externally worn neck collar—modulated the relationships between differential head impact exposure levels and pre‐ to postseason changes in diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)‐derived diffusivity and anisotropy metrics of white matter following a season of American tackle football. Male high‐school athletes (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 284) were prospectively assigned to a non‐collar group or a collar group. Magnetic resonance imaging data were collected from participants pre‐ and postseason and head impact exposure was monitored by accelerometers during every practice and game throughout the competitive season. Athletes' accumulated head impact exposure was systematically thresholded based on the frequency of impacts of progressively higher magnitudes (10 g intervals between 20 to 150 g) and modeled with pre‐ to postseason changes in DTI measures of white matter as a function of JVC neck collar wear. The findings revealed that the JVC neck collar modulated the relationships between greater high‐magnitude head impact exposure (110 to 140 g) and longitudinal changes to white matter, with each group showing associations that varied in directionality. Results also revealed that the JVC neck collar group partially preserved longitudinal changes in DTI metrics. Collectively, these data indicate that a JVC neck collar can provide a mechanistic response to the diffusion and anisotropic properties of brain white matter following the highly diverse exposure to repetitive head impacts in American tackle football.

 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We conducted a Mendelian randomization study to disentangle the comparative effects of lipids and apolipoprotein on ischemic stroke.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single‐nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with low‐ and high‐density lipoprotein (LDL and HDL) cholesterol, triglycerides and apolipoprotein A‐I and B (apoA‐I and apoB) at the level of genome‐wide significance (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;5×10&lt;sup&gt;‐8&lt;/sup&gt;) in the UK Biobank were used as instrumental variables. Summary‐level data for ischemic stroke and its subtypes were obtained from the MEGASTROKE consortium with 514 791 individuals (60 341 ischemic stroke cases and 454 450 non‐cases).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increased levels of apoB, LDL cholesterol and triglycerides were associated with higher risk of any ischemic stroke, large artery stroke and small vessel stroke in the main and sensitivity univariable MR analyses. In multivariable MR analysis including apoB, LDL cholesterol and triglycerides in the same model, apoB retained a robust effect (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05), whereas the estimate for LDL cholesterol was reversed and that for triglycerides largely attenuated. Decreased levels of apoA‐I and HDL cholesterol were robustly associated with increased risk of any ischemic stroke, large artery stroke and small vessel stroke in all univariable MR analyses, but the association for apoA‐I was attenuated to the null after mutual adjustment.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The present MR study reveals that apoB is the predominant trait that accounts for the etiological basis of apoB, LDL cholesterol and triglycerides in relation to ischemic stroke, in particular large artery and small vessel stroke. Whether HDL cholesterol exerts a protective effect on ischemic stroke independent of apoA‐I needs further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Comparative morphology of the corpus callosum across the adult lifespan in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and humans&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/959b2321-5601-4f4c-af64-dda0ee5a24f0/cne25039-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The present study compares age‐related difference in corpus callosum morphology of chimpanzees and humans across the adult lifespan utilizing measures of total midsagittal area and regional thickness. We find that the chimpanzee compared to the human aging trajectory is characterized by a slower increase from adolescence to middle adulthood, as well as by a lack of substantial decline from middle to old adulthood. Thus, callosal atrophy in old age is not a universal characteristic of the aging brain, but rather appears to be human‐specific phenomenon of aging.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The human corpus callosum exhibits substantial atrophy in old age, which is stronger than what would be predicted from parallel changes in overall brain anatomy. To date, however, it has not been conclusively established whether this accentuated decline represents a common feature of brain aging across species, or whether it is a specific characteristic of the aging human brain. In the present cross‐sectional study, we address this question by comparing age‐related difference in corpus callosum morphology of chimpanzees and humans. For this purpose, we measured total midsagittal area and regional thickness of the corpus callosum from T1‐weighted MRI data from 213 chimpanzees, aged between 9 and 54 years. The results were compared with data drawn from a large‐scale human sample which was age‐range matched using two strategies: (a) matching by chronological age (human sample size: &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 562), or (b) matching by accounting for differences in longevity and various maturational events between the species (i.e., adjusted human age range: 13.6 to 80.9 years; &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 664). Using generalized additive modeling to fit and compare aging trajectories, we found significant differences between the two species. The chimpanzee aging trajectory compared with the human trajectory was characterized by a slower increase from adolescence to middle adulthood, and by a lack of substantial decline from middle to old adulthood, which, however, was present in humans. Thus, the accentuated decline of the corpus callosum found in aging humans is not a universal characteristic of the aging brain, and appears to be human‐specific.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;We comprehensively characterized 5‐HT‐immunoreactive (‐ir) innervation throughout the brain of &lt;i&gt;Porichthys notatus&lt;/i&gt;, plainfin midshipman fish, including well‐delineated vocal and auditory nuclei. We report neuroanatomical heterogeneity in populations of the serotonergic raphe nuclei of the brainstem reticular formation, with three discrete subregions in the superior raphe, an intermediate 5‐HT‐ir cell cluster, and an extensive inferior raphe population.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serotonin (5‐HT) is a modulator of neural circuitry underlying motor patterning, homeostatic control, and social behavior. While previous studies have described 5‐HT distribution in various teleosts, serotonergic raphe subgroups in fish are not well defined and therefore remain problematic for cross‐species comparisons. Here we used the plainfin midshipman fish, &lt;i&gt;Porichthys notatus&lt;/i&gt;, a well‐studied model for investigating the neural and hormonal mechanisms of vertebrate vocal‐acoustic communication, to redefine raphe subgroups based on both stringent neuroanatomical landmarks as well as quantitative cell measurements. In addition, we comprehensively characterized 5‐HT‐immunoreactive (‐ir) innervation throughout the brain, including well‐delineated vocal and auditory nuclei. We report neuroanatomical heterogeneity in populations of the serotonergic raphe nuclei of the brainstem reticular formation, with three discrete subregions in the superior raphe, an intermediate 5‐HT‐ir cell cluster, and an extensive inferior raphe population. 5‐HT‐ir neurons were also observed within the vocal motor nucleus (VMN), forming putative contacts on those cells. In addition, three major 5‐HT‐ir cell groups were identified in the hypothalamus and one group in the pretectum. Significant 5‐HT‐ir innervation was found in components of the vocal pattern generator and cranial motor nuclei. All vocal midbrain nuclei showed considerable 5‐HT‐ir innervation, as did thalamic and hindbrain auditory and lateral line areas and vocal‐acoustic integration sites in the preoptic area and ventral telencephalon. This comprehensive atlas offers new insights into the organization of 5‐HT nuclei in teleosts and provides neuroanatomical evidence for serotonin as a modulator of vocal‐acoustic circuitry and behavior in midshipman fish, consistent with findings in vocal tetrapods.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<link href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25919?af=R"/>
		<id>/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25919?af=R</id>
		<updated>2020-09-25T18:04:21+00:00</updated>
		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In spinocerebellar ataxia type 3/Machado‐Joseph disease (SCA3/MJD), the expanded CAG repeat in &lt;i&gt;ATXN3&lt;/i&gt; is the causal mutation, and its length is the main factor in determining the age at onset (AO) of clinical symptoms. However, the contribution of the expanded CAG repeat length to the rate of disease progression after onset has remained a matter of debate, even though an understanding of this factor is crucial for experimental data on disease modifiers and their translation to clinical trials and their design.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;82 Dutch SCA3/MJD patients were evaluated annually for 15 years using the International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (ICARS). Using linear growth curve models, ICARS progression rates were calculated and tested for their relation to the length of the CAG repeat expansion and to the residual AO (RAO): the difference between the observed AO and the AO predicted on the basis of the CAG repeat length.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On average, ICARS scores increased 2·57 points/year of disease. The length of the CAG repeat was positively correlated with a more rapid ICARS progression, explaining 30% of the differences between patients. Combining both the length of the CAG repeat and RAO as co‐modifiers explained up to 47% of the inter‐patient variation in ICARS progression.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our data imply that the length of the expanded CAG repeat in &lt;i&gt;ATXN3&lt;/i&gt; is a major determinant of clinical decline, which suggests that CAG‐dependent molecular mechanisms similar to those responsible for disease onset also contribute to the rate of disease progression in SCA3/MJD.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html" xml:lang="en-US">
 &lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an urgent need for sensitive, widely available, blood‐based screening tests to identify presymptomatic individuals destined to develop Alzheimer's disease (AD). We investigated whether tau detected in plasma by our in‐house NT1 assay is specifically altered in AD, and when applied to patients with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) can serve to predict progression to AD dementia. The predictive value of NT1 versus tau measured using assays from Quanterix and Roche, and the specificity of NT1 for AD versus a nonspecific marker of neurodegeneration (neurofilament light [NfL]) were also examined.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NT1 tau and NfL were measured in plasma from prospectively followed patients with SCD or MCI who remained cognitively stable, converted to AD dementia, or converted to non‐AD dementias, and in cognitively unimpaired participants. Tau was measured using Quanterix and Roche assays in baseline subjects with SCD and MCI.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plasma NT1 tau was specifically elevated in AD, but not in non‐AD dementia compared with controls, whereas NfL was increased in both AD and non‐AD dementias. Baseline specimens from individuals who had SCD or MCI revealed that NT1 tau, but not tau measured using Quanterix or Roche assays, is elevated in subjects who progress to AD dementia. As expected, baseline plasma NfL is elevated in those who progress to AD and non‐AD dementias.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plasma NT1 tau is a specific marker of AD, which is elevated early in disease and may prove useful as a first round screen to identify individuals at risk of developing AD. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Marmosets have a greater diversity of c‐Fos response after hyperstimulation in distinct cortical regions as compared to rats&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/f63913ea-8a34-4f90-a4fa-7415ae6d924c/cne25044-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rats and marmosets were injected with pentylenetetrazol and euthanized at different time points after stimulus. Immunohistochemical detection of c‐Fos was quantified using stereological cell counting in eight neocortical regions. Our results showed that the marmoset brain has a greater neuronal activation after intense stimulation by means of pentylenetetrazol and a more complex pattern of brain activation. We speculate that these functional differences may contribute for the understanding of the different neuronal processing capacities of the neocortex in these mammals’ orders.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous evidence indicated a potential mechanism that might support the fact that primates exhibit greater neural integration capacity as a result of the activation of different structures of the central nervous system, as compared to rodents. The current study aimed to provide further evidence to confirm previous findings by analyzing the patterns of c‐Fos expression in more neocortical structures of rats and marmosets using a more robust quantitative technique and evaluating a larger number of brain areas. Nineteen Wistar rats and 21 marmosets (&lt;i&gt;Callithrix jacchus&lt;/i&gt;) were distributed among control groups (animals without injections) and animals injected with pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) and euthanized at different time points after stimulus. Immunohistochemical detection of c‐Fos was quantified using unbiased and efficient stereological cell counting in eight neocortical regions. Results: Marmosets had a c‐Fos expression that was notably more widely expressed (5x more cells) and longer lasting (up to 3 hours) than rats. c‐Fos expression in rats presented similar patterns of expression according to the function of the brain cortical structures (associative, sensorial and motor functions), which was not observed for marmosets (in which no clear pattern could be drawn, and a more diverse profile emerged). Our results provide evidence that the marmoset brain has a greater neuronal activation after intense stimulation by means of PTZ and a more complex pattern of brain activation. We speculate that these functional differences may contribute for the understanding of the different neuronal processing capacities of the neocortex in these mammals’ orders.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;img alt=&quot;Morphological and physiological properties of Rohon‐Beard neurons along the zebrafish spinal cord&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/d7b339aa-4c43-49ff-ab8b-c6d760eeccfc/cne25033-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Primary mechanosensory afferents serve as the first level of signal processing at the somatosensory periphery and provide information about behaviorally relevant stimulus features. Here, we show that the mechanosensory Rohon‐Beard (RB) neurons in larval zebrafish are rapidly adapting cells that can signal stimulus onset and offset and encode stimulus intensity implementing rate and temporal coding mechanisms. We also revealed a rostrocaudal variation in both morphology and physiology within the RB neuron population, which offers insights on what signals RBs carry into central circuits and on their role in locomotor behaviors.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Primary mechanosensory neurons play an important role in converting mechanical forces into the sense of touch. In zebrafish, Rohon‐Beard (RB) neurons serve this role at embryonic and larval stages of development. Here we examine the morphology and physiology of RBs in larval zebrafish to better understand how mechanosensory stimuli are represented along the spinal cord. We report that the morphology of RB neurons differs along the rostrocaudal body axis. Rostral RB neurons arborize in the skin near the cell body whereas caudal cells arborize at a distance posterior to their cell body. Using a novel electrophysiological approach, we also found longitudinal differences in the mechanosensitivity and physiological properties of RB neurons. Rostral RB neurons respond to mechanical stimulations close to the soma and produce up to three spikes with increasing stimulus intensity, whereas caudal cells respond at more distal locations and can produce four or more spikes when the intensity of the mechanical stimulus increases. The mechanosensory properties of RB neurons are consistent with those of rapidly adapting mechanoreceptors and can signal the onset, offset and intensity of mechanical stimulation. This is the first report of the intensity encoding properties of RB neurons, where an increase in spike number and a decrease in spike latency are observed with increasing stimulation intensity. This study reveals an unappreciated complexity of the larval zebrafish mechanosensory system and demonstrates how differences in the morphological and physiological properties of RBs related to their rostrocaudal location can influence the signals that enter the spinal cord.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Due to life-saving medical advances, the diagnosis and treatment of disorders of consciousness (DOC) has become a more commonly occurring clinical issue. One recently developed intervention option has been non-invasive transcranial direct current stimulation. This dichotomy of patient responders may be better understood by investigating the mechanism behind the transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) intervention. The combination of transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroencephalography (TMS-EEG) has been an important diagnostic tool in DOC patients. We therefore examined the neural response using TMS-EEG both before and after tDCS in seven DOC patients (four diagnosed as in a minimally conscious state and three with unresponsive wakefulness syndrome). tDCS was applied over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, while TMS pulses were applied to the premotor cortex. None of the seven patients showed relevant behavioral change after tDCS. We did, however, find that the overall evoked slow activity was reduced following tDCS intervention. We also found a positive correlation between the strength of the slow activity and the amount of high-frequency suppression. However, there was no significant pre-post tDCS difference in high frequencies. In the resting-state EEG, we observed that both the incidence of slow waves and the positive slope of the wave were affected by tDCS. Taken together, these results suggest that the tDCS intervention can reduce the slow-wave activity component of bistability, but this may not directly affect high-frequency activity. We hypothesize that while reduced slow activity may be necessary for the recovery of neural function, especially consciousness, this alone is insufficient.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content type="html">
 &lt;p&gt;Diabetic neuropathy (DPN) is one of the most severe and yet most poorly understood complications of diabetes mellitus. In vivo imaging of dorsal root ganglia (DRG), a key structure for the understanding of DPN, has been restricted to animal studies. These have shown a correlation of decreased DRG volume with neuropathic symptom severity. Our objective was to investigate correlations of DRG morphology and signal characteristics at 3 Tesla (3T) magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) with clinical and serological data in diabetic patients with and without DPN. In this cross-sectional study, participants underwent 3T MRN of both L5 DRG using an isotropic 3D T2-weighted, fat-suppressed sequence with subsequent segmentation of DRG volume and analysis of normalized signal properties. Overall, 55 diabetes patients (66 ± 9 years; 32 men; 30 with DPN) took part in this study. DRG volume was smaller in patients with severe DPN when compared to patients with mild or moderate DPN (134.7 ± 21.86 vs 170.1 ± 49.22; p = 0.040). In DPN patients, DRG volume was negatively correlated with the neuropathy disability score (r = −0.43; 95%CI = −0.66 to −0.14; p = 0.02), a measure of neuropathy severity. DRG volume showed negative correlations with triglycerides (r = −0.40; 95%CI = −0.57 to −0.19; p = 0.006), and LDL cholesterol (r = −0.33; 95%CI = −0.51 to −0.11; p = 0.04). There was a strong positive correlation of normalized MR signal intensity (SI) with the neuropathy symptom score in the subgroup of patients with painful DPN (r = 0.80; 95%CI = 0.46 to 0.93; p = 0.005). DRG SI was positively correlated with HbA1c levels (r = 0.30; 95%CI = 0.09 to 0.50; p = 0.03) and the triglyceride/HDL ratio (r = 0.40; 95%CI = 0.19 to 0.57; p = 0.007). In this first in vivo study, we found DRG morphological degeneration and signal increase in correlation with neuropathy severity. This elucidates the potential importance of MR-based DRG assessments in studying structural and functional changes in DPN.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Introduction&lt;p&gt;Transcranial electrical (TES) and magnetic stimulation (TMS) are both used for assessment of the motor function of the spinal cord in horses. Muscular motor evoked potentials (mMEP) were compared intra-individually for both techniques in five healthy horses. mMEPs were measured twice at increasing stimulation intensity steps over the extensor carpi radialis (ECR), tibialis cranialis (TC), and caninus muscles. Significance was set at p &amp;lt; 0.05. To support the hypothesis that both techniques induce extracranially elicited mMEPs, literature was also reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Both techniques show the presence of late mMEPs below the transcranial threshold appearing as extracranially elicited startle responses. The occurrence of these late mMEPs is especially important for interpretation of TMS tracings when coil misalignment can have an additional influence. Mean transcranial motor latency times (MLT; synaptic delays included) and conduction velocities (CV) of the ECR and TC were significantly different between both techniques: respectively, 4.2 and 5.5 ms (MLT&lt;sub&gt;TMS&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;–&lt;/sub&gt;-MLT&lt;sub&gt;TES&lt;/sub&gt;), and −7.7 and −9.9 m/s (CV&lt;sub&gt;TMS&lt;/sub&gt;-CV&lt;sub&gt;TES&lt;/sub&gt;). TMS and TES show intensity-dependent latency decreases of, respectively, −2.6 (ECR) and −2.7 ms (TC)/30% magnetic intensity and −2.6 (ECR) and −3.2 (TC) ms/30V. When compared to TMS, TES shows the lowest coefficients of variation and highest reproducibility and accuracy for MLTs. This is ascribed to the fact that TES activates a lower number of cascaded interneurons, allows for multipulse stimulation, has an absence of coil repositioning errors, and has less sensitivity for varying degrees of background muscle tonus. Real axonal conduction times and conduction velocities are most closely approximated by TES.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Both intracranial and extracranial mMEPs inevitably carry characteristics of brainstem reflexes. To avoid false interpretations, transcranial mMEPs can be identified by a stepwise latency shortening of 15–20 ms when exceeding the transcranial motor threshold at increasing stimulation intensities. A ring block around the vertex is advised to reduce interference by extracranial mMEPs. mMEPs reflect the functional integrity of the route along the brainstem nuclei, extrapyramidal motor tracts, propriospinal neurons, and motoneurons. The corticospinal tract appears subordinate in horses. TMS and TES are interchangeable for assessing the functional integrity of motor functions of the spinal cord. However, TES reveals significantly shorter MLTs, higher conduction velocities, and better reproducibility.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease that causes degeneration of the lower and upper motor neurons and is the most prevalent motor neuron disease. This disease is characterized by muscle weakness, stiffness, and hyperreflexia. Patients survive for a short period from the onset of the disease. Most cases are sporadic, with only 10% of the cases being genetic. Many genes are now known to be involved in familial ALS cases, including some of the sporadic cases. It has also been observed that, in addition to genetic factors, there are numerous molecular mechanisms involved in these pathologies, such as excitotoxicity, mitochondrial disorders, alterations in axonal transport, oxidative stress, accumulation of misfolded proteins, and neuroinflammation. This pathology affects the motor neurons, the spinal cord, the cerebellum, and the brain, but recently, it has been shown that it also affects the visual system. This impact occurs not only at the level of the oculomotor system but also at the retinal level, which is why the retina is being proposed as a possible biomarker of this pathology. The current review discusses the main aspects mentioned above related to ALS, such as the main genes involved, the most important molecular mechanisms that affect this pathology, its ocular involvement, and the possible usefulness of the retina as a biomarker.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 Background&lt;p&gt;Moyamoya disease (MMD) is an important cause of stroke in children and young adults in Asia. To date, diagnosis remains challenging due to varying clinical manifestations and unknown pathogenesis. The study aims to identify cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) exosomal microRNAs (exomiRs) that can serve as a novel diagnostic biomarker for diagnosis and assess its clinical applications.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;CSF samples were taken from 31 MMD patients and 31 healthy controls. Initial screening of miRNA expression was performed on samples pooled from MMD patients and controls using microarray and validated using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The diagnostic accuracy of the potential exosomal miRNAs was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic curve analyses in an independent patient cohort. The potential pathways regulated by the miRNAs was also determined using bioinformatics analysis.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The microarray results demonstrated that six exomiRs were dysregulated in the MMD patients compared to the controls. Using qRT-PCR, we validated four of the miRNAs (miR-3679-5p, miR-6165, miR-6760-5p, and miR-574-5p) as a biomarker for MMD diagnosis. The four exomiRs showed enhanced sensitivity (75%) and specificity (93.75%) in terms of differentiating MMD patients from healthy subjects [area under the curve (AUC) = 0.9453]. Pathway enrichment analysis for potential targets of six exomiRs identified proteins involved in cell adhesion and junction formation in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusions&lt;p&gt;We identified a novel and highly sensitive exomiRs signature for MMD detection and explored its potential targets using bioinformatics analysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Background: The pathophysiology of patients with dry eye disease (DED) is associated with abnormal functional connectivity (FC). The present study aims to probe alterations of voxel-wise brain-wide FC in patient with DED at rest in an unbiased way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Method: A total of 20 patients with DED and 23 controls matched by age, sex, and years of education underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scans. Global-brain FC (GFC) was adopted to analyze the images. Support vector machine (SVM) was utilized to differentiate the patients from the controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Compared with the controls, patients with DED exhibited decreased GFC in the right cerebellum lobule VIII/inferior semi-lunar lobule and left thalamus that belonged to the cerebello-thalamo-cortical network. The GFC values in the left thalamus were positively correlated to the illness duration (r = 0.589, p = 0.006) in the patients. Decreased GFC values in the left thalamus could be used to discriminate the patients from the controls with optimal accuracy, sensitivity and specificity (88.37, 85.00, and 91.30%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Our findings indicate that decreased GFC in the brain regions associated with cerebello-thalamo-cortical network may provide a new insight for understanding the pathological changes of FC in DED. GFC values in the left thalamus may be utilized as a potential biomarker to identify the patients from the controls.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;What are the key ingredients that make some persuasive messages resonate with audiences and elicit action, while others fail? Billions of dollars per year are put towards changing human behavior, but it is difficult to know which messages will be the most persuasive in the field. By combining novel neuroimaging techniques and large-scale online data, we examine the role of key health communication variables relevant to motivating action at scale. We exposed a sample of smokers to anti-smoking web-banner messages from a real-world campaign while measuring message-evoked brain response patterns via fMRI, and we also obtained subjective evaluations of each banner. Neural indices were derived based on: (i) message-evoked activity in specific brain regions; and (ii) spatially distributed response patterns, both selected based on prior research and theoretical considerations. Next, we connected the neural and subjective data with an independent, objective outcome of message success, which is the per-banner click-through rate in the real-world campaign. Results show that messages evoking brain responses more similar to signatures of negative emotion and vividness had lower online click-through-rates. This strategy helps to connect and integrate the rapidly growing body of knowledge about brain function with formative research and outcome evaluation of health campaigns, and could ultimately further disease prevention efforts.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;The objective of this study was to evaluate the biomechanical, neural, and functional outcomes during a 10-min treadmill stepping trial before and after two independent interventions with neuromuscular electrical stimulation (ES) in an individual with spinal cord injury (SCI). In this longitudinal study, a 34-year-old male with sensory- and motor-complete SCI (C5/C6) underwent two consecutive interventions: 61 h of supine lower limb ES (ES-alone) followed by 51 h of ES combined with stand training (ST) using an overhead body-weight support (BWS) system (ST + ES). In post ES-alone (unloaded), compared to baseline, the majority (∼60%) of lower extremity muscles decreased their peak surface electromyography (sEMG) amplitude, while in post ST + ES (loaded), compared to post ES-alone, there was a restoration in muscle activation that endured the continuous 10-min stepping. Temporal α-motor neuron activity patterns were observed for the SCI participant. In post ST + ES, there were increases in spinal activity patterns during mid-stance at spinal levels L5–S2 for the right and left limbs. Moreover, in post ES-alone, trunk stability increased with excursions from the midline of the base-of-support (50%) to the left (44.2%; Baseline: 54.2%) and right (66.4%; baseline: 77.5%). The least amount of trunk excursion observed post ST + ES, from midline to left (43%; AB: 22%) and right (64%; AB: 64%). Overall, in post ES-alone, there were gains in trunk independence with a decrease in lower limb muscle activation, whereas in post ST + ES, there were gains in trunk independence and increased muscle activation in both bilateral trunk muscles as well as lower limb muscles during the treadmill stepping paradigm. The results of the study illustrate the importance of loading during the stimulation for neural and mechanical gains.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Objective: To study the effect of directional deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrode configuration and vertical electrode spacing on the volume of tissue activated (VTA) in the globus pallidus, pars interna (GPi).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Background: Directional DBS leads may allow clinicians to precisely direct current fields to different functional networks within traditionally targeted brain areas. Modeling the shape and size of the VTA for various monopolar or bipolar configurations can inform clinical programming strategies for GPi DBS. However, many computational models of VTA are limited by assuming tissue homogeneity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We generated a multimodal image-based detailed anatomical (MIDA) computational model with a directional DBS lead (1.5 mm or 0.5 mm vertical electrode spacing) placed with segmented contact 2 at the ventral posterolateral “sensorimotor” region of the GPi. The effect of tissue heterogeneity was examined by replacing the MIDA tissues with a homogeneous tissue of conductance 0.3 S/m. DBS pulses (amplitude: 1 mA, pulse width: 60 μs, frequency: 130 Hz) were used to produce VTAs. The following DBS contact configurations were tested: single-segment monopole (2B-/Case+), two-segment monopole (2A-/2B-/Case+ and 2B-/3B-/Case+), ring monopole (2A-/2B-/2C-/Case+), one-cathode three-anode bipole (2B-/3A+/3B+/3C+), three-cathode three-anode bipole (2A-/2B-/2C-/3A+/3B+/3C+). Additionally, certain vertical configurations were repeated with 2 mA current amplitude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Using a heterogeneous tissue model affected both the size and shape of the VTA in GPi. Electrodes with both 0.5 mm and 1.5 mm vertical spacing (1 mA) modeling showed that the single segment monopolar VTA was entirely contained within the GPi when the active electrode is placed at the posterolateral “sensorimotor” GPi. Two segments in a same ring and ring settings, however, produced VTAs outside of the GPi border that spread into adjacent white matter pathways, e.g., optic tract and internal capsule. Both stacked monopolar settings and vertical bipolar settings allowed activation of structures dorsal to the GPi in addition to the GPi. Modeling of the stacked monopolar settings with the DBS lead with 0.5 mm vertical electrode spacing further restricted VTAs within the GPi, but the VTA volumes were smaller compared to the equivalent settings of 1.5 mm spacing.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a structural and physiological disruption of brain function caused by external forces. It is a major cause of death and disability for patients worldwide. TBI includes both primary and secondary impairments. Iron overload and ferroptosis highly involved in the pathophysiological process of secondary brain injury. Ferroptosis is a form of regulatory cell death, as increased iron accumulation in the brain leads to lipid peroxidation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, mitochondrial dysfunction and neuroinflammatory responses, resulting in cellular and neuronal damage. For this reason, eliminating factors like iron deposition and inhibiting lipid peroxidation may be a promising therapy. Iron chelators can be used to eliminate excess iron and to alleviate some of the clinical manifestations of TBI. In this review we will focus on the mechanisms of iron and ferroptosis involving the manifestations of TBI, broaden our understanding of the use of iron chelators for TBI. Through this review, we were able to better find novel clinical therapeutic directions for further TBI study.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Dendritic morphology is inextricably linked to neuronal function. Systematic large-scale screens combined with genetic mapping have uncovered several mechanisms underlying dendrite morphogenesis. However, a comprehensive overview of participating molecular mechanisms is still lacking. Here, we conducted an efficient clonal screen using a collection of mapped P-element insertions that were previously shown to cause lethality and eye defects in Drosophila melanogaster. Of 280 mutants, 52 exhibited dendritic defects. Further database analyses, complementation tests, and RNA interference validations verified 40 P-element insertion genes as being responsible for the dendritic defects. Twenty-eight mutants presented severe arbor reduction, and the remainder displayed other abnormalities. The intrinsic regulators encoded by the identified genes participate in multiple conserved mechanisms and pathways, including the protein folding machinery and the chaperonin-containing TCP-1 (CCT) complex that facilitates tubulin folding. Mutant neurons in which expression of CCT4 or CCT5 was depleted exhibited severely retarded dendrite growth. We show that CCT localizes in dendrites and is required for dendritic microtubule organization and tubulin stability, suggesting that CCT-mediated tubulin folding occurs locally within dendrites. Our study also reveals novel mechanisms underlying dendrite morphogenesis. For example, we show that Drosophila Nogo signaling is required for dendrite development and that Mummy and Wech also regulate dendrite morphogenesis, potentially via Dpp- and integrin-independent pathways. Our methodology represents an efficient strategy for identifying intrinsic dendrite regulators, and provides insights into the plethora of molecular mechanisms underlying dendrite morphogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Light adaptation changes both the sensitivity and maximum amplitude (R&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;) of the mouse photopic electroretinogram (ERG) b-wave. Using the ERG, we examined how modulation of gap junctional coupling between rod and cones alters the light-adapted ERG. To measure changes, a b-wave light adaptation enhancement factor (LAEF), was defined as the ratio of R&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; after 15 min light adaptation to R&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; recorded at the onset of an adapting light. For wild-type mice (WT), the LAEF averaged 2.64 ± 0.29, however, it was significantly reduced (1.06 ± 0.04) for connexin 36 knock out (Cx36KO) mice, which lack electrical coupling between photoreceptors. Wild type mice intraocularly injected with meclofenamic acid (MFA), a gap junction blocker, also showed a significantly reduced LAEF. Degeneration of rod photoreceptors significantly alters the effects of light adaptation on the photopic ERG response. Rd10 mice at P21, with large portions of their rod photoreceptors present in the retina, exhibited a similar b-wave enhancement as wildtype controls, with a LAEF of 2.55 ± 0.19. However, by P31 with most of their rod photoreceptors degenerated, rd10 mice had a much reduced b-wave enhancement during light-adaptation (LAEF of 1.54 ± 0.12). Flicker ERG responses showed a higher temporal amplitude in mesopic conditions for WT than those of Cx36KO mice, suggesting rod-cone coupling help high-frequency signals to pass from rods to cone pathways in the retina. In conclusion, our study provides a novel method to noninvasively measure the dynamics and modulation by the light adaptation for rod-cone gap junctional coupling in intact eyes.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;Progressive hearing loss is very common in the human population but we know little about the underlying molecular mechanisms. Synaptojanin2 (Synj2) has been reported to be involved, as a mouse mutation led to a progressive increase in auditory thresholds with age. Synaptojanin2 is a phosphatidylinositol (PI) phosphatase that removes the five-position phosphates from phosphoinositides, such as PIP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and PIP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and is a key enzyme in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. To investigate the mechanisms underlying progressive hearing loss, we have studied a different mutation of mouse Synj2 to look for any evidence of involvement of vesicle trafficking particularly affecting the synapses of sensory hair cells. Auditory brainstem responses (ABR) developed normally at first but started to decline between 3 and 4 weeks of age in Synj2&lt;sup&gt;tm1b&lt;/sup&gt; mutants. At 6 weeks old, some evidence of outer hair cell (OHC) stereocilia fusion and degeneration was observed, but this was only seen in the extreme basal turn so cannot explain the raised ABR thresholds that correspond to more apical regions of the cochlear duct. We found no evidence of any defect in inner hair cell (IHC) exocytosis or endocytosis using single hair cell recordings, nor any sign of hair cell synaptic abnormalities. Endocochlear potentials (EP) were normal. The mechanism underlying progressive hearing loss in these mutants remains elusive, but our findings of raised distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) thresholds and signs of OHC degeneration both suggest an OHC origin for the hearing loss. Synaptojanin2 is not required for normal development of hearing but it is important for its maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

 &lt;p&gt;In subacute and chronic phases of the stroke, there are no therapeutics available at present to promote functional recovery. Human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (hUC-MSCs) are one of the candidate cell types for treating subacute-phase stroke. The benefits of cell-based therapy largely depend on the migratory capacity of products administered, as well as their potential for engraftment in targeted tissues and paracrine activities. Timing and delivery modes may also influence the outcomes of stem-cell therapy. Still, the functional recuperative effects of differing hUC-MSC delivery modes, about cell replacement and cell-to-cell paracrine activity levels, have yet to be clarified in subacute phases of stroke.This study was conducted to compare the therapeutic effects of various delivery routes when administering Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP)-grade hUC-MSCs in a rodent model of subacute-phase stroke. Cell aliquots (1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;) were given to rats as intravenous (IV) injections or intracerebral (IC) transplants 1 week after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo). Transplanted rats were examined up to 7 weeks later using various behavioral tests and immunohistochemical analyses. Most IC-transplanted cells survived for short periods (i.e., &amp;lt;4 weeks after receipt) and gradually disappeared, whereas IV-injected cells were undetectable in the brain at the same time points (i.e., 3 days, 4 weeks, or 7 weeks after injection). Although short-lived, IC-transplanted cells effectively improved behavioral deficits, serving to reduce infarct volumes and glial scar formation, increase subventricular counts of proliferating neuroblasts, and promote cerebrovascular ingrowth in ischemic penumbra regions. IV injection, however, failed to improve behavioral function or histologic parameters during the same 7-week time frame. These findings overall suggest that IC transplantation is preferable to IV injection for delivery of hUC-MSCs during subacute phases of stroke.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
