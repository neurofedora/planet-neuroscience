              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08973">Somatosensory and motor contributions to emotion representation</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.08973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emotion is often described as something people 'feel' in their bodies. Embodied emotion theorists propose that this connection is not purely linguistic; perceiving an emotion may require somatosensory and motor re-experiencing. However, it remains unclear whether self-reports of emotion-related bodily sensations (i.e., 'lump in my throat') are related to neural simulations of bodily action and sensation or whether they can be explained by cognitive appraisals or the visual features of socioemotional signals. To investigate this, participants (N = 21) were shown arousing emotional images that varied in valence, complexity, and content while undergoing fMRI scans. Participants then rated the images on a set of emotion appraisal scales and indicated where, on a body map, they experienced sensation in response to the image. To derive normative models of responses on these scales, a separate larger online sample online (N = 56 - 128) also rated these images. Representational similarity analysis (RSA) was used to compare the emotional content in the body maps with appraisals and visual features. A pairwise distance matrix between the body maps generated for each stimulus was then used in a whole brain voxel-wise searchlight analysis to identify brain regions which reflect the representational geometry of embodied emotion. This analysis revealed a network including bilateral primary somatosensory and motor cortices, precuneus, insula, and medial prefrontal cortex. The results of this study suggest that the relationship between emotion and the body is not purely conceptual: It is supported by sensorimotor cortical activations.

                arXiv:2411.09098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply the phenomenological renormalization group to resting-state fMRI time series of brain activity in a large population. By recursively coarse-graining the data, we compute scaling exponents for the series variance, log probability of silence, and largest covariance eigenvalue. The exponents clearly exhibit linear interdependencies, which we derive analytically in a mean-field approach. We find a significant correlation of exponent values with the gray matter volume and cognitive performance. Akin to scaling relations near critical points in thermodynamics, our findings suggest scaling interdependencies are intrinsic to brain organization and may also exist in other complex systems.

                arXiv:2411.09004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article provides an expository account of training dynamics in the Deep Linear Network (DLN) from the perspective of the geometric theory of dynamical systems. Rigorous results by several authors are unified into a thermodynamic framework for deep learning.
  The analysis begins with a characterization of the invariant manifolds and Riemannian geometry in the DLN. This is followed by exact formulas for a Boltzmann entropy, as well as stochastic gradient descent of free energy using a Riemannian Langevin Equation. Several links between the DLN and other areas of mathematics are discussed, along with some open questions.

                arXiv:2411.09702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional wisdom suggests that pre-training Vision Transformers (ViT) improves downstream performance by learning useful representations. Is this actually true? We investigate this question and find that the features and representations learned during pre-training are not essential. Surprisingly, using only the attention patterns from pre-training (i.e., guiding how information flows between tokens) is sufficient for models to learn high quality features from scratch and achieve comparable downstream performance. We show this by introducing a simple method called attention transfer, where only the attention patterns from a pre-trained teacher ViT are transferred to a student, either by copying or distilling the attention maps. Since attention transfer lets the student learn its own features, ensembling it with a fine-tuned teacher also further improves accuracy on ImageNet. We systematically study various aspects of our findings on the sufficiency of attention maps, including distribution shift settings where they underperform fine-tuning. We hope our exploration provides a better understanding of what pre-training accomplishes and leads to a useful alternative to the standard practice of fine-tuning

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02930">Embedding Hardware Approximations in Discrete Genetic-based Training for Printed MLPs</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2402.02930v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Printed Electronics (PE) stands out as a promisingtechnology for widespread computing due to its distinct attributes, such as low costs and flexible manufacturing. Unlike traditional silicon-based technologies, PE enables stretchable, conformal,and non-toxic hardware. However, PE are constrained by larger feature sizes, making it challenging to implement complex circuits such as machine learning (ML) classifiers. Approximate computing has been proven to reduce the hardware cost of ML circuits such as Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs). In this paper, we maximize the benefits of approximate computing by integrating hardware approximation into the MLP training process. Due to the discrete nature of hardware approximation, we propose and implement a genetic-based, approximate, hardware-aware training approach specifically designed for printed MLPs. For a 5% accuracy loss, our MLPs achieve over 5x area and power reduction compared to the baseline while outperforming state of-the-art approximate and stochastic printed MLPs.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08674">Reducing ADC Front-end Costs During Training of On-sensor Printed Multilayer Perceptrons</a></h4>

Abstract: Printed electronics technology offers a cost-effectiveand fully-customizable solution to computational needs beyondthe capabilities of traditional silicon technologies, offering ad-vantages such as on-demand manufacturing and conformal, low-cost hardware. However, the low-resolution fabrication of printedelectronics, which results in large feature sizes, poses a challengefor integrating complex designs like those of machine learn-ing (ML) classification systems. Current literature optimizes onlythe Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) circuit within the classificationsystem, while the cost of analog-to-digital converters (ADCs)is overlooked. Printed applications frequently require on-sensorprocessing, yet while the digital classifier has been extensivelyoptimized, the analog-to-digital interfacing, specifically the ADCs,dominates the total area and energy consumption. In this work,we target digital printed MLP classifiers and we propose thedesign of customized ADCs per MLP's input which involvesminimizing the distinct represented numbers for each input,simplifying thus the ADC's circuitry. Incorporating this ADCoptimization in the MLP training, enables eliminating ADC levelsand the respective comparators, while still maintaining highclassification accuracy. Our approach achieves 11.2x lower ADCarea for less than 5% accuracy drop across varying MLPs.

	<p>Background: Spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) is a rare and frequently misdiagnosed disorder characterized by a low volume of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) caused by the leakage of CSF through the spinal dural membrane. Patients with Marfan Syndrome (MS) and other connective tissue disorders are at an increased risk for dural ectasia, which may predispose them to spontaneous CSF leaks due to the structural weakness of their dural membranes. The management of SIH in MS patients is debated. Conservative measures, an epidural blood patch (EBP), and surgical treatments are the options generally provided. Methods: Herein, we report on the case of a 52-year-old female affected by MS, genetically confirmed, with a two-month history of sudden-onset, &amp;amp;ldquo;thunderclap&amp;amp;rdquo; headache, worsened in an upright position and horizontal diplopia. A Computed Tomography (CT) scan of the brain showed a bilateral chronic subdural hematoma, slit ventricles, and a caudal descent of the brainstem without overt tonsillar herniation. The Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan of the whole spine revealed dural ectasia in the lumbosacral area and presacral perineural cyst without extradural CSF collection. The case was successfully managed with bed rest and high-dose corticosteroid therapy. Then, we discuss the pertinent literature, consisting of 25 papers dealing with the treatment of SIH in patients affected by MS. Results: The literature review yielded 25 papers dealing with SIH management in patients with MS, including 28 patients overall; 21 patients underwent EBP, of whom 7 patients had multiple procedures. Overall, in 23 cases (82%), the symptoms improved. In three cases, the patients were managed conservatively with bed rest. In three of these cases, there was an improvement. In one case, the surgical fenestration of two lumbar intradural spinal meningeal cysts was performed and the patient improved after the procedure. Our patient underwent 15 days of steroid therapy (dexamethasone iv 12 mg/day for 7 days, then reduced to 4 mg/day) and intravenous hydration (Ringer lactate 1500 mL/day). In ten days, the symptoms disappeared. At the 6-month follow-up, the patient was in good clinical condition, and a CT scan showed an almost complete regression of the bilateral subdural hematoma. Conclusions: The management of SIH in MS patients is still challenging. Patients with connective tissue disorders such as MS are at an increased risk for SIH. Few studies have assessed the management of these patients and different strategies. Our case and the available literature provide further data for this type of case.</p>

                Background Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin condition characterized by pruritus and skin barrier dysfunction. This study aims to evaluate the therapeutic potential of Pelargonium graveolens (Geraniaceae) in managing AD symptoms through its essential oil. Methods The chemical composition of Pelargonium graveolens flower essential oil (PFEO) was analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Its antimicrobial, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties were assessed, along with the inhibitory effects of PFEO on key enzymes involved in skin repair: tyrosinase, elastase, and collagenase. An in vivo evaluation of a gel formulation containing PFEO was also conducted to assess its anti-inflammatory and analgesic efficacy. Results GC-MS analysis identified major compounds in PFEO, including Geraniol (22.83%), beta-citronellol (19.51%), naphthalenemethanol (15.36%), and Geranyl tiglate (9.38%), with minor constituents such as linalool (3.81%) and neryl formate (1.31%). PFEO exhibited bacteriostatic activity against various bacterial and fungal strains, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Bacillus anthracis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Candida albicans, and Malassezia spp. The essential oil also demonstrated significant antioxidant properties and inhibited key enzymes linked to skin alterations in AD. Conclusions PFEO shows promising therapeutic potential for managing symptoms of atopic dermatitis due to its antimicrobial, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties, as well as its analgesic effects. The findings support further exploration of PFEO as a natural alternative in the treatment of AD.

                Background Cytoscape is an open-source software to visualize and analyze networks. However, large networks, such as protein interaction networks, are still difficult to analyze as a whole. Methods Here, we propose Clust&See3.0, a novel version of a Cytoscape app that has been developed to identify, visualize and manipulate network clusters and modules. It is now enriched with functionalities allowing custom annotations of nodes and computation of their statistical enrichments. Results As the wealth of multi-omics data is growing, such functionalities are highly valuable for a better understanding of biological module composition, as illustrated by the presented use case. Conclusions In summary, the originality of Clust&See3.0 lies in providing users with a complete tool for network clusters analyses: from cluster identification, visualization, node and cluster annotations to annotation statistical analyses.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1365/v1?src=rss">Evaluation of the fintech era on the performance of Moroccan banks: analysis through non-performing loans [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background This study aims to contribute to a better understanding of the impact of the financial technologies (fintech) era on the performance in the banking sector, measured through non-performing loans (NPL) and their coverage by provisions for NPL. It is a question of knowing whether banking investment in fintech makes it possible to better evaluate the granting of credits, and therefore makes it possible to reduce overdue credits. Methods To this end, the method used consists of using a regression analysis and a Pearson correlation applied to the financial data of Moroccan banks observed during two distinct periods, namely 2007-2014, considered pre-fintech, and the period 2015-2022, considered as the fintech period. Results With the emergence of the fintech era, the Moroccan banking situation improved slightly compared to the pre-fintech period: bad debts did not increase despite the significant increase in net banking income and the size of banking assets during the fintech era. Conclusions The implementation of fintech has improved customer relationship management, credit risk analysis and loan monitoring services, which ultimately reduces non-performing loans and improves the coverage of non-performing loans by provisions. The main implication of the results allows us to deduce that the implementation of fintech makes it possible to have a positive impact on overdue credits, and they are also likely to serve as a lever for the inclusion of those excluded from banking services.

                <p>Visual working memory (VWM) requires precise feature binding. Previous studies have revealed a close relationship between the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) and feature binding during VWM; this study further examined their causal relationship through three transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) experiments. In Experiment 1 (<I>N</I> = 57), participants underwent three sessions of tDCS separately, including PPC stimulation, occipital cortex stimulation, and sham stimulation, and completed delayed estimation tasks for orientations before and after stimulation. Results showed that tDCS over PPC selectively prolonged recall response time (RT) and increased the probability of nontarget responses (a.k.a. failure of feature binding, <I>p</I>NT). In Experiment 2 (<I>N</I> = 29), combining metacognition estimation, we further investigated whether the effects of PPC stimulation were attributed to misbinding (i.e., participants self-reported "remembered" in nontarget responses) or informed guessing trials (participants self-reported "forgotten" in nontarget responses). We replicated the main findings in Experiment 1 and observed greater tDCS effects of PPC on RT in informed guessing trials while there are comparable effects on <I>p</I>NT in these two types of trials. In Experiment 3 (<I>N</I> = 28), we then examined whether the tDCS effects over PPC specifically influenced the memory retrieval process by using a change detection task. We found that PPC stimulation did not influence the recognition RT or accuracy. Together, this study provided direct causal evidence supporting the specific involvement of PPC in feature binding during VWM retrieval, from both aspects of speed and response preference, expanding our understanding of the neural basis of feature binding in VWM.</p>

                <p>Neurodevelopmental abnormalities are considered to be one of the important causes of schizophrenia. The offspring of methylazoxymethanol acetate (MAM)&ndash;exposed mice are recognized for the dysregulation of neurodevelopment and are well-characterized with schizophrenia-like phenotypes. However, the inhibition-related properties of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hippocampus throughout adolescence and adulthood have not been systematically elucidated. In this study, both 10 and 15&nbsp;mg/kg MAM-exposed mice exhibited schizophrenia-related phenotypes in both adolescence and adulthood, including spontaneous locomotion hyperactivity and deficits in prepulse inhibition. We observed that there was an obvious parvalbumin (PV) loss in the mPFC and hippocampus of MAM-exposed mice, extending from adolescence to adulthood. Moreover, the frequency of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) in pyramidal neurons at mPFC and hippocampus was significantly dampened in the 10 and 15&nbsp;mg/kg MAM-exposed mice. Furthermore, the firing rate of putative pyramidal neurons in mPFC and hippocampus was increased, while that of putative inhibitory neurons was decreased during both adolescence and adulthood. In conclusion, PV loss in mPFC and hippocampus of MAM-exposed mice may contribute to the impaired inhibitory function leading to the attenuation of inhibition in the brain both in vitro and in vivo.</p>

                Background Sustaining a ‘fit-for-purpose’ health workforce requires a better understanding of the health care worker cadres that are affected during pandemics and their outcomes. In hospitalized health care workers with confirmed COVID-19 between March 2020 and May 2023 in Liberia, we determined the hospitalization and case fatality rates, type of health care worker cadres affected, their demographic and clinical characteristics and hospital exit outcomes. Methods This was a cohort study using routine data extracted from hospitalization forms for health care workers in 24 designated COVID-19 treatment facilities. Results Of the 424 health care workers with COVID-19, hospitalization rates progressively declined between 2020 and 2023, (P<0.001) with the highest rates in 2020 (24/1,000 health care workers) and 2021 (14/1,000 health care workers). Case fatality was 2% in both 2020 and 2021 with no deaths thereafter. Among those hospitalized, the highest proportions were nursing cadres with 191(45%), physicians with 63 (15%) and laboratory technicians with 42 (10%). The most frequent reported site for COVID-19 infection was the health facility (326, 89%). COVID-19 vaccination coverage in health care workers was 20%. The majority (91%) of hospitalizations were for mild symptomatic infections. Even in referral centres (n-52), 18 (35%) were for mild infections. Of the 424 who were hospitalized, 412 (97%) recovered, 9 (2%) died and 3 (1%) either left against medical advice or absconded. Of the nine deaths, none were vaccinated, seven had moderate-to-severe disease but were not referred to specialized COVID-19 treatment centers. Conclusions The hospitalized health care workers for COVID-19 were predominantly clinical and laboratory personnel who were mostly unvaccinated, and health facilities were hot-spots for contracting infections. The triage and referral system was weak with unnecessary hospitalization of mild infections. This study provides useful insights for outbreak preparedness including priority vaccination and improving health care worker safety in Liberia.

                Background Chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) is the most advanced stage of peripheral artery disease (PAD) and has poor clinical outcomes. Recently, stimulating arteriogenesis has been proposed to improve clinical outcomes. Several studies have shown that miRNAs have beneficial effects on limb ischemia related to arteriogenesis. This study aimed to review the roles of therapeutic miRNAs in the arteriogenesis of limb ischemia. Methods A systematic search was conducted through July 2021 using the PubMed, Scopus, and ScienceDirect databases. Two authors independently assessed studies that investigated the role of miRNAs in the arteriogenesis of limb ischemia, both in vivo and in clinical studies. Results All selected studies were in vivo studies, with a total of 36 articles and 28 types of miRNAs. miRNAs potentially regulate arteriogenesis by targeting different targets. The following miRNAs were upregulated to enhance arteriogenesis: miRNA-126-3p, -93, -675, -143-3p, -130a, -210, -146b, -21, -let-7g, -132/212, -150, and 155. Meanwhile, microRNAs needed to be downregulated, namely: miRNA-939-5p, -503, -199a-5p, -146a, -92a, -14q32 microRNA gene cluster, -15a/16, -100, -133a, -139-5p, -223, -352, -615-5p, -15b/5p, -124-3p, and 29a. MiRNA-126 was the most studied miRNA, and SPRED1 was the most common target of microRNA. However, the included studies showed high heterogeneity in terms of inducing hindlimb ischemia, the timing of administration, and the method used for evaluating arteriogenesis. Moreover, most studies presented unclear or high-risk bias. Conclusion MicroRNA application in a preclinical model of hindlimb ischemia has beneficial effects on arteriogenesis. This result indicates that miRNAs might be potentially beneficial in patients with CLTI. Registration The review protocol was registered with PROSPERO under registration number CRD42024484988.

                Background Central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR) is a common retinal condition with an increased risk of recurrence. Traditional approaches have made choroidal visualization challenging, but recent advances in optical coherence tomography (OCT) innovation have permitted the collection of more accurate choroidal visualizations. This study aimed to measure choroidal thickness in eyes with active CSCR as well as in the unaffected opposite eyes of these same individuals. Methods This research was conducted at the ophthalmology division in Ghazi Al-Hariri Hospital from the 1st of October 2019 until the 31st of March 2020. A total of 49 people, corresponding to 65 eyes, were included in the study. Among these participants, 16 individuals presented with central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR), affecting a total of 32 eyes. The CSCR individuals were further split into two groups: “Group A” consisted of 20 eyes with active CSCR, and “Group B” encompassed the remaining 12 unaffected opposite eyes. Additionally, the right eyes of 33 individuals who were age and gender-matched served as controls assigned as “Group C”. Results The choroid exhibited a substantial rise in thickness across each of the nine sectors in group A as compared to group C. Similarly, group B showed a significant increase in choroidal thickness in relation to group C. The mean subfoveal choroidal thickness (SFCT) was measured as follows: 474.55μm, 437.5μm, and 292.03μm among groups A, B, and C, correspondingly. These differences were identified as clinically significant for both A vs. C and B vs. C. Conclusions This study’s findings indicate a thickening of the choroid in both eyes exhibiting active CSCR, as well as in the unaffected opposite eyes of those with the disease.

                Introduction Low and middle-income countries account for the largest proportion of women’s deaths as a result of pregnancy or childbirth-related complications. The sub-Saharan region is the most affected with approximately 70% (202 000) of maternal deaths between 2000 and 2020. These deaths could have been prevented if expectant mothers were prepared for childbirth. Birth preparedness is perceived as a better strategy that helps attain a substantial reduction in maternal mortality. This is achieved by attending early antenatal classes, receiving skilled care during childbirth, and care and support right after birth. The latest survey on antenatal class attendance conducted in South Africa provides an estimated 30.8% of expectant mothers in public healthcare facilities. Methods This study employed a qualitative approach to collect data, as a result, one focus group discussion with five (N=5) participants and two others with six (N=6) participants each (n=6X2=12) and twenty individual interviews were conducted. The study sought to explore and describe the knowledge and attitudes of healthcare professionals regarding the birth preparedness of women in labour at selected hospitals in Durban KwaZulu-Natal. Results Expectant mothers were unprepared for both labour and postnatal care. The unprepared expectant mothers were uncooperative and made the task of midwives difficult to the extent of endangering the life of their expected newborn babies and their own. Factors such as finance, heterogeneity, staff shortage, language barrier, lack of family support, lack of interest, cultural beliefs, and confusion caused by various sources of information were responsible for birth unpreparedness. Conclusion The synergy between expectant mothers and midwives appears to be an important factor in achieving better birth preparedness.

                Digital and financial literacy are changing the landscape of the globe in terms of its approach to development. These two literacies also help to achieve women’s empowerment and, consequently, the sustainable development goals (SDGs) more quickly. This systematic literature review looks at the two literacies and their effects, focusing on women’s participation and showing how digital literacy not only increases women’s access to knowledge and connectivity but is also a door to women’s entrepreneurship and financial independence. Likewise, financial literacy, when coupled with digital skills, can be a breakthrough to the traditional socioeconomic barrier – poverty – by assisting women in making informed economic decisions, increasing their financial independence and resilience in the face of a global crisis. Empirical realities that still hinder women’s education, such as cultural norms, infrastructural deficiencies and educational gaps, still exist. However, the paper points out that to have a more equal world based on the SDGs, the double literacy strategy for women’s empowerment should not be negotiable.

                Background Studies have shown that perceived self-efficacy can influence teachers’ emotional state, thoughts and behaviours, and students’ learning. It’s also an important referential of professional satisfaction. In turn, teaching methodologies influence motor learning, as well as psychological, cognitive and social learning, with different impacts on human development and learning retention, levels of intrinsic motivation and continuity of practice in order to support a healthy lifestyle. Research on aquatic educators and teaching methodologies is scarce and at the same time necessary according to the view that aquatic literacy is an integral part of physical literacy and the only possibility of being more able to interact with this environment. Methods In this study we used an online questionnaire, aimed at aquatic professionals, which was answered voluntarily and anonymously to measure the prevalence of the use of different teaching methodologies, the comprehensive aquatic method and the perception of teacher self-efficacy. It has been deposited and can be consulted at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.27316242.v1. Results All methods can generate a feeling of self-efficacy in teachers despite having different results, with the methodologies that involve students more actively (cognitivist and constructivist) being those that generate a greater feeling of self-efficacy in teachers. MAC is a method that is more closely related to methodologies focused on active student participation and, consequently, it is a method that generates a high perception of self-efficacy in teachers. Conclusions Levels of self-efficacy influence professional satisfaction, teacher physical, mental and emotional health, as well as student learning. Is recommended that aquatic professionals give prevalence to the cognitivist and constructivist teaching methodologies being MAC a privileged methodological approach for promoting active lifestyle habits throughout life.

                <p>by Lin Lin, Rachel L. Spreng, Kelly E. Seaton, S. Moses Dennison, Lindsay C. Dahora, Daniel J. Schuster, Sheetal Sawant, Peter B. Gilbert, Youyi Fong, Neville Kisalu, Andrew J. Pollard, Georgia D. Tomaras, Jia Li</p>

Despite significant progress in vaccine research, the level of protection provided by vaccination can vary significantly across individuals. As a result, understanding immunologic variation across individuals in response to vaccination is important for developing next-generation efficacious vaccines. Accurate outcome prediction and identification of predictive biomarkers would represent a significant step towards this goal. Moreover, in early phase vaccine clinical trials, small datasets are prevalent, raising the need and challenge of building a robust and explainable prediction model that can reveal heterogeneity in small datasets. We propose a new model named Generative Mixture of Logistic Regression (GeM-LR), which combines characteristics of both a generative and a discriminative model. In addition, we propose a set of model selection strategies to enhance the robustness and interpretability of the model. GeM-LR extends a linear classifier to a non-linear classifier without losing interpretability and empowers the notion of predictive clustering for characterizing data heterogeneity in connection with the outcome variable. We demonstrate the strengths and utility of GeM-LR by applying it to data from several studies. GeM-LR achieves better prediction results than other popular methods while providing interpretations at different levels.

                <p>by Medha Shekhar, Dobromir Rahnev</p>

Prior research has shown that manipulating stimulus energy by changing both stimulus contrast and variability results in confidence-accuracy dissociations in humans. Specifically, even when performance is matched, higher stimulus energy leads to higher confidence. The most common explanation for this effect, derived from cognitive modeling, is the positive evidence heuristic where confidence neglects evidence that disconfirms the choice. However, an alternative explanation is the signal-and-variance-increase hypothesis, according to which these dissociations arise from changes in the separation and variance of perceptual representations. Because artificial neural networks lack built-in confidence heuristics, they can serve as a test for the necessity of confidence heuristics in explaining confidence-accuracy dissociations. Therefore, we tested whether confidence-accuracy dissociations induced by stimulus energy manipulations emerge naturally in convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We found that, across three different energy manipulations, CNNs produced confidence-accuracy dissociations similar to those found in humans. This effect was present for a range of CNN architectures from shallow 4-layer networks to very deep ones, such as VGG-19 and ResNet-50 pretrained on ImageNet. Further, we traced back the reason for the confidence-accuracy dissociations in all CNNs to the same signal-and-variance increase that has been proposed for humans: higher stimulus energy increased the separation and variance of evidence distributions in the CNNs’ output layer leading to higher confidence even for matched accuracy. These findings cast doubt on the necessity of the positive evidence heuristic to explain human confidence and establish CNNs as promising models for testing cognitive theories of human behavior.

                <p>by Michael Alexander Ramirez Sierra, Thomas R. Sokolowski</p>

Understanding how multicellular organisms reliably orchestrate cell-fate decisions is a central challenge in developmental biology, particularly in early mammalian development, where tissue-level differentiation arises from seemingly cell-autonomous mechanisms. In this study, we present a multi-scale, spatial-stochastic simulation framework for mouse embryogenesis, focusing on inner cell mass (ICM) differentiation into epiblast (EPI) and primitive endoderm (PRE) at the blastocyst stage. Our framework models key regulatory and tissue-scale interactions in a biophysically realistic fashion, capturing the inherent stochasticity of intracellular gene expression and intercellular signaling, while efficiently simulating these processes by advancing event-driven simulation techniques. Leveraging the power of Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) through the AI-driven Sequential Neural Posterior Estimation (SNPE) algorithm, we conduct a large-scale Bayesian inferential analysis to identify parameter sets that faithfully reproduce experimentally observed features of ICM specification. Our results reveal mechanistic insights into how the combined action of autocrine and paracrine FGF4 signaling coordinates stochastic gene expression at the cellular scale to achieve robust and reproducible ICM patterning at the tissue scale. We further demonstrate that the ICM exhibits a specific time window of sensitivity to exogenous FGF4, enabling lineage proportions to be adjusted based on timing and dosage, thereby extending current experimental findings and providing quantitative predictions for both mutant and wild-type ICM systems. Notably, FGF4 signaling not only ensures correct EPI-PRE lineage proportions but also enhances ICM resilience to perturbations, reducing fate-proportioning errors by 10-20% compared to a purely cell-autonomous system. Additionally, we uncover a surprising role for variability in intracellular initial conditions, showing that high gene-expression heterogeneity can improve both the accuracy and precision of cell-fate proportioning, which remains robust when fewer than 25% of the ICM population experiences perturbed initial conditions. Our work offers a comprehensive, spatial-stochastic description of the biochemical processes driving ICM differentiation and identifies the necessary conditions for its robust unfolding. It also provides a framework for future exploration of similar spatial-stochastic systems in developmental biology.

                <p>by Vanessa Scholz, Maria Waltmann, Nadine Herzog, Annette Horstmann, Lorenz Deserno</p>

Learning and decision-making undergo substantial developmental changes, with adolescence being a particular vulnerable window of opportunity. In adolescents, developmental changes in specific choice behaviors have been observed (e.g., goal-directed behavior, motivational influences over choice). Elevated levels of decision noise, i.e., choosing suboptimal options, were reported consistently in adolescents. However, it remains unknown whether these observations, the development of specific and more sophisticated choice processes and higher decision noise, are independent or related. It is conceivable, but has not yet been investigated, that the development of specific choice processes might be impacted by age-dependent changes in decision noise. To answer this, we examined 93 participants (12 to 42 years) who completed 3 reinforcement learning (RL) tasks: a motivational Go/NoGo task assessing motivational influences over choices, a reversal learning task capturing adaptive decision-making in response to environmental changes, and a sequential choice task measuring goal-directed behavior. This allowed testing of (1) cross-task generalization of computational parameters focusing on decision noise; and (2) assessment of mediation effects of noise on specific choice behaviors. Firstly, we found only noise levels to be strongly correlated across RL tasks. Second, and critically, noise levels mediated age-dependent increases in more sophisticated choice behaviors and performance gain. Our findings provide novel insights into the computational processes underlying developmental changes in decision-making: namely a vital role of seemingly unspecific changes in noise in the specific development of more complex choice components. Studying the neurocomputational mechanisms of how varying levels of noise impact distinct aspects of learning and decision processes may also be key to better understand the developmental onset of psychiatric diseases.

Longstanding theory predicts that strategic flexibility in when and how to use social information can help individuals make adaptive decisions, especially when environments are temporally or spatially variable. A short-term increase in reliance on social information under these conditions has been experimentally shown in primates, including humans, but whether this occurs in other taxa is unknown. We asked whether migration between spatially variable environments affected social information use with a large-scale cultural diffusion experiment with wild great tits (<i>Parus major</i>) in captivity, a small passerine bird that can socially learn novel behaviors. We simulated an immigration event where knowledgeable birds were exchanged between groups with opposing preferences for a socially learned foraging puzzle, living in similar or different environments. We found evidence that both immigrants and residents were influenced by social information and attended to the rewards that others received. Our analysis supported the use of a payoff-biased social learning by immigrants when both resources and habitat features were spatially variable. In contrast, immigrants relied more-so on individual learning when payoffs or the environment were unchanged. In summary, our results suggest that great tits assess the payoffs others receive and are more influenced by socially observed differences in payoffs when environmental cues differ in their new environment. Our results provide experimental support for the hypothesis that spatial variability is a strong driver for the evolution of social learning strategies.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1362/v1?src=rss">The Demographic Profile of Colorectal Cancer Patients in Indonesia: Insights from a Single Center Experience and Exploration of Immune Response and Survival Outcomes [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Understanding the demographics, tumor characteristics, genetic mutations, and immune scores in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients may aid in tailoring treatment and predicting survival. Methods This retrospective cohort study assessed clinical parameters, immune scores, and their relationship with survival in patients with CRC. Results The study included 74 patients, mean age 53.7 years, mostly male (53.3%) and aged 41-70 (77.3%). Common comorbidities included cardiovascular diseases (29.3%) and hypertension (21.3%). Adenocarcinoma (74%) primarily affects the colon (73%). KRAS mutations and Microsatellite instability-High (MSI-H)/deficient mismatch repair (dMMR) were found in 1.3% and 16% of patients, respectively. Stage IV (77.3%) and liver metastases (52.7%) were prevalent. Immune score was influenced by cancer stage (p = 0.04) and metastasis (p=0.05). The immune score was not associated with survival (p = 0.181). Patients with comorbidities had lower one- (p = 0.027) and two-year survival rates (p = 0.037) survival rates. Cardiovascular comorbidities negatively impacted one-year survival (p = 0.047) and two-year survival (p = 0.037). The mean survival time was shorter for males (2.047±0.288 vs. 2.781±0.195 years, p = 0.041), patients with comorbidities (1.772±0.371 vs. 2.702±0.188 years, p = 0.017), and cardiovascular comorbidities (1.558±0.316 vs. 2.685±0.207 years, p = 0.038). Comorbidities (unadjusted hazard ratio [HR] 2.948, p = 0.023) and cardiovascular comorbidities (unadjusted HR 2.695, p = 0.046) were initially associated with survival but lost significance after adjusting for confounding variables. Conclusions This study provides insights into CRC patient demographics and their interplay with the immune score and survival.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Harvey Jules Karten passed away on July 15, 2024. With his passing, the world lost a remarkable and energetic man who had made major contributions to neuroscience, in particular, resetting our understanding of the evolution of the forebrain and the evolution of intelligence. He left behind a legion of loyal colleagues with whom he had collaborated and shared ideas, students he had inspired and trained, and non-neuroscientist friends he had made in the passionate pursuit of his hobbies—sailing, skiing, and hiking.</p>

                The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and ventromedial-prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) play a key role in decision-making and encode task states in addition to expected value. We review evidence suggesting a connection between value and state representations and argue that OFC / vmPFC integrate stimulus, context, and outcome information. Comparable encoding principles emerge in late layers of deep reinforcement learning (RL) models, where single nodes exhibit similar forms of mixed-selectivity, which enables flexible readout of relevant variables by downstream neurons. Based on these lines of evidence, we suggest that outcome-maximization leads to complex representational spaces that are insufficiently characterized by linear value signals that have been the focus of most prior research on the topic. Major outstanding questions concern the role of OFC/ vmPFC in learning across tasks, in encoding of task-irrelevant aspects, and the role of hippocampus–PFC interactions.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93428">Structure of scavenger receptor SCARF1 and its interaction with lipoproteins</a></h4>

              
                SCARF1 (scavenger receptor class F member 1, SREC-1 or SR-F1) is a type I transmembrane protein that recognizes multiple endogenous and exogenous ligands such as modified low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) and is important for maintaining homeostasis and immunity. But the structural information and the mechanisms of ligand recognition of SCARF1 are largely unavailable. Here, we solve the crystal structures of the N-terminal fragments of human SCARF1, which show that SCARF1 forms homodimers and its epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains adopt a long-curved conformation. Then, we examine the interactions of SCARF1 with lipoproteins and are able to identify a region on SCARF1 for recognizing modified LDLs. The mutagenesis data show that the positively charged residues in the region are crucial for the interaction of SCARF1 with modified LDLs, which is confirmed by making chimeric molecules of SCARF1 and SCARF2. In addition, teichoic acids, a cell wall polymer expressed on the surface of gram-positive bacteria, are able to inhibit the interactions of modified LDLs with SCARF1, suggesting the ligand binding sites of SCARF1 might be shared for some of its scavenging targets. Overall, these results provide mechanistic insights into SCARF1 and its interactions with the ligands, which are important for understanding its physiological roles in homeostasis and the related diseases.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92025">Proteomic and functional comparison between human induced and embryonic stem cells</a></h4>

              
                Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) have great potential to be used as alternatives to embryonic stem cells (hESCs) in regenerative medicine and disease modelling. In this study, we characterise the proteomes of multiple hiPSC and hESC lines derived from independent donors and find that while they express a near-identical set of proteins, they show consistent quantitative differences in the abundance of a subset of proteins. hiPSCs have increased total protein content, while maintaining a comparable cell cycle profile to hESCs, with increased abundance of cytoplasmic and mitochondrial proteins required to sustain high growth rates, including nutrient transporters and metabolic proteins. Prominent changes detected in proteins involved in mitochondrial metabolism correlated with enhanced mitochondrial potential, shown using high-resolution respirometry. hiPSCs also produced higher levels of secreted proteins, including growth factors and proteins involved in the inhibition of the immune system. The data indicate that reprogramming of fibroblasts to hiPSCs produces important differences in cytoplasmic and mitochondrial proteins compared to hESCs, with consequences affecting growth and metabolism. This study improves our understanding of the molecular differences between hiPSCs and hESCs, with implications for potential risks and benefits for their use in future disease modelling and therapeutic applications.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96425">Chemokine expression profile of an innate granuloma</a></h4>

              
                Granulomas are defined by the presence of organized layers of immune cells that include macrophages. Granulomas are often characterized as a way for the immune system to contain an infection and prevent its dissemination. We recently established a mouse infection model where <i>Chromobacterium violaceum</i> induces the innate immune system to form granulomas in the liver. This response successfully eradicates the bacteria and returns the liver to homeostasis. Here, we sought to characterize the chemokines involved in directing immune cells to form the distinct layers of a granuloma. We use spatial transcriptomics to investigate the spatial and temporal expression of all CC and CXC chemokines and their receptors within this granuloma response. The expression profiles change dynamically over space and time as the granuloma matures and then resolves. To investigate the importance of monocyte-derived macrophages in this immune response, we studied the role of CCR2 during <i>C. violaceum</i> infection. <i>Ccr2</i><sup>–/–</sup> mice had negligible numbers of macrophages, but large numbers of neutrophils, in the <i>C. violaceum</i>-infected lesions. In addition, lesions had abnormal architecture resulting in loss of bacterial containment. Without CCR2, bacteria disseminated and the mice succumbed to the infection. This indicates that macrophages are critical to form a successful innate granuloma in response to <i>C. violaceum</i>.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98031">Astrocytes mediate two forms of spike timing-dependent depression at entorhinal cortex-hippocampal synapses</a></h4>

              
                The entorhinal cortex (EC) connects to the hippocampus sending different information from cortical areas that is first processed at the dentate gyrus (DG) including spatial, limbic and sensory information. Excitatory afferents from lateral (LPP) and medial (MPP) perforant pathways of the EC connecting to granule cells of the DG play a role in memory encoding and information processing and are deeply affected in humans suffering Alzheimer’s disease and temporal lobe epilepsy, contributing to the dysfunctions found in these pathologies. The plasticity of these synapses is not well known yet, as are not known the forms of long-term depression (LTD) existing at those connections. We investigated whether spike timing-dependent long-term depression (t-LTD) exists at these two different EC-DG synaptic connections in mice, and whether they have different action mechanisms. We have found two different forms of t-LTD, at LPP- and MPP-GC synapses and characterised their cellular and intracellular mechanistic requirements. We found that both forms of t-LTD are expressed presynaptically and that whereas t-LTD at LPP-GC synapses does not require NMDAR, t-LTD at MPP-GC synapses requires ionotropic NMDAR containing GluN2A subunits. The two forms of t-LTD require different group I mGluR, mGluR5 LPP-GC synapses and mGluR1 MPP-GC synapses. In addition, both forms of t-LTD require postsynaptic calcium, eCB synthesis, CB<sub>1</sub>R, astrocyte activity, and glutamate released by astrocytes. Thus, we discovered two novel forms of t-LTD that require astrocytes at EC-GC synapses.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99809">Isobaric crosslinking mass spectrometry technology for studying conformational and structural changes in proteins and complexes</a></h4>

              
                Dynamic conformational and structural changes in proteins and protein complexes play a central and ubiquitous role in the regulation of protein function, yet it is very challenging to study these changes, especially for large protein complexes, under physiological conditions. Here, we introduce a novel isobaric crosslinker, Qlinker, for studying conformational and structural changes in proteins and protein complexes using quantitative crosslinking mass spectrometry. Qlinkers are small and simple, amine-reactive molecules with an optimal extended distance of ~10 Å, which use MS2 reporter ions for relative quantification of Qlinker-modified peptides derived from different samples. We synthesized the 2-plex Q2linker and showed that the Q2linker can provide quantitative crosslinking data that pinpoints key conformational and structural changes in biosensors, binary and ternary complexes composed of the general transcription factors TBP, TFIIA, and TFIIB, and RNA polymerase II complexes.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93242">An antimicrobial drug recommender system using MALDI-TOF MS and dual-branch neural networks</a></h4>

              
                Timely and effective use of antimicrobial drugs can improve patient outcomes, as well as help safeguard against resistance development. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) is currently routinely used in clinical diagnostics for rapid species identification. Mining additional data from said spectra in the form of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) profiles is, therefore, highly promising. Such AMR profiles could serve as a drop-in solution for drastically improving treatment efficiency, effectiveness, and costs. This study endeavors to develop the first machine learning models capable of predicting AMR profiles for the whole repertoire of species and drugs encountered in clinical microbiology. The resulting models can be interpreted as drug recommender systems for infectious diseases. We find that our dual-branch method delivers considerably higher performance compared to previous approaches. In addition, experiments show that the models can be efficiently fine-tuned to data from other clinical laboratories. MALDI-TOF-based AMR recommender systems can, hence, greatly extend the value of MALDI-TOF MS for clinical diagnostics. All code supporting this study is distributed on PyPI and is packaged at https://github.com/gdewael/maldi-nn.

">Feature similarity: a sensitive method to capture the functional interaction of brain regions and networks to support flexible behavior</a></h4>

              
                The brain is a dynamic system where complex behaviours emerge from interactions across distributed regions. Accurately linking brain function to cognition requires tools that are sensitive to these dynamics. We introduce a novel technique - Feature Similarity (FS) - to capture intricate interaction patterns between brain systems. Our results show that FS can capture functional brain organisation: regions within the same functional network have greater FS compared to those in different networks, and FS also identifies the principal gradient that spans from unimodal to transmodal cortices. FS was found to be more sensitive to task modulation than traditional functional connectivity (FC). Specifically, FS reveals interaction patterns missed by FC, such as a double dissociation in the Dorsal Attention Network (DAN): greater interaction with the Visual network during working memory tasks and greater interaction with the default mode network (DMN) during long-term memory tasks. This study highlights FS as a promising tool for understanding flexibility in brain network dynamics.

">SEX-RELATED GENE EXPRESSION IN THE POSTERODORSAL MEDIAL AMYGDALA OF CYCLING FEMALE RATS ALONG WITH PROLACTIN MODULATION OF LORDOSIS BEHAVIOR</a></h4>

              
                The rat posterodorsal medial amygdala (MePD) is sexually dimorphic, has a high concentration of receptors for gonadal hormones and prolactin (PRL), and modulates reproduction. To unravel genetic and functional data for this relevant node of the social behavior network, we studied the expression of ERalpha, ERbeta, GPER1, Kiss1, Kiss1R, PRGR, PRL, PRLR, EGR1, JAK2, STAT5A, and STAT5B in the MePD of males and females along the estrous cycle using the RT-qPCR technique. We also investigated whether PRL in the MePD would affect the sexual behavior display of proestrus females by microinjecting saline, the PRL receptor antagonist Del1-9-G129R-hPRL (1 microM and 10 microM), or PRL (1 nM) and Del1-9-G129R-hPRL (10 microM) 3h before the onset of the dark-cycle period. The estrogen-dependent lordosis behavior, indicative of sexual receptivity of proestrus females, was recorded and compared before (control) and after (test) microinjections in these groups. Sex differences were found in the right and left MePD gene expression. ERalpha and Kiss1R, as well as PRL, Short PRLR, and STAT5B expression is higher in cycling females than males. Kiss1 expression is higher in males than females, and GPER1 is higher during diestrus than proestrus. Furthermore, Del1-9-G129R-hPRL in the MePD significantly reduced the full display and quotient of lordosis in proestrus females, an effect restored by the co-microinjection of PRL. In conjunction, the expression of studied genes showed specific sex and estrous cycle phase features while, in proestrus, PRL action in the MePD plays an essential role in the display of lordosis during the ovulatory period.

">Multimodal investigation of the neurocognitive deficits underlying dyslexia in adulthood</a></h4>

              
                Dyslexia is a neurobiological disorder characterised by reading difficulties, yet its underlying causes remain unclear. Neuroimaging and behavioural studies found anomalous responses in tasks requiring phonological processing, motion perception, and implicit learning, and showed gray and white matter abnormalities in several brain regions of dyslexics compared to controls, indicating that dyslexia is a heterogeneous condition and promoting a multifactorial approach. In order to evaluate whether the combination of behavioural and multimodal MRI can have greater sensitivity in identifying neurocognitive traits of dyslexia compared to monocomponential approaches, in 19 dyslexic and 19 control subjects we acquired behavioural cognitive assessments, multiple (phonological, visual motion, rhythmic) mismatch-response functional MRI tasks, structural diffusion-weighted and T1-weighted images. To examine between-group differences in the multimodal neurocognitive measures, we applied univariate and multivariate approaches. Results showed that dyslexics performed worse than controls in behavioural phonological tasks. Neuroimaging analyses revealed that individuals with dyslexia present reduced cerebellar responses to mismatching rhythmic stimuli, as well as structural disorganization in several white matter tracts and cortical regions previously implicated in dyslexia. Most importantly, in line with the view of dyslexia as a multifactorial phenomenon, a machine learning model trained with features from all three MRI modalities (functional, diffusion, and T1-weighted) discriminated between dyslexics and controls with greater accuracy than models including just one modality. The individual classification scores in the multimodal machine learning model correlated with behavioural reading accuracy. These results confirm that dyslexia should be approached as a composite condition characterised by multiple distinctive cognitive and brain features.

">Comparative analysis of spike-sorters in large-scale brainstem recordings</a></h4>

              
                Recent technological advancements in high-density multi-channel electrodes have made it possible to record large numbers of neurons from previously inaccessible regions. While the performance of automated spike-sorters has been assessed in recordings from cortex, dentate gyrus, and thalamus, the most effective and efficient approach for spike-sorting can depend on the target region due to differing morphological and physiological characteristics. We therefore assessed the performance of five commonly used sorting packages, Kilosort3, MountainSort5, Tridesclous, SpyKING CIRCUS, and IronClust, in recordings from the rostral ventromedial medulla, a region that has been characterized using single-electrode recordings but that is essentially unexplored at the high-density network level. As demonstrated in other brain regions, each sorter produced unique results. Manual curation preferentially eliminated units detected by only one sorter. Kilosort3 and IronClust required the least curation while maintaining the largest number of units, whereas SpyKING CIRCUS and MountainSort5 required substantial curation. Tridesclous consistently identified the smallest number of units. Nonetheless, all sorters successfully identified classically defined RVM physiological cell types. These findings suggest that while the level of manual curation needed may vary across sorters, each can extract meaningful data from this deep brainstem site.

">Brain functional network connectivity interpolation characterizes neuropsychiatric continuum and heterogeneity</a></h4>

              
                Psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia (SZ) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are challenging to characterize in part due to their heterogeneous presentation in individuals, with psychotic symptoms now thought to exist on a continuum from the general population to chronic SZ. Conventional diagnostic and neuroimaging analytical approaches rely on subjective assessment or group differences, but typically ignore progression between groups or heterogeneity within a group. Here, we propose a functional network connectivity (FNC) interpolation framework based on an unsupervised generative model, a variational autoencoder (VAE), to estimate the neuropsychiatric continuum and heterogeneity using static FNC (sFNC) and dynamic FNC (dFNC) data from controls and patients with SZ or ASD. We first demonstrate that VAEs significantly outperform a linear baseline and a semi-supervised counterpart in the interpolation task. We next utilize VAEs to perform sFNC and dFNC interpolation separately. For sFNC interpolation, we observe a high degree of correspondence between the generated sFNC and the corresponding original sFNC. We display the sFNC matrices on a two-dimensional grid to examine individual- and group-specific patterns, as well as pattern alterations. Specifically, the interpolated continua from patients to controls in both disorders show increased hyper-connectivity within the auditory, sensorimotor and visual networks, and between the subcortical and cerebellar domains, as well as hypo-connectivity between the subcortical domain and the sensory domains, and between the cerebellar domain and the sensory regions. For dFNC interpolation, we find that the generated dFNC states effectively capture representative and generalizable dynamic properties for each group. Finally, we show examples of how to leverage interpolation in the VAE latent space, following pathological, state-based, or temporal trajectories. The proposed framework offers added advantages over traditional methods, including data-driven discovery of hidden relationships, visualization of individual differences, imputation of missing values along a continuous spectrum, and estimation of the stage where an individual falls within the continuum. Further, it could potentially be applied to identify patient subgroups and predict future disorder progression.

                Entropy trajectories remain unclear for the aging process of human brain system due to the lacking of longitudinal neuroimaging resource. We used open data from an accelerated longitudinal cohort (PREVENT-AD) that included 24 healthy aging participants followed by 4 years with 5 visits per participant to establish cortical entropy aging curves and distinguish with the effects of age and cohort. This reveals that global cortical entropy decreased with aging, while a significant cohort effect was detectable that people who were born earlier showed higher cortical entropy. Such entropy reductions were also evident for large-scale cortical networks, although with different rates of reduction for different networks. Specifically, the primary and intermediate networks reduce their entropy faster than the higher-order association networks. We conclude two specific characteristics of the entropy of the human cortex with aging: the shift of the complexity hierarchy and the diversity of complexity strengthen.

">Modeling Complex Animal Behavior with Latent State Inverse Reinforcement Learning</a></h4>

              
                Understanding complex animal behavior is crucial for linking brain computation to observed actions. While recent research has shifted towards modeling behavior as a dynamic process, few approaches exist for modeling long-term, naturalistic behaviors such as navigation. We introduce discrete Dynamical Inverse Reinforcement Learning (dDIRL), a latent state-dependent paradigm for modeling complex animal behavior over extended periods. dDIRL models animal behavior as being driven by internal state-specific rewards, with Markovian transitions between the distinct internal states. Using expectation-maximization, we infer reward functions corresponding to each internal states and the transition probabilities between them, from observed behavior. We applied dDIRL to water-starved mice navigating a labyrinth, analyzing each animal individually. Our results reveal three distinct internal states sufficient to describe behavior, including a consistent water-seeking state occupied for less than half the time. We also identified two clusters of animals with different exploration patterns in the labyrinth. dDIRL offers a nuanced understanding of how internal states and their associated rewards shape observed behavior in complex environments, paving the way for deeper insights into the neural basis of naturalistic behavior.

                Glia reactivity, neuroinflammation and excitotoxic neuronal death are central processes to ischemic stroke and neurodegenerative diseases, altogether a leading cause of death, disability, and dementia. Due to the high incidence of these pathologies and the lack of efficient treatments, it is a priority developing brain protective therapies impacting both neurons and glial cells. Truncated neurotrophin receptor TrkB-T1, a protein produced by all these cells, plays relevant roles in excitotoxicity and ischemia. We have hypothesized that interactions established by isoform-specific TrkB-T1 sequences might be relevant to neurotoxicity and/or reactive gliosis and, therefore, constitute a therapeutic target. We identify here the TrkB-T1-specific interactome, poorly described to date, and demonstrate that interference of these protein-protein interactions using brain-accessible TrkB-T1-derived peptides can prevent reactive gliosis and decrease excitotoxicity-induced damage in cellular and mouse models of stroke. The pivotal role played by TrkB-T1 on microglia and astrocyte reactivity suggests that isoform-derived peptides could become important in development of therapies for human stroke and other excitotoxicity-associated pathologies.

">A Unified Approach for Identifying PET-based Neuronal Activation and Molecular Connectivity with the functional PET toolbox</a></h4>

              
                Purpose: Functional PET (fPET) enables the identification of stimulation-specific changes of various physiological processes (e.g., glucose metabolism, neurotransmitter synthesis) as well as computation of individual molecular connectivity and group-level molecular covariance. However, currently no consistent analysis approach is available for these techniques. We present a versatile, freely available toolbox designed for the analysis of fPET data, thereby filling a gap in the assessment of neuroimaging data. Methods: The fPET toolbox supports analyses for a variety of radiotracers, scanners, experimental protocols, cognitive tasks and species. It includes general linear model (GLM)-based assessment of task-specific effects, percent signal change and absolute quantification, as well as independent component analysis (ICA) for data-driven analyses. Furthermore, it allows computation of molecular connectivity via temporal correlations of PET signals between regions and molecular covariance as between-subject covariance using static images. Results: Toolbox performance was validated by analysis protocols established in previous work. Stimulation-induced changes in [18F]FDG metabolic demands and neurotransmitter dynamics obtained with 6-[18F]FDOPA and [11C]AMT were robustly detected across different cognitive tasks. Molecular connectivity analysis demonstrated metabolic interactions between different networks, whereas group-level covariance analysis highlighted interhemispheric relationships. These results underscore the flexibility of fPET in capturing dynamic molecular processes. Conclusions: The toolbox offers a comprehensive, unified and user-friendly platform for analyzing fPET data across a variety of experimental settings. It provides a reproducible analysis approach, which in turn facilitates sharing of analyses pipelines and comparison across centers to advance the study of brain metabolism and neurotransmitter dynamics in health and disease.

">Bidirectional Impact of miR-29a modulation on Memory Stability in the Adult Brain</a></h4>

              
                MicroRNAs are key regulators of brain gene expression, with miR-29a notably upregulated from development to adulthood and in aging, and showing links to cognitive decline. However, the extent to which miR-29 levels influence learning and memory processes, and its molecular mediators, remains to be determined. Here, we down- and up-regulated miR-29a levels in the dorsal hippocampus of adult mice to reveal miR-29 role in memory. Inhibiting miR-29a enhanced trace fear memory stability, increased Dnmt3a levels, and affected CpG methylation in gene regulation regions. In contrast, increasing miR-29a impaired memory performances and decreased Dnmt3a levels, suggesting a destabilization of memory processes. Proteomic and transcriptomic analysis demonstrated that miR-29a antagonism upregulated RNA-binding and synaptic proteins and downregulated inflammation and myelin associated proteins. These results underscore miR-29a pivotal role in memory persistence, plasticity, and cognitive aging, suggesting that miR-29a modulation could offer potential strategies for cognitive enhancement and age-related memory decline.

">Sulfatide deficiency-induced astrogliosis and myelin lipid dyshomeostasis are independent of Trem2-mediated microglial activation</a></h4>

              
                Disrupted lipid homeostasis and neuroinflammation often co-exist in neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the intrinsic connection and causal relationship between these deficits remain elusive. Our previous studies show that the loss of sulfatide (ST), a class of myelin-enriched lipids, causes AD-like neuroinflammatory responses, cognitive impairment, bladder enlargement, as well as lipid dyshomeostasis. To better understand the relationship between neuroinflammation and lipid disruption induced by ST deficiency, we established a ST-deficient mouse model with constitutive Trem2 knockout and studied the impact of Trem2 in regulating ST deficiency-induced microglia-mediated neuroinflammation, astrocyte activation and lipid disruption. Our study demonstrates that Trem2 regulates ST deficiency-induced microglia-mediated neuroinflammatory pathways and astrogliosis at the transcriptomic level, but not astrocyte activation at the protein level, suggesting that Trem2 is indispensable for ST deficiency-induced microglia-mediated neuroinflammation but not astrogliosis. Meanwhile, ST loss-induced lipidome disruption and free water retention were consistently observed in the absence of Trem2. Collectively, these results emphasize the essential role of Trem2 in mediating lipid loss-associated microglia-mediated neuroinflammation, but not both astrogliosis and myelin lipid disruption. Moreover, we demonstrated that attenuating neuroinflammation has a limited impact on brain ST loss-induced lipidome alteration or AD-like peripheral disorders. Our findings suggest that preserving lipidome and astrocyte balance may be crucial in decelerating the progression of AD.

                Single-nucleus transcriptomic studies have revealed glial cell states associated with Alzheimer's disease; however, these nuclei are dissociated from the complex architecture of the human neocortex. Here, we successfully performed an unbiased distance-based analytic strategy on spatially-registered transcriptomic data. Leveraging immunohistochemistry in the same tissue section, our analyses prioritized SERPINA3 and other genes, such as metallothioneins, as altered in the vicinity of neuritic amyloid plaques. Results were validated at the protein level by immunofluorescence, highlighting that a reactive SERPINA3+ astrocyte subtype, Ast.5, plays a role in the plaque microenvironment.

">Modeling of blood flow dynamics in the rat somatosensory cortex</a></h4>

              
                The cerebral microvasculature forms a dense network of interconnected blood vessels where flow is modulated partly by astrocytes. Increased neuronal activity stimulates astrocytes to release vasoactive substances at the endfeet, altering the diameters of connected vessels. Our study simulated the coupling between blood flow variations and vessel diameter changes driven by astrocytic activity in the rat somatosensory cortex. We developed a framework with three key components: coupling between vasculature and synthesized astrocytic morphologies, a fluid dynamics model to compute flow in each vascular segment, and a stochastic process replicating the effect of astrocytic endfeet on vessel radii. The model was validated against experimental flow values from literature across cortical depths. We found that local vasodilation from astrocyte activity increased blood flow, especially in capillaries, exhibiting a layer-specific response in deeper cortical layers. Additionally, the highest blood flow variability occurred in capillaries, emphasizing their role in cerebral perfusion regulation. We discovered that astrocytic activity impacts blood flow dynamics in a localized, clustered manner, with most vascular segments influenced by two to three neighboring endfeet. These insights enhance our understanding of neurovascular coupling and guide future research on blood flow-related diseases.

">Restoring Synaptic Balance in Schizophrenia: Insights from a thalamo-cortical conductance-based model.</a></h4>

              
                The dysconnectivity hypothesis of schizophrenia suggests that atypical, aberrant neural communication underlies the disorder's diverse symptoms. Building on this framework, our study introduces a novel approach to understanding schizophrenia and exploring potential ways to adjust neural activity through synaptic restoration. Using a combination of magnetoencephalography data and dynamic causal modeling, we identified specific synaptic disturbances in schizophrenia patients, including increased NMDA receptor-mediated excitation in superficial pyramidal neurons and reduced GABA-B receptor-mediated inhibition between interneurons and pyramidal cells. These findings reveal a critical imbalance in excitation and inhibition within thalamo-cortical circuits, manifesting as altered gamma and alpha oscillations. The cornerstone of our research is an in silico synaptic restoration analysis, which demonstrates that targeted modifications to AMPA, NMDA, GABA-A, and GABA-B receptor-mediated connections can recalibrate altered neural activity in schizophrenia, aligning it with healthy control patterns. This restoration approach not only highlights the complex nature of synaptic dysfunction in the disorder but also identifies specific pathways as potential therapeutic targets, offering new avenues for investigating schizophrenia's diverse symptomatology.

">Astrocytic connexin43 phosphorylation contributes to seizure susceptibility after mild Traumatic Brain Injury</a></h4>

              
                Astrocytes play a crucial role in maintaining brain homeostasis through functional gap junctions (GJs) primarily formed by connexin43 (Cx43). These GJs facilitate electrical and metabolic coupling between astrocytes, allowing the passage of ions, glucose, and metabolites. Dysregulation of Cx43 has been implicated in various pathologies, including traumatic brain injury (TBI) and acquired epilepsy. We previously identified a subset of atypical astrocytes after mild TBI that exhibit reduced Cx43 expression and coupling and are correlated with the development of spontaneous seizures. Given that mild TBI affects millions globally and can lead to long-term complications, including post-traumatic epilepsy, understanding the molecular events post-TBI is critical for developing therapeutic strategies. In the present study, we assessed the heterogeneity of Cx43 protein expression after mild TBI. In accordance with our previous findings, a subset of astrocytes lost Cx43 expression. As previously reported after TBI, we also found a significant increase in total Cx43 protein expression after mild TBI, predominantly in the soluble form, suggesting that while junctional Cx43 protein levels remained stable, hemichannels and cytoplasmic Cx43 were increased. We then investigated the phosphorylation of Cx43 at serine 368 after TBI, which is known to influence GJ assembly and function. Phosphorylation of Cx43 at serine 368 is elevated following TBI and Cx43S368A mutant mice, lacking this phosphorylation, exhibited reduced susceptibility to seizures induced by pentylenetetrazol (PTZ). These findings suggest that TBI-induced Cx43 phosphorylation enhances seizure susceptibility, while inhibiting this modification presents a potential therapeutic avenue for mitigating neuronal hyperexcitability and seizure development.

">Dynamic prioritisation of sensory and motor contents in working memory</a></h4>

              
                Internal selective attention prioritises both sensory and motor contents in working memory to guide prospective behaviour. Prior research has shown how attention modulation of sensory contents is flexible and temporally tuned depending on access requirements, but whether the prioritisation of motor contents follows similar flexible dynamics remains elusive. Also uncharted is the degree of co-dependence of sensory and motor modulation, which gets at the nature of both working-memory representations and internal attention functions. To address these questions, we independently tracked the prioritisation of sensory and motor working-memory contents as a function of dynamically evolving temporal expectations. The design orthogonally manipulated when an item location (left vs right side) and associated prospective action (left vs right hand) would be relevant. Contralateral modulation of posterior alpha (8-12 Hz) activity in electroencephalography (EEG) tracked prioritisation of the item location, while contralateral modulation of central mu/beta (8-30 Hz) activity tracked response prioritisation. Proactive and dynamic alpha and mu/beta modulation confirmed the flexible and temporally structured prioritisation of sensory and motor contents alike. Intriguingly, the prioritisation of sensory and motor contents was temporally uncoupled, showing dissociable patterns of modulation. The findings reveal multiple modulatory functions of internal attention operating in tandem to prepare relevant aspects of internal representations for adaptive behaviour.

                How seizures begin at the level of microscopic neural circuits remains unknown. High-density CMOS microelectrode arrays provide a new avenue for investigating neuronal network activity, with unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution. We use high-density CMOS-based microelectrode arrays to probe the network activity of human hippocampal brain slices from six patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy in the presence of hyperactivity promoting media. Two slices from the dentate gyrus exhibited epileptiform activity in the presence of low magnesium media with kainic acid. Both slices displayed an electrophysiological phenotype consistent with a reciprocally connected circuit, suggesting a recurrent feedback loop is a key driver of epileptiform onset. Larger prospective studies are needed, but these findings have the potential to elucidate the network signals underlying the initiation of seizure behavior.

                Behavioural and neuroscientific evidence suggests visual stimuli that signal value involuntarily capture attention and are preferentially processed, even when unattended. We examined whether learned value associations for task-irrelevant auditory stimuli modulate pre-attentive processing and involuntarily capture attention. Across two experiments, the effect of learned value on the visual- and auditory-evoked mismatch negativity (MMN) and P3a event-related potential (ERP) components was measured. Participants performed a primary visual detection task while an irrelevant, unattended oddball stimulus stream was concurrently presented. Deviants within this oddball stream had been previously learned to signal one of several value outcomes: monetary reward, loss or no change. Neither the auditory nor the visual MMN was influenced by these value associations. However, stimulus value affected performance on the primary task and the magnitude of the P3a in those who could identify the stimulus-value pairings at test. Supplementary mass univariate analyses and time frequency decomposition (theta phase-locking) confirmed the presence of the MMN and the absence of any influence of stimulus value on the MMN response. Findings suggest that learned value associations do not meaningfully influence the MMN prediction signaling mechanism for task-irrelevant auditory stimuli.

">Descending locus coeruleus noradrenergic signaling to spinal astrocyte subset is required for stress-induced pain facilitation</a></h4>

              
                It is known that stress powerfully alters pain, but its underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we identified a circuit, locus coeruleus descending noradrenergic neurons projecting to the spinal dorsal horn (LC[-&gt;]SDH-NA neurons), that is activated by acute exposure to restraint stress and is required for stress-induced mechanical pain hypersensitivity in mice. Interestingly, the primary target of spinal NA released from descending LC[-&gt;]SDH-NAergic terminals causing the stress-induced pain hypersensitivity was 1A-adrenaline receptors (1ARs) in Hes5-positive (Hes5+) astrocytes located in the SDH, an astrocyte subset that has an ability to induce pain sensitization. Furthermore, activation of Hes5+ astrocytes reduced activity of SDH-inhibitory neurons (SDH-INs) that have an inhibitory role in pain processing. This astrocytic reduction of IN activity was canceled by an A1-adenosine receptor (A1R)-knockdown in SDH-INs, and the A1R-knockdown suppressed pain hypersensitivity caused by acute restraint stress. Therefore, our findings suggest that LC[-&gt;]SDH-NA neuronal signaling to Hes5+ SDH astrocytes and subsequent astrocytic reduction of SDH-IN activity are essential for pain facilitation caused by stress.

">Humans anticipate the consequences of motor control demands when making perceptual decisions between actions</a></h4>

              
                Animals, including humans, are often faced with situations where they must decide between potential actions to perform based on various sources of information, including movement parameters that incur time and energy costs. Consistent with this fact, many behavioral studies indicate that decisions and actions show a high level of integration during goal-directed behavior. In particular, motor costs very often bias the choice process of human and non-human subjects facing successive decisions between actions. However, it appears as well that depending on the design in which the experiment occurs, the effect of motor costs on decisions can vary or even vanish. This suggests a contextual dependence of the influence of motor costs on decision-making. Moreover, it is not currently known whether or not the impact of motor costs on perceptual decisions depend on the difficulty of the decision. We addressed these two important issues by studying the behavior of healthy human subjects engaged in a new perceptual decision-making paradigm in which the constraint level associated with the movement executed to report a choice was volitionally chosen by the participants, and in which the difficulty of the perceptual decision to make continuously evolved depending on their motor performance. The results indicate that the level of constraint associated with a movement executed to express a perceptual decision strongly impacts the duration of these decisions, with a shortening of decisions when these are expressed by demanding movements. This influence appears most important when the decisions are difficult, but it is also present for easy decisions. We interpret this strategy as an adaptive way to optimize the participants' overall rate of success at the session level.

">Impaired online and enhanced offline motor sequence learning in individuals with Parkinson's disease</a></h4>

              
                Whereas memory consolidation research has traditionally focused on longer temporal windows (i.e., hours to days) following an initial learning episode, recent research has also examined the functional significance of the shorter rest epochs commonly interspersed with blocks of task practice (i.e., "micro-offline" intervals on the timescale of seconds to minutes). In the motor sequence learning domain, evidence from young, healthy individuals suggests that micro-offline epochs afford a rapid consolidation process that is supported by the hippocampus. Consistent with these findings, amnesic patients with hippocampal damage were recently found to exhibit degraded micro-offline performance improvements. Interestingly, these offline losses were compensated for by larger performance gains during online practice. Given the known role of the striatum in online motor sequence learning, we hypothesized that individuals with dysfunction of the striatal system would exhibit impaired online, yet enhanced micro-offline, learning (i.e., a pattern of results opposite to those observed in patients with hippocampal lesions). We tested this hypothesis using Parkinson's disease (PD) as a model of striatal dysfunction. Forty-two de novo, drug-naive individuals (men and women) with a clinical diagnosis of unilateral PD and 29 healthy control subjects completed a motor sequence learning paradigm. Individuals with PD exhibited deficits during online task practice that were paralleled by greater improvements over micro-offline intervals. This pattern of results could not be explained by disease-related deficits in movement execution. These data suggest that striatal dysfunction disrupts online learning, yet total learning remains unchanged because of greater micro-offline performance improvements that potentially reflect hippocampal-mediated compensatory processes.

                Development of therapeutic approaches that target specific microglia responses in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is crucial due to the involvement of microglia in ALS progression. Our study identifies the predominant microglia subset in human ALS primary motor cortex and spinal cord as an undifferentiated phenotype with dysregulated respiratory electron transport. Moreover, we find that the interferon response microglia subset is enriched in donors with aggressive disease progression, while a previously described potentially protective microglia phenotype is depleted in ALS. Additionally, we observe an enrichment of non-microglial immune cell, mainly NK/T cells, in ALS central nervous system, primarily in the spinal cord. These findings pave the way for the development of microglia subset-specific therapeutic interventions to slow or even stop ALS progression.

">Deep Neural Networks Explain Spiking Activity in Auditory Cortex</a></h4>

              
                For static stimuli or at gross (~1-s) time scales, artificial neural networks (ANNs) that have been trained on challenging engineering tasks, like image classification and automatic speech recognition, are now the best predictors of neural responses in primate visual and auditory cortex. It is, however, unknown whether this success can be extended to spiking activity at fine time scales, which are particularly relevant to audition. Here we address this question with ANNs trained on speech audio, and acute multi-electrode recordings from the auditory cortex of squirrel monkeys. We show that layers of trained ANNs can predict the spike counts of neurons responding to speech audio and to monkey vocalizations at bin widths of 50 ms and below. For some neurons, the ANNs explain close to all of the explainable variance---much more than traditional spectrotemporal--receptive-field models, and more than untrained networks. Non-primary neurons tend to be more predictable by deeper layers of the ANNs, but there is much variation by neuron, which would be invisible to coarser recording modalities.

">Spontaneous Brain Dynamics Associated With Acceleration Of Longterm Functional Connectome In Postnatal Development</a></h4>

              
                The first six postnatal months are a critical period for brain development, marked by rapid changes in functional neural circuits. However, long-term changes in neonatal functional connectome lacks an interpretive imaging indicator for the future development due to the non-linearity characteristics. In this study, we introduce an approach to extract intrinsic brain states from short-term brain dynamics to study the long-term (longitudinal) development. We found a high association (r=0.460) between the co-activated pattern of specific brain state and the acceleration pattern of non-linear development of static functional connectome. The fractional occupancy, self-sustaining probability of this short-term state share the similar age tendency with the long-term change rate within the majority of the function connectome. These findings suggest that short-term brain dynamics could serve as potential biomarkers for predicting the long-term development of functional connectome.

">Single-cell transcriptomic analysis of macaque LGN neurons reveals novel subpopulations</a></h4>

              
                Neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) provide a pivotal role in the visual system by modulating and relaying signals from the retina to the visual cortex. Although the primate LGN, with its distinct divisions (magnocellular, M; parvocellular, P; and koniocellular, K), has been extensively characterized, the intrinsic heterogeneity of LGN neurons has remained unexplained. With the development of high-throughput single-cell transcriptomics, researchers can rapidly isolate and profile large sets of neuronal nuclei, revealing a surprising diversity of genetic expression within the nervous systems. Here, we analyzed the transcriptomes of individual cells belonging to macaque LGN using raw data from a public database to explore the heterogeneity of LGN neurons. Using statistical analyses, we found additional subpopulations within the LGN transcriptomic population, whose gene expressions imply functional differences. Our results suggest the existence of a more nuanced complexity in LGN processing beyond the classic view of the three cell types and highlight a need to combine transcriptomic and functional assessments. A complete account of the cell type diversity of the primate LGN is critical to understanding how vision works.

">Unique Asymmetric Branching of Drosophila Neurons Optimizes Temporal Dendritic Computation</a></h4>

              
                Neurons execute a versatile array of computations through a complex interplay of factors, including their morphology and synaptic architecture. Dendritic branching encodes upstream inputs into diverse spike patterns transmitted via downstream axons. While earlier studies highlighted the distinct morphologies and functions of a few representative neurons, the availability of large-scale electron microscopy and fluorescent imaging now enables comprehensive data analysis and further simulations to explore structure-function relationships more broadly. This study investigates the general morphological characteristics of diverse neuron types in the fly model. By employing the Strahler Order (SO) metric, we identified a specific bias towards asymmetry in neuronal branching and further investigated the effect of the asymmetry on computational capabilities. Specifically, symmetric branching enhances coincidence detection capability, whereas asymmetric branching increases input order-selectivity. While certain neurons exhibit extreme symmetry or asymmetry optimized for specific tasks, most neurons strike a balance between these computational strategies. This balance underscores the intricate relationship between neuronal structure and function. In contrast to the wide range of branching symmetries found in random bifurcation models, neurons across different species exhibit species-specific asymmetry, suggesting shared underlying branching mechanisms. Our findings provide a fresh perspective on the exploration of neuronal morphologies and their computational roles.

">Fructose-2,6-bisphosphate restores TDP-43 pathology-driven genome repair deficiency in motor neuron diseases</a></h4>

              
                TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) proteinopathy plays a critical role in neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). In our recent discovery, we identified that TDP-43 plays a critical role in DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair via the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway. Here, we found persistent DNA damage in brains of ALS/FTD patients, primarily in the transcribed regions of the genome. We further investigated the underlying mechanism and found that the activity of polynucleotide kinase 3' phosphatase (PNKP) was severely impaired in the nuclear extracts of both the patient brains and TDP-43-depleted cells. PNKP is a key player in DSB repair within the transcribed genome, where its 3'-P termini processing activity is crucial for preventing persistent DNA damage and neuronal death. The inactivation of PNKP in ALS/FTD was due to reduced levels of its interacting partner, phosphofructo-2-kinase fructose 2,6 bisphosphatase (PFKFB3), and its biosynthetic product, fructose-2,6 bisphosphate (F2,6BP), an allosteric modulator of glycolysis. Recent work from our group has shown that F2,6BP acts as a positive modulator of PNKP activity in vivo. Notably, exogenous supplementation with F2,6BP restored PNKP activity in both nuclear extracts from ALS/FTD brain samples and in patient-derived induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells harboring pathological mutations. Our findings underscore the possibility of exploring the therapeutic potential of F2,6BP or its analogs in TDP-43 pathology-associated motor neuron diseases.

">Calcium-based input timing learning</a></h4>

              
                Stimulus-triggered synaptic long-term plasticity is the foundation of learning and other cognitive abilities of the brain. In general, long-term synaptic plasticity is subdivided into two different forms: homosynaptic plasticity describes synaptic changes at stimulated synapses, while heterosynaptic plasticity summarizes synaptic changes at non-stimulated synapses. For homosynaptic plasticity, the Ca2+-hypothesis pinpoints the calcium concentration within a stimulated dendritic spine as key mediator or controller of underlying biochemical and -physical processes. On the other hand, for heterosynaptic plasticity, although theoretical studies attribute important functional roles to it, such as synaptic competition and cooperation, experimental results remain ambiguous regarding its manifestation and biological basis. By integrating insights from Ca2+-dependent homosynaptic plasticity with experimental data of dendritic Ca2+-dynamics, we developed a mathematical model that describes the complex temporal and spatial dynamics of calcium in the dendritic shaft and respective dendritic spines. We show that the increased influx of calcium into a stimulated spine can lead to its diffusion through the shaft to neighboring spines, triggering heterosynaptic effects such as synaptic competition or cooperation. By considering different input strengths, our model explains the ambiguity of reported experimental results of heterosynaptic plasticity, suggesting that the Ca2+ hypothesis of homosynaptic plasticity can be extended to also model heterosynaptic plasticity. Furthermore, our model predicts that, via diffusion of calcium, a synapse can modulate the expression of homosynaptic plasticity at a neighboring synapse in an input-timing-dependent manner, without the need of postsynaptic spiking. The resulting sensitivity of synaptic plasticity on input-spike-timing can be influenced by the distance between involved spines as well as the local diffusion properties of the connecting dendritic shaft, providing a new way of dendritic computation.

                Subcortical nuclei of the ascending arousal system play an important role in regulating brain and cognition. However, functional MRI of these nuclei in humans involves unique challenges due to their size and location deep within the brain. Here, we used ultra-high-field MRI and other methodological advances to investigate the activity of six subcortical nuclei during reward anticipation and memory encoding: the locus coeruleus, basal forebrain, median and dorsal raphe nuclei, substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area. Participants performed a monetary incentive delay task, which successfully induced a state of reward anticipation, and a 24-hour delayed surprise memory test. Region-of-interest analyses revealed that activity in all subcortical nuclei increased in anticipation of potential rewards as opposed to neutral outcomes. In contrast, activity in none of the nuclei predicted memory performance 24 hours later. These findings provide new insights into the cognitive functions that are supported by the human ascending arousal system.

">An integrative layer-resolved atlas of the adult human meninges</a></h4>

              
                The human meninges are a dynamic tri-layered brain border that plays a key role in brain development, CSF homeostasis, immune regulation, and higher-level brain function. The meninges have also been implicated in central nervous system (CNS) pathologies such as infection, autoimmunity, and brain trauma. To understand how the meningeal microenvironment is altered under pathological conditions it is necessary to have a complete understanding of its normotypic cellular architecture and function. To date, there is no complete atlas of the normotypic adult human meninges. By surgically extracting each human meningeal layer during surgery, we generated the first layer-resolved map of all meningeal cell types via an integration of whole cell single cell RNA sequencing, multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH), and protein immunolabelling. Since fibroblasts play key roles in meningeal homeostasis yet remain less well-characterised than other meningeal cell types, we deeply phenotyped these cells in all layers. We identified 10 fibroblast subpopulations with unique predicted functions that localise to distinct neuroanatomical niches. Fibroblast interaction analysis in the dura and subarachnoid space (SAS) uncovered novel interactions with vascular cell populations mediated by insulin growth factor signaling. Together, these data serve as a comprehensive resource for future investigations of meningeal function in the healthy and diseased brain.

	<p>Background/Objectives: The Implicit Prosody Hypothesis (IPH) posits that individuals generate internal prosodic representations during silent reading, mirroring those produced in spoken language. While converging behavioral evidence supports the IPH, the underlying neurocognitive mechanisms remain largely unknown. Therefore, this study investigated the neurophysiological markers of sensitivity to speech rhythm cues during silent word reading. Methods: EEGs were recorded while participants silently read four-word sequences, each composed of either trochaic words (stressed on the first syllable) or iambic words (stressed on the second syllable). Each sequence was followed by a target word that was either metrically congruent or incongruent with the preceding rhythmic pattern. To investigate the effects of metrical expectancy and lexical stress type, we examined single-trial event-related potentials (ERPs) and time&amp;amp;ndash;frequency representations (TFRs) time-locked to target words. Results: The results showed significant differences based on the stress pattern expectancy and type. Specifically, words that carried unexpected stress elicited larger ERP negativities between 240 and 628 ms after the word onset. Furthermore, different frequency bands were sensitive to distinct aspects of the rhythmic structure in language. Alpha activity tracked the rhythmic expectations, and theta and beta activities were sensitive to both the expected rhythms and specific locations of the stressed syllables. Conclusions: The findings clarify neurocognitive mechanisms of phonological and lexical mental representations during silent reading using a conservative data-driven approach. Similarity with neural response patterns previously reported for spoken language contexts suggests shared neural networks for implicit and explicit speech rhythm processing, further supporting the IPH and emphasizing the centrality of prosody in reading.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system characterized by progressive impairment of neuronal transmission due to focal demyelination. The most common form is RRMS (relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis), which, under the influence of certain factors, can progress to SPMS (secondary progressive multiple sclerosis). Our study aimed to validate the criteria proposed by a working group of the Romanian Society of Neurology versus the criteria proposed by a group of experts from Spain, Karolinska, and Croatia concerning the progression from RRMS to SPMS. Methods: This was done by gathering epidemiological data (age, gender) and by applying clinical tests such as the 9HPT (9-hole peg test), 25FWT (25-foot walk test), and EDSS (expanded disability status scale) tests and the SDMT test (symbol digit modalities test). The present research is a cohort study that included a number of 120 patients diagnosed with MS according to the McDonald Diagnostic Criteria 2017. The study was carried out between January 2023 and April 2024, including patients hospitalized in the Neurology Clinic of the Clinical Rehabilitation Hospital from Iasi, Romania. The data were collected at baseline (T0) and at a 12-month interval (T1). Results: The statistical analysis was conducted using Kaiser&amp;amp;ndash;Meyer&amp;amp;ndash;Olkin analysis, which indicated a value of 0.683, thus validating the clinical tests used. The correlation matrix and the linear regression for all the tests showed highly significant statistical results. Furthermore, the ROC curve analysis of the criteria suggested by the working group of the Romanian Society of Neurology demonstrated that the EDSS, 9HPT, and 25FWT are highly sensitive in diagnosing SPMS, an opinion that is shared with the Spanish experts, but not with the Karolinska expert panel. Using the criteria given by the Croatian expert group in the ROC curve analysis showed that only the EDSS was strongly significant for the progression to the SPMS phase. Conclusions: In conclusion, all clinical methods used demonstrated that they are valid and can contribute to identifying patients with an increased risk of progression. The model proposed by the Romanian Society of Neurology working group is similar to other countries&amp;amp;rsquo; expert opinions and can be used to detect the risk of disease progression and establish a more tailored therapeutic management of SPMS.</p>

	<p>Background: Adolescence is an important point in the emotional development of young people. It is a time when young people are characterised by a high degree of emotional instability and seek effective ways to regulate their emotions. One of the frequent methods they use to cope with emotional tension is self-injurious behaviour. Methods: In the context of the rising incidence of self-harm among adolescents, this study aims to understand the association of temperament with the experience of tension and self-injurious behaviour along with the mediating role of perfectionism among 366 adolescents aged 15 to 20 years (Mage = 17.98, SD = 1.302, 52.7% female). Participants completed questionnaires on temperament traits, level of perfectionism, and experience of tension and self-injurious behaviour. Results: The results show that traits such as perfectionism, sensory sensitivity and emotional reactivity increase the risk of self-injurious behaviour. Maladaptive perfectionism partially mediates the relationship between these traits and the tendency to experience emotional tension. A temperament profile with a protective role was also identified. Conclusions: The results of the study highlight the importance of innate traits as well as environmental and cognitive influences, and may contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms leading to self-injurious behaviour and strategies aimed at its prevention.</p>

                Background Glioma is the second most common type of brain tumor, accounting for 24% of all brain tumor cases. The current diagnostic procedure is through an invasive tissue sampling to obtain histopathological analysis, however, not all patients are able to undergo a high-risk procedure. Circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) are considered as promising biomarkers for glioma due to their sensitivity, specificity, and non-invasive properties. There is currently no defined miRNA profile that contributes to determining the grade of glioma. This study aims to find the answer for “Is there any significant miRNA that able to distinguish different grades of glioma?”. Methods This study was conducted to compare the expression of miRNAs between low-grade glioma (LGG) and high-grade glioma (HGG). Eighteen blood plasma samples from glioma patients and 6 healthy controls were analyzed for 798 human miRNA profiles using NanoString nCounter Human v3 miRNA Expression Assay. The differential expressions of miRNAs were then analyzed to identify the differences in miRNA expression between LGG and HGG. Results Analyses showed significant expressions in 12 miRNAs between LGG and HGG, where all of them were downregulated. Out of these significant miRNAs, miR-518b, miR-1271-3p, and miR-598-3p showed the highest potential for distinguishing HGG from LGG, with area under curve (AUC) values of 0.912, 0.889, and 0.991, respectively. Conclusion miR-518b, miR-1271-3p, and miR-598-3p demonstrate significant potentials in distinguishing LGG and HGG.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1360/v1?src=rss">Climate Change and Veterinary Medicine: A Call to Action for a Healthier Planet [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Abstract Climate change is rapidly transforming ecosystems and reshaping the landscapes of animal health, with profound consequences for public health, food security, and biodiversity. Rising temperatures, shifting weather patterns, and increased frequency of natural disasters are driving the emergence and spread of infectious diseases, particularly zoonotic and vector-borne diseases. These environmental shifts endanger the health and welfare of animals and the delicate balance between human populations, livestock, and wildlife. As the stewards of animal health, veterinarians are uniquely positioned to lead the change in addressing these complex challenges at the nexus of human, animal, and environmental health and well-being. This article calls for urgent actions to integrate climate adaptation and mitigation strategies into veterinary practice and education. It underscores the critical need for veterinarians to embrace the One Health approach to tackle climate-driven disease outbreaks and the growing threat of antimicrobial resistance to safeguard human and animal populations while protecting natural ecosystems. The article further explores the role of veterinarians in fostering sustainable agricultural practices, reducing the environmental impact of livestock production, conserving biodiversity and advocating for policy reforms that protect both animal and planetary health. As we face an era of unprecedented climate disruption, this call to action aims to inspire the global veterinary community to actively get involved in combating climate change and its worst impacts. By building climate-resilient practices, enhancing disease surveillance, and championing environmental stewardship, veterinarians can contribute significantly to a healthier, more sustainable future for all species on Earth.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1359/v1?src=rss">De-ethnicizing Ethiopian higher education leadership: the quest for merit-based governance [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background This study examines the growing trend of ethnicized leadership in Ethiopian higher education institutions and advocates for a shift toward merit-based governance to improve institutional integrity and performance. Since 1991, with the introduction of ethnic federalism, leadership appointments in Ethiopian universities have increasingly been based on ethnic identity rather than qualifications. This has led to governance challenges, weakened academic standards, and reduced institutional efficiency. The study highlights the need for governance reforms prioritizing meritocracy to enhance the quality and sustainability of Ethiopia’s ethnically diverse higher education system. Methods The study utilizes a qualitative research approach, combining both primary and secondary data. Primary data were collected through semi-structured interviews with university administrators, faculty, and governance experts, while secondary data were gathered from institutional reports, government policies, and academic literature. Institutional theory, principal-agent theory, and meritocratic theory frame the analysis, providing insights into how ethnic-based leadership appointments affect university governance and performance. Results The findings reveal that ethnicized leadership has eroded governance structures, lowered academic quality, and compromised institutional efficiency. Leadership appointments based on ethnicity rather than merit have led to poor decision-making, weakened accountability, and reduced transparency. In contrast, merit-based governance improves accountability, decision-making, and institutional performance. The study emphasizes that transitioning to a meritocratic leadership model is vital for restoring institutional integrity and academic excellence in Ethiopian universities. Conclusions Ethnic federalism, while initially designed to empower regions, has politicized federal institutions, including universities, reducing them to regional entities rather than national institutions. This system of ethnicized leadership has fostered a culture of favoritism, rampant corruption, and ineffective governance, ultimately weakening Ethiopia’s higher education system. Recommendations Governance reforms that prioritize merit-based appointments are urgently needed. Legal reforms, transparent leadership selection processes, depoliticization efforts, and capacity-building initiatives are recommended to foster a meritocratic culture and improve institutional performance in Ethiopian universities.

                Background Traditional dietary assessments are often inaccurate and prone to self-reporting biases. Tracking the physiological responses associated with eating and digestion events via wearable technologies may provide an effective approach for continuously monitoring food intake and estimating energy consumption. Eating and digestion are accompanied by a series of changes in the heart rate, skin temperature, blood oxygen saturation, and blood pressure. These changes can be tracked by wearable devices, such as smartwatches, which have been widely accepted in the market. This systematic review is the first to evaluate the effectiveness of tracking such physiological biomarkers in differentiating between high- and low-calorie meals, potentially paving the way for more accurate dietary monitoring. Methods Following the PRISMA-P guidelines, we will conduct a systematic literature search through MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PubMed for clinical trials that investigated physiological responses following meal intake in healthy subjects. Two independent reviewers will screen and select articles based on pre-defined eligibility criteria, with a third review to resolve any discrepancies. This will be followed by data extraction and quality assessment of the included studies. Statistical analyses, including meta-analyses, will be performed using R Studio software. Our primary outcome will be the comparison of physiological biomarkers before and after meal intake, while secondary outcomes will include comparisons of physiological biomarkers between high- and low-calorie meal consumption and the correlation between the caloric content of consumed meals and postprandial physiological changes. Discussion This systematic review and meta-analysis will identify physiological indicators for eating events and inform the design of wearable sensors that estimate food intake in healthy subjects.

                Background Breast cancer has become the most prevalent disease and its incidence has almost doubled in the Indian population. This increased burden demands new targeted therapies with novel compounds either synthetically produced or derived from indigenous plants, which could be a promising approach for the development of drugs. Euphorbia thymifolia L is a widely growing tropical herb that has been reported to have various ethnopharmacological properties. Although Euphorbia genus is reported to have anticancer properties, E. thymifolia is not reported to have anticancer properties to date. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to screen the phytoconstituents and identify the active compounds present in the methanolic extract of E. thymifolia (ME.ET) as ligands to inhibit human cancer cell lines with special reference to potential protein targets implicated in breast cancer using an In-silico approach. Methods ME.ET was subjected to GC-MS analysis to screen the phytoconstituents, and the identified compounds were docked with protein targets such as extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1), a serine/threonine kinase-1(AKT1), human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2), estrogen receptor (ER), maternal embryonic leucine zipper kinase (MELK), polo-like kinase-1(PLK1), and protein tyrosine kinase (PTK6). Compounds with good docking scores were further subjected to dynamic studies to understand the protein ligand binding stability, ligand pathway calculation, and molecular mechanics energies combined with Poisson-Boltzmann (MM/PBSA) calculations using the Schrodinger suite. Results GC-MS analysis revealed the presence of 245 phytoconstituents, 219 of which were unique. When subjected to docking, these phytocompounds, namely 3,6,9,12-tetraoxatetradecane-1,14-diyl dibenzoate (TTDB) and succinic acid, 2-(dimethylamino) ethyl 4-isopropylphenyl ester (SADPE), showed good docking scores. Molecular dynamics studies showed a high affinity and low binding energy for TTDB with HER2, ERK1, and SADPE with ER. Conclusions Hence, in this study, we identified two lead compounds in E.thymifolia linn. Further invitro and invivo anticancer studies can be performed to confirm these results and to understand the molecular mechanism by which they exhibit anticancer activity against breast cancer.

                <p>Basolateral amygdala (BLA) neurons are engaged by emotionally salient stimuli. An area of increasing interest is how BLA dynamics relate to evolving reward-seeking behavior, especially under situations of uncertainty or ambiguity. Here, we recorded the activity of individual BLA neurons in male rats across the acquisition and extinction of conditioned reward seeking. We assessed ongoing neural dynamics in a task where long reward cue presentations preceded an unpredictable, variably time reward delivery. We found that, with training, BLA neurons discriminated the CS+ and CS&ndash; cues with sustained cue-evoked activity that correlated with behavior and terminated only after reward receipt. BLA neurons were bidirectionally modulated, with a majority showing prolonged inhibition during cued reward seeking. Strikingly, population-level analyses revealed that neurons showing cue-evoked inhibitions and those showing excitations similarly represented the CS+ and behavioral state. This sustained population code rapidly extinguished in parallel with conditioned behavior. We next assessed the contribution of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), a major reciprocal partner to the BLA. Inactivation of the OFC while simultaneously recording in the BLA revealed a blunting of sustained cue-evoked activity in the BLA that accompanied reduced reward seeking. Optogenetic disruption of BLA activity and OFC terminals in the BLA also reduced reward seeking. Our data indicate that the BLA represents reward-seeking states via sustained, bidirectional cue-driven neural encoding. This code is regulated by cortical input and is important for the maintenance of vigilant reward-seeking behavior.</p>

                <p>The extent to which neural representations of fear experience depend on or generalize across the situational context has remained unclear. We systematically manipulated variation within and across three distinct fear-evocative situations including fear of heights, spiders, and social threats. Participants (<I>n</I> = 21; 10 females and 11 males) viewed ~20&nbsp;s clips depicting spiders, heights, or social encounters and rated fear after each video. Searchlight multivoxel pattern analysis was used to identify whether and which brain regions carry information that predicts fear experience and the degree to which the fear-predictive neural codes in these areas depend on or generalize across the situations. The overwhelming majority of brain regions carrying information about fear did so in a situation-dependent manner. These findings suggest that local neural representations of fear experience are unlikely to involve a singular pattern but rather a collection of multiple heterogeneous brain states.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/46/e0550242024?rss=1">The Role of the Rat Prefrontal Cortex and Sex Differences in Decision-Making</a></h4>

              
                <p>The prefrontal cortex is critical for decision-making across species, with its activity linked to choosing between options. Drift diffusion models (DDMs) are commonly employed to understand the neural computations underlying this behavior. Studies exploring the specific roles of regions of the rodent prefrontal cortex in controlling the decision process are limited. This study explored the role of the prelimbic cortex (PLC) in decision-making using a two-alternative forced-choice task. Rats first learned to report the location of a lateralized visual stimulus. The brightness of the stimulus indicated its reward value. Then, the rats learned to make choices between pairs of stimuli. Sex differences in learning were observed, with females responding faster and more selectively to high-value stimuli than males. DDM analysis found that males had decreased decision thresholds during initial learning, whereas females maintained a consistently higher drift rate. Pharmacological manipulations revealed that PLC inactivation reduced the decision threshold for all rats, indicating that less information was needed to make a choice in the absence of normal PLC processing. &mu;-Opioid receptor stimulation of the PLC had the opposite effect, raising the decision threshold and reducing bias in the decision process toward high-value stimuli. These effects were observed without any impact on the rats&rsquo; choice preferences. Our findings suggest that PLC has an inhibitory role in the decision process and regulates the amount of evidence that is required to make a choice. That is, PLC activity controls "when," but not "how," to act.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/46/e0583242024?rss=1">Deciphering Peripheral Taste Neuron Diversity: Using Genetic Identity to Bridge Taste Bud Innervation Patterns and Functional Responses</a></h4>

              
                <p>Peripheral taste neurons exhibit functional, genetic, and morphological diversity, yet understanding how or if these attributes combine into taste neuron types remains unclear. In this study, we used male and female mice to relate taste bud innervation patterns to the function of a subset of proenkephalin-expressing (Penk+) taste neurons. We found that taste arbors (the portion of the axon within the taste bud) stemming from Penk+ neurons displayed diverse branching patterns and lacked stereotypical endings. The range in complexity observed for individual taste arbors from Penk+ neurons mirrored the entire population, suggesting that taste arbor morphologies are not primarily regulated by the neuron type. Notably, the distinguishing feature of arbors from Penk+ neurons was their propensity to come within 110&nbsp;nm (in apposition with) different types of taste-transducing cells within the taste bud. This finding is contrary to the expectation of genetically defined taste neuron types that functionally represent a single stimulus. Consistently, further investigation of Penk+ neuron function revealed that they are more likely to respond to innately aversive stimuli&mdash;sour, bitter, and high salt concentrations&mdash;as compared with the full taste population. Penk+ neurons are less likely to respond to nonaversive stimuli&mdash;sucrose, umami, and low salt&mdash;compared with the full population. Our data support the presence of a genetically defined neuron type in the geniculate ganglion that is responsive to innately aversive stimuli. This implies that genetic expression might categorize peripheral taste neurons into hedonic groups, rather than simply identifying neurons that respond to a single stimulus.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/46/e0635242024?rss=1">Dynamics of Saccade Trajectory Modulation by Distractors: Neural Activity Patterns in the Frontal Eye Field</a></h4>

              
                <p>The sudden appearance of a visual distractor shortly before saccade initiation can capture spatial attention and modulate the saccade trajectory in spite of the ongoing execution of the initial plan to shift gaze straight to the saccade target. To elucidate the neural correlates underlying these curved saccades, we recorded from single neurons in the frontal eye field of two male rhesus monkeys shifting gaze to a target while a distractor with the same eccentricity appeared either left or right of the target at various delays after target presentation. We found that the population level of presaccadic activity of neurons representing the distractor location encoded the direction of the saccade trajectory. Stronger activity occurred when saccades curved toward the distractor, and weaker when saccades curved away. This relationship held whether the distractor was ipsilateral or contralateral to the recorded neurons. Meanwhile, visually responsive neurons showed asymmetrical patterns of excitatory responses that varied with the location of the distractor and the duration of distractor processing relating to attentional capture and distractor inhibition. During earlier distractor processing, neurons encoded curvature toward the distractor. During later distractor processing, neurons encoded curvature away from the distractor. This was observed when saccades curved away from distractors contralateral to the recording site and when saccades curved toward distractors ipsilateral to the recording site. These findings indicate that saccadic motor planning involves dynamic push&ndash;pull hemispheric interactions producing attraction or repulsion for potential but unselected saccade targets.</p>

                <p>The activation of autonomic and hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) systems occurs interdependently with behavioral adjustments under varying environmental demands. Nevertheless, laboratory rodent studies examining the neural bases of stress responses have generally attributed increments in these systems to be monolithic, regardless of whether an active or passive coping strategy is employed. Using the shock probe defensive burying test (SPDB) to measure stress-coping features naturalistically in male and female rats, we identify a neural pathway whereby activity changes may promote distinctive response patterns of hemodynamic and HPA indices typifying active and passive coping phenotypes. Optogenetic excitation of the rostral medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) input to the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG) decreased passive behavior (immobility), attenuated the glucocorticoid hormone response, but did not prevent arterial pressure and heart rate increases associated with rats&rsquo; active behavioral (defensive burying) engagement during the SPDB. In contrast, inhibition of the same pathway increased behavioral immobility and attenuated hemodynamic output but did not affect glucocorticoid increases. Further analyses confirmed that hemodynamic increments occurred preferentially during active behaviors and decrements during immobility epochs, whereas pathway manipulations, regardless of the directionality of effect, weakened these correlational relationships. Finally, neuroanatomical evidence indicated that the influence of the rostral mPFC-&gt;vlPAG pathway on coping response patterns is mediated predominantly through GABAergic neurons within vlPAG. These data highlight the importance of this prefrontal-&gt;midbrain connection in organizing stress-coping responses and in coordinating bodily systems with behavioral output for adaptation to aversive experiences.</p>

                <p>Endogenous reprogramming of glia into neurogenic progenitors holds great promise for neuron restoration therapies. Using lessons from regenerative species, we have developed strategies to stimulate mammalian Mu&#x0308;ller glia to regenerate neurons in vivo in the adult retina. We have demonstrated that the transcription factor Ascl1 can stimulate Mu&#x0308;ller glia neurogenesis. However, Ascl1 is only able to reprogram a subset of Mu&#x0308;ller glia into neurons. We have reported that neuroinflammation from microglia inhibits neurogenesis from Mu&#x0308;ller glia. Here we found that the peripheral immune response is a barrier to CNS regeneration. We show that monocytes from the peripheral immune system infiltrate the injured retina and negatively influence neurogenesis from Mu&#x0308;ller glia. Using CCR2 knock-out mice of both sexes, we found that preventing monocyte infiltration improves the neurogenic and proliferative capacity of Mu&#x0308;ller glia stimulated by Ascl1. Using scRNA-seq analysis, we identified a signaling axis wherein Osteopontin, a cytokine highly expressed by infiltrating immune cells is sufficient to suppress mammalian neurogenesis. This work implicates the response of the peripheral immune system as a barrier to regenerative strategies of the retina.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/46/e1252242024?rss=1">Encoding of Vibrotactile Stimuli by Mechanoreceptors in Rodent Glabrous Skin</a></h4>

              
                <p>Somatosensory coding in rodents has been mostly studied in the whisker system and hairy skin, whereas the function of low-threshold mechanoreceptors (LTMRs) in the rodent glabrous skin has received scant attention, unlike in primates where the glabrous skin has been the focus. The relative activation of different LTMR subtypes carries information about vibrotactile stimuli, as does the rate and temporal patterning of LTMR spikes. Rate coding depends on the probability of a spike occurring on each stimulus cycle (reliability), whereas temporal coding depends on the timing of spikes relative to the stimulus cycle (precision). Using in vivo extracellular recordings in male rats and mice of either sex, we measured the reliability and precision of LTMR responses to tactile stimuli including sustained pressure and vibration. Similar to other species, rodent LTMRs were separated into rapid-adapting (RA) or slow-adapting based on their response to sustained pressure. However, unlike the dichotomous frequency preference characteristic of RA1 and RA2/Pacinian afferents in other species, rodent RAs fell along a continuum. Fitting generalized linear models to experimental data reproduced the reliability and precision of rodent RAs. The resulting model parameters highlight key mechanistic differences across the RA spectrum; specifically, the integration window of different RAs transitions from wide to narrow as tuning preferences across the population move from low to high frequencies. Our results show that rodent RAs can support both rate and temporal coding, but their heterogeneity suggests that coactivation patterns play a greater role in population coding than for dichotomously tuned primate RAs.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/46/e1299242024?rss=1">Behavioral and Neural Mechanisms of Face-Specific Attention during Goal-Directed Visual Search</a></h4>

              
                <p>Goal-directed visual attention is a fundamental cognitive process that enables animals to selectively focus on specific regions of the visual field while filtering out irrelevant information. However, given the domain specificity of social behaviors, it remains unclear whether attention to faces versus nonfaces recruits different neurocognitive processes. In this study, we simultaneously recorded activity from temporal and frontal nodes of the attention network while macaques performed a goal-directed visual search task. V4 and inferotemporal (IT) visual category-selective units, selected during cue presentation, discriminated fixations on targets and distractors during the search but were differentially engaged by face and house targets. V4 and IT category-selective units also encoded fixation transitions and search dynamics. Compared with distractors, fixations on targets reduced spike&ndash;LFP coherence within the temporal cortex. Importantly, target-induced desynchronization between the temporal and prefrontal cortices was only evident for face targets, suggesting that attention to faces differentially engaged the prefrontal cortex. We further revealed bidirectional theta influence between the temporal and prefrontal cortices using Granger causality, which was again disproportionate for faces. Finally, we showed that the search became more efficient with increasing target-induced desynchronization. Together, our results suggest domain specificity for attending to faces and an intricate interplay between visual attention and social processing neural networks.</p>

                <p>A unique population of ventral tegmental area (VTA) neurons co-transmits glutamate and GABA. However, the circuit inputs to VTA VGluT2+VGaT+ neurons are unknown, limiting our understanding of their functional capabilities. By coupling monosynaptic rabies tracing with intersectional genetic targeting in male and female mice, we found that VTA VGluT2+VGaT+ neurons received diverse brainwide inputs. The largest numbers of monosynaptic inputs to VTA VGluT2+VGaT+ neurons were from superior colliculus (SC), lateral hypothalamus (LH), midbrain reticular nucleus, and periaqueductal gray, whereas the densest inputs relative to brain region volume were from the dorsal raphe nucleus, lateral habenula, and VTA. Based on these and prior data, we hypothesized that LH and SC inputs were from glutamatergic neurons. Optical activation of glutamatergic LH neurons activated VTA VGluT2+VGaT+ neurons regardless of stimulation frequency and resulted in flee-like ambulatory behavior. In contrast, optical activation of glutamatergic SC neurons activated VTA VGluT2+VGaT+ neurons for a brief period of time at high frequency and resulted in head rotation and arrested ambulatory behavior (freezing). Stimulation of glutamatergic LH neurons, but not glutamatergic SC neurons, was associated with VTA VGluT2+VGaT+ footshock-induced activity and inhibition of LH glutamatergic neurons disrupted VTA VGluT2+VGaT+ tailshock-induced activity. We interpret these results such that inputs to VTA VGluT2+VGaT+ neurons may integrate diverse signals related to the detection and processing of motivationally salient outcomes.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/11/ENEURO.0185-24.2024?rss=1">Distinct Modulation of Ih by Synaptic Potentiation in Excitatory and Inhibitory Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>Selective modifications in the expression or function of dendritic ion channels regulate the propagation of synaptic inputs and determine the intrinsic excitability of a neuron. Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide&ndash;gated (HCN) channels open upon membrane hyperpolarization and conduct a depolarizing inward current (<I>I</I><SUB>h</SUB>). HCN channels are enriched in the dendrites of hippocampal pyramidal neurons where they regulate the integration of synaptic inputs. Synaptic plasticity can bidirectionally modify dendritic HCN channels in excitatory neurons depending on the strength of synaptic potentiation. In inhibitory neurons, however, the dendritic expression and modulation of HCN channels are largely unknown. In this study, we systematically compared the modulation of <I>I</I><SUB>h</SUB> by synaptic potentiation in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons and stratum radiatum (sRad) interneurons in mouse organotypic cultures. <I>I</I><SUB>h</SUB> properties were similar in inhibitory and excitatory neurons and contributed to resting membrane potential and action potential firing. We found that in sRad interneurons, HCN channels were downregulated after synaptic plasticity, irrespective of the strength of synaptic potentiation. This suggests differential regulation of <I>I</I><SUB>h</SUB> in excitatory and inhibitory neurons, possibly signifying their distinct role in network activity.</p>

                <p>The complexity of natural environments requires highly flexible mechanisms for adaptive processing of single and multiple stimuli. Neuronal oscillations could be an ideal candidate for implementing such flexibility in neural systems. Here, we present a framework for structuring attention-guided processing of complex visual scenes in humans, based on multiplexing and phase coding schemes. Importantly, we suggest that the dynamic fluctuations of excitability vary rapidly in terms of magnitude, frequency and wave-form over time, i.e., they are not necessarily sinusoidal or sustained oscillations. Different elements of single objects would be processed within a single cycle (burst) of alpha activity (7&ndash;14 Hz), allowing for the formation of coherent object representations while separating multiple objects across multiple cycles. Each element of an object would be processed separately in time&mdash;expressed as different gamma band bursts (&gt;30 Hz)&mdash;along the alpha phase. Since the processing capacity per alpha cycle is limited, an inverse relationship between object resolution and size of attentional spotlight ensures independence of the proposed mechanism from absolute object complexity. Frequency and wave-shape of those fluctuations would depend on the nature of the object that is processed and on cognitive demands. Multiple objects would further be organized along the phase of slower fluctuations (e.g., theta), potentially driven by saccades. Complex scene processing, involving covert attention and eye movements, would therefore be associated with multiple frequency changes in the alpha and lower frequency range. This framework embraces the idea of a hierarchical organization of visual processing, independent of environmental temporal dynamics.</p>

                <p>Relationships among membrane currents allow central pattern generator (CPG) neurons to reliably drive motor programs. We hypothesize that continually active CPG neurons utilize activity-dependent feedback to correlate expression of ion channel genes to balance essential membrane currents. However, episodically activated neurons experience absences of activity-dependent feedback and, thus, presumably employ other strategies to coregulate the balance of ionic currents necessary to generate appropriate output after periods of quiescence. To investigate this, we compared continually active pyloric dilator (PD) neurons with episodically active lateral gastric (LG) CPG neurons of the stomatogastric ganglion (STG) in male <I>Cancer borealis</I> crabs. After experimentally activating LG for 8&nbsp;h, we measured three potassium currents and abundances of their corresponding channel mRNAs. We found that ionic current relationships were correlated in LG's silent state, but ion channel mRNA relationships were correlated in the active state. In continuously active PD neurons, ion channel mRNAs and ionic currents are simultaneously correlated. Therefore, two distinct relationships exist between channel mRNA abundance and the ionic current encoded in these cells: in PD, a direct correlation exists between <I>Shal</I> channel mRNA levels and the A-type potassium current it carries. Conversely, such channel mRNA&ndash;current relationships are not detected and appear to be temporally uncoupled in LG neurons. Our results suggest that ongoing feedback maintains membrane current and channel mRNA relationships in continually active PD neurons, while in LG neurons, episodic activity serves to establish channel mRNA relationships necessary to produce the ionic current profile necessary for the next bout of activity.</p>

                Background Undescended testes (UDT) is a condition where one or both testes is absent in the scrotum. The general age recommendation in which the treatment should be performed is before 18 months old due to the infertility risk and malignancy in later life. In post-pubertal UDT, the current guideline recommends orchiectomy; however, the strength rating of this recommendation is weak. Therefore, this study aimed to provide a systematic review of post-pubertal UDT treatment, focusing on the malignancy risk point of view. Methods A systematic search was performed using PubMed, Wiley Online Library and the Cochrane Library up to 5 March 2023. Any study with either post-pubertal orchiectomy or orchidopexy in patients with UDT and reporting the testicular malignancy was included. The exclusion criteria were studies with lack of information of UDT correction time, no history of correction and the full text wasn’t available. The data collected were the occurrence of testicular malignancy in post-pubertal UDT patients corrected with any method. Quality and bias assessment was assessed with Newcastle-Ottawa scale and Joanna Briggs Institute tools. Results Seven articles (three case reports and four observational studies) were reviewed with a total of 42 patients who underwent post-pubertal correction of either unilateral or bilateral UDT. The correction age ranged from 13 to 34 years old, with follow-up of 48.7–252 months. Among those who developed malignancies, the most common were seminoma, teratoma and carcinoma in situ of the testes. In addition, this study was able to propose an algorithm for post-pubertal UDT treatment strategy. Conclusions The scarce resource was the main limitation of this study. Nevertheless, this review showed that post-pubertal UDT management should be tailored individually. Several factors that should be considered include the condition of the contralateral descended testis, UDT location, serum testosterone level, patient’s age, comorbidities, and interest in fertility.

                <p>by Yuanchen Zhao, Otto X. Cordero, Mikhail Tikhonov</p>

Microbial communities play key roles across diverse environments. Predicting their function and dynamics is a key goal of microbial ecology, but detailed microscopic descriptions of these systems can be prohibitively complex. One approach to deal with this complexity is to resort to coarser representations. Several approaches have sought to identify useful groupings of microbial species in a data-driven way. Of these, recent work has claimed some empirical success at <i>de novo</i> discovery of coarse representations predictive of a given function using methods as simple as a linear regression, against multiple groups of species or even a single such group (the ensemble quotient optimization (EQO) approach). Modeling community function as a linear combination of individual species’ contributions appears simplistic. However, the task of identifying a predictive coarsening of an ecosystem is distinct from the task of predicting the function well, and it is conceivable that the former could be accomplished by a simpler methodology than the latter. Here, we use the resource competition framework to design a model where the “correct” grouping to be discovered is well-defined, and use synthetic data to evaluate and compare three regression-based methods, namely, two proposed previously and one we introduce. We find that regression-based methods can recover the groupings even when the function is manifestly nonlinear; that multi-group methods offer an advantage over a single-group EQO; and crucially, that simpler (linear) methods can outperform more complex ones.

                <p>by Rym Ben Boubaker, Daniel Henrion, Marie Chabbert</p>

Environmental factors, including mechanical stress and surrounding lipids, can influence the response of GPCRs, such as the mechanosensitive angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1). To investigate the impact of these factors on AT1 activation, we developed a steered molecular dynamics simulations protocol based on quaternion formalism. In this protocol, a pulling force was applied to the N-terminus of transmembrane helix 6 (TM6) to induce the TM6 opening characteristic of activation. Subsequently, the simulations were continued without constraints to allow the receptor to relax around the novel TM6 conformation under different conditions. We analyzed the responses of AT1 to membrane stretching, modeled by applying surface tension, in different bilayers. In phosphocholine bilayers without surface tension, we could observe a transient atypical structure of AT1, with an outward TM7 conformation, at the beginning of the activation process. This atypical structure then evolved toward a pre-active structure with outward TM6 and inward TM7. Strikingly, the presence of anionic phosphoglycerol lipids and application of surface tension synergistically favored the atypical structure, which led to an increase in the cross-section area of the receptor intracellular domain. Lipid internalization and H-bonds between lipid heads and the receptor C-terminus increased in phosphoglycerol vs phosphocholine bilayers, but did not depend on surface tension. The difference in the cross-section area of the atypical and pre-active conformations makes the conformational transition sensitive to lateral pressure, and favors the atypical conformation upon surface tension. Anionic lipids act as allosteric modulators of the conformational transition, by stabilizing the atypical conformation. These findings contribute to decipher the mechanisms underlying AT1 activation, highlighting the influence of environmental factors on GPCR responses. Moreover, our results reveal the existence of intermediary conformations that depend on receptor environment and could be targeted in drug design efforts.

                <p>by Suhwan Gim, Seok-Jun Hong, Elizabeth A. Reynolds Losin, Choong-Wan Woo</p>

Pain is not a mere reflection of noxious input. Rather, it is constructed through the dynamic integration of current predictions with incoming sensory input. However, the temporal dynamics of the behavioral and neural processes underpinning this integration remain elusive. In the current study involving 59 human participants, we identified a series of brain mediators that integrated cue-induced expectations with noxious inputs into ongoing pain predictions using a semicircular scale designed to capture rating trajectories. Temporal mediation analysis revealed that during the early-to-mid stages of integration, the frontoparietal and dorsal attention network regions, such as the lateral prefrontal, premotor, and parietal cortex, mediated the cue effects. Conversely, during the mid-to-late stages of integration, the somatomotor network regions mediated the effects of stimulus intensity, suggesting that the integration occurs along the cortical hierarchy from the association to sensorimotor brain systems. Our findings advance the understanding of how the brain integrates contextual and sensory information into pain experience over time.

                Aging leads to a decrease in white matter volume and damage to myelinated axons, contributing to neurodegeneration. Myelin breakdown can trigger inflammation, creating a vicious cycle that causes further damage. Understanding these changes is key to preventing age-related neurodegenerative disease.

                Wilson et al. demonstrate that KRT14+ leader cells drive ovarian cancer metastasis by promoting immunosuppression. Loss of KRT14+ leader cells impairs tumor progression, while their overexpression accelerates metastasis through chemokine-mediated immune evasion. These findings reveal KRT14+ leader cells as a potential therapeutic target to hinder metastasis and enhance anti-tumor immunity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92820">Hemispheric divergence of interoceptive processing across psychiatric disorders</a></h4>

              
                Interactions between top-down attention and bottom-up visceral inputs are assumed to produce conscious perceptions of interoceptive states, and while each process has been independently associated with aberrant interoceptive symptomatology in psychiatric disorders, the neural substrates of this interface are unknown. We conducted a preregistered functional neuroimaging study of 46 individuals with anxiety, depression, and/or eating disorders (ADE) and 46 propensity-matched healthy comparisons (HC), comparing their neural activity across two interoceptive tasks differentially recruiting top-down or bottom-up processing within the same scan session. During an interoceptive attention task, top-down attention was voluntarily directed towards cardiorespiratory or visual signals. In contrast, during an interoceptive perturbation task, intravenous infusions of isoproterenol (a peripherally-acting beta-adrenergic receptor agonist) were administered in a double-blinded and placebo-controlled fashion to drive bottom-up cardiorespiratory sensations. Across both tasks, neural activation converged upon the insular cortex, localizing within the granular and ventral dysgranular subregions bilaterally. However, contrasting hemispheric differences emerged, with the ADE group exhibiting (relative to HCs) an asymmetric pattern of overlap in the left insula, with increased or decreased proportions of co-activated voxels within the left or right dysgranular insula, respectively. The ADE group also showed less agranular anterior insula activation during periods of bodily uncertainty (i.e. when anticipating possible isoproterenol-induced changes that never arrived). Finally, post-task changes in insula functional connectivity were associated with anxiety and depression severity. These findings confirm the dysgranular mid-insula as a key cortical interface where attention and prediction meet real-time bodily inputs, especially during heightened awareness of interoceptive states. Furthermore, the dysgranular mid-insula may indeed be a ‘locus of disruption’ for psychiatric disorders.

                Mammalian sperm delve into the female reproductive tract to fertilize the female gamete. The available information about how sperm regulate their motility during the final journey to the fertilization site is extremely limited. In this work, we investigated the structural and functional changes in the sperm flagellum after acrosomal exocytosis (AE) and during the interaction with the eggs. The evidence demonstrates that the double helix actin network surrounding the mitochondrial sheath of the midpiece undergoes structural changes prior to the motility cessation. This structural modification is accompanied by a decrease in diameter of the midpiece and is driven by intracellular calcium changes that occur concomitant with a reorganization of the actin helicoidal cortex. Midpiece contraction occurs in a subset of cells that undergo AE, and live-cell imaging during in vitro fertilization showed that the midpiece contraction is required for motility cessation after fusion is initiated. These findings provide the first evidence of the F-actin network’s role in regulating sperm motility, adapting its function to meet specific cellular requirements during fertilization, and highlighting the broader significance of understanding sperm motility.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97279">Metastasis of colon cancer requires Dickkopf-2 to generate cancer cells with Paneth cell properties</a></h4>

              
                Metastasis is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality. Paneth cells provide stem cell niche factors in homeostatic conditions, but the underlying mechanisms of cancer stem cell niche development are unclear. Here, we report that Dickkopf-2 (DKK2) is essential for the generation of cancer cells with Paneth cell properties during colon cancer metastasis. Splenic injection of <i>Dkk2</i> knockout (KO) cancer organoids into C57BL/6 mice resulted in a significant reduction of liver metastases. Transcriptome analysis showed reduction of Paneth cell markers such as lysozymes in KO organoids. Single-cell RNA sequencing analyses of murine metastasized colon cancer cells and patient samples identified the presence of lysozyme positive cells with Paneth cell properties including enhanced glycolysis. Further analyses of transcriptome and chromatin accessibility suggested hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4A) as a downstream target of DKK2. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing analysis revealed that HNF4A binds to the promoter region of <i>Sox9</i>, a well-known transcription factor for Paneth cell differentiation. In the liver metastatic foci, DKK2 knockout rescued HNF4A protein levels followed by reduction of lysozyme positive cancer cells. Taken together, DKK2-mediated reduction of HNF4A protein promotes the generation of lysozyme positive cancer cells with Paneth cell properties in the metastasized colon cancers.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95044">CXCR3-expressing myeloid cells recruited to the hypothalamus protect against diet-induced body mass gain and metabolic dysfunction</a></h4>

              
                Microgliosis plays a critical role in diet-induced hypothalamic inflammation. A few hours after a high-fat diet (HFD), hypothalamic microglia shift to an inflammatory phenotype, and prolonged fat consumption leads to the recruitment of bone marrow-derived cells to the hypothalamus. However, the transcriptional signatures and functions of these cells remain unclear. Using dual-reporter mice, this study reveals that CX3CR1-positive microglia exhibit minimal changes in response to a HFD, while significant transcriptional differences emerge between microglia and CCR2-positive recruited myeloid cells, particularly affecting chemotaxis. These recruited cells also show sex-specific transcriptional differences impacting neurodegeneration and thermogenesis. The chemokine receptor CXCR3 is emphasized for its role in chemotaxis, displaying notable differences between recruited cells and resident microglia, requiring further investigation. Central immunoneutralization of CXCL10, a ligand for CXCR3, resulted in increased body mass and decreased energy expenditure, especially in females. Systemic chemical inhibition of CXCR3 led to significant metabolic changes, including increased body mass, reduced energy expenditure, elevated blood leptin, glucose intolerance, and decreased insulin levels. This study elucidates the transcriptional differences between hypothalamic microglia and CCR2-positive recruited myeloid cells in diet-induced inflammation and identifies CXCR3-expressing recruited immune cells as protective in metabolic outcomes linked to HFD consumption, establishing a new concept in obesity-related hypothalamic inflammation.

                O-GlcNAcylation is an essential intracellular protein modification mediated by O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) and O-GlcNAcase (OGA). Recently, missense mutations in <i>OGT</i> have been linked to intellectual disability, indicating that this modification is important for the development and functioning of the nervous system. However, the processes that are most sensitive to perturbations in O-GlcNAcylation remain to be identified. Here, we uncover quantifiable phenotypes in the fruit fly <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> carrying a patient-derived OGT mutation in the catalytic domain. Hypo-O-GlcNAcylation leads to defects in synaptogenesis and reduced sleep stability. Both these phenotypes can be partially rescued by genetically or chemically targeting OGA, suggesting that a balance of OGT/OGA activity is required for normal neuronal development and function.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95170">Functional characteristics and computational model of abundant hyperactive loci in the human genome</a></h4>

              
                Enhancers and promoters are classically considered to be bound by a small set of transcription factors (TFs) in a sequence-specific manner. This assumption has come under increasing skepticism as the datasets of ChIP-seq assays of TFs have expanded. In particular, high-occupancy target (HOT) loci attract hundreds of TFs with often no detectable correlation between ChIP-seq peaks and DNA-binding motif presence. Here, we used a set of 1003 TF ChIP-seq datasets (HepG2, K562, H1) to analyze the patterns of ChIP-seq peak co-occurrence in combination with functional genomics datasets. We identified 43,891 HOT loci forming at the promoter (53%) and enhancer (47%) regions. HOT promoters regulate housekeeping genes, whereas HOT enhancers are involved in tissue-specific process regulation. HOT loci form the foundation of human super-enhancers and evolve under strong negative selection, with some of these loci being located in ultraconserved regions. Sequence-based classification analysis of HOT loci suggested that their formation is driven by the sequence features, and the density of mapped ChIP-seq peaks across TF-bound loci correlates with sequence features and the expression level of flanking genes. Based on the affinities to bind to promoters and enhancers we detected five distinct clusters of TFs that form the core of the HOT loci. We report an abundance of HOT loci in the human genome and a commitment of 51% of all TF ChIP-seq binding events to HOT locus formation thus challenging the classical model of enhancer activity and propose a model of HOT locus formation based on the existence of large transcriptional condensates.

	<p>Objectives: This systematic review evaluates the anti-suicidal properties of Lithium in children and adolescents with Bipolar Disorder (BD), addressing gaps in evidence regarding its efficacy and safety in reducing suicidality and self-harming behaviors. Methods: A comprehensive literature search was conducted across PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus up to February 2024. Eligible studies were those focusing on patients aged 25 years or younger, examining Lithium therapy and its impact on suicidal ideation and behaviors. The review included randomized controlled trials, longitudinal prospective and retrospective studies, and cross-sectional studies, while excluding expert opinions and case reports. Results: Evidence generally supports the efficacy of Lithium in reducing suicidal ideation and self-harming behaviors in youth with BD, though results are mixed. Randomized controlled trials demonstrated its effectiveness in mitigating suicidal thoughts during acute manic episodes, with effects persisting post-treatment. Longitudinal studies suggested that Lithium might offer superior outcomes compared to other mood stabilizers, although its specific impact on suicidality remains inconclusive. Cross-sectional studies and retrospective analyses reveal associations between Lithium use and reduced self-harming behaviors, but causality remains uncertain. While mood-stabilizing effects of Lithium offer potential benefits for reducing suicidality in youth, evidence on its direct impact on emotional dysregulation (ED) and long-term efficacy is limited. Variability in individual responses and adherence issues underscore the need for further research. Future studies should include larger, diverse samples, focus on ED symptoms, and explore Lithium mechanisms in suicidality prevention. Conclusions: Lithium remains a promising treatment for mood stabilization and reduction in suicidality in youth with BD.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Slow oscillation (SO) brainwaves observed during sleep have been shown to reflect the process of memory consolidation, that underlies the critical role of sleep in learning, memory, and other cognitive functions. Closed-loop auditory stimulation (CLAS) uses tones presented in phase with SOs to increase their amplitude and number, along with other brainwave signatures related to memory consolidation. Prior studies have found that CLAS maximizes the ability to perform rote memorization tasks, although this remains controversial. The present study examined whether CLAS affects a broader range of learning tasks than has been tested previously, including a rote language learning task requiring basic memorization and also two discovery learning tasks requiring insight, hypothesis testing, and integration of experience, all processes that benefit from memory consolidation. Methods: Twenty-eight healthy participants performed language and discovery learning tasks before sleeping in our laboratory for three continuous nights per week over two weeks, with verum or control CLAS using a prototype NeuroGevity system (NeuroGeneces, Inc., Santa Fe, NM, USA) in a crossed, randomized, double-blind manner. Results: Language learning showed a 35% better word recall (p = 0.048), and discovery learning showed a 26% better performance (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) after three continuous nights of CLAS vs. control. EEG measures showed increased SO amplitude and entrainment, SO-spindle coupling, and other features that may underlie the learning benefits of CLAS. Conclusions: Taken together, the present results show that CLAS can alter brain dynamics and enhance learning, especially in complex discovery learning tasks that may benefit more from memory consolidation compared with rote word pair or language learning.</p>

	<p>Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a neuropsychiatric condition whose neurobiological characteristics include alterations in brain plasticity, modulated by Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF). In animal models, environmental enrichment promotes neuroplasticity and reduces depressive-like behaviors. In humans, we proposed to assess the level of Enriched Environment (EE) using a questionnaire that includes different domains of the EE (cognitive, social, and physical), which we named the EE Indicator (EEI). Objective: To determine the relationship between the level of EE and serum BDNF in participants with MDD and healthy controls. Materials: Participants with MDD without antidepressant treatment and healthy controls were recruited, and their EE level and serum BDNF concentration were determined looking for correlations between their clinical characteristics and the cognitive, social, and physical activities according to the EEI. Results: A total of 25 participants were recruited, of which 6 participants with MDD and the same number of controls were selected in a paired manner. Although no differences were found in the concentration of BDNF between the groups, positive correlations were observed between cognitive EE and BDNF (r = 0.62, p = 0.035), as well as negative social EE and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) (r = &amp;amp;minus;0.86, p = 0.001). The sum between cognitive and social EE showed a positive correlation with the serum concentration of BDNF (r = 0.34, p = 0.0451). Conclusions: The level of EE is potentially modulating the presence and severity of MDD at a clinical level, but it can also influence at a neuroplastic level through promoting or limiting the concentration of BDNF.</p>

                Appendicularians are planktonic tunicates abundant all over the world. Currently, only two complete annotated mitochondrial genome assemblies are available for appendicularians, both for cryptic species of Oikopleura dioica. This underrepresentation of available appendicularian mitochondrial genomes limits environmental DNA sequencing (eDNA) studies that rely on mitochondrial markers as a taxonomic barcode. We report the complete mitochondrial genome assembly and annotation of an unknown appendicularian species isolated from the Amami Oshima island, Kagoshima prefecture, Japan, that has significant sequence difference with other currently available assemblies and will serve as a useful resource for ecological studies and further mitochondrial studies of appendicularians.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1356/v1?src=rss">Protocol for a co-design study for the development of a chronotherapeutic mobile health behaviour change intervention targeting light exposure among older adults [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Through its wide-ranging effects on human physiology and behaviour, daily light exposure is an important environmental modulator of healthy ageing. Integrating mobile health (mHealth) technology with behaviour change strategies offers a promising approach to optimise light exposure and positively impact sleep, rest-wake cycles, cognitive function, and mood at scale. This study aims to develop the LightSPAN mHealth behaviour change intervention to optimise light exposure across the lifespan. Employing a co-design methodology, the study comprises two distinct workstreams. The first focuses on conceptualising the theoretical framework and implementation strategies through a comprehensive review of light exposure interventions, behaviour change theories, mHealth user personas, and recommendations for designing mHealth interventions for older adults. The second workstream centres on co-designing the intervention, involving consultation with community service providers and engagement with older adults at ageing community centres (≥60 years of age). Community service providers will be consulted through open-ended discussions (target n=5). Older adult participants (n=20) will engage in telephone interviews, focus group discussions and prototyping workshops to explore older adult participants’ characteristics, needs, preferences, and mHealth intervention design elements and co-design the LightSPAN mHealth behaviour change intervention. The insights generated in these co-design components will ensure that the intervention addresses the needs of its future users.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-164/v3?src=rss">Assessment of potential drug-drug interactions in hospitalized patients with infectious diseases: an experience from a secondary care hospital [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 2 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Polypharmacy is common among hospitalized patients with infectious infections owing to comorbidities or concomitant illnesses. This raises the likelihood of drug-drug interactions and creates uncertainty for healthcare providers. This study aimed to assess the potential drug-drug interactions (pDDIs) among hospitalized patients with infectious diseases in a secondary care hospital. Methods A prospective observational study was conducted in the internal medicine ward for six months after the ethics committee’s approval. Data were collected from patient case records, and prescriptions were screened for pDDIs from a portable electronic physician information database (PEPID) resource analyzed using SPSS, version 27.0. Results In total, 148 patient case records were analyzed, and 549 pDDIs were identified, with 66.8% having at least one or more DDIs. The mean number of drug interactions was 3.70 ± 4.58 per prescription. The most frequently encountered drug interactions were drug combinations such as bisoprolol with atorvastatin and aspirin with tazobactam/piperacillin. Bivariate analysis showed that age, comorbidities, length of hospital stay, and the number of drugs prescribed were risk factors associated with DDIs (p<0.05). In the multiple binary logistic regression analysis, DDIs were significantly associated with comorbidities and the number of prescribed medications (p<0.0001). Conclusions This study observed the prevalence of DDIs in hospitalized patients with infectious diseases of ‘moderate’ severity. Prescription screening using a drug information database assists in early identification and prevention of DDIs, enhancing drug safety and quality of patient-centered care.

Despite advancements in understanding the structure and functions of the Calcium Sensing Receptor (CaSR), gaps persist in our knowledge of the specific functions of its residues. In this study, we used phylogeny-based techniques to identify functionally equivalent orthologs of CaSR, predict residue significance, and compute specificity-determining position (SDP) scores to understand its evolutionary basis. The analysis revealed exceptional conservation of the CaSR subfamily, emphasizing the critical role of residues with high SDP scores in receptor activation and pathogenicity. To further enhance the findings, gradient-boosting trees were applied to differentiate between gain- and loss-of-function mutations responsible for hypocalcemia and hypercalcemia. Lastly, we investigated the importance of these mutations in the context of receptor activation dynamics. In summary, through comprehensive exploration of the evolutionary history of the CaSR subfamily, coupled with innovative phylogenetic methodologies, we identified activating and inactivating residues, providing valuable insights into the regulation of calcium homeostasis and its connections to associated disorders.
