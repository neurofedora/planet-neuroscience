              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05441">The many roads to dementia: a systems view of Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2504.05441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alzheimer's disease is not the outcome of a single cause but the convergence of many. This review reframes dementia as a systemic failure, where amyloid plaques and tau tangles are not root causes but late-stage byproducts of the underlying metabolic collapse. We begin by tracing the historical merger of early- and late-onset Alzheimer's into a single disease category, a conceptual error that may have misdirected decades of research. We then synthesize evidence pointing to metabolic dysfunction - especially mitochondrial damage - as a more likely initiating event. Through this lens, we examine diverse contributing factors including type 2 diabetes, hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress, infections and neuroinflammation. Finally, we assess current treatment limitations and argue that prevention, grounded in early metabolic and vascular interventions, holds the most promise for altering the course of this complex disease.

                arXiv:2504.05534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the application of Riemannian geometry-based methods for brain decoding using invasive electrophysiological recordings. Although previously employed in non-invasive, the utility of Riemannian geometry for invasive datasets, which are typically smaller and scarcer, remains less explored. Here, we propose a Minimum Distance to Mean (MDM) classifier using a Riemannian geometry approach based on covariance matrices extracted from intracortical Local Field Potential (LFP) recordings across various regions during different brain state dynamics. For benchmarking, we evaluated the performance of our approach against Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Euclidean MDM classifiers. Our results indicate that the Riemannian geometry-based classification not only achieves a superior mean F1 macro-averaged score across different channel configurations but also requires up to two orders of magnitude less computational training time. Additionally, the geometric framework reveals distinct spatial contributions of brain regions across varying brain states, suggesting a state-dependent organization that traditional time series-based methods often fail to capture. Our findings align with previous studies supporting the efficacy of geometry-based methods and extending their application to invasive brain recordings, highlighting their potential for broader clinical use, such as brain computer interface applications.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05568">Conditions for Inter-brain Synchronization in Remote Communication: Investigating the Role of Transmission Delay</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2504.05568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inter-brain synchronization (IBS), the alignment of neural activities between individuals, is a fundamental mechanism underlying effective social interactions and communication. Prior research has demonstrated that IBS can occur during collaborative tasks and is deeply connected to communication effectiveness. Building on these findings, recent investigations reveal that IBS happens during remote interactions, implying that brain activities between individuals can synchronize despite latency and physical separation. However, the conditions under which this synchronization occurs or is disrupted in remote settings, especially the effect of latency, are not fully understood. This study investigates how varying transmission latency affects IBS, in order to identify thresholds where synchronization is disrupted. Using electroencephalography measurements quantified through Phase Locking Value -- a metric that captures synchronization between brainwave phases -- we first confirm synchronization under face-to-face conditions and then observe changes in IBS across remote communication scenarios. Our findings reveal that IBS can occur during remote collaboration, but is critically dependent on transmission delays, with delays exceeding 450 ms significantly disrupting synchronization. These findings suggest that IBS may serve as a key indicator of communication quality in remote interactions, offering insights for improving remote communication systems and collaboration.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06199">Resting State Functional Connectivity Patterns Associate with Alcohol Use Disorder Characteristics: Insights from the Triple Network Model</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2504.06199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prolonged alcohol use results in neuroadaptations that mark more severe and treatment-resistant alcohol use. The goal of this study was to identify functional connectivity brain patterns underlying Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD)-related characteristics in fifty-five adults (31 female) who endorsed heavy alcohol use. We hypothesized that resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) of the Salience (SN), Frontoparietal (FPN), and Default Mode (DMN) networks would reflect self reported recent and lifetime alcohol use, laboratory-based alcohol seeking, urgency, and sociodemographic characteristics related to AUD. To test our hypothesis, we combined the triple network model (TNM) of psychopathology with a multivariate data-driven approach, regularized partial least squares (rPLS), to unfold concurrent functional connectivity (FC) patterns and their association with AUD characteristics. We observed three concurrent associations of interest: i) drinking and age-related cross communication between the SN and both the FPN and DMN; ii) family history density of AUD and urgency anticorrelations between the SN and FPN; and iii) alcohol seeking and sex-associated SN and DMN interactions. These findings demonstrate the utility of combining theory- and data-driven approaches to uncover associations between resting-state functional substrates and AUD-related characteristics that could aid in the identification, development, and testing of novel treatment targets across preclinical and clinical models.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06255">Diagrammatic expansion for the mutual-information rate in the realm of limited statistics</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2504.06255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neurons in sensory systems encode stimulus information into their stochastic spiking response. The Mutual information has been broadly applied to these systems to quantify the neurons' capacity of transmitting such information. Yet, while for discrete stimuli, like flashed images or single tones, its computation is straightforward, for dynamical stimuli it is necessary to compute a (mutual) information rate (MIR), therefore integrating over the multiple temporal correlations which characterize sensory systems. Previous methods are based on extensive sampling of the neuronal response, require large amounts of data, and are therefore prone to biases and inaccuracy. Here, we develop Moba-MIRA (moment-based mutual-information-rate approximation), a computational method to estimate the mutual information rate. To derive Moba-MIRA, we use Feynman diagrams to expand the mutual information in arbitrary orders in the correlations around the corresponding value for the empirical spike count distributions of single binss. As a result, only the empirical estimation of the pairwise correlations between time bins and the single-bin entropies are required, without the need for the whole joint probability distributions. We tested Moba-MIRA on synthetic data generated with generalized linear models, and showed that it requires only a few tens of stimulus repetitions to provide an accurate estimate of the information rate. Finally, we applied it to ex-vivo electrophysiological recordings of rats retina, obtaining rates ranging between 5 to 20 bits per second, consistent with earlier estimates.

                arXiv:2504.05696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the major complications in diabetic patients' eyes, potentially leading to permanent blindness if not detected timely. This study aims to evaluate the accuracy of artificial intelligence (AI) in diagnosing DR. The method employed is the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) algorithm, applied to identify DR and its severity stages from fundus images using the public dataset "APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection." Literature was reviewed via ScienceDirect, ResearchGate, Google Scholar, and IEEE Xplore. Classification results using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) showed the best performance for the binary classes normal (0) and DR (1) with an accuracy of 99.55%, precision of 99.54%, recall of 99.54%, and F1-score of 99.54%. For the multiclass classification No_DR (0), Mild (1), Moderate (2), Severe (3), Proliferate_DR (4), the accuracy was 95.26%, precision 95.26%, recall 95.17%, and F1-score 95.23%. Evaluation using the confusion matrix yielded results of 99.68% for binary classification and 96.65% for multiclass. This study highlights the significant potential in enhancing the accuracy of DR diagnosis compared to traditional human analysis

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.11632">Retinotopic Mechanics derived using classical physics</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2109.11632v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The concept of a cell$'$s receptive field is a bedrock in systems neuroscience, and the classical static description of the receptive field has had enormous success in explaining the fundamental mechanisms underlying visual processing. Borne out by the spatio-temporal dynamics of visual sensitivity to probe stimuli in primates, I build on top of this static account with the introduction of a new computational field of research, retinotopic mechanics. At its core, retinotopic mechanics assumes that during active sensing receptive fields are not static but can shift beyond their classical extent. Specifically, the canonical computations and the neural architecture that supports these computations are inherently mediated by a neurobiologically inspired force field (e.g.,$R_s\propto \sim 1 /\Delta M$). For example, when the retina is displaced because of a saccadic eye movement from one point in space to another, cells across retinotopic brain areas are tasked with discounting the retinal disruptions such active surveillance inherently introduces. This neural phenomenon is known as spatial constancy. Using retinotopic mechanics, I propose that to achieve spatial constancy or any active visually mediated task, retinotopic cells, namely their receptive fields, are constrained by eccentricity dependent elastic fields. I propose that elastic fields are self-generated by the visual system and allow receptive fields the ability to predictively shift beyond their classical extent to future post-saccadic location such that neural sensitivity which would otherwise support intermediate eccentric locations likely to contain retinal disruptions is transiently blunted.

                arXiv:2407.18922v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Synchronization dynamics is a phenomenon of great interest in many fields of science. One of the most important fields is neuron dynamics, as synchronization in certain regions of the brain is related to some of the most common mental illnesses. To study the impact of the network heterogeneity in the neuronal synchronization, we analyze a small-world network of non-identical Chialvo neurons that are electrically coupled. We introduce a mismatch in one of the model parameters to introduce the heterogeneity of the network. Our study examines the effects of this parameter mismatch, the noise intensity in the stochastic model, and the coupling strength between neurons on synchronization and firing frequency. We have identified critical values of noise intensity, parameter mismatch, and rewiring probability that facilitate effective synchronization within the network. Furthermore, we observe that the balance between excitatory and inhibitory connections plays a crucial role in achieving global synchronization. Our findings offer insights into the mechanisms driving synchronization dynamics in complex neuron networks.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16391">When does compositional structure yield compositional generalization? A kernel theory</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2405.16391v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Compositional generalization (the ability to respond correctly to novel combinations of familiar components) is thought to be a cornerstone of intelligent behavior. Compositionally structured (e.g. disentangled) representations support this ability; however, the conditions under which they are sufficient for the emergence of compositional generalization remain unclear. To address this gap, we present a theory of compositional generalization in kernel models with fixed, compositionally structured representations. This provides a tractable framework for characterizing the impact of training data statistics on generalization. We find that these models are limited to functions that assign values to each combination of components seen during training, and then sum up these values ("conjunction-wise additivity"). This imposes fundamental restrictions on the set of tasks compositionally structured kernel models can learn, in particular preventing them from transitively generalizing equivalence relations. Even for compositional tasks that they can learn in principle, we identify novel failure modes in compositional generalization (memorization leak and shortcut bias) that arise from biases in the training data. Finally, we empirically validate our theory, showing that it captures the behavior of deep neural networks (convolutional networks, residual networks, and Vision Transformers) trained on a set of compositional tasks with similarly structured data. Ultimately, this work examines how statistical structure in the training data can affect compositional generalization, with implications for how to identify and remedy failure modes in deep learning models.

                arXiv:2406.12065v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely applied in the analysis of brain fMRI, yet defining the connectivity between ROIs remains a challenge in noisy fMRI data. Among all approaches, Functional Connectome (FC) is the most popular method. Computed by the correlation coefficients between ROI time series, FC is a powerful and computationally efficient way to estimate ROI connectivity. However, it is well known for neglecting structural connections and causality in ROI interactions. Also, FC becomes much more noisy in the short spatio-temporal sliding-window subsequences of fMRI. Effective Connectome (EC) is proposed as a directional alternative, but is difficult to accurately estimate. Furthermore, for optimal GNN performance, usually only a small percentage of the strongest connections are selected as sparse edges, resulting in oversimplification of complex brain connections. To tackle these challenges, we propose the Spatio-Temporal Node Attention Graph Neural Network (STNAGNN) as a data-driven alternative that combines sparse predefined FC with dense data-driven spatio-temporal connections, allowing for flexible and spatio-temporal learning of ROI interaction patterns.

Abstract: Learning shared structure across environments facilitates rapid learning and adaptive behavior in neural systems. This has been widely demonstrated and applied in machine learning to train models that are capable of generalizing to novel settings. However, there has been limited work exploiting the shared structure in neural activity during similar tasks for learning latent dynamics from neural recordings. Existing approaches are designed to infer dynamics from a single dataset and cannot be readily adapted to account for statistical heterogeneities across recordings. In this work, we hypothesize that similar tasks admit a corresponding family of related solutions and propose a novel approach for meta-learning this solution space from task-related neural activity of trained animals. Specifically, we capture the variabilities across recordings on a low-dimensional manifold which concisely parametrizes this family of dynamics, thereby facilitating rapid learning of latent dynamics given new recordings. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on few-shot reconstruction and forecasting of synthetic dynamical systems, and neural recordings from the motor cortex during different arm reaching tasks.

                arXiv:2306.11950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our understanding of biological neuronal networks has profoundly influenced the development of artificial neural networks (ANNs). However, neurons utilized in ANNs differ considerably from their biological counterparts, primarily due to the absence of complex dendritic trees with local nonlinearities. Early studies have suggested that dendritic nonlinearities could substantially improve the learning capabilities of neural network models. In this study, we systematically examined the role of nonlinear dendrites within neural networks. Utilizing machine-learning methodologies, we assessed how dendritic nonlinearities influence neural network performance. Our findings demonstrate that dendritic nonlinearities do not substantially affect learning capacity; rather, their primary benefit lies in enabling network capacity expansion while minimizing communication costs through effective localized feature aggregation. This research provides critical insights with significant implications for designing future neural network accelerators aimed at reducing communication overhead during neural network training and inference.

Abstract: Three-factor learning rules in Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as a crucial extension to traditional Hebbian learning and Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP), incorporating neuromodulatory signals to improve adaptation and learning efficiency. These mechanisms enhance biological plausibility and facilitate improved credit assignment in artificial neural systems. This paper takes a view on this topic from a machine learning perspective, providing an overview of recent advances in three-factor learning, discusses theoretical foundations, algorithmic implementations, and their relevance to reinforcement learning and neuromorphic computing. In addition, we explore interdisciplinary approaches, scalability challenges, and potential applications in robotics, cognitive modeling, and AI systems. Finally, we highlight key research gaps and propose future directions for bridging the gap between neuroscience and artificial intelligence.

                arXiv:2504.05347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reservoir Computing (RC) is a time-efficient computational paradigm derived from Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). The Simple Cycle Reservoir (SCR) is an RC model that stands out for its minimalistic design, offering extremely low construction complexity and proven capability of universally approximating time-invariant causal fading memory filters, even in the linear dynamics regime. This paper introduces Multiple Simple Cycle Reservoirs (MSCRs), a multi-reservoir framework that extends Echo State Networks (ESNs) by replacing a single large reservoir with multiple interconnected SCRs. We demonstrate that optimizing MSCR using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) outperforms existing multi-reservoir models, achieving competitive predictive performance with a lower-dimensional state space. By modeling interconnections as a weighted Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), our approach enables flexible, task-specific network topology adaptation. Numerical simulations on three benchmark time-series prediction tasks confirm these advantages over rival algorithms. These findings highlight the potential of MSCR-PSO as a promising framework for optimizing multi-reservoir systems, providing a foundation for further advancements and applications of interconnected SCRs for developing efficient AI devices.

                arXiv:2504.05365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concepts of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and multi-agent systems are two important areas of research in artificial intelligence (AI). In this paper, we present an approach that builds a CNN-based colony of AI agents to serve as a single system and perform multiple tasks (e.g., predictions or classifications) in an environment. The proposed system impersonates the natural environment of a biological system, like an ant colony or a human colony. The proposed colony of AI that is defined as a role-based system uniquely contributes to accomplish tasks in an environment by incorporating AI agents that are fast learners, detailed learners, and organized learners. These learners can enhance their localized learning and their collective decisions as a single system of colony of AI agents. This approach also enhances the diversity and quality of the colony of AI with the help of Genetic Algorithms and their crossover and mutation mechanisms. The evolution of fast, detailed, and organized learners in the colony of AI is achieved by introducing a unique one-to-one mapping between these learners and the pretrained VGG16, VGG19, and ResNet50 models, respectively. This role-based approach creates two parent-AI agents using the AI models through the processes, called the intra- and inter-marriage of AI, so that they can share their learned knowledge (weights and biases) based on a probabilistic rule and produce diversified child-AI agents to perform new tasks. This process will form a colony of AI that consists of families of multi-model and mixture-model AI agents to improve diversity and quality. Simulations show that the colony of AI, built using the VGG16, VGG19, and ResNet50 models, can provide a single system that generates child-AI agents of excellent predictive performance, ranging between 82% and 95% of F1-scores, to make diversified collective and quality decisions on a task.

Abstract: Establishing profitable trading strategies in financial markets is a challenging task. While traditional methods like technical analysis have long served as foundational tools for traders to recognize and act upon market patterns, the evolving landscape has called for more advanced techniques. We explore the use of Vectorial Genetic Programming (VGP) for this task, introducing two new variants of VGP, one that allows operations with complex numbers and another that implements a strongly-typed version of VGP. We evaluate the different variants on three financial instruments, with datasets spanning more than seven years. Despite the inherent difficulty of this task, it was possible to evolve profitable trading strategies. A comparative analysis of the three VGP variants and standard GP revealed that standard GP is always among the worst whereas strongly-typed VGP is always among the best.

                arXiv:2504.06067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: NSGA-III is one of the most widely adopted algorithms for tackling many-objective optimization problems. However, its CPU-based design severely limits scalability and computational efficiency. To address the limitations, we propose {TensorNSGA-III}, a fully tensorized implementation of NSGA-III that leverages GPU parallelism for large-scale many-objective optimization. Unlike conventional GPU-accelerated evolutionary algorithms that rely on heuristic approximations to improve efficiency, TensorNSGA-III maintains the exact selection and variation mechanisms of NSGA-III while achieving significant acceleration. By reformulating the selection process with tensorized data structures and an optimized caching strategy, our approach effectively eliminates computational bottlenecks inherent in traditional CPU-based and na\"ive GPU implementations. Experimental results on widely used numerical benchmarks show that TensorNSGA-III achieves speedups of up to $3629\times$ over the CPU version of NSGA-III. Additionally, we validate its effectiveness in multiobjective robotic control tasks, where it discovers diverse and high-quality behavioral solutions. Furthermore, we investigate the critical role of large population sizes in many-objective optimization and demonstrate the scalability of TensorNSGA-III in such scenarios.

                arXiv:2504.06110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several mating restriction techniques have been implemented in Evolutionary Algorithms to promote diversity. From similarity-based selection to niche preservation, the general goal is to avoid premature convergence by not having fitness pressure as the single evolutionary force. In a way, such methods can resemble the mechanisms involved in Sexual Selection, although generally assuming a simplified approach. Recently, a selection method called mating Preferences as Ideal Mating Partners (PIMP) has been applied to GP, providing promising results both in performance and diversity maintenance. The method mimics Mate Choice through the unbounded evolution of personal preferences rather than having a single set of rules to shape parent selection. As such, PIMP allows ideal mate representations to evolve freely, thus potentially taking advantage of Sexual Selection as a dynamic secondary force to fitness pressure. However, it is still unclear how mating preferences affect the overall population and how dependent they are on set-up choices. In this work, we tracked the evolution of individual preferences through different mutation types, searching for patterns and evidence of self-reinforcement. Results suggest that mating preferences do not stand on their own, relying on subtree mutation to avoid convergence to single-node trees. Nevertheless, they consistently promote smaller and more balanced solutions depth-wise than a standard tournament selection, reducing the impact of bloat. Furthermore, when coupled with subtree mutation it also results in more solution diversity with statistically significant results.

                arXiv:2504.05320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text clustering holds significant value across various domains due to its ability to identify patterns and group related information. Current approaches which rely heavily on a computed similarity measure between documents are often limited in accuracy and interpretability. We present a novel approach to the problem based on a set of evolved search queries. Clusters are formed as the set of documents matched by a single search query in the set of queries. The queries are optimized to maximize the number of documents returned and to minimize the overlap between clusters (documents returned by more than one query). Where queries contain more than one word they are interpreted disjunctively. We have found it useful to assign one word to be the root and constrain the query construction such that the set of documents returned by any additional query words intersect with the set returned by the root word. Not all documents in a collection are returned by any of the search queries in a set, so once the search query evolution is completed a second stage is performed whereby a KNN algorithm is applied to assign all unassigned documents to their nearest cluster. We describe the method and present results using 8 text datasets comparing effectiveness with well-known existing algorithms. We note that as well as achieving the highest accuracy on these datasets the search query format provides the qualitative benefits of being interpretable and modifiable whilst providing a causal explanation of cluster construction.

                arXiv:2504.05756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Survival Regression (SuR) is a key technique for modeling time to event in important applications such as clinical trials and semiconductor manufacturing. Currently, SuR algorithms belong to one of three classes: non-linear black-box -- allowing adaptability to many datasets but offering limited interpretability (e.g., tree ensembles); linear glass-box -- being easier to interpret but limited to modeling only linear interactions (e.g., Cox proportional hazards); and non-linear glass-box -- allowing adaptability and interpretability, but empirically found to have several limitations (e.g., explainable boosting machines, survival trees). In this work, we investigate whether Symbolic Regression (SR), i.e., the automated search of mathematical expressions from data, can lead to non-linear glass-box survival models that are interpretable and accurate. We propose an evolutionary, multi-objective, and multi-expression implementation of SR adapted to SuR. Our empirical results on five real-world datasets show that SR consistently outperforms traditional glass-box methods for SuR in terms of accuracy per number of dimensions in the model, while exhibiting comparable accuracy with black-box methods. Furthermore, we offer qualitative examples to assess the interpretability potential of SR models for SuR. Code at: https://github.com/lurovi/SurvivalMultiTree-pyNSGP.

Abstract: Concept drift and extreme verification latency pose significant challenges in data stream learning, particularly when dealing with recurring concept changes in dynamic environments. This work introduces a novel method based on the Growing Neural Gas (GNG) algorithm, designed to effectively handle abrupt recurrent drifts while adapting to incrementally evolving data distributions (incremental drifts). Leveraging the self-organizing and topological adaptability of GNG, the proposed approach maintains a compact yet informative memory structure, allowing it to efficiently store and retrieve knowledge of past or recurring concepts, even under conditions of delayed or sparse stream supervision. Our experiments highlight the superiority of our approach over existing data stream learning methods designed to cope with incremental non-stationarities and verification latency, demonstrating its ability to quickly adapt to new drifts, robustly manage recurring patterns, and maintain high predictive accuracy with a minimal memory footprint. Unlike other techniques that fail to leverage recurring knowledge, our proposed approach is proven to be a robust and efficient online learning solution for unsupervised drifting data flows.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06006">Optuna vs Code Llama: Are LLMs a New Paradigm for Hyperparameter Tuning?</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2504.06006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimal hyperparameter selection is critical for maximizing neural network performance, especially as models grow in complexity. This work investigates the viability of using large language models (LLMs) for hyperparameter optimization by employing a fine-tuned version of Code Llama. Through parameter-efficient fine-tuning using LoRA, we adapt the LLM to generate accurate and efficient hyperparameter recommendations tailored to diverse neural network architectures. Unlike traditional methods such as Optuna, which rely on exhaustive trials, the proposed approach achieves competitive or superior results in terms of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) while significantly reducing computational overhead. Our approach highlights that LLM-based optimization not only matches state-of-the-art methods like Tree-structured Parzen Estimators but also accelerates the tuning process. This positions LLMs as a promising alternative to conventional optimization techniques, particularly for rapid experimentation. Furthermore, the ability to generate hyperparameters in a single inference step makes this method particularly well-suited for resource-constrained environments such as edge devices and mobile applications, where computational efficiency is paramount. The results confirm that LLMs, beyond their efficiency, offer substantial time savings and comparable stability, underscoring their value in advancing machine learning workflows. All generated hyperparameters are included in the LEMUR Neural Network (NN) Dataset, which is publicly available and serves as an open-source benchmark for hyperparameter optimization research.

                arXiv:2504.06126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vehicle Routing Problems (VRP) are an extension of the Traveling Salesperson Problem and are a fundamental NP-hard challenge in combinatorial optimization. Solving VRP in real-time at large scale has become critical in numerous applications, from growing markets like last-mile delivery to emerging use-cases like interactive logistics planning. Such applications involve solving similar problem instances repeatedly, yet current state-of-the-art solvers treat each instance on its own without leveraging previous examples. We introduce a novel optimization framework that uses a reinforcement learning agent - trained on prior instances - to quickly generate initial solutions, which are then further optimized by genetic algorithms. Our framework, Evolutionary Algorithm with Reinforcement Learning Initialization (EARLI), consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art solvers across various time scales. For example, EARLI handles vehicle routing with 500 locations within 1s, 10x faster than current solvers for the same solution quality, enabling applications like real-time and interactive routing. EARLI can generalize to new data, as demonstrated on real e-commerce delivery data of a previously unseen city. Our hybrid framework presents a new way to combine reinforcement learning and genetic algorithms, paving the road for closer interdisciplinary collaboration between AI and optimization communities towards real-time optimization in diverse domains.

                arXiv:2307.05657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantization is a widely used technique to compress neural networks. Assigning uniform bit-widths across all layers can result in significant accuracy degradation at low precision and inefficiency at high precision. Mixed-precision quantization (MPQ) addresses this by assigning varied bit-widths to layers, optimizing the accuracy-efficiency trade-off. Existing sensitivity-based methods for MPQ assume that quantization errors across layers are independent, which leads to suboptimal choices. We introduce CLADO, a practical sensitivity-based MPQ algorithm that captures cross-layer dependency of quantization error. CLADO approximates pairwise cross-layer errors using linear equations on a small data subset. Layerwise bit-widths are assigned by optimizing a new MPQ formulation based on cross-layer quantization errors using an Integer Quadratic Program. Experiments with CNN and vision transformer models on ImageNet demonstrate that CLADO achieves state-of-the-art mixed-precision quantization performance.

                arXiv:2406.17811v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bayesian optimization is a powerful method for automating tuning of compilers. The complex landscape of autotuning provides a myriad of rarely considered structural challenges for black-box optimizers, and the lack of standardized benchmarks has limited the study of Bayesian optimization within the domain. To address this, we present CATBench, a comprehensive benchmarking suite that captures the complexities of compiler autotuning, ranging from discrete, conditional, and permutation parameter types to known and unknown binary constraints, as well as both multi-fidelity and multi-objective evaluations. The benchmarks in CATBench span a range of machine learning-oriented computations, from tensor algebra to image processing and clustering, and uses state-of-the-art compilers, such as TACO and RISE/ELEVATE. CATBench offers a unified interface for evaluating Bayesian optimization algorithms, promoting reproducibility and innovation through an easy-to-use, fully containerized setup of both surrogate and real-world compiler optimization tasks. We validate CATBench on several state-of-the-art algorithms, revealing their strengths and weaknesses and demonstrating the suite's potential for advancing both Bayesian optimization and compiler autotuning research.

                arXiv:2407.21077v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) require high quality instruction data for effective alignment, particularly in code generation tasks where expert curated datasets are expensive to produce. We present Genetic-Instruct, a scalable algorithm for synthesizing large-scale, high quality coding instructions using evolutionary principles. Starting from a small set of seed instructions, Genetic-Instruct generates diverse and challenging instruction-code pairs by leveraging an Instructor-LLM for generation, a Coder-LLM for code synthesis, and a Judge-LLM for automatic quality evaluation. Our proposed approach is highly parallelizable and effective even with a small seed data and weaker generator models. We generated more than 7.5 million coding instructions with the proposed approach. Then we evaluated it by fine-tuning LLMs with the synthetic samples and demonstrated a significant improvement in their code generation capability compared to the other synthetic generation approaches and publicly available datasets. Our results highlight the efficiency, scalability, and generalizability of the Genetic-Instruct framework.

">Functional Role for Cas Cytoplasmic Adaptor Proteins During Cortical Axon Pathfinding</a></h4>

              
                Proper neural circuit organization requires individual neurons to project to their targets with high specificity. While several guidance molecules have been shown to mediate axonal fasciculation and pathfinding, less is understood about how neurons intracellularly interpret and integrate these cues. Here we provide genetic evidence that the Crk-Associated Substrate (Cas) family of intracellular adaptor proteins is required for proper fasciculation and guidance of two cortical white matter tracts: the Anterior Commissure (AC) and thalamocortical axons (TCAs). Using a Cas Triple Conditional Knock Out (Cas TcKO) mouse model, we show that Cas proteins are required non-neuronally for TCA projections in a manner that phenocopies the non-neuronal requirement for the {beta}1-integrin receptor. Additional analysis of Cas TcKO mutants reveals a neuronal-autonomous role in AC fasciculation that is not phenocopied in {beta}1-integrin deficient mutants, suggesting that Cas proteins might signal downstream of a different receptor during this axon pathfinding event. These findings implicate Cas proteins as key mediators of cortical axon tract fasciculation and guidance.

">Genetic diversity shapes behavioral outcomes and reveals sex differences in mice exposed to early life stress</a></h4>

              
                Understanding how genetic variability shapes responses to environmental and developmental factors is critical for advancing translational neuroscience. However, most preclinical studies rely on inbred mouse strains that do not capture the genetic complexity of human populations. One key area of translational research focuses on identifying the neural and behavioral consequences of early life trauma. Rodent models of childhood neglect, such as maternal separation with early weaning (MSEW), have been used in isogenic mouse strains like C57BL/6J (B6) to identify behavioral domains and neural loci of deficits stemming from exposure to MSEW. To understand how genetic diversity may contribute to the outcomes produced by MSEW, and thus inform future studies on the topic, we utilized the Jackson Laboratory Diversity Outbred (DO) line, a population derived from eight founder strains that exhibit broad genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity. We first compared MSEW effects on social behavior in DO mice versus B6 mice, because we have previously found social behavior deficits in B6 mice with a history of MSEW. Indeed, we established that MSEW incited social motivation deficits in DO mice, in a sex-specific manner. We then expanded our investigation of DO mice to test MSEW-related changes in anxiety-like behavior, fear learning and expression, and reward-seeking. Results revealed that MSEW produces distinct, sex-specific phenotypes: female DO mice displayed reduced social motivation and elevated anxiety-like behavior, while male DO mice showed attenuated CS-evoked fear expression and diminished reward-seeking behavior. Additionally, immunohistochemical analysis revealed increased Fos expression in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) in MSEW-exposed DO mice, both at baseline and following acute stress. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating genetically diverse models to better capture the nuances of early life adversity-related outcomes relevant to human populations.

">Insights into early cochlear damage induced by potassium channel deficiency</a></h4>

              
                Hearing loss (HL) is the most common sensory disorder, caused by genetic mutations and acquired factors like presbycusis and noise exposure. A critical factor in HL development is the dysfunction of potassium (K+) channels, essential for sensory cell function in the organ of Corti (OC). Inner and outer hair cells (IHCs and OHCs) convert sound into electrical signals, while supporting cells (SCs) maintain ionic and structural balance. KCNQ4 channels, located in the basal membrane of OHCs, regulate K+ efflux. Mutations in KCNQ4 are linked to progressive HL (DFNA2), noise-induced hearing loss, and presbycusis, leading to K+ accumulation, cellular stress, and OHC death. Gene editing or pharmacological activation of KCNQ4 has shown potential in partially preventing HL in mouse models. In this study, we demonstrate KCNQ4 deletion disrupts the localization of key proteins like prestin and BK channels, alters OHC organization, and induces apoptosis in sensory and SC. Spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) also degenerate over time. Despite these structural changes, noise exposure does not exacerbate OHC damage in our KCNQ4-deficient model. This highlights KCNQ4's role in maintaining ion homeostasis and cochlear function, as its absence triggers widespread dysfunction in the OC. The present study demonstrates that disruptions in a single cell type can have a cascade effect on overall cochlear health. Understanding the molecular and cellular consequences of KCNQ4 mutations is crucial for developing targeted therapies to mitigate progressive HL caused by genetic and environmental factors.

">Identification of a stress-sensitive endogenous opioid-containing neuronal population in the paranigral ventral tegmental area.</a></h4>

              
                Nociceptin/orphanin FQ (N/OFQ), an endogenous opioid neuropeptide, and its G-protein coupled receptor NOPR have been implicated in motivation, feeding behaviors, and aversion. Stress-induced dysfunction in these states is central to the development of numerous psychiatric disorders, and the N/OFQ-NOPR system's role in reward- and stress-related responses has driven broad interest in NOPR as a therapeutic target for anxiety and depression. However, the impact of stress on N/OFQ signaling in the context of its influence on discrete midbrain reward circuitry remains unknown. To this end, we focused on a possible candidate population of N/OFQ neurons in the paranigral ventral tegmental area (pnVTAPNOC) that have been shown to act locally on NOPR-containing VTA dopamine neurons to suppress motivation. Here we report and characterize pnVTAPNOC sensitivity to stress exposure and identify a functional excitatory and inhibitory afferent input to this subpopulation from the lateral hypothalamus (LH). Our results indicate that pnVTAPNOC neurons become recruited during exposure to a range of acute stressor types, whereas the GABAergic input from the LH to this population is suppressed by predator odor stress, providing a mechanism for disinhibition of these neurons. These findings suggest that this N/OFQ population in the pnVTA could act as a critical bridge between stress and motivation through interactions with upstream hypothalamic circuitry.

">The precision of hippocampal representations predicts incremental value-learning across the adult lifespan</a></h4>

              
                Correctly assigning value to different options and leveraging this information to guide choice is a cornerstone of adaptive decision-making. Reinforcement learning (RL) has provided a computational framework to study this process, and neural signals linked to RL have been identified in the striatum and medial prefrontal cortex. More recently, hippocampal contributions to this kind of value-learning have been proposed, at least under some conditions. Here, we test whether the hippocampus provides a signal of the option's identity that aids in credit assignment when learning about several perceptually similar items, and evaluate how this process differs across the lifespan. A sample of 251 younger and older adults, including a subset (n = 76) with simultaneous fMRI, completed an RL task in which they learned the value of four houses through trial-and-error. Older adults showed decreased choice accuracy, accompanied by reduced neural signaling of value at choice but not feedback. Using representational similarity analysis, we found that the precision with which choice options were represented in the posterior hippocampus during choice predicted accurate decisions across age groups. Interestingly, despite previous evidence for neural de-differentiation in older adults, we found no support for a "blurring" of these stimulus representations in older adults. Rather, we observed reduced connectivity between the posterior hippocampus and the medial PFC in older adults, and this connectivity correlated with choice consistency. Taken together, these findings identify a hippocampal contribution to incremental value learning, and that reductions in incremental value learning in older adults are associated with the reduced transfer of information between the hippocampus and mPFC, rather than the precision of the information in the hippocampus itself.

">Autism-associated Scn2a haploinsufficiency disrupts in vivo dendritic signaling and impairs flexible decision-making</a></h4>

              
                SCN2A is a high-confidence risk gene for autism spectrum disorder. Loss-of-function mutations in Scn2a reduce dendritic excitability in neocortical pyramidal cells. However, the impact of Scn2a haploinsufficiency on dendritic signaling in vivo, particularly during behavior, is unknown. In this study, we used two-photon microscopy to image dendritic calcium transients in deep layer pyramidal cells in the mouse medial frontal cortex. Scn2a+/- mice had diminished coupling between apical and proximal dendritic compartments. Pyramidal tract neurons had abnormal event rates, while intratelencephalic neurons had compartment-specific alterations indicative of diminished dendritic integration. In a matching pennies task, Scn2a+/- mice were inflexible in the face of changing competitive pressure. Apical dendritic tuft in IT neurons typically encoded reward and strategy, but these task-specific representations were absent in Scn2a+/- mice. Collectively, the findings demonstrate that Scn2a haploinsufficiency weakens dendritic integration in vivo and disrupts the dendritic encoding of decision variables, potentially contributing to the cognitive rigidity in autism spectrum disorder.

">Ontogeny of tactile, vocal and kinship dynamics in rat pup huddling</a></h4>

              
                Huddling, a tactile, thermoregulatory and filial social interaction, is a predominant and conserved social interaction mammalian and bird species. The act of huddling is particularly important in early life, when thermoregulation, social touch and bonding are influential for survival and healthy brain and behavioural development. We ask how tactile, vocal and kinship dynamics of rat pup interactions develop. We designed a huddling apparatus where we record and synchronise huddle formation with ultrasonic vocalisation analysis. With development, we see that groups (P6-8 vs older pups) stay longer in triad aggregon (pup huddle) configurations in the huddle trial period. Older pups (P18-20) switch huddle states more often. The spectral characteristics of rat pup vocalisation during huddling task change in development, with a higher peak frequency in P18-20 pups. In all age-groups we observe vocal quieting as aggregons form. We hypothesized that kinship should be a strong determinant of huddling interactions but our findings reveal otherwise. When comparing kin vs non-kin groups we found no differences in aggregon durations or switches. In the youngest age group (P6-8) the amount of USVs were reduced in kin vs non-kin groups, though not in older age groups. To address the role of tactile contact in quieting we integrated touch dividers in the huddle arena. Without touch, we saw that vocalisations significantly increased in P6-8 and P11-14, but not in P18-20 kin sibling groups. We suggest that rat pups have a strong internal drive towards huddling behaviour regardless of whether huddle partners are related by kinship. USV analysis suggests that huddling has a calming effect, where related sibling young pups show less distress overall; absence of touch is associated with increased distress in P6-8 and P11-14 kin huddle groups. Thus, huddling is a natural social behaviour that is intrinsically rewarding and shared between both related siblings and unrelated conspecifics; it has calming effects - as indicated by USVs - that depend on kinship and tactile contact during the earliest stages of development.

                Background One of the most common strabismus types in children is intermittent exotropia, which predominantly occurs in children between the ages of 2 to 4 years. It may affect visual development and often coexists with refractive errors. Unlike esotropia, which usually links to hyperopia, intermittent exotropia might have a different relationship with refractive errors and thus lead to myopia. This study will investigate the prevalence and distribution of refractive errors in children with intermittent exotropia, challenging the traditionally held relationship between strabismus and hyperopia and its possible contribution to the development of myopia. Methods In this cross-sectional retrospective study from August 2021 to December 2023, 179 patients diagnosed with intermittent exotropia were recruited via an outpatient clinic of Najah Al-Quraishi, Baghdad, Iraq. The refractive errors were compared by autorefractometry and retinoscopy after cycloplegic dilation. Data analysis was conducted under the use of IBM SPSS V.26 for the determination of emmetropia, myopia, and hyperopia prevalence. Results Among the 179 patients, emmetropia was the most commonly observed refractive status, present in 68 patients (38%). Low hyperopia and low myopia were also common, with 64 and 40, respectively. A limited number of patients had moderate/high myopia and moderate/high hyperopia; in detail, the prevalence was as follows: 5% of patients had moderate myopia, while 0.5% of patients suffered from high myopia; symmetrically, 5% were moderate to high hyperopia. From the data collected, a trend emerged for a low refractive error and symmetric refractive error in both eyes. Conclusion Contrasted to prior conventional wisdom about refractive error in strabismus, it established the greater prevalence of emmetropia in patients with intermittent exotropia. The findings call for specific management strategies to be applied in this population.

                Background This study aimed to compare the effect on postoperative complications of combined prehabilitation targeting predefined co-existing risky SNAP factors with usual preoperative routines in surgical patients. Methods This systematic review followed the PRISMA 2020 guideline and the protocol (CRD42022282611). Five databases were searched from inception to November 7, 2022 for randomised controlled trials on prehabilitation targeting ≥2 predefined risky lifestyles compared with usual preoperative routines. Risky lifestyles included Smoking, Nutrition (malnutrition and/or BMI>25), risky Alcohol intake, and Physical inactivity (SNAP). Primary outcome was postoperative complications ≤30 days. Cochrane’s risk-of-bias tool 2 was used and meta-analyses were conducted. GRADE was used to assess certainty of evidence. Results The search resulted in 20,862 records. At full-text screening, only two (120 participants) of 24 identified trials on combined SNAP intervention had ≥2 predefined risk factors and were included. One (n=110) on intensive physical and brief nutritional intervention to frail patients with colorectal cancer resection reported complication rates of 45% in both groups (relative risk (RR) 1.00, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.51). The other study (n=10, subgroup) on intensive alcohol and smoking intervention in patients with bladder cancer undergoing radical cystectomy, reported complications in 3/7 vs 3/3 participants. The meta-analysis estimated a RR of 0.79 (95% CI 0.41 to 1.51, I2 51%). Conclusion Two small of the 24 trials on prehabilitation targeted co-existing and predefined risky SNAP factors and the effect on postoperative complications is very uncertain. Future prehabilitation research involving patient needs is warranted.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-416/v1?src=rss">Ovarian Cancer Registry (OVAR); A study protocol for retrospective data collection in Colombian patients with ovarian cancer [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Ovarian cancer is one of the leading causes of death from gynecologic cancer. In Colombia, as in the world, its diagnosis is made in late stages due to the absence of specific symptoms of this disease. Objective The objective of the Ovarian Cancer Registry is (i) to collect clinical and histopathological data using a standardized protocol, (ii) to characterize these patients clinically and histopathological to optimize the diagnosis and treatment, to describe these clinical aspects, which will allow us to understand the clinical particularities of this disease better. Methods The Ovarian Cancer Registry is designed as a retrospective for data collection on OVAR patients. All patients under medical care at the Hospital Universitario Mayor Méderi and who have arrived in three possible routes or scenarios: (i) outpatient care, (ii) assessment in emergency services and (iii) references to the oncology service. The OVAR will have information on patients who consulted the Major Hospital from the first of January 2021 with CIE10 C56X and C482. Ethics and dissemination The University of Rosario Ethics Committee approved registry protocol V02 (08/feb/24) No. 2541-CV1830 (Bogotá, Colombia). Registry leaders acknowledge their ongoing ethical responsibilities for all research using this data. Conclusion The data from the Ovarian Cancer Registry will be instrumental in establishing optimal management strategies for OC patients, laying the groundwork for future guideline recommendations, and shaping the direction of upcoming research on the Colombian population.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-415/v1?src=rss">Systematic review protocol on antibiotic use for orofacial pain: Policy and practice implications [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Dental pain and intraoral swelling, commonly resulting from pulpal and periapical infections, are leading causes of emergency visits. Overuse of antibiotics in such cases contributes to antimicrobial resistance. The appropriateness of antibiotic use must be evaluated to ensure rational prescribing and minimize unnecessary prescriptions. Objectives This review aims to evaluate the effectiveness and associated signs and symptoms of empiric antibiotic treatment for ≤5 days compared to >5 days in patients presenting with dental pain. Methods This protocol has been conducted following PRISMA-P guidelines. A comprehensive search of four electronic databases, such as PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane and Embase was performed to find pertinent studies. This study will follow PICOS framework, including individuals receiving antibiotic treatment for oro-facial pain. Randomized controlled trials evaluating the use of empirical antibiotics for <5 days, compared to >5 days for dental pain management. Outcomes assessed will be pain reduction, quality of life improvement, adverse events related to antibiotic, clinical resolution, microbiological and radiological findings, biomarkers, antimicrobial resistance, cost implications. Independent reviewers will screen the studies, assess the risk of bias by using RoB-2 and certainty of evidence by using GRADE. Where feasible, a meta-analysis will be conducted to synthesize findings and provide a quantitative summary of the results. Results The study commenced in February 2025 and is anticipated to be completed by May 2025. Conclusions This review will evaluate the effectiveness of antibiotic prescriptions for dental pain, minimizing adverse effects and identifying guideline adherence gaps. Findings will support antibiotic stewardship and inform policies to promote rational use, aiming to curb antimicrobial resistance while ensuring effective, evidence-based pain management in dental practice.

                Background Yeasts are unicellular fungi that inhabit a variety of environments including plant surfaces, water, soil, and animal hosts. However, limited research has been conducted on soil and plant associated yeasts in Africa, with most studies originating from developed regions. Methods This study explored the diversity, distribution, and phenotypic characterization of cultivable wild yeast in samples from rhizosphere soil, leaves, litter, and tree bark collected from South West Ethiopia. Yeast isolates were characterized using morphological, physiological and biochemical methods, Stress-tolerant yeast species were identified using Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization-Time of Flight (MALDI-TOF). Results Based on morphological, physiological, and biochemical analyses, a total of 15 yeast genera were identified from 23 plant species. Predominant yeast species included Candida spp., Saccharomyces spp., Meyerozyma spp., Pichia spp., Geotrichum spp., and Hanseniaspora spp. Plant species with the highest yeast diversity were Ficus vasta, Ficus exasperata, Ficus sycomorus, Cordia africana, and Ritchiea albersii. Bark samples yielded more yeast isolates than rhizosphere soil, litter, and leaves. Stress-tolerant species such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Candida pelliculosa, Meyerozyma guilliermondii, Pichia kluyveri, and Trichosporon asahii were identified using MALDI-TOF. Correlation analysis revealed no significant relationship between yeast populations in bark and leaf samples or between rhizosphere soil and leaves, though a weak positive correlation was found between rhizosphere soil and bark or litter. Seasonal analysis showed a strong positive correlation between yeast abundance in spring and summer, but no association between autumn and spring. Conclusion Ethiopian forests are home for various yeast species including the stress-tolerant wild yeasts. This study highlights the significant yeast diversity in Ethiopian forests, with potential applications in improving industrial fermentation processes that operate under stressful conditions.

                Background The reliable and usable (semi) automation of data extraction can support the field of systematic review by reducing the workload required to gather information about the conduct and results of the included studies. This living systematic review examines published approaches for data extraction from reports of clinical studies. Methods We systematically and continually search PubMed, ACL Anthology, arXiv, OpenAlex via EPPI-Reviewer, and the dblp computer science bibliography databases. Full text screening and data extraction are conducted using a mix of open-source and commercial tools. This living review update includes publications up to August 2024 and OpenAlex content up to September 2024. Results 117 publications are included in this review. Of these, 30 (26%) used full texts while the rest used titles and abstracts. A total of 112 (96%) publications developed classifiers for randomised controlled trials. Over 30 entities were extracted, with PICOs (population, intervention, comparator, outcome) being the most frequently extracted. Data are available from 53 (45%), and code from 49 (42%) publications. Nine (8%) implemented publicly available tools. Conclusions This living systematic review presents an overview of (semi)automated data-extraction literature of interest to different types of literature review. We identified a broad evidence base of publications describing data extraction for interventional reviews and a small number of publications extracting other study types. Between review updates, large language models emerged as a new tool for data extraction. While facilitating access to automated extraction, they showed a trend of decreasing quality of results reporting, especially quantitative results such as recall and lower reproducibility of results. Compared with the previous update, trends such as transition to relation extraction and sharing of code and datasets stayed similar.

                Background During hospitalisation, older adults are at risk of developing functional decline unrelated to the condition for which they were admitted. The loss of independence in at least one activity of daily living is referred to as hospital-associated disability (HAD). A loss of functional independence in hospitalised older people is associated with a greater risk of nursing home placement and increased caregiver burden after hospital dismissal. It is essential to raise awareness of the HAD problem among older patients and to implement adequate preventive and treatment measures. Objectives To evaluate systematically the effectiveness of physical exercise to prevent and rehabilitate HAD in people aged 65 years and over who are hospitalised in an acute care setting. To assess factors (training intensity, volume, and frequency) that potentially influence the effectiveness of physical exercise on HAD in such patients through meta-regression. Methods We will conduct a living systematic review of randomised controlled trials including a network meta-analysis. For the outcome HAD, various physical exercise modalities such as resistance training, aerobic exercises or cycling could be proposed. Unlike pair-wise meta-analyses, which allow only head-to-head comparisons, network meta-analysis enables us to compare all modalities simultaneously. Guidelines from the Cochrane Handbook for a systematic review of interventions will be followed. Discussion A network meta-analysis offers several advantages which are relevant in the context of the present review question: i) it allows the integration of multiple comparisons within one analytical framework; ii) it enables to the evaluation of the comparative effectiveness of each exercise modality, thus allowing for a hierarchy of interventions; iii) it increased precision of the effect estimates compared to traditional meta-analyses. The latter advantage is crucial for outcomes like functional decline after a hospital stay.

                Backgrounds Oil palm (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.), is the most significant and highest-yielding crop among oil-producing crops worldwide. In 2020/2022, Basal stem rot (BSR) disease was observed in six oil palm growing Districts in Ghana. Methods Field study and laboratory analysis were conducted. A random sampling technique was used to select five plantation blocks from each District. Single-point disease assessments were done using Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) with a severity scale of 0-4. Molecular assays were performed on each sample using nucleic acid as a template. ITS and GanET sequence analysis were performed along with the formation of a phylogenetic tree using the FASTA algorithm with the Fungus database from EBI and NCBI GenBank. Koch’s postulate was followed to confirm the disease. Results The disease incidence was 11.3 % with the highest severity score of 4. BSR is characterised by stem decay large-perennial, woody brackets basidiocarps of average measurement of 2-65 cm in diameter on infected palms. Culture colonies were white, striated, undulating, woolly-cottony, and creamish pigment on the reverse depicting attributes of Ganoderma fungus. Molecular confirmation was done by combining ITS sequence of top matches of >97% to members of the genus Ganoderma, >98% and 99.3% identity to three sequences of Ganoderma sp. (HM138671; HM138670 and HM138672) generated from strains assigned to Ganoderma ryvardenii and compared with 132 published sequences of Ganoderma isolates. Conclusion This is the first report of Ganoderma ryvardenii causing BSR disease on oil palm in Ghana and possibly the second report in Africa. However, the pathogen was first reported to cause similar diseases in oil palm in Cameroon.

                Background Benign prostatic hyperplasia [BPH] is a prevalent condition among aging men, characterized by prostate gland enlargement leading to lower urinary tract symptoms [LUTS]. Conventional treatments like alpha-blockers and 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors, though effective, often result in adverse effects. This has spurred interest in phytotherapy, leveraging plant-derived compounds to mitigate BPH symptoms due to their safety, cost-effectiveness, and patient preference. Method The review highlighted 84 studies involving diverse plants and bioactive compounds. Prominent examples include Serenoa repens [saw palmetto], Urtica dioica [nettle root], Cucurbita pepo [pumpkin seed], and Pygeum africanum [African cherry]. These plants exhibit mechanisms such as 5α-reductase inhibition, anti-inflammatory effects, and modulation of oxidative stress. Clinical and preclinical findings demonstrate improved urinary flow, reduced prostate volume, and alleviated LUTS. However, variability in methodologies, extract preparations, and dosages poses challenges to standardization. Results The review highlighted 84 studies involving diverse plants and bioactive compounds.

                Background Studies assessing sub-maximal aerobic capacity in non-cirrhotic chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients are scarce. This study aimed to evaluate sub-maximal aerobic capacity in CHB patients compared to apparently healthy participants (control-group (CG)). Methods A 6-min walk test (6MWT) was performed. The 6-min walk distance (6MWD) was recorded, along with heart-rate (HR), oxy-hemoglobin saturation (SpO2), blood-pressure, and dyspnea ( ie ; visual analogue scale) at rest (Rest) and at the end (End) of the 6MWT. Additionally, the 6-min walk work (6MWW), and estimated cardiorespiratory and muscular chain age were calculated. Signs of physical intolerance were determined including abnormal 6MWD ( ie ; 6MWD < lower limit of normal), chronotropic insufficiency (ie ; HREnd < 60% of maximal predicted HR (MPHR)), high dyspnea ( ie ; dyspneaEnd > 5), and desaturation ( ie ; drop in SpO2 > 5 points). Results Compared to the CG (n=28), the CHB-group (n=26) exhibited significantly lower 6MWD by 61 meters (8%), lower 6MWW by 10%, and lower HREnd by 21% (when expressed in bpm) and 17% (when expressed in %MPHR). The CHB-group, compared to the CG, included higher percentages of participants with chronotropic insufficiency and abnormal 6MWD (23.08% vs. 3.57%, and 34.61% vs. 3.57%, respectively). The CHB-group was 8.1 and 14.3 times more likely to have chronotropic insufficiency and abnormal 6MWD than the CG, respectively. CHB accelerated the aging of the cardiorespiratory and muscular chain by 11 years. Conclusion Non-cirrhotic CHB may contribute to reduced submaximal aerobic capacity and acceleration of cardiorespiratory and muscular chain aging.

                <p>by Ziyan Jin, Xinyi Zhou, Zhaoyuan Fang</p>

Stochastic Simulation Algorithm (SSA) is crucial for modeling biochemical reactions and gene regulatory networks. Traditional SSA is characterized by Markovian property and cannot naturally model systems with time delays. Several algorithms have already been designed to handle delayed reactions, yet few easy-to-use implementations exist. To address these challenges, we have developed DelaySSA, an R package that implements currently available algorithms for SSA with or without delays. Meanwhile, we also provided Matlab and Python versions to support wider applications. We demonstrated its accuracy and validity by simulating two classical models: the Bursty model and Refractory model. We then tested its capability to simulate the RNA Velocity model, where it successfully reproduced both the up- and down-regulation stages in the phase portrait. Finally, we extended its application to simulate a gene regulatory network of lung cancer adeno-to-squamous transition (AST) and qualitatively analyzed its bistability behavior by approximating the Waddington’s landscape. Modeling the therapeutic intervention of a SOX2 degrader as a delayed degradation reaction, AST is effectively blocked and reprogrammed back to the adenocarcinoma state, providing a useful clue for targeting drug-resistant AST in the future. Taken together, DelaySSA is a powerful and easy-to-use software suite, facilitating accurate modeling of various kinds of biological systems and broadening the scope of stochastic simulations in systems biology.

Epidemic surveillance is a challenging task, especially when crucial data is fragmented across institutions and data custodians are unable or unwilling to share it. This study aims to explore the feasibility of a simple <i>federated surveillance</i> approach. We conduct hypothesis tests on count data behind each custodian’s firewall and then combine <i>p</i>-values from these tests using techniques from meta-analysis. We propose a hypothesis testing framework to identify surges in epidemic-related data streams and conduct experiments on real and semi-synthetic data to assess the power of different <i>p</i>-value combination methods to detect surges without needing to combine or share the underlying counts. Our findings show that relatively simple combination methods achieve a high degree of fidelity and suggest that infectious disease outbreaks can be detected without needing to share or even aggregate data across institutions.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012903">The impact of climate change on ecology of tick associated with tick-borne diseases</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Heejin Choi, Chang Hyeong Lee</p>

Infectious diseases have caused significant economic and human losses worldwide. Growing concerns exist regarding climate change potentially exacerbating the spread of these diseases, particularly those transmitted by vectors such as ticks and mosquitoes. Tick-borne diseases, such as Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (SFTS), can be particularly detrimental to elderly and immunocompromised individuals. This study utilizes a mathematical modeling approach to predict changes in tick populations under climate change scenarios, incorporating tick ecology and climate-sensitive parameters. Sensitivity analysis is performed to investigate the factors influencing tick population dynamics. The study further explores effective tick control strategies and their cost-effectiveness in the context of climate change. The findings indicate that the efficacy of tick population reduction varies greatly depending on the timing of control measure implementation and the effectiveness of the control strategies exhibits a strong dependence on the duration of implementation. Furthermore, as climate change intensifies, tick populations are projected to increase, leading to a rise in control costs and SFTS cases. In light of these findings, identifying and implementing appropriate control measures to manage tick populations under climate change will be increasingly crucial.

                <p>by Xiaoyuan Liu, Jonathan W. Pitchford, George W. A. Constable</p>

In unicellular organisms, sexual reproduction typically begins with the fusion of two cells (plasmogamy) followed by the fusion of their two haploid nuclei (karyogamy) and finally meiosis. Most work on the evolution of sexual reproduction focuses on the benefits of the genetic recombination that takes place during meiosis. However, the selection pressures that may have driven the early evolution of binary cell fusion, which sets the stage for the evolution of karyogamy by bringing nuclei together in the same cell, have seen less attention. In this paper we develop a model for the coevolution of cell size and binary cell fusion rate. The model assumes that larger cells experience a survival advantage from their larger cytoplasmic volume. We find that under favourable environmental conditions, populations can evolve to produce larger cells that undergo obligate binary cell fission. However, under challenging environmental conditions, populations can evolve to subsequently produce smaller cells under binary cell fission that nevertheless retain a survival advantage by fusing with other cells. The model thus parsimoniously recaptures the empirical observation that sexual reproduction is typically triggered by adverse environmental conditions in many unicellular eukaryotes and draws conceptual links to the literature on the evolution of multicellularity.

                <p>by Anton Sumser, Emilio Ulises Isaías-Camacho, Rebecca Audrey Mease, Alexander Groh</p>

Active and passive sensing strategies are integral to an animal’s behavioral repertoire. Nevertheless, there is a lack of information regarding the neuronal circuitry that underpins these strategies, particularly at the thalamus level. We evaluated how active versus passive whisker deflections are represented in single neurons of the ventral posteromedial thalamus (VPM) and the posterior medial thalamus (POm) in awake mice. These are the first- and higher-order thalamic nuclei of the whisker system, respectively. VPM neurons robustly responded to both active and passive whisker deflections, while POm neurons showed a preference for passive deflections and responded poorly to active touches. This response disparity could not be explained by stimulus kinematics and only in part by the animal’s voluntary whisking state. In contrast, cortical activity significantly influenced POm’s responses to passive touch. Inhibition of the barrel cortex strongly attenuated whisker responses in POm and simultaneously increased the whisking phase coding. This suggests that POm receives touch information from the cortex which strongly adapts and is gated by rare events. Together, these findings suggest two thalamic relay streams, where VPM robustly relays both active and passive deflection, while POm’s sensitivity requires top-down cortical involvement to signal salient events such as unexpected deflections, originating in the environment.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003065">Extreme diversity of phage amplification rates and phage–antibiotic interactions revealed by PHORCE</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yuval Mulla, Janina Müller, Denny Trimcev, Tobias Bollenbach</p>

Growth rate plays a fundamental role in microbiology and serves as an important proxy for fitness in evolution. While high-throughput measurements of bacterial growth rates are easily performed in any microbiology laboratory, similar methods are lacking for bacteriophages. This gap hinders systematic comparisons of important phage phenotypes, such as their amplification rate in bacterial populations and their bactericidal effect, across different phages and environmental conditions. Here, we show that the amplification rate of lytic phages can be quantified by analyzing bacterial population growth and collapse dynamics under phage predation using a parsimonious mathematical model – an approach termed Phage-Host Observation for Rate estimation from Collapse Events (PHORCE). We found that the resulting phage amplification rate captures the bactericidal effect independent of initial phage and bacterial population sizes for fast-growing hosts and adsorption-limited phages. Using high-throughput PHORCE, we found that the amplification rates of <i>Escherichia coli</i> phages vary widely by more than three orders of magnitude. Furthermore, our approach suggests that phage–antibiotic interactions are predominantly determined by the antibiotic, and not by the phage. In particular, the ribosome-inhibiting antibiotic doxycycline generally showed antagonism with phage amplification, whereas the DNA-damaging antibiotic nitrofurantoin was synergistic. This framework provides a means to quantitatively characterize phage phenotypes and may facilitate future high-throughput phage screens for antibacterial applications.

                <p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) and Alzheimer's disease are neurodegenerative diseases with age-related disability accumulation. In MS, inflammation spans decades, whereas AD is characterized by Aβ plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT). Few studies explore accumulation of amyloids in MS. We examined Aβ deposition and NFT density in temporal and frontal cortices from postmortem MS (<i>n</i> = 75) and control (<i>n</i> = 66) cases. Compared with controls, MS cases showed reduced Aβ, especially in those aged &lt;65 years, and reduced NFT, notably in cases aged &gt;65 years. Aβ deposition predicted greater NFT density both in MS cases and controls. MS-related factors may affect Aβ/NFT deposition and/or clearance, offering new therapeutic insights for both diseases.

<p>We use maternal separation in early life to investigate the effects of early life stress in male and female offspring.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Early life stress exposure exerts detrimental effects in adulthood and is a risk factor for psychiatric disorders. Studies addressing the molecular mechanisms of early life stress have primarily focused on hormones and stress circuits. However, little is known on how mitochondria and mitochondrial dynamics (i.e., the orchestration of mitochondrial fission, fusion, mitophagy, and biogenesis) modulate early life stress responses. Here, we used a maternal separation with early weaning (MSEW) paradigm to investigate the behavioral and molecular early life stress-elicited effects in male and female C57BL/6 mice in adulthood. We first applied a behavioral test battery to assess MSEW-driven, anxiety-related and stress-coping alterations. We then looked for MSEW-induced, mitochondria-centered changes in cingulate cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum, as well as in plasma by combining protein, mRNA, mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNAcn) and metabolomics analyses. We found that MSEW mice are more anxious, show decreased antioxidant capacity in the cingulate cortex and have higher mRNA levels of the fission regulator <i>Fis1</i> and the mitophagy activator <i>Pink1</i> in the hippocampus, indicating a shift towards mitochondrial degradation. Hippocampal mRNA level alterations of apoptotic markers further suggest an MSEW-driven activation of apoptosis accompanied by a dysregulation of purine catabolism in the cerebellum in MSEW mice. Sex-specific analysis revealed distinct MSEW-induced changes in male and female mice at the molecular level. Our work reveals a previously unexplored role of mitochondrial dynamics in regulating early life stress effects and highlights a mitochondria-centered dysregulation as a persistent outcome of early life stress in adulthood.</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Neuroinflammation is a hallmark of various neurodegenerative disorders, yet effective treatments remain limited. This study investigates the neuroprotective potential of a cannabidiol (CBD)-Rich <i>Cannabis sativa</i> L. (CS) extract in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neuroinflammation mouse model. The effects on anxiety-like behavior, cognitive function, and locomotor activity were assessed using behavioral tests (open field, elevated plus maze, novel object recognition, and Morris water maze). Antioxidant activity was measured by assaying glutathione (GSH) levels and lipid peroxidation by-products (TBARs). Anti-inflammatory properties were evaluated using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (QRt-PCR) for proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-α), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) mRNAs in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Astrocytic bioenergetics were analyzed using extracellular flux assays. Additionally, computational inference with a deep learning approach was conducted to evaluate the synergistic interactions among CS phytocompounds on the CB1 receptors. Compared with synthetic CBD, the CS extract (20.0 mg/kg) demonstrated superior efficacy in mitigating LPS-induced anxiety-like behavior, cognitive deficits, and locomotor impairments. It also significantly mitigated oxidative stress (increased GSH, reduced TBARs) and suppressed proinflammatory cytokines and GFAP mRNAs, indicating potent anti-inflammatory properties. The extract modulated CB1 receptor expression and preserved metabolic homeostasis in cortical astrocytes, preventing their shift from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation under neuroinflammatory conditions. Computational modeling highlighted conformational changes in CB1 receptor residues induced by Delta-9-THC that enhanced CBD binding. These findings underscore the potential of CS extract as a therapeutic candidate for managing neuroinflammation and its associated neurodegenerative consequences, warranting further clinical exploration.</p>

                Sotomayor-Gómez et al. analyze how neural ensembles in the visual cortex encode natural videos using spike sequences. Spike-timing relations provided a stable coding mechanism, in contrast to firing-rate codes that exhibited substantial drift. Thus, spike sequences enable robust and stable encoding of sensory information in high-dimensional neural populations.

                The role of tactile pathways in allodynia remains understudied. Upadhyay et al. show that the gracile nucleus (Gr) bidirectionally scales tactile sensitivity and becomes hyperexcitable after neuropathic injury. Reducing Gr output alleviates tactile hypersensitivity and affective pain behaviors, highlighting its role in touch-evoked pain (allodynia).

                Hockley et al. investigate how the brain processes auditory stimuli based on predictability. The results show that predictions in the medial prefrontal cortex govern sensory information flow and modulate prediction errors in the auditory cortex. Such data advance our understanding of hierarchical processing under the predictive coding framework.

                C9orf72 repeat expansion, a leading cause of ALS/FTD, triggers selective neuronal death. Using a Drosophila model, Shen et al. identified vulnerable and resistant neuronal populations. Resistance correlates with protein homeostasis pathways at baseline. Overexpression of Xbp1s, a key regulator, mitigates C9 toxicity, highlighting intrinsic neuronal states’ role in vulnerability.

This paper shows how PACT prevents aberrant PKR activation by endogenous dsRNAs like Alu. PACT disrupts PKR’s dsRNA scanning without blocking its binding, resetting its activation threshold to tolerate cellular dsRNA and preserve homeostasis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100914">Coordinated regulation of chemotaxis and resistance to copper by CsoR in Pseudomonas putida</a></h4>

              
                Copper is an essential enzyme cofactor in bacteria, but excess copper is highly toxic. Bacteria can cope with copper stress by increasing copper resistance and initiating chemorepellent response. However, it remains unclear how bacteria coordinate chemotaxis and resistance to copper. By screening proteins that interacted with the chemotaxis kinase CheA, we identified a copper-binding repressor CsoR that interacted with CheA in <i>Pseudomonas putida</i>. CsoR interacted with the HPT (P1), Dimer (P3), and HATPase_c (P4) domains of CheA and inhibited CheA autophosphorylation, resulting in decreased chemotaxis. The copper-binding of CsoR weakened its interaction with CheA, which relieved the inhibition of chemotaxis by CsoR. In addition, CsoR bound to the promoter of copper-resistance genes to inhibit gene expression, and copper-binding released CsoR from the promoter, leading to increased gene expression and copper resistance. <i>P. putida</i> cells exhibited a chemorepellent response to copper in a CheA-dependent manner, and CsoR inhibited the chemorepellent response to copper. Besides, the CheA-CsoR interaction also existed in proteins from several other bacterial species. Our results revealed a mechanism by which bacteria coordinately regulated chemotaxis and resistance to copper by CsoR.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98023">Dynamics of compartment-specific proteomic landscapes of hepatotoxic and cholestatic models of liver fibrosis</a></h4>

              
                Accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) in liver fibrosis is associated with changes in protein abundance and composition depending upon etiology of the underlying liver disease. Current efforts to unravel etiology-specific mechanisms and pharmacological targets rely on several models of experimental fibrosis. Here, we characterize and compare dynamics of hepatic proteome remodeling during fibrosis development and spontaneous healing in experimental mouse models of hepatotoxic (carbon tetrachloride [CCl<sub>4</sub>] intoxication) and cholestatic (3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine [DDC] feeding) injury. Using detergent-based tissue extraction and mass spectrometry, we identified compartment-specific changes in the liver proteome with detailed attention to ECM composition and changes in protein solubility. Our analysis revealed distinct time-resolved CCl<sub>4</sub> and DDC signatures, with identified signaling pathways suggesting limited healing and a potential for carcinogenesis associated with cholestasis. Correlation of protein abundance profiles with fibrous deposits revealed extracellular chaperone clusterin with implicated role in fibrosis resolution. Dynamics of clusterin expression was validated in the context of human liver fibrosis. Atomic force microscopy of fibrotic livers complemented proteomics with profiles of disease-associated changes in local liver tissue mechanics. This study determined compartment-specific proteomic landscapes of liver fibrosis and delineated etiology-specific ECM components, providing thus a foundation for future antifibrotic therapies.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101606">Sex-dependent gastrointestinal colonization resistance to MRSA is microbiota and Th17 dependent</a></h4>

              
                Gastrointestinal (GI) colonization by methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (MRSA) is associated with a high risk of transmission and invasive disease in vulnerable populations. The immune and microbial factors that permit GI colonization remain unknown. Male sex is correlated with enhanced <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> nasal carriage, skin and soft tissue infections, and bacterial sepsis. Here, we established a mouse model of sexual dimorphism during GI colonization by MRSA. Our results show that in contrast to male mice that were susceptible to persistent colonization, female mice rapidly cleared MRSA from the GI tract following oral inoculation in a manner dependent on the gut microbiota. This colonization resistance displayed by female mice was mediated by an increase in IL-17A+ CD4+ T cells (Th17) and dependent on neutrophils. Ovariectomy of female mice increased MRSA burden, but gonadal female mice that have the Y chromosome retained enhanced Th17 responses and colonization resistance. Our study reveals a novel intersection between sex and gut microbiota underlying colonization resistance against a major widespread pathogen.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98899">Connecting the dots: Managing species interaction networks to mitigate the impacts of global change</a></h4>

              
                Global change is causing unprecedented degradation of the Earth’s biological systems and thus undermining human prosperity. Past practices have focused either on monitoring biodiversity decline or mitigating ecosystem services degradation. Missing, but critically needed, are management approaches that monitor and restore species interaction networks, thus bridging existing practices. Our overall aim here is to lay the foundations of a framework for developing network management, defined here as the study, monitoring, and management of species interaction networks. We review theory and empirical evidence demonstrating the importance of species interaction networks for the provisioning of ecosystem services, how human impacts on those networks lead to network rewiring that underlies ecosystem service degradation, and then turn to case studies showing how network management has effectively mitigated such effects or aided in network restoration. We also examine how emerging technologies for data acquisition and analysis are providing new opportunities for monitoring species interactions and discuss the opportunities and challenges of developing effective network management. In summary, we propose that network management provides key mechanistic knowledge on ecosystem degradation that links species- to ecosystem-level responses to global change, and that emerging technological tools offer the opportunity to accelerate its widespread adoption.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98166">Transcriptome-wide identification of 5-methylcytosine by deaminase and reader protein-assisted sequencing</a></h4>

              
                5-Methylcytosine (m<sup>5</sup>C) is one of the posttranscriptional modifications in mRNA and is involved in the pathogenesis of various diseases. However, the capacity of existing assays for accurately and comprehensively transcriptome-wide m<sup>5</sup>C mapping still needs improvement. Here, we develop a detection method named DRAM (deaminase and reader protein assisted RNA methylation analysis), in which deaminases (APOBEC1 and TadA-8e) are fused with m<sup>5</sup>C reader proteins (ALYREF and YBX1) to identify the m<sup>5</sup>C sites through deamination events neighboring the methylation sites. This antibody-free and bisulfite-free approach provides transcriptome-wide editing regions which are highly overlapped with the publicly available bisulfite-sequencing (BS-seq) datasets and allows for a more stable and comprehensive identification of the m<sup>5</sup>C loci. In addition, DRAM system even supports ultralow input RNA (10 ng). We anticipate that the DRAM system could pave the way for uncovering further biological functions of m<sup>5</sup>C modifications.

">Cardiorespiratory fitness and cardiometabolic health are associated with distinct cognitive domains in cognitively healthy older adults.</a></h4>

              
                Background: Aging is associated with progressive cognitive decline, as well as increased prevalence of cardiometabolic risk factors and reduced cardiorespiratory fitness. In fact, reduced cardiometabolic health and cardiorespiratory fitness are both associated with a decline in cognitive functioning. This study examines the common and distinct contributions of these cardiovascular health factors on cognitive variability across different domains in cognitively healthy older adults. Methods and Results: We apply structural equation modelling (SEM) to model cross-sectional relationships between cardiometabolic health, cardiorespiratory fitness and performance across multiple cognitive domains in an age-restricted sample of healthy older adults from the ACTIVate Study (n=345; 60-70 yrs). Participants completed a series of cognitive and clinical assessments (including brachial blood pressure, heart rate, blood-based metabolic markers). We designed a cognitive model (Model 1) with four latent factors that are differentially impacted by aging (Processing Speed, Executive Function, Verbal Memory and Crystallized Ability) and used it to test effects on cognition of two theory-driven dimensions of cardiovascular health: Cardiorespiratory Fitness (Model 2) and Cardiometabolic Health (Model 3). Model 4 included both predictors and examined their joint and distinct effects on these cognitive domains. When controlling for their joint variance, Cardiometabolic Health and Cardiorespiratory Fitness showed evidence consistent with a double dissociation on cognitive domains. Specifically, cardiorespiratory fitness significantly predicted processing speed (r=0.28, p<0.05) and executive function (r=0.66, p<0.05), but not verbal memory and crystallized ability. In contrast, cardiometabolic health predicted crystallized ability (r=0.31, p<0.05) and verbal memory (r=0.28, p<0.05), but not executive function and processing speed. Conclusions: This study shows the first evidence that cardiorespiratory fitness and cardiometabolic health are associated with distinct cognitive domains in a large cross-sectional, age-restricted and high functioning cohort. These findings emphasize the importance of healthy aging approaches that target both health literacy and lifestyle behaviors to promote functional capacity across the lifespan.

">Epigenetic memory astrocytes are likely an artifact of immune cell contamination</a></h4>

              
                Innate immune memory, in which prior immune stimuli can "train" certain immune cells to respond more aggressively to subsequent challenges, is crucial for immune system plasticity in disease. Lee et al. [1] recently described a similar kind of immune memory state in astrocytes which they termed "epigenetic memory astrocytes". The discovery of astrocytes with immune memory could have tremendous importance in understanding and treating neurological disease. However, the RNA-seq data and in vitro experiments presented by Lee et al. to claim astrocytes possess pro-inflammatory immune memory show signs of immune cell contamination. Further, astrocyte-specific knockout of Ep300, the purported epigenetic regulator of this memory, did not reduce expression of any memory astrocyte signature genes. The FIND-seq signature used to verify the presence of epigenetic memory astrocytes in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) also shows signs of immune cell contamination, and the cells identified as memory astrocytes in previously published EAE single-cell RNA-seq data are misannotated macrophages. Lastly, we find the purported epigenetic memory astrocytes identified in single-nucleus RNA-seq data of multiple sclerosis (MS) tissue are an artifact of ambient RNA, low quality nuclei, and non-astrocyte contamination. We conclude that the epigenetic memory astrocyte signature is likely driven by immune cell contamination and the existence of astrocyte immunological memory is insufficiently evidenced. We caution that astrocyte transcriptomic, epigenomic, and functional assays must take care to exclude contamination by immune cells, especially when evaluating the potential of astrocytes to perform immunological functions.

">The role of the right language network and the multiple-demand network in verbal semantics: Insights from an Activation Likelihood Estimation Meta-analysis of 561 Functional Neuroimaging Studies</a></h4>

              
                Language processing has been traditionally associated with a network of fronto-parietal and temporal regions in the left hemisphere. Nevertheless, the 'right language network' (frontal, temporal, and parietal regions homologous to the left language network) and the 'Multiple-Demand Network' (MDN) are often involved in verbal semantic processing as well, however their role remain poorly understood. This is in part due to the inconsistent engagement of these latter two networks across linguistic tasks. To explore the factors driving networks recruitment of right language network and MDN during verbal semantic processing, we conducted a large-scale Activation Likelihood Estimation meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies. We examined whether the right language network is influenced by verbal stimulus type (sentences/narratives versus single words/word pairs) and whether this may be due to differences in semantic control demands and/or the presence of social content in the stimuli. Additionally, we investigated whether MDN recruitment depends on external task demands rather than semantic control demands. Our main findings revealed greater engagement of the right language network during semantic processing of sentence/narrative stimuli, with distinct regions reflecting different functions: increased semantic control demands recruit the right inferior frontal gyrus. Instead, social content processing during a semantic task engages the right Anterior Temporal Lobe, as well as the right posterior middle temporal gyrus. Finally, semantic processing engages the MDN, but only when external task (rather than semantic) demands increase.

">Atypical Alpha Oscillatory EEG Dynamics in Children with Angelman Syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Objectives: Biomarkers of atypical brain development are crucial for advancing clinical trials and guiding therapeutic interventions in Angelman syndrome (AS). Electroencephalography (EEG) captures well-characterized developmental changes in peak alpha frequency (PAF) that reflect underlying neural circuit maturation and may provide a sensitive metric for mapping atypical neural trajectories in AS. Method: We analyzed EEG recordings from 159 children with AS (ages 1 to 15 years) and 185 age-matched typically developing (TD) controls. PAF was quantified using a well-established curve-fitting method applied to 1/f-corrected power spectra. To validate robustness, we further evaluated PAF using an alternative prominence-based peak detection approach across varying detection thresholds. Results: Significant disruptions in PAF were evident in children with AS. While over 90% of EEGs from TD children exhibited a clear alpha peak, fewer than 50% of EEGs from children with AS showed a detectable PAF. Furthermore, when PAF was present, its frequency was significantly lower in AS children and did not show the typical age-related increases observed in TD children. Validation analyses confirmed consistently lower rates of PAF detection in AS across varying sensitivity thresholds, demonstrating the robustness of these results. Conclusions: PAF is a robust and developmentally sensitive marker of disrupted neural maturation in children with Angelman syndrome. As a quantifiable and sensitive measure of neural disruptions in AS, PAF has the potential to complement and enhance existing clinical trial outcome assessments by providing an objective index of underlying brain function. Future analyses will explore individual differences related to PAF in AS, to better understand mechanistic insights to guide targeted therapeutic strategies.

">The Physiological Component of the BOLD Signal: Impact of Age and Heart Rate Variability Biofeedback Training</a></h4>

              
                Aging is associated with declines in autonomic nervous system (ANS) function, including reduced heart rate variability (HRV), impaired neurovascular coupling, and diminished cerebrovascular responsiveness: factors that may contribute to cognitive decline and neurodegenerative diseases. Understanding how aging alters physiological signal integration in the brain is crucial for identifying potential interventions to promote brain health. This study examines age-related differences in how cardiac and respiratory fluctuations influence the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal, using two independent resting-state fMRI datasets with concurrent physiological recordings from younger and older adults. Our findings reveal significant age-related reductions in the percent variance of the BOLD signal explained by heart rate (HR), respiratory variation (RV), and end-tidal CO2, particularly in regions involved in autonomic regulation, including the orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, insula, basal ganglia, and white matter. Cross-correlation analysis also revealed that younger adults exhibited stronger HR-BOLD coupling in white matter, as well as a more rapid BOLD response to RV and CO2 in gray matter. Additionally, we investigated the effects of heart rate variability biofeedback (HRV-BF) training, a non-invasive intervention designed to modulate heart rate oscillations. The intervention altered physiological-BOLD coupling in an age- and training-dependent manner: older adults who underwent HRV-BF to enhance HR oscillations exhibited a shift toward younger-like HR-BOLD coupling patterns, while younger adults who trained to suppress HR oscillations showed increased CO2-BOLD coupling. These findings suggest that HRV-BF may help mitigate age-related declines in autonomic or cerebrovascular function. Overall, this study underscores the role of physiological dynamics in brain aging and highlights the importance of considering autonomic function when interpreting BOLD signals. By demonstrating that HRV-BF can modulate physiological-BOLD interactions, our findings suggest a potential pathway for enhancing cerebrovascular function and preserving brain health across the lifespan.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Creativity neuroscience has consistently reported increased functional connectivity between the default mode network and the executive control network supports creative cognition, potentially reflecting coordination of generative and evaluative cognitive processes. However, evidence has been purely correlational—no causal demonstrations show that default mode network–executive control network interaction specifically drives creative performance. We sought causal evidence for default mode network–executive control network coupling in creative thinking using functional near-infrared spectroscopy–brain connectivity neurofeedback, which can endogenously modify functional connectivity through reinforcement learning. Importantly, we employed covert neurofeedback, where participants were unaware of the specific brain activity being trained, allowing for unbiased evaluation of cognitive and neural impacts. In a default-executive neurofeedback condition (<span style="font-style:italic;">n</span> = 15), we entrained coupling between the medial prefrontal cortex and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, hubs of the default mode network and executive control network, respectively. We compared this with a default-motor condition (<span style="font-style:italic;">n</span> = 15), entraining coupling between the medial prefrontal cortex and the supplementary motor area. Approximately 24 h later, default-executive neurofeedback led to increased coupling between the default mode network and the executive control network during a creative thinking task (generating creative object uses), extending to broader default mode network regions. Behaviorally, we observed a double dissociation: The default–executive condition increased idea originality, while the default-motor condition improved go/no-go reaction times. We thus provide the first evidence that default mode network–executive control network coupling causally enhances creative performance.</span>

The efficiency of this intracellular information transfer also powerfully shapes stimulus representations in sensory cortices.

This information is largely lost during action potential generation but can be rapidly (&lt;20 ms) recovered using complementary information in local populations in a cell-type-specific manner. These results show that as sensory information is transferred from one neural locus to another, the circuits reconstruct the stimulus with high fidelity so that sensory representations of single neurons faithfully represent the stimulus in the periphery, but only in their postsynaptic potentials, resulting in lossless information processing for the sense of touch in the primary somatosensory cortex.</span>

Behaviorally, there were no significant differences in deception proportions between the self-deception and nonself-deception conditions under egoistic or mixed motivations. However, under altruistic motivation, participants in the self-deception condition engaged in more deceptive behavior compared to those in the nonself-deception condition. Event-related potential results revealed no significant differences in P2 and N2 amplitudes between the self-deception and nonself-deception conditions under egoistic or mixed motivations.

                Abstract Risk management has become a foundational aspect in numerous industries, propelling the implementation of machine learning technologies for impact assessment, prevention, and decision-making processes. Nevertheless, lacunae in the extant literature persist, particularly with regard to the identification of emergent trends and transversal applications. This study addresses this limitation through a bibliometric analysis of scientific production in Scopus and Web of Science, adhering to the PRISMA-2020 declaration. The findings reveal a substantial growth in publications on machine learning applied to risk management, with an increase of 98.99% between 2018 and 2023. China, South Korea, and the United States are identified as the primary research-producing countries. The analysis also identifies emerging trends, such as the application of machine learning in the evaluation of urban trees and the management of risks associated with the pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2). Key terms include random forest, support vector machines (SVM), and credit risk assessment, while terms such as prediction, postpartum depression, big data, and security emerge as new areas of study. Furthermore, there is a transition from traditional approaches such as stacking to advanced deep learning and feature selection techniques, reflecting the evolution of the discipline.

                Background There is urgent need for comprehensive climate change policies to mitigate impacts and protect the interests of those most vulnerable to its worst effects. The Labour Government has rejected its own 2021 £28bn annual investment in climate change policies on account of commitment to economic restraint and public opinion. Not only does this pose real risks to the UK’s ability to respond to climate change, it may also reduce a range of social and economic benefits. Methods We report findings of innovative mixed-methods survey analysis of public perceptions of an illustrative Green New Deal within three surveys (1) n=693; 2) n=10; 3) n=2,200) of adult UK residents conducted between November 2023-January 2024. Results We analyse the findings of survey 3 to show that levels of support for a Green New Deal are high across parties and demographic groups, and increase further when voters are presented with narrative justifications adversarially co-produced with opponents – termed ‘haters’ – of the policy. We find clear associations between risk of destitution and various other socioeconomic characteristics, health status and levels of support. We present innovative Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) of these associations and find moderately strong positive correlations with levels of support for key infrastructural policies. Conclusions This article presents further evidence in support of the notion that exposure to risk of destitution, which varies by age, is a key determinant of policy preference at a time in which political affiliation is increasingly fluid and the prima facie need for a Green New Deal is considerable. This suggests that, in order to understand preferences and to present responses to challenges, there is good reason to focus on material outcomes. Given the importance of a Green New Deal to enhancing financial security, progressive politicians have every reason to commit to substantive reform.

                Background Student-staff partnership (SSP) in higher education (HE) is rooted in democratic education and critical pedagogy, advocating for active student engagement. While widely recognised for fostering student success, SSP initiatives vary in definition, implementation, and impact. In Ireland, national policy has positioned SSP as central to student engagement, yet there is limited synthesis of the contextual factors and mechanisms influencing its success. Existing literature highlights benefits such as increased engagement and enhanced learning but often overlooks challenges, including power dynamics, resistance to change, and inconsistent institutional commitment. Aim This protocol outlines the methodology for a realist review, forming the first stage of a broader realist inquiry into SSP initiatives. The review will synthesise existing evidence to understand how, why, and in what contexts SSP initiatives succeed or face challenges in HE. Specifically, it will identify the contextual factors, mindsets, and engagement strategies that enable meaningful partnerships, as well as mechanisms for overcoming barriers. The review will generate initial programme theories (IPTs) to inform a subsequent realist evaluation within University College Dublin (UCD). Method A realist review methodology will be used to explore the interactions between context, mechanisms, and outcomes in SSP initiatives. The study will follow a five-stage realist review process: scoping the literature, developing IPTs, systematically reviewing evidence, synthesising findings, and refining theories with expert input. The Context-Mechanism-Outcome Configuration (CMOC) framework will guide the analysis. Conclusion This protocol sets out the approach for developing evidence-informed programme theories on SSP. These theories will underpin a subsequent realist evaluation within UCD to refine SSP implementation strategies. Findings will inform institutional strategies, policy development, and academic practice, with dissemination through academic and practitioner-focused outputs.

                Background To evaluate the NETosis biomarkers citrullinated histone H3 (citH3), neutrophil elastase (ELA), calprotectin (CALPRO), and myeloperoxidase (MPO) as indicators of inflammation in the severe stages of periodontitis III and IV in both (smokers and nonsmokers) patients, and to determine the correlation between NETosis biomarkers and clinical periodontal parameters. Methods This study recruited male subjects with an age range of (20-60) years; 60 were stage III and stage IV periodontitis patients, 30 were cigarette smoker, and 30 were nonsmokers. After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria to evaluate their eligibility for recruitment, 25 control subjects with a healthy periodontal status and good oral hygiene maintenance were included. Unstimulated saliva was obtained and evaluated using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and the following periodontal parameters were documented: [plaque index, bleeding on probing, periodontal pocket depth, and clinical attachment loss]. Results The mean levels of all salivary NETosis biomarkers citH3, ELA, CALPRO, and MPO were elevated in the periodontitis groups (smokers and nonsmokers) than in controls. Moreover, the mean NETosis biomarker‘s mean levels were significantly higher in smoker than in nonsmokers. In addition, the correlations were significant between CALPRO and CitH3 in smokers and between ELA and CitH3 in nonsmokers. Conclusions The results of this study showed that the chosen salivary biomarkers of NETosis revealed elevated clinical accuracy in differentiating the studied periodontitis groups (smokers and nonsmokers) from controls. In addition, cigarette smoking increases the risk of periodontitis, and neutrophils in smokers with periodontitis exhibited more susceptibility to form neutrophil extracellular traps when compared with nonsmokers.

Metabolites acting as substrates and regulators of all biochemical reactions play an important role in maintaining the functionality of cellular metabolism. Despite advances in the constraint-based framework for metabolic modeling at a genome-scale, we lack reliable proxies for metabolite concentrations that can be efficiently determined and that allows us to investigate the relationship between concentrations of metabolites in specified metabolic states in the absence of measurements. Here, we introduce a constraint-based approach, the flux-sum coupling analysis (FSCA), which facilitates the study of the interdependencies between metabolite concentrations by determining coupling relationships based on the flux-sum of metabolites. Application of FSCA on metabolic models of <i>Escherichia coli</i>, <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, and <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> showed that the three coupling relations are present in all models and pinpointed similarities in coupled metabolite pairs. Using the available concentration measurements of <i>E. coli</i> metabolites, we demonstrated that the coupling relationships identified by FSCA can capture the qualitative associations between metabolite concentrations and that flux-sum is a reliable proxy for metabolite concentration. Therefore, FSCA provides a novel tool for exploring and understanding the intricate interdependencies between the concentration of metabolites, advancing the understanding of metabolic regulation, and improving flux-centered systems biology approaches.

                <p>by Yuanxi Li, Bing Zhang, Jinqi Liu, Rubin Wang</p>

Numerous experiments have found that the behavioral characteristics of major depressive disorder (MDD) animals are usually associated with abnormal neural activity patterns and brain energy metabolism. However, the relationship among the behavioral characteristics, neural activity patterns and brain energy metabolism remains unknown. In this paper, we computationally investigated this relationship, especially studied how neural energy coding patterns changed in MDD brains, in the VTA-NAc-mPFC dopaminergic pathway of the reward system based on our biological neural network model and neural energy calculation model. Interestingly, our results suggested that the neural energy consumption of the whole VTA-NAc-mPFC microcircuit in MDD group was significantly reduced, which was mainly attributed to the decreasing neural energy consumption in the mPFC region. This observation theoretically supported the view of low-level energy consumption in MDD. We also investigated the neural energy consumption patterns of various neuronal types in our VTA-NAc-mPFC microcircuit under the influence of different dopamine concentrations, and found that there were some specific impairments in MDD, which provided some potential biomarkers for MDD diagnosis. More specifically, we found that the actual neural energy consumption of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the NAc region was increased in the MDD group, whereas pyramidal neurons in the mPFC region exhibited higher actual neural energy consumption in the NC group. Additionally, in both neuron types, the actual neural energy required to generate an action potential was higher in the MDD group, suggesting that, given the same energy budget, these neurons in the MDD group tended to generate fewer action potentials. To further explore the relationship between neural coding patterns and neural energy coding patterns in the VTA-NAc-mPFC microcircuit, we in addition calculated P-V correlation for each neuronal types, defined as the Pearson’s correlation coefficient between membrane potential and neural power. The results showed that the membrane potential and neural power were not perfectly correlated (P-V correlations were ranged from 0.6 to 0.9), and dopamine concentration inputs affected the P-V correlations of the MSN, pyramidal neurons and CB interneurons in the mPFC region. It suggested that the joint application of the neural coding theory and neural energy coding theory will be superior to the application of any single theory, and this joint application could help discovery new mechanisms in neurocircuits of MDD. Overall, our study not only uncovered the neural energy coding patterns for the VTA-NAc-mPFC neural microcircuit, but also presented a novel pipeline for the study of MDD based on the neural coding theory and neural energy coding theory.

                <p>by Christopher J. Whyte, Eli J. Müller, Jaan Aru, Matthew Larkum, Yohan John, Brandon R. Munn, James M. Shine</p>

Contemporary models of perceptual awareness lack tractable neurobiological constraints. Inspired by recent cellular recordings in a mouse model of tactile threshold detection, we constructed a biophysical model of perceptual awareness that incorporated essential features of thalamocortical anatomy and cellular physiology. Our model reproduced, and mechanistically explains, the key <i>in vivo</i> neural and behavioural signatures of perceptual awareness in the mouse model, as well as the response to a set of causal perturbations. We generalised the same model (with identical parameters) to a more complex task – visual rivalry – and found that the same thalamic-mediated mechanism of perceptual awareness determined perceptual dominance. This led to the generation of a set of novel, and directly testable, electrophysiological predictions. Analyses of the model based on dynamical systems theory show that perceptual awareness in simulations of both threshold detection and visual rivalry arises from the emergent systems-level dynamics of thalamocortical loops.

                <p>by Atsushi Matsuda, Mohammad R K Mofrad</p>

The nuclear pore complex (NPC), a channel within the nuclear envelope filled with intrinsically disordered proteins, regulates the transport of macromolecules between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Recent studies have highlighted the NPC’s ability to adjust its diameter in response to the membrane tension, underscoring the importance of exploring how variations in pore size influence molecular transport through the NPC. In this study, we investigated the relationship between pore size and transport rate and proposed a mathematical model describing this connection. We began by theoretically analyzing how the pore size scales with the characteristic dimensions of the mesh-like structure within the pore. By introducing key assumptions about how the meshwork structure influences molecular diffusion, we derived a mathematical expression for the transport rate based on the size of the pore and the transported molecules. To validate our model, we conducted Brownian dynamics simulations using a coarse-grained representation of the NPC. These simulations, performed across a range of pore sizes, demonstrated strong agreement with our model’s predictions, confirming its accuracy and applicability. Our model is specifically tailored for small-to-medium-sized molecules, approximately 5 nanometers in size, making it relevant to a wide range of transcription factors and signaling molecules. It also extends to molecules with weak and transient interactions with FG-Nups, such as importin-<i>β</i>. By presenting this model formula, our study offers a quantitative framework for analyzing the effects of pore dilation on nucleocytoplasmic transport.

                <p>by Sara Javadzadeh, Aaron Adamson, Jonghun Park, Se-Young Jo, Yuan-Chun Ding, Mehrdad Bakhtiari, Vikas Bansal, Susan L. Neuhausen, Vineet Bafna</p>

Variable Number Tandem repeats (VNTRs) refer to repeating motifs of size greater than five bp. VNTRs are an important source of genetic variation, and have been associated with multiple Mendelian and complex phenotypes. However, the highly repetitive structures require reads to span the region for accurate genotyping. Pacific Biosciences HiFi sequencing spans large regions and is highly accurate but relatively expensive. Therefore, targeted sequencing approaches coupled with long-read sequencing have been proposed to improve efficiency and throughput. In this paper, we systematically explored the trade-off between targeted and whole genome HiFi sequencing for genotyping VNTRs. We curated a set of 10 , 787 gene-proximal (G-)VNTRs, and 48 phenotype-associated (P-)VNTRs of interest. Illumina reads only spanned 46% of the G-VNTRs and 71% of P-VNTRs, motivating the use of HiFi sequencing. We performed targeted sequencing with hybridization by designing custom probes for 9,999 VNTRs and sequenced 8 samples using HiFi and Illumina sequencing, followed by adVNTR genotyping. We compared these results against HiFi whole genome sequencing (WGS) data from 28 samples in the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium (HPRC). With the targeted approach only 4,091 (41%) G-VNTRs and only 4 (8%) of P-VNTRs were spanned with at least 15 reads. A smaller subset of 3,579 (36%) G-VNTRs had higher median coverage of at least 63 spanning reads. The spanning behavior was consistent across all 8 samples. Among 5,638 VNTRs with low-coverage ( < 15), 67% were located within GC-rich regions ( > 60%). In contrast, the 40X WGS HiFi dataset spanned 98% of all VNTRs and 49 (98%) of P-VNTRs with at least 15 spanning reads, albeit with lower coverage. Spanning reads were sufficient for accurate genotyping in both cases. Our findings demonstrate that targeted sequencing provides consistently high coverage for a small subset of low-GC VNTRs, but WGS is more effective for broad and sufficient sampling of a large number of VNTRs.

                <p>by Travis Carver Tune, Simon Sponberg</p>

Crossbridge binding, state transitions, and force in active muscle is dependent on the radial spacing between the myosin-containing thick filament and the actin-containing thin filament in the filament lattice. This radial spacing has been previously shown through spatially explicit modeling and experimental efforts to greatly affect quasi-static, isometric, force production in muscle. It has recently been suggested that this radial spacing might also be able to drive differences in mechanical function, or net work, under dynamic oscillations like those which occur in muscles <i>in vivo</i>. However, previous spatially explicit models either had no radial spacing dependence, meaning the radial spacing could not be investigated, or did include radial spacing dependence but could not reproduce <i>in vivo</i> net work during dynamic oscillations and only investigated isometric contractions. Here we show the first spatially explicit model to include radial crossbridge dependence which can produce mechanical function similar to real muscle. Using this spatially explicit model of a half sarcomere, we show that when oscillated at strain amplitudes and frequencies like those in the main flight muscles of the hawkmoth <i>Manduca sexta</i>, mechanical function (net work) does depend on the lattice spacing. In addition, since the trajectory of lattice spacing changes during dynamic oscillation can vary from organism to organism, we can prescribe a trajectory of lattice spacing changes in the spatially explicit half sarcomere model and investigate the extent to which the time course of lattice spacing changes can affect mechanical function. We simulated a half sarcomere undergoing dynamic oscillations and prescribed the Poisson’s ratio of the lattice to be either 0 (constant lattice spacing) or 0.5 (isovolumetric lattice spacing changes). We also simulated net work using lattice spacing data taken from <i>M. sexta</i> which has a variable Poisson’s ratio. Our simulation results indicate that the lattice spacing can change the mechanical function of muscle, and that in some cases a 1 nm difference can switch the net work of the half sarcomere model from positive (motor-like) to negative (brake-like).

                <p>by Laia Barjuan, Muhua Zheng, M Ángeles Serrano</p>

Anatomical connectivity between different brain regions can be mapped to a network representation, the connectome, where the intensities of the links, the weights, influence resilience and functional processes. Yet, many features associated with these weights are not fully understood, particularly their multiscale organization. In this paper, we elucidate the architecture of weights, including weak ties, in multiscale human brain connectomes reconstructed from empirical data. Our findings reveal multiscale self-similarity, including the ordering of weak ties, in every individual connectome and group representative. This phenomenon is captured by a renormalization technique based on a geometric network model that replicates the observed structure of connectomes across all length scales, using the same connectivity law and weighting function for both weak and strong ties. The observed symmetry represents a signature of criticality in the weighted connectivity of the human brain and raises important questions for future research, such as the existence of symmetry breaking at some scale or whether it is preserved in cases of neurodegeneration or psychiatric disorder.

                <p>by Liang Chen, Xinxing Wang, Hanxiao Liu, Chenzhao He, Allen P. F. Chen, Lu Chen, Thomas A. Kim, Qiaojie Xiong</p>

Auditory signal-cued behaviors rely on a sophisticated neural network. While extensive research has focused on auditory processing and decision-making, the neural circuits governing motor coordination for goal-directed actions remain poorly understood. The red nucleus (RN) is essential for motor coordination, whereas the zona incerta (ZI) plays a key role in modulating sensorimotor circuits. Using tetrode recordings and optogenetics, we investigated the ZI-RN circuit’s role in an auditory-cued decision task. RN neurons were preferentially activated when mice moved to the contralateral port for a reward, and optogenetic activation biased choices toward the contralateral side. Notably, parvalbumin-positive ZI neurons projected to the RN and negatively regulated movement coordination. These findings reveal an inhibitory ZI-RN circuit that shapes auditory-cued, goal-directed movement.

                <p>by Suma Chinta, Scott R. Pluta</p>

Active sensation requires the brain to interpret external stimuli against an ongoing estimate of body position. While internal estimates of body position are often ascribed to the cerebral cortex, we examined the midbrain superior colliculus (SC), due to its close relationship with the sensory periphery as well as higher, motor-related brain regions. Using high-density electrophysiology and movement tracking, we discovered that the on-going kinematics of whisker motion and locomotion speed accurately predict the firing rate of mouse SC neurons. Neural activity was best predicted by movements occurring either in the past, present, or future, indicating that the SC population continuously estimates a trajectory of self-motion. A combined representation of slow and fast whisking features predicted absolute whisker angle at high temporal resolution. Sensory reafference played at least a partial role in shaping this feature tuning. Taken together, these data indicate that the SC contains a joint representation of whisking and locomotor features that is potentially useful in guiding complex orienting movements involving the face and limbs.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003077">The SPFH complex HflK-HflC regulates aerobic respiration in bacteria</a></h4>

              
                <p>by María Isabel Pérez-López, Paul Lubrano, Georgia Angelidou, Sarah Hoch, Timo Glatter, Nicole Paczia, Hannes Link, Victor Sourjik</p>

The bacterial HflK-HflC membrane complex is a member of the highly conserved family of SPFH proteins, which are present in all domains of life and include eukaryotic stomatins, flotillins, and prohibitins. These proteins organize cell membranes and are involved in various processes. However, the exact physiological functions of most bacterial SPFH proteins remain unclear. Here, we report that the HflK-HflC complex in <i>Escherichia coli</i> is required for growth under high aeration. The absence of this complex causes a growth defect at high oxygen levels due to a reduced abundance of IspG, an essential iron-sulfur cluster enzyme in the isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway. This reduction might be related to lower stability of IspG and several other proteins, including the iron siderophore transporter TonB, in the absence of the HflK-HflC complex. Our results suggest that decreased IspG activity leads to lower levels of ubiquinone and misregulated expression of multiple respiratory enzymes, including cytochrome oxidases, and consequently reduced respiration and lower ATP levels. This impact of the <i>hflK hflC</i> deletion on aerobic respiration resembles the mitochondrial respiratory defects caused by the inactivation of prohibitins in mammalian and yeast cells, indicating functional parallels between these bacterial and eukaryotic SPFH proteins.

Research on bacteriophages, the viruses infecting bacteria, has fueled the development of modern molecular biology and inspired their therapeutic application to combat bacterial multidrug resistance. However, most work has so far focused on a few model phages which impedes direct applications of these findings in clinics and suggests that a vast potential of powerful molecular biology has remained untapped. We have therefore recently composed the BASEL collection of <i>Escherichia coli</i> phages (BActeriophage SElection for your Laboratory), which made a relevant diversity of phages infecting the <i>E. coli</i> K-12 laboratory strain accessible to the community. These phages are widely used, but their assorted diversity has remained limited by the <i>E. coli</i> K-12 host. We have therefore now genetically overcome the two major limitations of <i>E. coli</i> K-12, its lack of O-antigen glycans and the presence of resident bacterial immunity. Restoring O-antigen expression resulted in the isolation of diverse additional viral groups like <i>Kagunavirus</i>, <i>Nonanavirus</i>, <i>Gordonclarkvirinae</i>, and <i>Gamaleyavirus</i>, while eliminating all known antiviral defenses of <i>E. coli</i> K-12 additionally enabled us to isolate phages of <i>Wifcevirus</i> genus. Even though some of these viral groups appear to be common in nature, no phages from any of them had previously been isolated using <i>E. coli</i> laboratory strains, and they had thus remained largely understudied. Overall, 37 new phage isolates have been added to complete the BASEL collection. These phages were deeply characterized genomically and phenotypically with regard to host receptors, sensitivity to antiviral defense systems, and host range. These results highlighted dominant roles of the O-antigen barrier for viral host recognition and of restriction-modification systems in bacterial immunity. We anticipate that the completed BASEL collection will propel research on phage–host interactions and their molecular mechanisms, deepening our understanding of viral ecology and fostering innovations in biotechnology and antimicrobial therapy.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Despite substantial advancements in uncovering the genetic basis of Parkinson's disease (PD), a significant portion of cases characterized by familial PD remain genetically elusive. Here, we reported that biallelic variants in <i>EPG5</i>, a key autophagy gene responsible for Vici syndrome, are associated with PD.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed in the first cohort including 171 pedigrees with autosomal recessive PD (ARPD), 1,746 cases of sporadic early-onset PD (sEOPD, age at onset ≤ 50 years) and 1,652 healthy controls. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was performed in the second cohort consisting of 1,947 sporadic late-onset PD (sLOPD, age at onset &gt;50 years) and 2,478 healthy controls.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified 7 participants harboring compound heterozygous variants within the <i>EPG5</i> gene across 1 family with ARPD (ARPD-F1), 4 sporadic EOPD cases, and 1 sporadic LOPD individual. A total of 10 novel variants in <i>EPG5</i> were discovered in the 7 individuals, comprising 3 nonsense variants and 7 missense variants. The compound heterozygous variants in the <i>EPG5</i> gene led to decreased expression of EPG5 protein, and impaired autophagy-lysosome function in cells derived from <i>EPG5</i>-PD individuals. We also revealed several key pathological features, including abnormal accumulation of autophagic vacuoles, aggregation of α-synuclein in skin tissue from <i>EPG5</i>-PD individuals. In mice, EPG5 deficiency led to progressive dopaminergic neurodegeneration in the substantia nigra of the midbrain.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results unveil a novel association between biallelic variants in <i>EPG5</i> gene and PD, providing compelling initial evidence for the involvement of <i>EPG5</i> and autophagy dysregulation in the development of PD. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                This study examines how democratic values have been promoted through natural sciences education over the last 50 years, providing a comprehensive analysis based on a systematic review of relevant literature. The central problem addressed is understanding the role of natural science education in fostering democratic values such as equity, participation, critical thinking, and ethical responsibility. This research aims to identify and analyze strategies, methodologies, and transformative experiences that contribute to the promotion of democratic values. This study employs the PRISMA methodology to ensure a rigorous and structured systematic review. Data were collected from multiple databases using detailed Boolean equations. Tools such as ScientoPy and VOSviewer were used for data preprocessing, clustering, and network visualization, followed by qualitative analysis to categorize the findings. Educational programs in natural sciences have increasingly integrated democratic values, fostering a culture of inclusivity and participation; the incorporation of ICT has enhanced equity and participation, while civic education has been fundamental in developing critical and informed citizens; citizen science initiatives have empowered students to engage in democratic deliberation and address epistemic injustice; cooperative learning methods in science classes have effectively promoted gender equity and inclusion; and emphasis on sustainability and environmental justice in science education has promoted democratic values and empowered students to take action on global challenges. In conclusion, natural science education is an effective vehicle for promoting democratic values, but it is an understudied field. By integrating practices that emphasize inclusivity, critical thinking, and ethical responsibility, science education not only enhances students’ scientific understanding but also prepares them to be active, informed, and responsible citizens.

                Background: Inflammation is the key contributor to the development of atherosclerotic plague. This study aims to evaluate the protective and autophagy induction properties of pterostilbene and sitagliptin on modulating the degree of atherosclerosis in rabbit models treated with an atherogenic diet. Methods: 80 rabbits were randomly placed into one of four study groups (20 in each group): normal control diet (NC) fed normal diet for eight weeks, atherogenic control (AC) fed atherogenic diet for eight weeks, pterostilbene treated group (PT) fed atherogenic diet with pterostilbene (at 10 mg/kg/day) orally daily for eight weeks, and sitagliptin treated group (ST) fed atherogenic diet with sitagliptin (at 12 mg/kg/day) orally daily for eight weeks. Results: While serum lipids and F2-isoprostane were elevated significantly in the AC study cohort compared to NC study cohort, (P < 0.001), both pterostilbene and sitagliptin supplementations provided significant improvements in serum lipid parameters and F2-isoprostane in the PT study cohort and ST study cohort, respectively, when compared to the AC study cohort, (P<0.001). Total cholesterol, triglycerides and LDL levels were significantly reduced among the PT and ST study cohorts as compared to the AC study cohort. This was coupled with a significant rise in LC3B levels (marker of tissue autophagy) among the PT study cohort and the ST study cohort, as compared to the AC study cohort, (P < 0.001). The RNA expression of mTORC1 was reduced significantly at both PT study cohort and ST study cohort, (P<0.001). Pterostilbene supplementation induced a significant reduction in tissue expression of PI3K and AKT, (P<0.01), while sitagliptin induced significant reduction in 5’ adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) levels, (P<0.001). Conclusions: The results indicate that pterostilbene and/or sitagliptin supplementation can significantly improve the outcome of atherosclerosis due to their effects on the inflammatory pathways which hinder the progression of atherosclerotic plaque formation.

                Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused substantial morbidity and mortality on a global scale. A strong correlation has been found between COVID-19 treatment outcomes and noncommunicable diseases such as cancers. However, there is limited information on the outcomes of cancer patients who were hospitalised for COVID-19. Methods We conducted an analysis on data collected in a large prospective cohort study set-up by the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium (ISARIC). All patients with laboratory-confirmed or clinically-diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included. Cancer was defined as having a current solid organ or haematological malignancy. The following outcomes were assessed; 30-day in-hospital mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, length of hospitalization and receipt of higher-level care. Results Of the 560,547 hospitalised individuals who were analysed, 27,243 (4.9%) had cancer. Overall, cancer patients were older and had more comorbidities than non-cancer patients. Patients with cancer had higher 30-day in-hospital mortality than non-cancer patients (29.1.3% vs 18.0%) and longer hospital stays (median of 12 days vs 8 days). However, patients with cancer were admitted less often to intensive care units than non-cancer patients (12.6% vs 17.1%) and received less invasive mechanical ventilation than non-cancer patients (4.5% vs 7.6%). The hazard ratio of dying from cancer, adjusted for age, sex and country income level was 1.18 (95%CI: 1.15-1.2). Conclusions This study's findings underscore the heightened vulnerability of hospitalized COVID-19 patients with cancer, revealing a higher mortality rate, longer hospital stays, and an unstructured pattern of care that reflects the complexity of managing severely ill patients during a public health crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic.

                Background Nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), is a promising nutraceutical attracting much attention for its pharmacological and anti-aging efficacies. However, NMN-containing commercial products are very high-priced due to the lack of efficient and facile methods for industrial-scale production. To date, various metabolic engineering strategies have been successfully applied to produce NMN in Escherichia coli. Recently, Vibrio natriegens has become a promising host in the bioindustry thanks to its rapid growth and capabilities of broad substrate utilization. This study aims to evaluate the NMN biosynthesis capability of V. natriegens. Methods Firstly, a mutant V. natriegens strain (Δdns::araC-T7RNAP-KanR ΔpncC::FtnadE-SmR ΔnadR) was generated via multiplex genome editing by natural transformation (MuGENT). Nampt genes encoding nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase from Chitinophaga pinensis, Sphingopyxis sp. C-1, Haemophilus ducreyi, and Vibrio phage KVP40 were codon-optimized and cloned into pACYCDuet™-1 under the control of T7 promoter. The recombinant plasmids were electroporated into the mutant strain. The expression of recombinant NAMPTs in V. natriegens was evaluated by SDS-PAGE analysis and the intracellular NMN concentrations were quantified by HPLC. Results After two rounds of MuGENT, V. natriegens V54-33 strain (Δdns::araC-T7RNAP-KanR ΔpncC::FtnadE-SmR ΔnadR) was successfully generated. SDS-PAGE analysis demonstrated that all NAMPTs were strongly expressed in the V54-33 strain. HPLC analysis revealed that the highest intracellular NMN concentration was obtained with NAMPT from Chitinophaga pinensis (44.5 μM), followed by NAMPT from Vibrio phage KVP40 (23.3 μM). Conclusion This study demonstrated the feasibility of NMN biosynthesis in V. natriegens.

                Background Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most invasive liver cancer, with high incidence rates and resistance to chemotherapy. Polyphenols from red rice bran extract (RRBE) exert diverse anti-cancer effects on certain cancers. This study, for the first time, examined the suppressive effects of RRBE on proliferation, migration, and invasion in HepG2 cells with a preliminary investigation into how its inhibitory effects are linked to reversing the EMT process via the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Methods The anti-proliferative and cytotoxic effects of RRBE on HepG2 were determined by the resazurin cell viability assay. Its effects on the cell cycle distribution and the apoptosis induction in HepG2 cells were assessed by flow cytometry. Its ability to impede migration was tested using the scratch assay and the transwell migration assay. An initial study was conducted to explore the link between its inhibitory effect and the reversal of EMT via the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway using Western blot analysis. Polyphenols and flavonoids were quantified using the Folin-Ciocalteu assay and the aluminum chloride colorimetric assay, respectively. Results RRBE exhibited specific anti-proliferative and cytotoxic effects against HepG2 liver cancer cells compared to normal BNL CL2 liver cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. RRBE caused a halt in the progression of HepG2 cells at the G2/M phase, resulting in subsequent apoptosis with variations in DNA content. The non-toxic doses of RRBE fully blocked the invasive migration of HepG2 cells after 24 h of its exposure as opposed to the untreated cells. Moreover, E-cadherin protein levels in HepG2 cells dose-dependently increased after 48 h of RRBE exposure, while the levels of β-catenin, vimentin, and MMP-9 proteins dose-dependently decreased compared to their respective untreated cells. The results indicated that RRBE-treated HepG2 cells showed a transition to epithelial characteristics along with diminished malignant features. Preliminary findings from the analysis of these proteins suggest that the inhibitory effects of RRBE may be connected to reversing EMT by regulating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. The phytochemical analysis revealed that RRBE contained high levels of polyphenols and flavonoids. Conclusions Red rice bran polyphenols demonstrated anti-proliferative, anti-migratory, and anti-invasive effects, which are possibly through Wnt/β-catenin-driven EMT reversal.

                Abstract* Stroke remains a leading cause of mortality and long-term disability worldwide, necessitating innovative therapeutic strategies. The advent of nanotechnology, particularly oxygen-delivering nanobubbles (ODNBs), has introduced a promising avenue for enhancing stroke therapy. ODNBs have demonstrated the ability to improve oxygen delivery, enhance therapeutic efficacy, and provide diagnostic advantages through imaging contrast enhancement. However, challenges such as toxicity, off-target effects, and regulatory hurdles must be addressed before clinical translation. This review synthesizes the latest findings on ODNBs in stroke therapy, highlights their key benefits and challenges, and explores future applications, including gene therapy and brain tissue regeneration. By addressing these aspects, this review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the potential of ODNBs in revolutionizing stroke treatment.

                Background Individuals with fatalistic beliefs and lack of knowledge of healthy lifestyles tend to show conformism and resignation due to their state of health. Even individuals with fatalism consider that contracting a disease is divine punishment, and this is reflected when they perform unhealthy behaviours. The relationship between fatalistic beliefs, knowledge about diabetes risk factors, and perceived risk of T2DM in Mexican adults during the COVID-19 pandemic were evaluated. Objective The aim of this research was to examine the association between fatalistic beliefs, knowledge of T2DM risk factors, and perceived risk of T2DM among Mexican adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods The study design was cross-sectional and correlational. The sample size was 222 individuals between 30 and 70 years of age, from a rural community in Guanajuato, Mexico. We used the Multidimensional Fatalism Scale in Spanish, Risk Perception Survey for Developing Diabetes. For the correlation analysis, Spearman’s coefficient and multiple linear regression were used to explain the perceived risk of T2DM. Results The average age was 29.2 years (SD = 10.5), 55% were women, 52.3% were single, 36.2% had university studies and 57.3% were working. Perceived risk of T2DM was inversely related to fatalistic beliefs. Knowledge level was positively correlated to perceived risk of T2DM. In multiple linear regression, pessimism and divine control dimensions were the only predictors of perceived risk of T2DM. Conclusions In young adults, knowledge increases regarding perceived risk of T2DM. But the higher the fatalistic beliefs the lower the level of knowledge and the lower the perceived risk of T2DM.

                Background This study explores the complex relationship between organizational politics, emotional intelligence and employee behavior in contemporary settings. Organizational politics, which is widespread in organizational settings, has a substantial impact on different aspects of employee behavior. Emotional Intelligence has become a vital factor in individuals’ capacity to successfully traverse the complexities of an organization. This study consolidates current material to offer insights into the impact of organizational politics on employee behavior and the mediating role of emotional intelligence in this connection. Methods A survey was undertaken with a sample size of 500 employees hailing from several Information Technology (IT) and Information Technology Enabled Services (ITES) firms in the Dehradun (Uttarakhand) region. The study employed quantitative methodologies to investigate the correlations between Emotional Intelligence, Perceived Organizational Politics and Employee Behavior. The data were evaluated using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) to examine the hypothesized correlations and mediation effects. Results The study identified substantial correlations between Emotional Intelligence, Perceived Organizational Politics, and Employee Behavior. Emotional Intelligence was discovered to have a positive impact on Behavioral Dynamics. Perceived Organizational Politics had a substantial influence on both Emotional Intelligence and Behavioral Dynamics. Factors such as Need for Power, Relationship Conflict, Resource Constraints, Role Conflict, and Workforce Diversity were discovered to have an impact on Perceived Organizational Politics. Conclusions The results confirm strong connections between organizational politics, emotional intelligence, and employee behavior, highlighting the significance of these concepts in comprehending employee behavior in organizational environments. The study proposes that enhancing employees' emotional intelligence can alleviate the adverse effects of organizational politics, resulting in enhanced behavioral dynamics.

                Abstract* Background Currently, there is no objective and quantified measurement for detecting blood clots during extraction socket hemostasis. It has relied solely on clinical observation, even when conducting clinical research by using extraction sockets as samples. This study aimed to assess the in vitro reliability and clinical-relevant validity of a new objective measurement providing quantified data called blood clot detection (BCD) using a standard capillary tube. Methods The in vitro part of the study was conducted using surplus blood samples from ten healthy participants. Two identical sets of blood samples in simulation reservoirs mimicking bleeding sockets were prepared for reliability tests. Then, the capillary tubes were concurrently placed in the reservoirs. The blood-filled distances were measured. The part of clinical-relevant validity study was conducted in sixteen extraction sockets from each healthy participant. Clinical observation and BCD measurement were evaluated by two calibrated assessors. The total duration of the assessment was a 30-minute. Results The distances of the blood-filled capillary tube were decreased by time. Test and retest reliability analysis of the BCD measurement showed an excellent intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.980 (0.968 to 0.988). The medians of blood-filled distance categorized by clinical observation into active bleeding, sluggish oozing, and clot formation were 13.0 mm (Q1 = 11.7, Q3 = 13.8), 5.6 mm (Q1 = 4.3, Q3 = 7.0), and 0.9 mm (Q1 = 0.5, Q3 = 1.3), respectively. The blood-filled distance of the clot formation group was significantly less than the active bleeding and sluggish oozing (p<0.001). Therefore, the BCD measurement also significantly indicated the completion of extraction socket hemostasis Conclusions A distance of blood-filled in capillary tube of 0.9 mm from the BCD measurement significantly ensured complete clot formation. The BCD measurement proved to be a quantified tool for objectively measuring hemostasis of bleeding socket.

                Background of the study The influence of macroeconomic indicators makes it important to study the relationship between macroeconomic indicators and stock market return. On further analysis it can be observed that different sectors respond differently to change in the macroeconomic indicator that is important for investors, researchers and policy makers. Methods The autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model is applied to study influence of macroeconomic indicators on sectoral return of NSE from April 2012 to August 2024. Results Findings of the study show that macroeconomic indicators influence sectoral return in the short run as well as long run and the influence is differential. The analysis of long run relationship shows that Foreign Institutional Investment (FII) significantly affects all the sectoral indices except IT. Index of industrial production (IIP) have significant relationship with Auto, IT, Media, Metal and Pharma. Money supply (MS) significantly affects Bank, FMCG and IT in the long run. Wholesale Price Index (WPI) has significant relationship with Auto, FMCG and Media in the long run. Economic Policy Uncertainty Index (EPU) affects Auto, FMCG and Pharma in the long run. Crude oil price (COP) has significant effect only on Media in the long run. Exchange rate (ER) does not have significant effect on any of the sectoral index. Conclusion In the long run FII, IIP, EPU, MS and WIP are major determinants of stock market return. In the short run FII, ER and COP are major determinants of stock market return.

An assessment of hybrid versus gold open-access publishing models of medical journals on their impact [version 2; peer review: 2 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background Hybrid and gold open-access (OA) are common publishing models. The latter requires fees to allow full-text visibility, whereas hybrid journals offer the option to publish gold OA or for free (subscription-based) where users with access can get the full-text. We evaluated the impact of the publishing model and other factors on medical journals’ impact. Methods A sample of hybrid and gold OA medical journals indexed in Web of Science (WOS) and Scopus were included. The effect of the publishing model and other factors on journals’ impact factor (IF), CiteScore, quartile, and number of citations was assessed. Results 402 journals were included, 201 in each group. Hybrid and gold OA journals had a median age of 32 and 21 years, respectively (P<0.001). While gold OA journals had a slightly higher median IF (3.3 vs. 2.9; P=0.021), more hybrid journals had Q1 ranking in Scopus (57.7% vs. 43.8%; P=0.091). Publishing model, journal’s age, being of an organization/society, and EMBASE indexation didn’t affect IF, CiteScore, number of citations, and WOS quartile (P>0.05). However, gold OA model wasn’t significantly associated with Scopus Q1 ranking (OR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.25-0.94; P=0.032), indicating that hybrid journals were more likely to have such ranking. Conclusion These findings indicate that gold OA publishing doesn’t result in higher impact or journals ranking. Therefore, authors can continue to submit their work to high impact hybrid journals if their interest is getting published in reputable prestigious journals regardless of their publishing model. Gold OA journals are encouraged to reduce their fees to facilitate global research access.

                Background Diabetes remains a major health challenge in low- and middle-income countries like Uganda, where access to effective treatment is often limited. Avocado (Persea americana) has demonstrated antidiabetic potential in global preclinical studies, but research on its pharmacological benefits within Uganda’s healthcare context is scarce. This review synthesizes global evidence on avocado’s bioactive compounds and therapeutic effects, highlighting gaps that warrant further investigation. Methods A systematic search was conducted across PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science to identify peer-reviewed English-language studies on avocado’s antidiabetic properties. Eligible studies included preclinical models and intervention studies. This review adheres to PRISMA 2020 guidelines. Data extraction and quality assessment were performed independently by two reviewers. Of the 266 articles initially identified, 45 met the inclusion criteria. Results Avocado extracts significantly improve metabolic markers, with 30 studies reporting statistically significant reductions in blood glucose levels (p < 0.05). The bioactive compounds modulate key diabetes-related pathways, suggesting a multi-target therapeutic approach. However, most evidence originates from global research, with limited studies conducted in African populations or within Uganda’s healthcare setting. While toxicity assessments indicate a favorable safety profile, challenges such as standardization of extraction methods, dosage optimization, and clinical validation persist. Conclusion Avocado demonstrates strong antidiabetic potential, but region-specific research is essential to validate its efficacy and practical application in Uganda. Strengthening local research efforts could bridge the gap between global evidence and Uganda’s healthcare needs, facilitating its evidence-based integration into traditional and modern diabetes treatment strategies.

                Background Traditional optimization methods often struggle to balance global exploration and local refinement, particularly in complex real-world problems. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel hybrid optimization strategy that integrates the Nelder-Mead (NM) technique and the Genetic Algorithm (GA), named the Genetic and Nelder-Mead Algorithm (GANMA). This hybrid approach aims to enhance performance across various benchmark functions and parameter estimation tasks. Methods GANMA combines the global search capabilities of GA with the local refinement strength of NM. It is first tested on 15 benchmark functions commonly used to evaluate optimization strategies. The effectiveness of GANMA is also demonstrated through its application to parameter estimation problems, showcasing its practical utility in real-world scenarios. Results GANMA outperforms traditional optimization methods in terms of robustness, convergence speed, and solution quality. The hybrid algorithm excels across different function landscapes, including those with high dimensionality and multimodality, which are often encountered in real-world optimization issues. Additionally, GANMA improves model accuracy and interpretability in parameter estimation tasks, enhancing both model fitting and prediction. Conclusions GANMA proves to be a flexible and powerful optimization method suitable for both benchmark optimization and real-world parameter estimation challenges. Its capability to efficiently explore parameter spaces and refine solutions makes it a promising tool for scientific, engineering, and economic applications. GANMA offers a valuable solution for improving model performance and effectively handling complex optimization problems.

                Background We have little knowledge about the synchronous occurrence of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) and other types of histologic tumors. This association is very rare. Case presentation We describe a case of synchronous stromal tumor and adenocarcinoma of the left side colonic localization. Immunohistochemistry identified c-Kit expression. The discovery of colonic adenocarcinoma was on operative specimen after histologic examination. The patient underwent left oncologic colectomy with stoma. Follow-up at one year postoperatively did not detect tumor recurrence. Discussion Clinical implications of the association between these two neoplasms are not clearly described. Treatment depends on the the most aggressive histologic type or obviously highest stage. Knowledge of the genetic data of this association offers opportunity of treatment with the new targeted-therapy molecules. Surgical resection, may remain the curative treatment. Conclusions Synchronous adenocarcinoma and GIST has been more commonly described in the stomach.  The pathogeneses of tumorigenesis may not be the same for the two tumors. More studies seem be necessary to clarify a potential role of different genes in the development of adenocarcinomas. And therefore, above all their therapeutic implications.

                Objective The main purpose of this study was to explore experiences of women who survived pre-eclampsia and eclampsia in Shashemene referral hospital and Melka Oda general hospital, 2021. Design An institution-based exploratory qualitative study with a descriptive phenomenological study design Setting The present study was conducted in Shashemene referral hospital and Melka Oda general hospital from March 03 to May 18, 2021. Participants A total of 17 individual in-depth interviews (IDIs) were conducted with women who experienced and survived pre-eclampsia and eclampsia. Data were analyzed through thematic analysis using Atlas-ti software. Result The present study revealed that women’s level of awareness on raised blood pressure and or convulsion occurring during pregnancy was poor. Barriers that limit pregnant women from getting treatment at the earliest point included misconception, lack of insight, failure to accept counseling from health care providers, low income, and influence from husbands. Discussions with the women in this study showed that these mothers were not counseled on danger signs during antenatal care check-ups. Almost all of the women were very concerned and frustrated due to their diagnosis. Conclusions Women’s awareness of pre-eclampsia and eclampsia was poor. Improving awareness of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy and enhancing the quality of antenatal care is essential.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-403/v1?src=rss">Correlation of transcutaneous and serum bilirubin levels in late preterm and term neonates at a tertiary care center in south India [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Neonatal jaundice is one of the most prevalent condition during first week of life causing morbidity and even mortality in few, especially in low – middle income countries. Although visual inspection for jaundice has been a time tested method, serum bilirubin is the gold standard investigation of choice. Due to this newborn receive many heel or vein pricks for testing, hence transcutaneous bilirubinometer can be a helpful non-invasive tool for diagnosing jaundice requiring phototherapy. Methods This prospective study was carried out in a tertiary care hospital in Mangalore, Karnataka to compare a non invasive method of detecting bilirubin levels and serum bilirubin levels. Performance of a transcutaneous bilirubinometer Dräger Jaundice Meter JM-105 was assessed against routine venous serum bilirubin testing before phototherapy during neonatal care in the first two weeks of life. Results were derived by analysing the correlation coefficient between two methods and direct agreement was analysed using Bland Altman analysis. Results Total of 271 neonates (>35 weeks) were included in the study. Transcutaneous bilirubinometry and serum bilirubin values were done on all of them in the first week of life. Correlation analysis showed significant relationship with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.629. Values of transcutaneous bilirubinometer showed excellent agreement with venous serum bilirubin concentration in Bland Altman analysis. Conclusions The transcutaneous bilirubinometer is a reliable tool to screen neonates and identify those needing phototherapy there by reducing invasive blood sampling.

                Tambrin et al. show that the Cdc42/Rac GAP ARHGAP12 promotes the flux of macromolecules across tight junctions by suppressing junctional actin assembly and tension via N-WASP and the Arp2/3 complex. This study reveals a mechanism by which epithelial cells can fine-tune the permeability of the tight junction leak pathway.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105352">Improving gender equity in academia depends on the workplace environment</a></h4>

              
                The iDiv Female Scientists initiative at the German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv) Halle-Jena-Leipzig in Germany was set up to connect women in science and to raise awareness of gender inequity. In this article we discuss the impact of the workplace environment on women in academia. Our experiences indicate that supportive workplace environments are more likely to discuss gender inequity, enabling “bottom-up” approaches where individual researchers can propose solutions to the problem. In contrast, unsupportive environments are less receptive to such discussions, so “top-down” approaches driven by legislation policies are required to improve the situation. We also make recommendations of actions that can be taken by individuals, institutions and policymakers to promote gender equity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104199">FtsK is critical for the assembly of the unique divisome complex of the FtsZ-less Chlamydia trachomatis</a></h4>

              
                <i>Chlamydia trachomatis</i> serovar L2 (<i>Ct),</i> an obligate intracellular bacterium that does not encode FtsZ, divides by a polarized budding process. In the absence of FtsZ, we show that FtsK, a chromosomal translocase, is critical for divisome assembly in <i>Ct</i>. Chlamydial FtsK forms discrete foci at the septum and at the base of the progenitor mother cell, and our data indicate that FtsK foci at the base of the mother cell mark the location of nascent divisome complexes that form at the site where a daughter cell will emerge in the next round of division. The divisome in <i>Ct</i> has a hybrid composition, containing elements of the divisome and elongasome from other bacteria, and FtsK is recruited to nascent divisomes prior to the other chlamydial divisome proteins assayed, including the PBP2 and PBP3 transpeptidases, and MreB and MreC. Knocking down FtsK prevents divisome assembly in <i>Ct</i> and inhibits cell division and septal peptidoglycan synthesis. We further show that MreB does not function like FtsZ and serve as a scaffold for the assembly of the <i>Ct</i> divisome. Rather, MreB is one of the last proteins recruited to the chlamydial divisome, and it is necessary for the formation of septal peptidoglycan rings. Our studies illustrate the critical role of chlamydial FtsK in coordinating divisome assembly and peptidoglycan synthesis in this obligate intracellular bacterial pathogen.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101043">Synaptic cell adhesion molecule Cdh6 identifies a class of sensory neurons with novel functions in colonic motility</a></h4>

              
                Intrinsic sensory neurons are an essential part of the enteric nervous system (ENS) and play a crucial role in gastrointestinal tract motility and digestion. Neuronal subtypes in the ENS have been distinguished by their electrophysiological properties, morphology, and expression of characteristic markers, notably neurotransmitters and neuropeptides. Here, we investigated synaptic cell adhesion molecules as novel cell-type markers in the ENS. Our work identifies two type II classic cadherins, <i>Cdh6</i> and <i>Cdh8,</i> specific to sensory neurons in the mouse colon. We show that <i>Cdh6+</i> neurons demonstrate all other distinguishing classifications of enteric sensory neurons including marker expression of <i>Calcb</i> and <i>Nmu</i>, Dogiel type II morphology and AH-type electrophysiology and <i>I<sub>H</sub></i> current. Optogenetic activation of <i>Cdh6+</i> sensory neurons in distal colon evokes retrograde colonic motor complexes (CMCs), while pharmacologic blockade of rhythmicity-associated current <i>I<sub>H</sub></i> disrupts the spontaneous generation of CMCs. These findings provide the first demonstration of selective activation of a single neurochemical and functional class of enteric neurons and demonstrate a functional and critical role for sensory neurons in the generation of CMCs.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102819">A single-cell atlas of spatial and temporal gene expression in the mouse cranial neural plate</a></h4>

              
                The formation of the mammalian brain requires regionalization and morphogenesis of the cranial neural plate, which transforms from an epithelial sheet into a closed tube that provides the structural foundation for neural patterning and circuit formation. Sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling is important for cranial neural plate patterning and closure, but the transcriptional changes that give rise to the spatially regulated cell fates and behaviors that build the cranial neural tube have not been systematically analyzed. Here, we used single-cell RNA sequencing to generate an atlas of gene expression at six consecutive stages of cranial neural tube closure in the mouse embryo. Ordering transcriptional profiles relative to the major axes of gene expression predicted spatially regulated expression of 870 genes along the anterior-posterior and mediolateral axes of the cranial neural plate and reproduced known expression patterns with over 85% accuracy. Single-cell RNA sequencing of embryos with activated SHH signaling revealed distinct SHH-regulated transcriptional programs in the developing forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain, suggesting a complex interplay between anterior-posterior and mediolateral patterning systems. These results define a spatiotemporally resolved map of gene expression during cranial neural tube closure and provide a resource for investigating the transcriptional events that drive early mammalian brain development.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101143">A novel method (RIM-Deep) for enhancing imaging depth and resolution stability of deep cleared tissue in inverted confocal microscopy</a></h4>

              
                The increasing use of tissue clearing techniques underscores the urgent need for cost-effective and simplified deep imaging methods. While traditional inverted confocal microscopes excel in high-resolution imaging of tissue sections and cultured cells, they face limitations in deep imaging of cleared tissues due to refractive index mismatches between the immersion media of objectives and sample container. To overcome these challenges, the RIM-Deep was developed to significantly improve deep imaging capabilities without compromising the normal function of the confocal microscope. This system facilitates deep immunofluorescence imaging of the prefrontal cortex in cleared macaque tissue, extending imaging depth from 2 mm to 5 mm. Applied to an intact and cleared Thy1-EGFP mouse brain, the system allowed for clear axonal visualization at high imaging depth. Moreover, this advancement enables large-scale, deep 3D imaging of intact tissues. In principle, this concept can be extended to any imaging modality, including existing inverted wide-field, confocal, and two-photon microscopy. This would significantly upgrade traditional laboratory configurations and facilitate the study of connectomes in the brain and other tissues.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90139">Ab initio prediction of specific phospholipid complexes and membrane association of HIV-1 MPER antibodies by multi-scale simulations</a></h4>

              
                A potent class of HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) targets the envelope glycoprotein’s membrane proximal exposed region (MPER) through a proposed mechanism where hypervariable loops embed into lipid bilayers and engage headgroup moieties alongside the epitope. We address the feasibility and determinant molecular features of this mechanism using multi-scale modeling. All-atom simulations of 4E10, PGZL1, 10E8, and LN01 docked onto HIV-like membranes consistently form phospholipid complexes at key complementarity-determining region loop sites, solidifying that stable and specific lipid interactions anchor bnAbs to membrane surfaces. Ancillary protein-lipid contacts reveal surprising contributions from antibody framework regions. Coarse-grained simulations effectively capture antibodies embedding into membranes. Simulations estimating protein-membrane interaction strength for PGZL1 variants along an inferred maturation pathway show bilayer affinity is evolved and correlates with neutralization potency. The modeling demonstrated here uncovers insights into lipid participation in antibodies’ recognition of membrane proteins and highlights antibody features to prioritize in vaccine design.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97760">Effort drives saccade selection</a></h4>

              
                What determines where to move the eyes? We recently showed that pupil size, a well-established marker of effort, also reflects the effort associated with making a saccade (‘saccade costs’). Here, we demonstrate saccade costs to critically drive saccade selection: when choosing between any two saccade directions, the least costly direction was consistently preferred. Strikingly, this principle even held during search in natural scenes in two additional experiments. When increasing cognitive demand experimentally through an auditory counting task, participants made fewer saccades and especially cut costly directions. This suggests that the eye-movement system and other cognitive operations consume similar resources that are flexibly allocated among each other as cognitive demand changes. Together, we argue that eye-movement behavior is tuned to adaptively minimize saccade-inherent effort.

                Genetic variation is known to contribute to the variation of animal social behavior, but the molecular mechanisms that lead to behavioral differences are still not fully understood. Here, we investigate the cellular evolution of the hypothalamic preoptic area (POA), a brain region that plays a critical role in social behavior, across two sister species of deer mice (<i>Peromyscus maniculatus</i> and <i>P. polionotus</i>) with divergent social systems. These two species exhibit large differences in mating and parental care behavior across species and sex. Using single-nucleus RNA-sequencing, we build a cellular atlas of the POA for males and females of both <i>Peromyscus</i> species. We identify four cell types that are differentially abundant across species, two of which may account for species differences in parental care behavior based on known functions of these cell types. Our data further implicate two sex-biased cell types to be important for the evolution of sex-specific behavior. Finally, we show a remarkable reduction of sex-biased gene expression in <i>P. polionotus</i>, a monogamous species that also exhibits reduced sexual dimorphism in parental care behavior. Our POA atlas is a powerful resource to investigate how molecular neuronal traits may be evolving to give rise to innate differences in social behavior across animal species.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104280">Load-based divergence in the dynamic allostery of two TCRs recognizing the same pMHC</a></h4>

              
                Increasing evidence suggests that mechanical load on the αβ T-cell receptor (TCR) is crucial for recognizing the antigenic peptide-bound major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) molecule. Our recent all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations revealed that the inter-domain motion of the TCR is responsible for the load-induced catch bond behavior of the TCR-pMHC complex and peptide discrimination (Chang-Gonzalez et al., 2024). To further examine the generality of the mechanism, we perform all-atom MD simulations of the B7 TCR under different conditions for comparison with our previous simulations of the A6 TCR. The two TCRs recognize the same pMHC and have similar interfaces with pMHC in crystal structures. We find that the B7 TCR-pMHC interface stabilizes under ∼15 pN load using a conserved dynamic allostery mechanism that involves the asymmetric motion of the TCR chassis. However, despite forming comparable contacts with pMHC as A6 in the crystal structure, B7 has fewer high-occupancy contacts with pMHC and exhibits higher mechanical compliance during the simulation. These results indicate that the dynamic allostery common to the TCRαβ chassis can amplify slight differences in interfacial contacts into distinctive mechanical responses and nuanced biological outcomes.

With a panel of patients with lived experiences of stroke, we performed a systematic review of animal models of stroke that administered a CCR5 antagonist and assessed infarct size or behavioural outcomes. MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Embase were searched. Article screening and data extraction were completed in duplicate. We pooled outcomes using random effects meta-analyses. We assessed risk of bias using the Systematic Review Centre for Laboratory Animal Experimentation (SYRCLE) tool and alignment with the Stroke Treatment Academic Industry Roundtable (STAIR) and Stroke Recovery and Rehabilitation Roundtable (SRRR) recommendations. Five studies representing 10 experiments were included. CCR5 antagonists reduced infarct volume (standard mean difference −1.02; 95% confidence interval −1.58 to −0.46) when compared to stroke-only controls. Varied timing of CCR5 administration (pre- or post-stroke induction) produced similar benefit. CCR5 antagonists significantly improved 11 of 16 behavioural outcomes reported. High risk of bias was present in all studies and critical knowledge gaps in the preclinical evidence were identified using STAIR/SRRR. CCR5 antagonists demonstrate promise; however, rigorously designed preclinical studies that better align with STAIR/SRRR recommendations and downstream clinical trials are warranted.
