<p>In the eyes of a rationalist like Descartes or Spinoza, human reasoning is
flawless, marching toward uncovering ultimate truth. A few centuries later,
however, culminating in the work of Kahneman and Tversky, human reasoning was
portrayed as anything but flawless, filled with numerous misjudgments, biases,
and cognitive fallacies. With further investigations, new cognitive fallacies
continually emerged, leading to a state of affairs which can fairly be
characterized as the cognitive fallacy zoo! In this largely methodological
work, we formally present a principled way to bring order to this zoo. We
introduce the idea of establishing implication relationships (IRs) between
cognitive fallacies, formally characterizing how one fallacy implies another.
IR is analogous to, and partly inspired by, the fundamental concept of
reduction in computational complexity theory. We present several examples of
IRs involving experimentally well-documented cognitive fallacies: base-rate
neglect, availability bias, conjunction fallacy, decoy effect, framing effect,
and Allais paradox. We conclude by discussing how our work: (i) allows for
identifying those pivotal cognitive fallacies whose investigation would be the
most rewarding research agenda, and importantly (ii) permits a systematized,
guided research program on cognitive fallacies, motivating influential
theoretical as well as experimental avenues of future research.

                <h4><a href="http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0332-18.2018v1?rss=1">p11 in cholinergic interneurons of the nucleus accumbens is essential for dopamine responses to rewarding stimuli</a></h4>

Abstract<p>A recent study showed that p11 expressed in cholinergic interneurons (CINs) of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) is a key regulator of depression-like behaviors. Dopaminergic neurons projecting to the NAc are responsible for reward-related behaviors, and their function is impaired in depression. The present study investigated the role of p11 in NAc CINs in dopamine responses to rewarding stimuli. The extracellular dopamine and acetylcholine (ACh) levels in the NAc were determined in freely moving male mice using <i>in vivo</i> microdialysis. Rewarding stimuli (cocaine, palatable food and female mouse encounter) induced an increase in dopamine efflux in the NAc of wild-type mice. The dopamine responses were attenuated (cocaine) or abolished (food and female mouse encounter) in constitutive p11 KO mice. The dopamine response to cocaine was accompanied by an increase in ACh NAc efflux, whereas the attenuated dopamine response to cocaine in p11 KO mice was restored by activation of nicotinic or muscarinic ACh receptors in the NAc. Dopamine responses to rewarding stimuli and ACh release in the NAc were attenuated in mice with deletion of p11 from cholinergic neurons (ChAT-p11 cKO mice), whereas gene delivery of p11 to CINs restored the dopamine responses. Furthermore, chemogenetic studies revealed that p11 is required for activation of CINs in response to rewarding stimuli. Thus, p11 in NAc CINs plays a critical role in activating these neurons to mediate dopamine responses to rewarding stimuli. The dysregulation of mesolimbic dopamine system by dysfunction of p11 in NAc CINs may be involved in pathogenesis of depressive states.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> p11 is a critical regulator of CIN activity as measured by the dopamine response of the mesolimbic dopamine pathway to rewarding stimuli. p11 is required for reward-mediated NAc CIN activation and induction in ACh release, resulting in the enhancement of dopamine release. The reduction of p11 expression in NAc CINs is tightly associated with anhedonia as well as other depression-like symptoms of behavioral despair. To improve therapeutic efficacy of antidepressants for anhedonia, a new type of antidepressant directly or indirectly acting on the mesolimbic dopamine pathway needs to be developed. For this purpose, therapeutic strategies that increase the function of p11 and its signaling pathway in NAc CINs may have an impact on antidepressant efficacy.</p>

Abstract<p>Little is known about how 17β-estradiol (E<sub>2</sub>) mediates memory formation in males. In ovariectomized mice, bilateral dorsal hippocampal (DH) infusion of E<sub>2</sub> enhances memory consolidation in object recognition and object placement tasks in a manner dependent on activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and Akt signaling. Here, bilateral DH E<sub>2</sub> infusion enhanced memory consolidation in both tasks in ovariectomized female, gonadally-intact male, and castrated male mice, suggesting comparable facilitation of memory consolidation in both sexes, independent of testicular hormones in males. Contrary to previous reports in ovariectomized mice, E<sub>2</sub> did not increase DH ERK or Akt phosphorylation in males, nor did the ERK inhibitor U0126 prevent E<sub>2</sub> from enhancing memory consolidation among intact and castrated males. These data suggest that ERK activation is not necessary for E<sub>2</sub> to enhance memory consolidation in males, and compared with previous reports in females, reveal novel sex differences in the cell-signaling pathways through which E<sub>2</sub> facilitates memory consolidation. To explore the mechanisms underlying E<sub>2</sub>-induced memory enhancements in males, phosphorylation of the transcription factor cAMP binding protein (CREB) in the DH was assessed. E<sub>2</sub> increased phospho-CREB levels in both sexes, yet U0126 did not block these increases in castrated or intact males, indicating that E<sub>2</sub> regulates CREB phosphorylation in males via an ERK-independent mechanism. Collectively, these findings suggest that the beneficial effects of hippocampal E<sub>2</sub> on memory consolidation in males and females are mediated by different molecular mechanisms, which has important implications for the development of treatments to reduce memory dysfunction in men and women.</p><p><b>Significant Statement</b> The impact of biological sex on neural function is understudied, despite clear sex differences in the risks and symptomology of disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease, mood disorders, developmental learning disabilities, and attention-deficit disorder. The ability of 17β-estradiol to enhance memory consolidation in females depends on rapid activation of cell signaling pathways in the dorsal hippocampus, yet the mechanisms underlying its effects in males are unknown. The present study suggests a novel sex difference in the hippocampal cell-signaling mechanisms through which 17β-estradiol facilitates memory consolidation. These and future studies may lead to the development of sex-specific therapeutics that more effectively reduce cognitive dysfunction in diseases that disproportionately affect one sex or the other.</p>

Abstract
<p>Immune challenge alters neural functioning via cytokine production. Inflammation has profound impact on the central regulation of fertility, but the mechanisms involved are not clearly defined. The anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-10 is responsible for balancing the immune response in the brain. To examine whether IL-10 has an effect on the function of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons, we first examined the effect of immune responses with distinct cytokine profiles, such as the T cell-dependent (TD) and T cell-independent (TI) B-cell response. We investigated the effect of the TD and TI immune responses on ERK1/2 phosphorylation in GnRH neurons by administering fluorescein isothiocyanate/keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH-FITC) or dextran-FITC to female mice. Although dextran-FITC had no effect, KLH-FITC induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation in GnRH neurons after 6 d. KLH-FITC treatment increased the levels of IL-10 in the hypothalamus (HYP), but this treatment did not cause lymphocyte infiltration or an increase in the levels of proinflammatory cytokines. In IL-10 knock-out (KO) mice, KLH-FITC-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation in the GnRH neurons was absent. We also showed that in IL-10 KO mice, the estrous cycle was disrupted. Perforated patch-clamp recordings from GnRH-GFP neurons, IL-10 immunohistochemistry, and in vitro experiments on acute brain slices revealed that IL-10 can directly alter GnRH neuron firing and induce ERK1/2 phosphorylation. These observations demonstrate that IL-10 plays a role in influencing signaling of GnRH neurons in the TD immune response. These results also provide the first evidence that IL-10 can directly alter the function of GnRH neurons and may help the maintenance of the integrity of the estrous cycle.</p>

Abstract
<p>Perceptual decision-making is often modeled as the accumulation of sensory evidence over time. Recent studies using psychophysical reverse correlation have shown that even though the sensory evidence is stationary over time, subjects may exhibit a time-varying weighting strategy, weighting some stimulus epochs more heavily than others. While previous work has explained time-varying weighting as a consequence of static decision mechanisms (e.g., decision bound or leak), here we show that time-varying weighting can reflect strategic adaptation to stimulus statistics, and thus can readily take a number of forms. We characterized the temporal weighting strategies of humans and macaques performing a motion discrimination task in which the amount of information carried by the motion stimulus was manipulated over time. Both species could adapt their temporal weighting strategy to match the time-varying statistics of the sensory stimulus. When early stimulus epochs had higher mean motion strength than late, subjects adopted a pronounced early weighting strategy, where early information was weighted more heavily in guiding perceptual decisions. When the mean motion strength was greater in later stimulus epochs, in contrast, subjects shifted to a marked late weighting strategy. These results demonstrate that perceptual decisions involve a temporally flexible weighting process in both humans and monkeys, and introduce a paradigm with which to manipulate sensory weighting in decision-making tasks.</p>

<p>A fundamental question in biology is how organisms integrate sensory and
social evidence to make decisions. However, few models describe how both these
streams of information can be combined to optimize choices. Here we develop a
normative model for collective decision making in a network of agents
performing a two-alternative forced choice task. We assume that rational
(Bayesian) agents in this network make private measurements, and observe the
decisions of their neighbors until they accumulate sufficient evidence to make
an irreversible choice. As each agent communicates its decision to those
observing it, the flow of social information is described by a directed graph.
The decision-making process in this setting is intuitive, but can be complex.
We describe when and how the absence of a decision of a neighboring agent
communicates social information, and how an agent must marginalize over all
unobserved decisions. We also show how decision thresholds and network
connectivity affect group evidence accumulation, and describe the dynamics of
decision making in social cliques. Our model provides a bridge between the
abstractions used in the economics literature and the evidence accumulator
models used widely in neuroscience and psychology.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/39368">Dopamine maintains network synchrony via direct modulation of gap junctions in the crustacean cardiac ganglion</a></h4>

The Large Cell (LC) motor neurons of the crab cardiac ganglion have variable membrane conductance magnitudes even within the same individual, yet produce identical synchronized activity in the intact network. In a previous study we blocked a subset of K<sup>+ </sup>conductances across LCs, resulting in loss of synchronous activity (Lane et al., 2016). In this study, we hypothesized that this same variability of conductances makes LCs vulnerable to desynchronization during neuromodulation. We exposed the LCs to serotonin (5HT) and dopamine (DA) while recording simultaneously from multiple LCs. Both amines had distinct excitatory effects on LC output, but only 5HT caused desynchronized output. We further determined that DA rapidly increased gap junctional conductance. Co-application of both amines induced 5HT-like output, but waveforms remained synchronized. Furthermore, DA prevented desynchronization induced by the K<sup>+</sup> channel blocker tetraethylammonium (TEA), suggesting that dopaminergic modulation of electrical coupling plays a protective role in maintaining network synchrony.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/38906">Recurrent loss of HMGCS2 shows that ketogenesis is not essential for the evolution of large mammalian brains</a></h4>

Apart from glucose, fatty acid-derived ketone bodies provide metabolic energy for the brain during fasting and neonatal development. We investigated the evolution of <i>HMGCS2</i>, the key enzyme required for ketone body biosynthesis (ketogenesis). Unexpectedly, we found that three mammalian lineages, comprising cetaceans (dolphins and whales), elephants and mastodons, and Old World fruit bats have lost this gene. Remarkably, many of these species have exceptionally large brains and signs of intelligent behavior. While fruit bats are sensitive to starvation, cetaceans and elephants can still withstand periods of fasting. This suggests that alternative strategies to fuel large brains during fasting evolved repeatedly and reveals flexibility in mammalian energy metabolism. Furthermore, we show that <i>HMGCS2</i> loss preceded brain size expansion in toothed whales and elephants. Thus, while ketogenesis was likely important for brain size expansion in modern humans, ketogenesis is not a universal precondition for the evolution of large mammalian brains.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/38621">CD95/Fas ligand mRNA is toxic to cells</a></h4>

CD95/Fas ligand binds to the death receptor CD95 to induce apoptosis in sensitive cells. We previously reported that CD95L mRNA is enriched in sequences that, when converted to si/shRNAs, kill all cancer cells by targeting critical survival genes (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml#bib27">Putzbach et al., 2017</a>). We now report expression of full-length CD95L mRNA itself is highly toxic to cells and induces a similar form of cell death. We demonstrate that small (s)RNAs derived from CD95L are loaded into the RNA induced silencing complex (RISC) which is required for the toxicity and processing of CD95L mRNA into sRNAs is independent of both Dicer and Drosha. We provide evidence that in addition to the CD95L transgene a number of endogenous protein coding genes involved in regulating protein translation, particularly under low miRNA conditions, can be processed to sRNAs and loaded into the RISC suggesting a new level of cell fate regulation involving RNAi.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/37868">Loss of p53 suppresses replication-stress-induced DNA breakage in G1/S checkpoint deficient cells</a></h4>

In cancer cells, loss of G1/S control is often accompanied by p53 pathway inactivation, the latter usually rationalized as a necessity for suppressing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. However, we found an unanticipated effect of p53 loss in mouse and human G1-checkpoint-deficient cells: reduction of DNA damage. We show that abrogation of the G1/S-checkpoint allowed cells to enter S-phase under growth-restricting conditions at the expense of severe replication stress manifesting as decelerated DNA replication, reduced origin firing and accumulation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). In this system, loss of p53 allowed mitogen-independent proliferation, not by suppressing apoptosis, but rather by restoring origin firing and reducing DNA breakage. Loss of G1/S control also caused DNA damage and activation of p53 in an <i>in vivo</i> retinoblastoma model. Moreover, in a teratoma model, loss of <i>Trp53</i> reduced DNA breakage. Thus, loss of p53 may promote growth of incipient cancer cells by reducing replication-stress-induced DNA damage.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/37812">Mechanically-stimulated ATP release from murine bone cells is regulated by a balance of injury and repair</a></h4>

Bone cells sense and actively adapt to physical perturbations to prevent critical damage. ATP release is among the earliest cellular responses to mechanical stimulation. Mechanical stimulation of a single murine osteoblast led to the release of 70 {plus minus} 24 amole ATP, which stimulated calcium responses in neighboring cells. Osteoblasts contained ATP-rich vesicles that were released upon mechanical stimulation. Surprisingly, interventions that promoted vesicular release reduced ATP release, while inhibitors of vesicular release potentiated ATP release. Searching for an alternative ATP release route, we found that mechanical stresses induced reversible cell membrane injury <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. Ca<sup>2+</sup>/PLC/PKC-dependent vesicular exocytosis facilitated membrane repair, thereby minimizing cell injury and reducing ATP release. Priming cellular repair machinery prior to mechanical stimulation reduced subsequent membrane injury and ATP release, linking cellular mechanosensitivity to prior mechanical exposure. Thus, our findings position ATP release as an integrated readout of membrane injury and repair.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/37516">Maturing <i>Mycobacterium smegmatis </i>peptidoglycan requires non-canonical crosslinks to maintain shape</a></h4>

In most well studied rod-shaped bacteria, peptidoglycan is primarily crosslinked by penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). However, in mycobacteria, crosslinks formed by L,D-transpeptidases (LDTs) are highly abundant. To elucidate the role of these unusual crosslinks, we characterized <i>Mycobacterium smegmatis</i> cells lacking all LDTs. We find that crosslinks generate by LDTs are required for rod shape maintenance specifically at sites of aging cell wall, a byproduct of polar elongation. Asymmetric polar growth leads to a non-uniform distribution of these two types of crosslinks in a single cell. Consequently, in the absence of LDT-mediated crosslinks, PBP-catalyzed crosslinks become more important. Because of this, <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (Mtb) is more rapidly killed using a combination of drugs capable of PBP- and LDT- inhibition. Thus, knowledge about the spatial and genetic relationship between drug targets can be exploited to more effectively treat this pathogen.

Whereas the composition of the human gut microbiome is well resolved, predictive understanding is still lacking. Here, we followed a bottom-up strategy to explore human gut community dynamics: we established a synthetic community composed of three representative human gut isolates (<i>Roseburia intestinalis </i>L1-82, <i>Faecalibacterium prausnitzii</i> A2-165 and <i>Blautia hydrogenotrophica </i>S5a33) and explored their interactions under well-controlled conditions <i>in vitro. </i>Systematic mono- and pair-wise fermentation experiments confirmed competition for fructose and cross-feeding of formate. We quantified with a mechanistic model how well tri-culture dynamics was predicted from mono-culture data. With the model as reference, we demonstrated that strains grown in co-culture behaved differently than in mono-culture and confirmed their altered behavior at the transcriptional level. In addition, we showed with replicate tri-cultures and simulations that dominance in tri-culture sensitively depended on initial conditions. Our work has important implications for gut microbial community modeling as well as ecological interaction detection from batch cultures.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/36495">Firefly genomes illuminate parallel origins of bioluminescence in beetles</a></h4>

Fireflies and their luminous courtships have inspired centuries of scientific study. Today firefly luciferase is widely used in biotechnology, but the evolutionary origin of bioluminescence within beetles remains unclear. To shed light on this long-standing question, we sequenced the genomes of two firefly species that diverged over 100 million-years-ago: the North American <i>Photinus pyralis</i> and Japanese <i>Aquatica lateralis.</i> To compare bioluminescent origins, we also sequenced the genome of a related click beetle, the Caribbean <i>Ignelater luminosus</i>, with bioluminescent biochemistry near-identical to fireflies, but anatomically unique light organs, suggesting the intriguing hypothesis of parallel gains of bioluminescence. Our analyses support independent gains of bioluminescence in fireflies and click beetles, and provide new insights into the genes, chemical defenses, and symbionts that evolved alongside their luminous lifestyle.

The columbine genus <i>Aquilegia</i> is a classic example of an adaptive radiation, involving a wide variety of pollinators and habitats. Here we present the genome assembly of <i>A. coerulea</i> 'Goldsmith', complemented by high-coverage sequencing data from 10 wild species covering the world-wide distribution. Our analyses reveal extensive allele sharing among species, and demonstrate that introgression and selection played a role in the <i>Aquilegia</i> radiation. We also present the remarkable discovery that the evolutionary history of an entire chromosome differs from that of the rest of the genome - a phenomenon which we do not fully understand, but which highlights the need to consider chromosomes in an evolutionary context.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/34870">OGT binds a conserved C-terminal domain of TET1 to regulate TET1 activity and function in development</a></h4>

TET enzymes convert 5-methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine and higher oxidized derivatives. TETs stably associate with and are post-translationally modified by the nutrient-sensing enzyme OGT, suggesting a connection between metabolism and the epigenome. Here, we show for the first time that modification by OGT enhances TET1 activity <i>in vitro.</i> We identify a TET1 domain that is necessary and sufficient for binding to OGT and report a point mutation that disrupts the TET1-OGT interaction. We show that this interaction is necessary for TET1 to rescue hematopoetic stem cell production in tet mutant zebrafish embryos, suggesting that OGT promotes TET1's function during development. Finally, we show that disrupting the TET1-OGT interaction in mouse embryonic stem cells changes the abundance of TET2 and 5-methylcytosine, which is accompanied by alterations in gene expression. These results link metabolism and epigenetic control, which may be relevant to the developmental and disease processes regulated by these two enzymes.

We propose a framework for the memory function of spindle oscillations during sleep. In this framework, memories are reinstated by spindle events, and further reprocessed during subsequent spindle refractory periods. We posit that spindle refractoriness is crucial for protecting memory reprocessing from interference. We further argue that temporally-coordinated spindle refractory periods across local networks facilitate the consolidation of rich, multimodal representations, and that localized spindle refractoriness optimizes oscillatory interactions that support systems consolidation in the sleeping brain.

The Drosophila larval neuromuscular system is extensively used by researchers to study neuronal cell biology, and Drosophila glutamatergic motor neurons (MNs) have become a major model system. There are two main Types of glutamatergic MNs, Ib and Is, with different structural and physiological properties at synaptic level at the neuromuscular junction. To generate genetic tools to identify and manipulate MNs of each Type, we screened for GAL4 driver lines for this purpose. Here we describe GAL4 drivers specific for examples of neurons within each Type, Ib or Is. These drivers showed high expression levels and were expressed in only few MNs, making them amenable tools for specific studies of both axonal and synapse biology in identified Type I MNs.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/445346v1?rss=1">Deliberation and enaction during adaptive economic choice</a></h4>

Economic decisions can adapt to contexts. Choices can be quick and impulsive or slow and more deliberative, depending on the temporal context. Choices can also depend on how we enact the choice, in an action context. Where we decide to go for dinner may change if we can take a taxi or need to walk. We hypothesized that frontal action circuits could contribute to adapting economic choices to context because of their privileged position over actions as endpoints of decisions. To test this, we performed an unbiased survey of neuronal population activity across motor, premotor and prefrontal cortices as animals expressed context-dependent economic preferences. Activity in distributed action circuits tracked the animals evolving preferences in real-time and integrated them with a signal for their enaction. We propose that frontal action circuits form a neural substrate that supports an adaptive control over economic choice by flexibly translating real-time preferences into actions.

Type 1 Estrogen receptor-expressing neurons in the ventrolateral subdivision of the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMHvlEsr1) play a causal role in the control of social behaviors including aggression. Here we use six different viral-genetic tracing methods to map the connectional architecture of VMHvlEsr1 neurons. These data reveal a high level of input convergence and output divergence ('fan-in/fan-out') from and to over 30 distinct brain regions, with a high degree (~90%) of recurrence. Unlike GABAergic populations in other hypothalamic nuclei controlling feeding and parenting behavior, VMHvlEsr1 glutamatergic neurons collateralize to multiple targets. However, we identify two anatomically distinct subpopulations with anterior vs. posterior biases in their collateralization patterns. Surprisingly, these two subpopulations receive indistinguishable inputs. These studies suggest an overall system architecture in which an anatomically feed-forward sensory-to-motor processing stream is integrated with a dense, highly recurrent central processing circuit. This architecture differs from the 'brain-inspired' feed-forward circuits used in certain types of artificial intelligence networks.

The sensory recruitment model envisages visual working memory (VWM) as an emergent property that is encoded and maintained in sensory (visual) regions. The model implies that enhanced sensory-perceptual functions, as in synaesthesia, entail a dedicated VWM-system, showing reduced visual cortex activity as a result of neural specificity. By contrast, sensory-perceptual decline, as in old age, is expected to show enhanced visual cortex activity as a result of neural broadening. To test this model, young grapheme-colour synaesthetes, older adults and young controls engaged in a delayed pair-associative retrieval and a delayed matching-to-sample task, consisting of achromatic fractal stimuli that do not induce synaesthesia. While a previous analysis of this dataset (Pfeifer et al., 2016) has focused on cued retrieval and recognition of pair-associates (i.e. long-term memory), the current study focuses on visual working memory and considers, for the first time, the crucial delay period in which no visual stimuli are present, but working memory processes are engaged. Participants were trained to criterion and demonstrated comparable behavioural performance on VWM tasks. Whole-brain and region-of-interest-analyses revealed significantly lower activity in the synaesthetes middle frontal gyrus and visual regions (cuneus, inferior temporal cortex) respectively, suggesting greater neural efficiency relative to young and older adults in both tasks. The results support the sensory recruitment model and can explain age and individual WM-differences based on neural specificity in visual cortex.

The properties of different dopamine receptors constrain the function of dopamine signals in the striatum of the basal ganglia. Still, dopamine receptor kinetics are often neglected in considerations of the temporal dynamics of dopamine signalling. Here we develop a neurochemical model of dopamine receptor binding taking into account slow receptor kinetics. Contrary to current views, in our model D1 and D2 dopamine receptor populations react very similarly to dopamine signals independent of their timescale and integrate them over minutes. Furthermore, our model explains why ramping dopamine concentrations, observed experimentally, are an effective signal for increasing the occupancy of dopamine receptors.

Endo- and exocannabinoids, such as the psychoactive component of marijuana, exert their effects on brain function by inducing several forms of synaptic plasticity through the modulation of presynaptic vesicle release. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the widely expressed endocannabinoid-mediated long-term depression (eCB-LTD), are poorly understood. Here, we reveal that eCB-LTD depends on the contractile properties of the pre-synaptic actomyosin cytoskeleton. Preventing this contractility, both directly by inhibiting non-muscle myosin II NMII ATPase and indirectly by inhibiting the upstream Rho-associated kinase ROCK, abolished long-term, but not short-term forms of cannabinoid-induced functional plasticity in both inhibitory hippocampal and excitatory cortico-striatal synapses. Furthermore, using 3D superresolution microscopy, we find an actomyosin contractility-dependent redistribution of synaptic vesicle pools within the presynaptic compartment following cannabinoid receptor activation, leading to vesicle clustering and depletion from the pre-synaptic active zone. These results suggest that cannabinoid-induced functional plasticity is mediated by a nanoscale structural reorganization of the presynaptic compartment produced by actomyosin contraction. By introducing the contractile NMII as an important actin binding/structuring protein in the dynamic regulation of synaptic function, our results open new perspectives in the understanding of mechanisms of synaptic and cognitive function, marijuana intoxication and psychiatric pathogenesis.

Normalization is a fundamental operation throughout neuronal systems to adjust dynamic range. In the visual cortex various cell circuits have been identified that provide the substrate for such a canonical function, but how these circuits are orchestrated remains unclear. Here we suggest the serotonergic (5-HT) system as another player involved in normalization. 5-HT receptors of different classes are co-distributed across different cortical cell types, but their individual contribution to cortical population responses is unknown. We combined wide-field calcium imaging of primary visual cortex (V1) with optogenetic stimulation of 5-HT neurons in mice dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) -- the major hub for widespread release of serotonin across cortex -- in combination with selective 5-HT receptor blockers. While inhibitory (5-HT1A) receptors accounted for subtractive suppression of spontaneous activity, depolarizing (5-HT2A) receptors promoted divisive suppression of response gain. Added linearly, these components led to normalization of population responses over a range of visual contrasts.

Pupillometry, the measure of pupil size and reactivity, has been widely used to assess cognitive processes. As such, changes in pupil size have been shown to correlate with arousal, locomotion, cortical state and decision-making processes. In addition, pupillary responses have been linked to the activity of neuromodulatory systems that modulate attention and perception as the noradrenergic and cholinergic systems. Due to the extent of processes reflected by the pupil, we aimed at resolving pupillary responses in context of behavioral state and task performance while recording pupillary transients of mice performing a vibrotactile two-alternative forced choice task (2-AFC). We show that pre-stimulus pupil size differentiates between states disengagement from task performance versus when actively engaged. In addition, when actively engaged, post-stimulus, pupillary dilations for correct responses are larger than for error responses with this difference reflecting response confidence. Importantly, in a delayed 2-AFC task we show that even though pupillary transients mainly reflect motor output following the response of the animal, they also reflect animal decision confidence prior to its response. Finally, in a condition of passive engagement, when stimulus has no task relevance with reward provided automatically, pupillary dilations rather reflect stimulation and reward and are reduced relative to a state of active engagement explained by shifts of attention from irrelevant task occurrences. Our results provide further evidence of how pupillary dilations reflect cognitive processes in a task relevant context, showing that the pupil reflects response confidence and baseline pupil size encodes attentiveness rather than general arousal.

Value-based decision making is a process in which humans or animals maximize their gain by selecting appropriate options and performing the corresponding actions to acquire them. Whether the evaluation process of the options in the brain can be independent from their action contingency has been hotly debated. To address the question, we trained rhesus monkeys to make decisions by integrating evidence and studied whether the integration occurred in the stimulus or the action domain in the brain. After the monkeys learned the task, we recorded both from the orbitofrontal (OFC) and dorsolateral prefrontal (DLPFC) cortices. We found that the OFC neurons encoded the value associated with the single piece of evidence in the stimulus domain. Importantly, the representations of the value in the OFC was transient and the information was not integrated across time for decisions. The integration of evidence was observed only in the DLPFC and only in the action domain. We further used a neural network model to show how the stimulus-to-action transition of value information may be computed in the DLPFC. Our results indicated that the decision making in the brain is computed in the action domain without an intermediate stimulus-based decision stage.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/444430v1?rss=1">Contribution of sensory encoding to measured bias</a></h4>

Perceptual decision-making is a complex process that involves sensory integration followed by application of a cognitive threshold. Signal detection theory (SDT) provides a mathematical framework for attributing the underlying neurobiological processes to these distinct phases of perceptual decision-making. In particular, SDT reveals the sensitivity (d-prime) of the neuronal response distributions and the bias (c) of the decision criterion, which are commonly thought to reflect sensory and cognitive processes, respectively. However, neuronal representations of bias have been observed in sensory areas, suggesting that some changes in bias are due to effects on sensory encoding. To directly test whether sensory encoding can influence bias, we optogenetically manipulated neuronal excitability in primary visual cortex (V1) during a detection task. Increasing excitability in V1 significantly decreased behavioral bias, while decreasing excitability had the opposite effect. To determine whether this change in bias is consistent with the effects on sensory encoding, we made extracellular recordings from V1 neurons in passively viewing mice. Indeed, we found that optogenetic manipulation of excitability shifted the neuronal bias in the same direction as the behavioral bias, despite using a fixed artificial decision criterion to predict hit and false alarm rates from the neuronal firing rates. To test the generality these effects, we also manipulated the quality of V1 encoding by changing stimulus contrast or inter-stimulus interval. These stimulus manipulations also resulted in consistent changes in bias measured both behaviorally and neuronally. Thus, changes in sensory encoding are sufficient to drive changes in bias measured using SDT.

Isolation of cell populations is untangling complex biological interactions, but studies comparing methodologies lack in vivo complexity and draw limited conclusions about the types of transcripts identified by each technique. Furthermore, few studies compare FACS-based techniques to ribosomal affinity purification, and none do so genome-wide. We addressed this gap by systematically comparing nuclear-FACS, whole cell-FACS, and RiboTag affinity purification in the context of D1 or D2 dopamine receptor-expressing medium spiny neuron (MSN) subtypes of the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a key brain reward region. We find that nuclear-FACS-seq generates a substantially longer list of differentially expressed genes between these cell types, and a significantly larger number of neuropsychiatric GWAS hits than the other two methods. RiboTag-seq has much lower coverage of the transcriptome than the other methods, but very efficiently distinguishes D1- and D2-MSNs. We also demonstrate differences between D1- and D2-MSNs with respect to RNA localization, suggesting fundamental cell type differences in mechanisms of transcriptional regulation and subcellular transport of RNAs. Together, these findings guide the field in selecting the RNAseq method that best suits the scientific questions under investigation.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/444281v1?rss=1">EEG signal diversity reflects capability for behavioral responsiveness during propofol sedation</a></h4>

Background: Transitions between wakefulness and anesthesia are accompanied by profound changes in brain functioning. A key challenge is to disentangle neuronal mechanisms specific to loss and recovery of consciousness, from more general effects that are not directly related to the capacity for conscious experience. Measures of neuronal diversity have been recently proposed to constitute a robust correlate of the global states of consciousness. In the present study we investigated whether EEG signal diversity is indeed related to behavioral responsiveness during propofol sedation, or rather to the general drug-related effects. Methods: We reanalyzed data collected from 20 subjects sedated with propofol. Based on the responsiveness to auditory stimuli all subjects were subdivided into two subgroups - responsive (n = 13), who remains awake throughout the experiment, and drowsy (n = 7), who becomes unresponsive during moderate sedation. Resting state EEG recorded during wakefulness and sedation was characterized by the Mean Information Gain - an information-theory measure estimating signal diversity. Results: In line with our hypothesis, the drowsy group exhibited a decrease in diversity during sedation but, unexpectedly, the responsive group exhibited a robust increase in diversity (ANOVA group x state interaction: F(3) = 7.81, p &lt; 0.001; BF10 &gt; 100). Conclusions: We revealed that propofol sedation is initially related to an increase in EEG signal diversity, and that only upon loss of responsiveness EEG diversity decreases. The qualitatively different pattern of changes in the responsive and drowsy groups makes EEG diversity a robust indirect index of responsiveness and, presumably, consciousness.

Loss of smell is an early indicator of Alzheimer's disease (AD), making the olfactory system an accessible model to study the effect of AD-related proteins such as Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP). The regenerative capacity of the system further enables studies of circuit recovery after APP-induced degeneration. While the cellular effects of APP are well documented, little is known about its effects on brain circuits at the ultrastructural level. To study circuitry changes, we overexpressed humanized APP with familial AD mutations (hAPP) in olfactory sensory neurons and performed serial electron microscopy on olfactory bulb glomeruli from both control and hAPP expressing mice. We found that hAPP-expressing mice showed a striking decrease in glomerular connectivity along with widespread changes of subcellular structures. By then turning off hAPP expression for 6 weeks we tested the capacity of glomerular circuits to recover and found clear restoration of both connectivity and subcellular features, including an increase in post-synaptic density to above the control level. These data provide an important ultrastructural view of olfactory regions associated with AD and suggest that circuit recovery is possible in brain tissue that has experienced APP-induced neurodegeneration.

What determines where we look? Theories of attentional guidance hold that image features and task demands govern fixation behaviour, while differences between observers are interpreted as 'noise'. Here, we investigated the fixations of &gt; 100 human adults freely viewing a large set of complex scenes. We found systematic individual differences in fixation frequencies along six semantic stimulus dimensions. These differences were large (&gt; twofold) and highly stable across images and time. Surprisingly, they also held for first fixations directed towards each image, which are thought to reflect 'bottom-up' visual salience. The dimensions of individual salience and their covariance pattern replicated across samples from three different countries, suggesting they reflect a fundamental biological space of attention. Our findings show that individual observers have stable salience biases, which can be captured along a canonical set of semantic dimensions. Salience reflects features of the observer as well as the image.

Human genetic disorders provide a powerful lens to understanding the human brain. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) represent an important, new resource for mechanistic studies and therapeutic development. Christianson syndrome (CS), an X-linked neurological disorder with attenuation of brain growth postnatally (postnatal microcephaly), is caused by mutations in SLC9A6, the gene encoding endosomal Na+/H+ exchanger 6 (NHE6). We developed CS iPSC lines from patients with a mutational spectrum, as well as robust biologically-related and isogenic controls. We demonstrate that mutations in CS lead to loss of protein function by a variety of mechanisms. Regardless of mutation, all patient-derived neurons demonstrate reduced neurite growth and arborization, likely underlying diminished postnatal brain growth in patients. Additionally, phenotype rescue strategies show allele-specific responses: a gene replacement strategy shows efficacy in nonsense mutations but not in a missense mutation, whereas application of exogenous trophic factors (BDNF or IGF-1) rescues arborization phenotypes across all mutations. Our data emphasize the important principle of personalized medicine whereby success of some therapeutic strategies may be more linked to patient genotype than others.

The rapid adoption of the larval zebrafish as a systems neuroscience model has been driven largely by its small size and optical transparency, which enable the use of imaging and optogenetics techniques to record and manipulate activity throughout the brain. Unfortunately, larval fish lack the sophisticated behavioral repertoire of adults and so a number of complex learning phenomena and social behaviors cannot be investigated in these animals. Here we establish the pedomorphic fish species Danionella translucida as a laboratory model that overcomes this limitation. Adult Danionella possess the size and optical transparency of late-larval zebrafish, which we exploit to image deep within the brains of a behaviorally mature animals using two-photon microscopy. The close phylogenetic relationship between Danionella and zebrafish enabled us to use existing reagents and techniques for transgenesis, and zebrafish-derived enhancer elements drove transgene expression in Danionella with the intended specificity. In a behavioral assay for socially-reinforced place preference, interactions between fish were found to be positively reinforcing, demonstrating the power of this species for studies of learning and memory as well as social behavior. The establishment of Danionella's behavioral, molecular, and optical tractability provides a unique opportunity for researchers seeking to understand the relationship between circuits and complex behaviors at a whole-brain level.

Frequent cannabis use during adolescence has been associated with alterations in brain structure. However, studies have featured relatively inconsistent results, predominantly from small samples, and few studies have examined less frequent users to shed light on potential brain structure differences across levels of cannabis use. In this study, high-resolution T1-weighted MRIs were obtained from 781 youth aged 14-21 years who were studied as part of the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort. This sample included 147 cannabis users (109 Occasional [[≤]1-2 times per week] and 38 Frequent [[≥] 3 times per week] Users) and 634 cannabis Non-Users. Several structural neuroimaging measures were examined in whole brain analyses, including gray and white matter volumes, cortical thickness, and gray matter density. Established procedures for stringent quality control were conducted, and two automated neuroimaging software processing packages were used to ensure robustness of results. There were no significant differences by cannabis group in global or regional brain volumes, cortical thickness, or gray matter density, and no significant group by age interactions were found. Follow-up analyses indicated that values of structural neuroimaging measures by cannabis group were similar across regions, and any differences among groups were likely of a small magnitude. In sum, structural brain metrics were similar among adolescent and young adult cannabis users and non-users. Our data converge with prior large-scale studies suggesting small or limited associations between cannabis use and structural brain measures in youth. Detailed studies of vulnerability to structural brain alterations and longitudinal studies examining long-term risk are indicated.

No two individuals experience the world the same way. On a spectrum of inter-individual variability, synesthetes, for instance, experience additional sensations, while schizophrenia patients suffer perceptual deficits. Is there a unifying principle explaining inter-individual variability in perception? Perceptual experience results from inferential processes whereby sensory evidence is weighted by prior knowledge about the world. Different perceptual phenotypes may then stem from different weighting of sensory evidence and prior knowledge. We tested this hypothesis by comparing visibility thresholds in a perceptual closure task across medicated schizophrenia patients (N=20), synesthetes (N=20), and controls (N=26). Participants rated the subjective visibility of illusory contours of stimuli embedded in noise while the availability of sensory evidence was manipulated parametrically. Additionally, implicit priors in synesthetes were manipulated by presenting either synesthesia-inducing or neutral stimuli. Schizophrenia patients showed increased visibility thresholds, consistent with overreliance on sensory evidence and reduced influence of prior knowledge. In contrast, synesthetes exhibited lowered thresholds exclusively for synesthesia-inducing stimuli suggesting synesthetic experiences arise through excess implicit priors. Additionally, both in synesthetes and schizophrenics explicit top-down priors lowered thresholds but did not normalize perception in either group. Our results indicate that perceptual phenotypes might be traced to automatic differences in perceptual inference which are not overcome by conscious, explicit priors.

Brain trauma triggers a cascade of deleterious events leading to enhanced incidence of drug resistant epilepsies, depression and cognitive dysfunctions. The underlying mechanisms leading to these alterations are poorly understood and treatment that attenuates those sequels not available. Using controlled-cortical impact (CCI) as experimental model of brain trauma in adult mouse we found a strong suppressive effect of the sodium-potassium-chloride importer (NKCC1) specific antagonist bumetanide on appearance of depression-like behavior. We demonstrate that this alteration in behavior is associated with a block of CCI-induced decrease in parvalbumin-positive interneurons and impairment of post-traumatic secondary neurogenesis within the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. The mechanism mediating the effect of bumetanide involves early transient changes in expression of chloride regulatory proteins and qualitative changes in GABA(A) mediated transmission after brain trauma. This work opens new perspectives in the early treatment of human post-traumatic induced depression. Our results strongly suggest that bumetanide might constitute an efficient prophylactic treatment to reduce neurological and psychiatric consequences of brain trauma.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/442194v1?rss=1">How face perception unfolds over time</a></h4>

Within a fraction of a second of viewing a face, we have already determined its gender, age and identity. A full understanding of this remarkable feat will require a characterization of the computational steps it entails, along with the representations extracted at each. Here we used magnetencephalography to ask which properties of a face are extracted when, and how early in processing these computations are affected by face familiarity. Subjects viewed images of familiar and unfamiliar faces varying orthogonally in gender and age. Using representational similarity analysis, we found that gender and age information emerged significantly earlier than identity information, followed by a late signature of familiarity. Importantly, gender and identity representations were enhanced for familiar faces early during processing. These findings start to reveal the sequence of processing steps entailed in face perception in humans, and suggest that early stages of face processing are tuned to familiar face features.

<p>by Ivan Tomić, Paul M. Bays</p>

The precision with which visual information can be recalled from working memory declines as the number of items in memory increases. This finding has been explained in terms of the distribution of a limited representational resource between items. Here we investigated how the sensory strength of memoranda affects resource allocation. We manipulated signal strength of an orientation stimulus in two ways: we varied the internal (sensory) noise by adjusting stimulus contrast, and varied the external (stimulus) noise by altering the within-stimulus variability. Both manipulations had similar effects on the precision with which the orientation could be recalled, but differed in their impact on memory for other stimuli. These results indicate that increasing internal noise released resources that could be used to store other stimuli more precisely; increasing external noise had no such effect. We show that these observations can be captured by a simple neural model of working memory encoding, in which spiking activity takes on the role of the limited resource.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/532tuGBOm9M" width="1" />

Abstract<p>The quick and reliable detection and identification of a tastant in the mouth regulate nutrient uptake and toxin expulsion. Consistent with the pivotal role of the gustatory system, taste category information (e.g. sweet, salty) is represented during the earliest phase of the taste-evoked cortical response (Crouzet et al., 2015) and different tastes are perceived and responded to within only a few hundred milliseconds, in rodents (Perez et al., 2013) and humans (Bujas, 1935). Currently, it is unknown whether taste detection and discrimination are sequential or parallel processes, i.e. whether you know what it is as soon as you taste it. To investigate the sequence of processing steps involved in taste perceptual decisions, participants tasted sour, salty, bitter, and sweet solutions and performed a taste-detection and a taste-discrimination task. We measured response times and 64-channel scalp electrophysiological recordings, and tested the link between the timing of behavioral decisions and the timing of neural taste representations determined with multivariate pattern analyses. Irrespective of taste and task, neural decoding onset and behavioral response times were strongly related, demonstrating that differences between taste judgments are reflected early during chemosensory encoding. Neural and behavioral detection times were faster for the iso-hedonic salty and sour tastes than their discrimination time. No such latency difference was observed for sweet and bitter, which differ hedonically. Together, these results indicate that the human gustatory system detects a taste faster than it discriminates between tastes, yet hedonic computations may run in parallel (Perez et al., 2013) and facilitate taste identification.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Human response behavior reflects the culmination of multiple processing stages, so that the emergence of the commonly observed response delay between simple and more complex gustatory perceptual decisions remained unaddressed. For the first time, we show a strong correspondence between neural and behavioral task-dependent latency differences, providing evidence that this lag is represented during early chemosensory encoding, rather than resulting from higher-level cognitive processing. Moreover, we find that the processing sequence itself varies with taste contrast, likely dependent on hedonics. We suggest that taste hedonic features are processed in parallel to purely sensory computations with the potential to facilitate stimulus identification in the human gustatory sense, supporting the concept of a flexible sequence of gustatory coding states.</p>

<p>Many probabilistic models of interest in scientific computing and machine
learning have expensive, black-box likelihoods that prevent the application of
standard techniques for Bayesian inference, such as MCMC, which would require
access to the gradient or a large number of likelihood evaluations. We
introduce here a novel sample-efficient inference framework, Variational
Bayesian Monte Carlo (VBMC). VBMC combines variational inference with
Gaussian-process based, active-sampling Bayesian quadrature, using the latter
to efficiently approximate the intractable integral in the variational
objective. Our method produces both a nonparametric approximation of the
posterior distribution and an approximate lower bound of the model evidence,
useful for model selection. We demonstrate VBMC both on several synthetic
likelihoods and on a neuronal model with data from real neurons. Across all
tested problems and dimensions (up to $D = 10$), VBMC performs consistently
well in reconstructing the posterior and the model evidence with a limited
budget of likelihood evaluations, unlike other methods that work only in very
low dimensions. Our framework shows great promise as a novel tool for posterior
and model inference with expensive, black-box likelihoods.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/41973">Dynamic neuromuscular remodeling precedes motor-unit loss in a mouse model of ALS</a></h4>

Despite being an early event in ALS, it remains unclear whether the denervation of neuromuscular junctions (NMJ) is simply the first manifestation of a globally degenerating motor neuron. Using <i>in vivo</i> imaging of single axons and their NMJs over a three-month period, we identify that single motor-units are dismantled asynchronously in <i>SOD1<sup>G37R</sup></i> mice. We reveal that weeks prior to complete axonal degeneration, the dismantling of axonal branches is accompanied by contemporaneous new axonal sprouting resulting in synapse formation onto nearby NMJs. Denervation events tend to propagate from the first lost NMJ, consistent with a contribution of neuromuscular factors extrinsic to motor neurons, with distal branches being more susceptible. These results show that NMJ denervation in ALS is a complex and dynamic process of continuous denervation and new innervation rather than a manifestation of sudden global motor neuron degeneration.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/41901">Can Hamilton's rule be violated?</a></h4>

How generally Hamilton's rule holds is a much debated question. The answer to that question depends on how costs and benefits are defined. When using the regression method to define costs and benefits, there is no scope for violations of Hamilton's rule. We introduce a general model for assortative group compositions to show that, when using the counterfactual method for computing costs and benefits, there is room for violations. The model also shows that there are limitations to observing violations in equilibrium, as the discrepancies between Hamilton's rule and the direction of selection may imply that selection will take the population out of the region of disagreement, precluding observations of violations in equilibrium. Given what it takes to create a violation, empirical tests of Hamilton's rule, both in and out of equilibrium, require the use of statistical models that allow for identifying non-linearities in the fitness function.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/40474">RalB directly triggers invasion downstream Ras by mobilizing the Wave complex</a></h4>

The two Ral GTPases, RalA and RalB, have crucial roles downstream Ras oncoproteins in human cancers; in particular, RalB is involved in invasion and metastasis. However, therapies targeting Ral signalling are not available yet. By a novel optogenetic approach, we found that light-controlled activation of Ral at plasma-membrane promotes the recruitment of the Wave Regulatory Complex (WRC) via its effector exocyst, with consequent induction of protrusions and invasion. We show that active Ras signals to RalB via two RalGEFs (Guanine nucleotide Exchange Factors), RGL1 and RGL2, to foster invasiveness; RalB contribution appears to be more important than that of MAPK and PI3K pathways. Moreover, on the clinical side, we uncovered a potential role of RalB in human breast cancers by determining that RalB expression at protein level increases in a manner consistent with progression toward metastasis. This work highlights the Ras-RGL1/2-RalB-exocyst-WRC axis as appealing target for novel anti-cancer strategies.

The intracellular parasite <i>Toxoplasma gondii,</i> hijacks evolutionarily conserved host processes by delivering effector proteins into the host cell that shift gene expression in a timely fashion. We identified a parasite dense granule protein as GRA18 that once released in the host cell cytoplasm forms versatile complexes with regulatory elements of the β-catenin destruction complex. By interacting with GSK3/PP2A-B56, GRA18 drives β-catenin up-regulation and the downstream effects on host cell gene expression. In the context of macrophages infection, GRA18 induces the expression of a specific set of genes commonly associated with an anti-inflammatory response that includes those encoding chemokines CCL17 and CCL22. Overall, this study adds another original strategy by which <i>T. gondii</i> tachyzoites reshuffle the host cell interactome through a GSK3/β-catenin axis to selectively reprogram immune gene expression.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/39655">Dynein-2 intermediate chains play crucial but distinct roles in primary cilia formation and function</a></h4>

The dynein-2 microtubule motor is the retrograde motor for intraflagellar transport. Mutations in dynein-2 components cause skeletal ciliopathies, notably Jeune syndrome. Dynein-2 contains a heterodimer of two non-identical intermediate chains, WDR34 and WDR60. Here, we use knockout cell lines to demonstrate that each intermediate chain has a distinct role in cilium function. Using quantitative proteomics, we show that WDR34 KO cells can assemble a dynein-2 motor complex that binds IFT proteins yet fails to extend an axoneme, indicating complex function is stalled. In contrast, WDR60 KO cells do extend axonemes but show reduced assembly of dynein-2 and binding to IFT proteins. Both proteins are required to maintain a functional transition zone and for efficient bidirectional intraflagellar transport. Our results indicate that the subunit asymmetry within the dynein-2 complex is matched with a functional asymmetry between the dynein-2 intermediate chains. Furthermore, this work reveals that loss of function of dynein-2 leads to defects in transition zone architecture, as well as intraflagellar transport.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/39440">Myosin V functions as a vesicle tether at the plasma membrane to control neurotransmitter release in central synapses</a></h4>

Synaptic vesicle fusion occurs at specialized release sites at the active zone. How refilling of release sites with new vesicles is regulated in central synapses remains poorly understood. Using nanoscale-resolution detection of individual release events in rat hippocampal synapses we found that inhibition of myosin V, the predominant vesicle-associated motor, strongly reduced refilling of the release sites during repetitive stimulation. Single-vesicle tracking revealed that recycling vesicles continuously shuttle between a plasma membrane pool and an inner pool. Vesicle retention at the membrane pool was regulated by neural activity in a myosin V dependent manner. Ultrastructural measurements of vesicle occupancy at the plasma membrane together with analyses of single-vesicle trajectories during vesicle shuttling between the pools suggest that myosin V acts as a vesicle tether at the plasma membrane, rather than a motor transporting vesicles to the release sites, or directly regulating vesicle exocytosis.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/38821">Screening of candidate substrates and coupling ions of transporters by thermostability shift assays</a></h4>

Substrates of most transport proteins have not been identified, limiting our understanding of their role in physiology and disease. Traditional identification methods use transport assays with radioactive compounds, but they are technically challenging and many compounds are unavailable in radioactive form or are prohibitively expensive, precluding large-scale trials. Here, we present a high-throughput screening method that can identify candidate substrates from libraries of unlabeled compounds. The assay is based on the principle that transport proteins recognize substrates through specific interactions, which lead to enhanced stabilization of the transporter population in thermostability shift assays. Representatives of three different transporter (super)families were tested, which differ in structure as well as transport and ion coupling mechanisms. In each case, the substrates were identified correctly from a large set of chemically related compounds, including stereo-isoforms. In some cases, stabilization by substrate binding was enhanced further by ions, providing testable hypotheses on energy coupling mechanisms.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/38362">Structural basis for isoform-specific kinesin-1 recognition of Y-acidic cargo adaptors</a></h4>

The light chains (KLCs) of the heterotetrameric microtubule motor kinesin-1, that bind to cargo adaptor proteins and regulate its activity, have a capacity to recognize short peptides via their tetratricopeptide repeat domains (KLC<sup>TPR</sup>). Here, using X-ray crystallography, we show how kinesin-1 recognizes a novel class of adaptor motifs that we call 'Y-acidic' (tyrosine flanked by acidic residues), in a KLC-isoform specific manner. Binding specificities of Y-acidic motifs (present in JIP1 and in TorsinA) to KLC1<sup>TPR</sup> are distinct from those utilized for the recognition of W-acidic motifs found in adaptors that are KLC- isoform non-selective. However, a partial overlap on their receptor binding sites implies that adaptors relying on Y-acidic and W-acidic motifs must act independently. We propose a model to explain why these two classes of motifs that bind to the concave surface of KLC<sup>TPR</sup> with similar low micromolar affinity can exhibit different capacities to promote kinesin-1 activity.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/37551">Species and cell-type properties of classically defined human and rodent neurons and glia</a></h4>

Determination of the molecular properties of genetically targeted cell types has led to fundamental insights into mouse brain function and dysfunction. Here, we report an efficient strategy for precise exploration of gene expression and epigenetic events in specific cell types in a range of species, including postmortem human brain. We demonstrate that classically defined, homologous neuronal and glial cell types differ between rodent and human by the expression of hundreds of orthologous, cell specific genes. Confirmation that these genes are differentially active was obtained using epigenetic mapping and immunofluorescence localization. Studies of sixteen human postmortem brains revealed gender specific transcriptional differences, cell-specific molecular responses to aging, and the induction of a shared, robust response to an unknown external event evident in three donor samples. Our data establish a comprehensive approach for analysis of molecular events associated with specific circuits and cell types in a wide variety of human conditions.

                <h4><a href="https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy221/5132771?rss=1">Cortical Balance Between ON and OFF Visual Responses Is Modulated by the Spatial Properties of the Visual Stimulus</a></h4>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The primary visual cortex of carnivores and primates is dominated by the OFF visual pathway and responds more strongly to dark than light stimuli. Here, we demonstrate that this cortical OFF dominance is modulated by the size and spatial frequency of the stimulus in awake primates and we uncover a main neuronal mechanism underlying this modulation. We show that large grating patterns with low spatial frequencies drive five times more OFF-dominated than ON-dominated neurons, but this pronounced cortical OFF dominance is strongly reduced when the grating size decreases and the spatial frequency increases, as when the stimulus moves away from the observer. We demonstrate that the reduction in cortical OFF dominance is not caused by a selective reduction of visual responses in OFF-dominated neurons but by a change in the ON/OFF response balance of neurons with diverse receptive field properties that can be ON or OFF dominated, simple, or complex. We conclude that cortical OFF dominance is continuously adjusted by a neuronal mechanism that modulates ON/OFF response balance in multiple cortical neurons when the spatial properties of the visual stimulus change with viewing distance and/or optical blur.</span>

After injury, activation and recruitment of inflammatory and immune cells has been thought to occur throughout the whole body. A recent study shows that after brain injury in mice, immune cells are primarily recruited from nearby skull bone marrow and invade the brain through microscopic vascular channels. Manipulation of this process may provide new therapeutic options.

Converging evidence across species highlights the contribution of environmental stress to anhedonia (loss of pleasure and/or motivation). However, despite a clear link between stress and the emergence of anhedonic-like behavior in both human and animal models, the underlying biological pathways remain elusive. Here, we synthesize recent findings across multiple levels, from molecular signaling pathways through whole-brain networks, to discuss mechanisms through which stress may influence anhedonia.

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/I5VLXmddQbU/article">State dependence of stimulus-induced variability tuning in macaque MT</a></h4>

<p>by Joseph A. Lombardo, Matthew V. Macellaio, Bing Liu, Stephanie E. Palmer, Leslie C. Osborne</p>

Behavioral states marked by varying levels of arousal and attention modulate some properties of cortical responses (e.g. average firing rates or pairwise correlations), yet it is not fully understood what drives these response changes and how they might affect downstream stimulus decoding. Here we show that changes in state modulate the tuning of response variance-to-mean ratios (Fano factors) in a fashion that is neither predicted by a Poisson spiking model nor changes in the mean firing rate, with a substantial effect on stimulus discriminability. We recorded motion-sensitive neurons in middle temporal cortex (MT) in two states: alert fixation and light, opioid anesthesia. Anesthesia tended to lower average spike counts, without decreasing trial-to-trial variability compared to the alert state. Under anesthesia, within-trial fluctuations in excitability were correlated over longer time scales compared to the alert state, creating supra-Poisson Fano factors. In contrast, alert-state MT neurons have higher mean firing rates and largely sub-Poisson variability that is stimulus-dependent and cannot be explained by firing rate differences alone. The absence of such stimulus-induced variability tuning in the anesthetized state suggests different sources of variability between states. A simple model explains state-dependent shifts in the distribution of observed Fano factors via a suppression in the variance of gain fluctuations in the alert state. A population model with stimulus-induced variability tuning and behaviorally constrained information-limiting correlations explores the potential enhancement in stimulus discriminability by the cortical population in the alert state.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/I5VLXmddQbU" width="1" />

                <h4><a href="http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0397-17.2018v1?rss=1">Targeted activation of cholinergic interneurons accounts for the modulation of dopamine by striatal nicotinic receptors</a></h4>

Abstract<p>Striatal dopamine (DA) is a major player in action selection and reinforcement. DA release is under strong local control by striatal ACh acting at axonal nicotinic ACh receptors (nAChRs) on DA axons. Striatal nAChRs have been shown to control how DA is released in response to ascending activity from DA neurons, and they also directly drive DA release following synchronized activity in a small local cholinergic network. The source of striatal ACh has been thought to arise solely from intrinsic cholinergic interneurons (ChIs), but recent findings have identified a source of cholinergic inputs to striatum from brainstem nuclei, the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) and laterodorsal tegmentum (LDT). Here, we used targeted optogenetic activation alongside DA detection with fast-scan cyclic voltammetry to test whether ChIs alone and/or brainstem afferents to the striatum can account for how ACh drives and modulates DA release in rat striatum. We demonstrate that targeted transient light activation of rat striatal ChIs drives striatal DA release, corroborating and extending previous observations in mouse to rat. However, the same light stimulation targeted to cholinergic brainstem afferents did not drive DA release, and nor did it modulate DA release activated subsequently by electrical stimulation, whereas targeted activation of ChIs did so. We were unable to obtain any evidence for DA modulation by PPN/LDT stimulation. By contrast, we could readily identify that striatal ChIs alone are sufficient to provide a source of ACh that powerfully regulates DA via nAChRs.</p><p><b>Significance statement</b> Striatal acetylcholine (ACh) can powerfully regulate striatal dopamine (DA). Until recently, cholinergic interneurons were thought to be the only source of striatal ACh, but brainstem cholinergic neurons have now been revealed to innervate striatum. Here, we use targeted optogenetic activation in rats to explore which input accounts for the rapid regulation of striatal DA release. We find that targeted activation of striatal cholinergic interneurons in rat striatal slices can reproduce how striatal ACh drives and modulates dopamine release in mouse, but we could not find comparable evidence for a role for brainstem cholinergic inputs. Activation of cholinergic interneurons alone can reproduce the previously documented effects of activating all striatal ACh systems on DA release.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0326-18.2018v1?rss=1">COMT inhibition alters cued-evoked oscillatory dynamics during alcohol drinking in the rat</a></h4>

Abstract<p><b>Background:</b> Alterations in the corticostriatal system have been implicated in numerous substance use disorders, including alcohol use disorder (AUD). Adaptations in this neural system are associated with enhanced drug-seeking behaviors following exposure to cues predicting drug availability. Therefore, understanding how potential treatments alter neural activity in this system could lead to more refined and effective approaches for AUD. <b>Methods:</b> Local field potentials (LFPs) were acquired simultaneously in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and nucleus accumbens (NA) of both alcohol preferring (P) and Wistar rats engaged in a Pavlovian conditioning paradigm wherein a light cue signaled the availability of ethanol. On test days, the COMT inhibitor tolcapone was administered prior to conditioning. <b>Results:</b> Stimulus-evoked voltage changes were observed following the presentation of the ethanol cue in both strains, and were most pronounced in the PFC of P rats. Phase analyses of LFPs in the theta band (5-11 Hz) revealed that PFC-NA synchrony was reduced in P rats relative to Wistars, but was robustly increased during drinking. Presentation of the cue resulted in a larger phase reset in the PFC of P rats but not Wistars, an effect that was attenuated by tolcapone. Additionally, tolcapone reduced cued ethanol intake in P rat but not Wistars. <b>Conclusions:</b> These results suggest a link between corticostriatal synchrony and genetic risk for excessive drinking. Moreover, inhibition of COMT within these systems may result in reduced attribution of salience to reward paired stimuli via modulation of stimulus-evoked changes to cortical oscillations in genetically susceptible populations.</p><p><b>Significance statement</b> Alcoholism is highly heritable and genetic vulnerability is associated with increased likelihood of alcohol-use related problems. Presentation of environmental stimuli paired with alcohol are capable of inducing craving and relapse in alcohol dependent individuals. The work described here using a rodent model of cued ethanol availability suggests that altered corticostriatal activity may be associated with genetic vulnerability to abuse alcohol. Additionally, our data suggest that inhibition of the COMT enzyme activity may reduce the influence that alcohol-conditioned stimuli elicit on behavior, resulting in a reduction of cued alcohol seeking in genetically susceptible individuals.</p>

<p>Complex problem solving is a high level cognitive process which has been
thoroughly studied over the last decade. The Tower of London (TOL) is a task
that has been widely used to study problem-solving. In this study, we aim to
explore the underlying cognitive network dynamics among anatomical regions of
complex problem solving and its sub-phases, namely planning and execution. A
new brain network construction model establishing dynamic functional brain
networks using fMRI is proposed. The first step of the model is a preprocessing
pipeline that manages to decrease the spatial redundancy while increasing the
temporal resolution of the fMRI recordings. Then, dynamic brain networks are
estimated using artificial neural networks. The network properties of the
estimated brain networks are studied in order to identify regions of interest,
such as hubs and subgroups of densely connected brain regions. The major
similarities and dissimilarities of the network structure of planning and
execution phases are highlighted. Our findings show the hubs and clusters of
densely interconnected regions during both subtasks. It is observed that there
are more hubs during the planning phase compared to the execution phase, and

<p>by Daniel Strömbom, Audrey Dussutour</p>

Ants, termites and humans often form well-organized and highly efficient trails between different locations. Yet the microscopic traffic rules responsible for this organization and efficiency are not fully understood. In previous experimental studies with leaf-cutting ants (<i>Atta colombica</i>), a set of local priority rules were isolated and it was proposed that these rules govern the temporal and spatial organization of the traffic on the trails. Here we introduce a model based on these priority rules to investigate whether they are sufficient to produce traffic similar to that observed in the experiments on both a narrow and a wider trail. We establish that the model is able to reproduce key characteristics of the traffic on the trails. In particular, we show that the proposed priority rules induce de-synchronization into clusters of inbound and outbound ants on a narrow trail, and that priority-type dependent segregated traffic emerges on a wider trail. Due to the generic nature of the proposed priority rules we speculate that they may be used to model traffic organization in a variety of other ant species.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/mqMMX0_JVcg" width="1" />

Fly development amazes us by the precision and reproducibility of gene expression, especially since the initial expression patterns are established during very short nuclear cycles. Recent live imaging of <i>hunchback</i> promoter dynamics shows a stable steep binary expression pattern established within the three minute interphase of nuclear cycle 11. Considering expression models of different complexity, we explore the trade-off between the ability of a regulatory system to produce a steep boundary and minimize expression variability between different nuclei. We show how a limited readout time imposed by short developmental cycles affects the gene’s ability to read positional information along the embryo’s anterior posterior axis and express reliably. Comparing our theoretical results to real-time monitoring of the <i>hunchback</i> transcription dynamics in live flies, we discuss possible regulatory strategies, suggesting an important role for additional binding sites, gradients or non-equilibrium binding and modified transcription factor search strategies.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/NmHDABd2idw" width="1" />

We present the results of a model inversion algorithm for electrocorticography (ECoG) data recorded during epileptic seizures. The states and parameters of neural mass models were tracked during a total of over 3000 seizures from twelve patients with focal epilepsy. These models provide an estimate of the effective connectivity within intracortical circuits over the time course of seizures. Observing the dynamics of effective connectivity provides insight into mechanisms of seizures. Estimation of patients seizure dynamics revealed: 1) a highly stereotyped pattern of evolution for each patient, 2) distinct sub-groups of onset mechanisms amongst patients, and 3) different offset mechanisms for long and short seizures. Stereotypical dynamics suggest that, once initiated, seizures follow a deterministic path through the parameter space of a neural model. Furthermore, distinct sub-populations of patients were identified based on characteristic motifs in the dynamics at seizure onset. There were also distinct patterns between long and short duration seizures that were related to seizure offset. Understanding how these different patterns of seizure evolution arise may provide new insights into brain function and guide treatment for epilepsy, since specific therapies may have preferential effects on the various parameters that could potentially be individualized. Methods that unite computational models with data provide a powerful means to generate testable hypotheses for further experimental research. This work provides a demonstration that the hidden connectivity parameters of a neural mass model can be dynamically inferred from data. Our results underscore the power of theoretical models to inform epilepsy management. It is our hope that this work guides further efforts to apply computational models to clinical data.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/FP4XLutG9Ic" width="1" />

<p>by Lars Ole Schwen, Sabrina Rueschenbaum</p>

Most studies in the life sciences and other disciplines involve generating and analyzing numerical data of some type as the foundation for scientific findings. Working with numerical data involves multiple challenges. These include reproducible data acquisition, appropriate data storage, computationally correct data analysis, appropriate reporting and presentation of the results, and suitable data interpretation.
Finding and correcting mistakes when analyzing and interpreting data can be frustrating and time-consuming. Presenting or publishing incorrect results is embarrassing but not uncommon. Particular sources of errors are inappropriate use of statistical methods and incorrect interpretation of data by software. To detect mistakes as early as possible, one should frequently check intermediate and final results for plausibility. Clearly documenting how quantities and results were obtained facilitates correcting mistakes. Properly understanding data is indispensable for reaching well-founded conclusions from experimental results. Units are needed to make sense of numbers, and uncertainty should be estimated to know how meaningful results are. Descriptive statistics and significance testing are useful tools for interpreting numerical results if applied correctly. However, blindly trusting in computed numbers can also be misleading, so it is worth thinking about how data should be summarized quantitatively to properly answer the question at hand. Finally, a suitable form of presentation is needed so that the data can properly support the interpretation and findings. By additionally sharing the relevant data, others can access, understand, and ultimately make use of the results.
These quick tips are intended to provide guidelines for correctly interpreting, efficiently analyzing, and presenting numerical data in a useful way.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/OAsr7tu2D9w" width="1" />

Abstract<p>Microglia are highly motile immune-reactive cells that play integral roles in the response to brain infection and damage, and in the progression of various neurological diseases. During development, microglia also help sculpt neural circuits, via both promoting synapse formation and by targeting specific synapses for elimination and phagocytosis. Microglia are also active surveyors of neural circuits in the mature, healthy brain, although the functional consequences of such microglia-neuron contacts under these conditions is unclear. Using <i>in vivo</i> imaging of neurons and microglia in awake mice, we report here the functional consequences of microglia-synapse contacts. Direct contact between a microglial process and a single synapse results in a specific increase in the activity of that contacted synapse, and a corresponding increase in back-propagating action potentials along the parent dendrite. This increase in activity is not seen for microglia-synapse contacts when microglia are activated by chronic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment. To probe how this microglia-synapse contact affects neural circuits, we imaged across larger populations of motor cortical neurons. When microglia were again activated by LPS (or partially ablated) there was a decrease in the extent to which neuronal activity was synchronized. Together our results demonstrate that interactions between physiological or resting microglia and synapses in the mature, healthy brain leads to an increase in neuronal activity and thereby helps to synchronize local populations of neurons. Our novel findings provide a plausible physical basis for understanding how alterations in immune status may impact on neural circuit plasticity and on cognitive behaviors such as learning.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Microglia, the sole immune cells in the central nervous system, make frequent contacts with synapses on dendritic spines, but the functional significance of these contact has remained elusive. In this study we use <i>in vivo</i> two photon imaging and demonstrate that microglia contact on spines increases synaptic activity. This microglia-induced increase in synaptic activity enhances the synchronization of neuronal populations. This increase synchrony is inhibited by microglial activation, proving a possible mechanistic basis for how immune status may impact on neural circuit function.</p>

<p>In this work the stochastic generalization of single Hodgkin-Huxley neuron is
further extended to unidirectionally coupled neurons. Our main focus is to
elucidate the role of channel noise in the kinetics and energetics of spiking
of action potential and the synchronization between two coupled neurons. We
have found that the size of the patch is playing the pivotal role in
synchronization and metabolic energy consumption. For example, there exists
three different patch size ranges in which coupled neuron system behaves in a
different manner from noise enhanced phase to dead range state before reaching
the deterministic limit. We have also found that the sodium and potassium
channel blockers have characteristic kinetic and energetic effects on
synchronization process and metabolic energy consumption rate which has been
validated with the simulated data.

<p>Designing artificial cyber-agents able to interact with human safely, smartly
and in a natural way is a current open problem in control. Solving such an
issue will allow the design of cyber-agents capable of co-operatively
interacting with people in order to fulfil common joint tasks in a multitude of
different applications. This is particularly relevant in the context of
healthcare applications. Indeed, the use has been proposed of artificial agents
interacting and coordinating their movements with those of a patient suffering
from social or motor disorders. Specifically, it has been shown that an
artificial agent exhibiting certain kinematic properties could provide
innovative and efficient rehabilitation strategies for these patients.
Moreover, it has also been shown that the level of motor coordination is
enhanced if these kinematic properties are similar to those of the individual
it is interacting with. In this paper we discuss, first, a new method based on
Markov Chains to confer "human motor characteristics" on a virtual agent, so as
that it can coordinate its motion with that of a target individual while
exhibiting specific kinematic properties. Then, we embed such synthetic model
in a control architecture based on reinforcement learning to synthesize a
cyber-agent able to mimic the behaviour of a specific human performing a joint
motor task with one or more individuals.

<p>A central question in neuroscience is how to develop realistic models that
predict output firing behavior based on provided external stimulus. Given a set
of external inputs and a set of output spike trains, the objective is to
discover a network structure which can accomplish the transformation as
accurately as possible. Due to the difficulty of this problem in its most
general form, approximations have been made in previous work. Past
approximations have sacrificed network size, recurrence, allowed spiked count,
or have imposed layered network structure. Here we present a learning rule
without these sacrifices, which produces a weight matrix of a leaky
integrate-and-fire (LIF) network to match the output activity of both
deterministic LIF networks as well as probabilistic integrate-and-fire (PIF)
networks. Inspired by synaptic scaling, our pre-synaptic pool modification
(PSPM) algorithm outputs deterministic, fully recurrent spiking neural networks
that can provide a novel generative model for given spike trains. Similarity in
output spike trains is evaluated with a variety of metrics including a
van-Rossum like measure and a numerical comparison of inter-spike interval
distributions. Application of our algorithm to randomly generated networks
improves similarity to the reference spike trains on both of these stated
measures. In addition, we generated LIF networks that operate near criticality
when trained on critical PIF outputs. Our results establish that learning rules
based on synaptic homeostasis can be used to represent input-output
relationships in fully recurrent spiking neural networks.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Cajal-Retzius (CR) cells are one of the earliest populations of neurons in the cerebral cortex of rodents and primates, and they play a critical role in corticogenesis and cortical lamination during neocortical development. However, a comprehensive morphological and physiological profile of CR cells in the mouse neocortex has not yet been established. Here, we systematically investigated the dynamic development of CR cells in Tg(Ebf2-EGFP)58Gsat/Mmcd mice. The morphological complexity, membrane activities and presynaptic inputs of CR cells coordinately increase and reach a plateau at P5–P9 before regressing. Using 3D reconstruction, we delineated a parallel-stratification pattern of the axonal extension of CR cells. Furthermore, we found that the morphological structure and presynaptic inputs of CR cells were disturbed in Reelin-deficient mice. These findings confirm that CR cells undergo a transient maturation process in layer 1 before disappearing. Importantly, Reelin deficiency impairs the formation of synaptic connections onto CR cells. In conclusion, our results provide insights into the rapid maturation and axonal stratification of CR cells in layer 1. These findings suggest that both the electrophysiological activities and the morphology of CR cells provide vital guidance for the modulation of early circuits, in a Reelin-dependent manner.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Individual differences in humans are driven by unique brain structural and functional profiles, presumably mediated in part through differential cortical gene expression. However, the relationships between cortical gene expression profiles and individual differences in large-scale neural network organization remain poorly understood. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether the magnitude of sequence alterations in regional cortical genes mapped onto brain areas with high degree of functional connectivity variability across individuals. First, human genetic expression data from the Allen Brain Atlas was used to identify protein-coding genes associated with cortical areas, which delineated the regional genetic signature of specific cortical areas based on sequence alteration profiles. Thereafter, we identified brain regions that manifested high degrees of individual variability by using test-retest functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging and graph-theory analyses in healthy subjects. We found that rates of genetic <span style="font-style: italic;">sequence alterations</span> shared a distinct spatial topography with cortical regions exhibiting individualized (highly-variable) connectivity profiles. Interestingly, gene expression profiles of brain regions with highly individualized connectivity patterns and elevated number of sequence alterations are devoted to <span style="font-style: italic;">neuropeptide-signaling-pathways</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">chemical-synaptic-transmission</span>. Our findings support that genetic <span style="font-style: italic;">sequence alterations</span> may underlie important aspects of brain connectome individualities in humans.Significance Statement: The neurobiological underpinnings of our individuality as humans are still an unsolved question. Although the notion that genetic variation drives an individual’s brain organization has been previously postulated, specific links between neural connectivity and gene expression profiles have remained elusive. In this study, we identified the magnitude of population-based sequence alterations in discrete cortical regions and compared them to the brain topological distribution of functional connectivity variability across an independent human sample. We discovered that brain regions with high degree of connectional individuality are defined by increased rates of genetic sequence alterations; these findings specifically implicated genes involved in <span style="font-style: italic;">neuropeptide-signaling pathways</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">chemical-synaptic transmission</span>. These observations support that genetic <span style="font-style: italic;">sequence alterations</span> may underlie important aspects of the emergence of the brain individuality across humans.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Sparse representation is considered an important coding strategy for cortical processing in various sensory modalities. It remains unclear how cortical sparseness arises and is being regulated. Here, unbiased recordings from primary auditory cortex of awake adult mice revealed salient sparseness in layer (L)2/3, with a majority of excitatory neurons exhibiting no increased spiking in response to each of sound types tested. Sparse representation was not observed in parvalbumin (PV) inhibitory neurons. The nonresponding neurons did receive auditory-evoked synaptic inputs, marked by weaker excitation and lower excitation/inhibition (E/I) ratios than responding cells. Sparse representation arises during development in an experience-dependent manner, accompanied by differential changes of excitatory input strength and a transition from unimodal to bimodal distribution of E/I ratios. Sparseness level could be reduced by suppressing PV or L1 inhibitory neurons. Thus, sparse representation may be dynamically regulated via modulating E/I balance, optimizing cortical representation of the external sensory world.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Neural stem cells (NSCs) in the adult mouse hippocampus occur in a specific neurogenic niche, where a multitude of extracellular signaling molecules converges to regulate NSC proliferation as well as fate and functional integration. However, the underlying mechanisms how NSCs react to extrinsic signals and convert them to intracellular responses still remains elusive. NSCs contain a functional endocannabinoid system, including the cannabinoid type-1 receptor (CB1). To decipher whether CB1 regulates adult neurogenesis directly or indirectly <span style="font-style: italic;">in vivo</span>, we performed NSC-specific conditional inactivation of CB1 by using triple-transgenic mice. Here, we show that lack of CB1 in NSCs is sufficient to decrease proliferation of the stem cell pool, which consequently leads to a reduction in the number of newborn neurons. Furthermore, neuronal differentiation was compromised at the level of dendritic maturation pointing towards a postsynaptic role of CB1 <span style="font-style: italic;">in vivo</span>. Deteriorated neurogenesis in NSC-specific CB1 knock-outs additionally resulted in reduced long-term potentiation in the hippocampal formation. The observed cellular and physiological alterations led to decreased short-term spatial memory and increased depression-like behavior. These results demonstrate that CB1 expressed in NSCs and their progeny controls neurogenesis in adult mice to regulate the NSC stem cell pool, dendritic morphology, activity-dependent plasticity, and behavior.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>With increasing attention on the developmental causes of neuropsychiatric disorders, appropriate animal models are crucial to identifying causes and assessing potential interventions. The common marmoset is an ideal model as it has sophisticated social/emotional behavior, reaching adulthood within 2 years of birth. Magnetic resonance imaging was used in an accelerated longitudinal cohort (<span style="font-style: italic;">n</span> = 41; aged 3–27 months; scanned 2–7 times over 2 years). Splines were used to model nonlinear trajectories of grey matter volume development in 53 cortical areas and 16 subcortical nuclei. Generally, volumes increased before puberty, peaked, and declined into adulthood. We identified 3 milestones of grey matter development: I) age at peak volume; II) age at onset of volume decline; and III) age at maximum rate of volume decline. These milestones differentiated growth trajectories of primary sensory/motor cortical areas from those of association cortex but also revealed distinct trajectories between association cortices. Cluster analysis of trajectories showed that prefrontal cortex was the most heterogenous of association regions, comprising areas with distinct milestones and developmental trajectories. These results highlight the potential of high-field structural MRI to define the dynamics of primate brain development and importantly to identify when specific prefrontal circuits may be most vulnerable to environmental impact.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Aberrant regulation and activity of synaptic proteins may cause synaptic pathology in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of mood disorder patients. Carboxy-terminal PDZ ligand of NOS1 (CAPON) is a critical scaffold protein linked to synaptic proteins like nitric oxide synthase 1, synapsins. We hypothesized that CAPON is altered together with its interacting synaptic proteins in the PFC in mood disorder patients and may contribute to depression-like behaviors in mice subjected to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS). Here, we found that CAPON-immunoreactivity (ir) was significantly increased in the dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC) and anterior cingulate cortex in major depressive disorder (MDD), which was accompanied by an upregulation of spinophilin-ir and a downregulation of synapsin-ir. The increases in CAPON and spinophilin and the decrease in synapsin in the DLPFC of MDD patients were also seen in the PFC of CUMS mice. CAPON-ir positively correlated with spinophilin-ir (but not with synapsin-ir) in mood disorder patients. CAPON colocalized with spinophilin in the DLPFC of MDD patients and interacted with spinophilin in human brain. Viral-mediated CAPON downregulation in the medial PFC notably reversed the depression-like behaviors in the CUMS mice. These data suggest that CAPON may contribute to aspects of depressive behavior, possibly as an interacting protein for spinophilin in the PFC.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The development of the mammalian cerebral cortex involves a variety of temporally organized events such as successive waves of neuronal production and the transition of progenitor competence for each neuronal subtype generated. The number of neurons generated in a certain time period, that is, the rate of neuron production, varies across the regions of the brain and the specific developmental stage; however, the underlying mechanism of this process is poorly understood. We have recently found that nascent neurons communicate with undifferentiated progenitors and thereby regulate neurogenesis, through a transiently retained apical endfoot that signals via the Notch pathway. Here, we report that the retention time length of the neuronal apical endfoot correlates with the rate of neuronal production in the developing mouse cerebral cortex. We further demonstrate that a forced reduction or extension of the retention period through the disruption or stabilization of adherens junction, respectively, resulted in the acceleration or deceleration of neurogenesis, respectively. Our results suggest that the apical endfeet of differentiating cells serve as a pace controller for neurogenesis, thereby assuring the well-proportioned laminar organization of the neocortex.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Nonhuman primates, and great apes in particular, possess a variety of cognitive abilities thought to underlie human brain and cognitive evolution, most notably, the manufacture and use of tools. In a relatively large sample (<span style="font-style: italic;">N</span> = 226) of captive chimpanzees (<span style="font-style: italic;">Pan troglodytes</span>) for whom pedigrees are well known, the overarching aim of the current study was to investigate the source of heritable variation in brain structure underlying tool use skills. Specifically, using source-based morphometry (SBM), a multivariate analysis of naturally occurring patterns of covariation in gray matter across the brain, we investigated (1) the genetic contributions to variation in SBM components, (2) sex and age effects for each component, and (3) phenotypic and genetic associations between SBM components and tool use skill. Results revealed important sex- and age-related differences across largely heritable SBM components and associations between structural covariation and tool use skill. Further, shared genetic mechanisms appear to account for a heritable link between variation in both the capacity to use tools and variation in morphology of the superior limb of the superior temporal sulcus and adjacent parietal cortex. Findings represent the first evidence of heritability of structural covariation in gray matter among nonhuman primates.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Adult aging is associated with differences in structure, function, and connectivity of brain areas. Age-based brain comparisons have typically rested on the assumption that brain areas exhibit a similar spatial organization across age; we evaluate this hypothesis directly. Area parcellation methods that identify locations where resting-state functional correlations (RSFC) exhibit abrupt transitions (boundary-mapping) are used to define cortical areas in cohorts of individuals sampled across a large range of the human adult lifespan (20–93 years). Most of the strongest areal boundaries are spatially consistent across age. Differences in parcellation boundaries are largely explained by differences in cortical thickness and anatomical alignment in older relative to younger adults. Despite the parcellation similarities, age-specific parcellations exhibit better internal validity relative to a young-adult parcellation applied to older adults’ data, and age-specific parcels are better able to capture variability in task-evoked functional activity. Incorporating age-specific parcels as nodes in RSFC network analysis reveals that the spatial topography of the brain’s large-scale system organization is comparable throughout aging, but confirms that the segregation of systems declines with increasing age. These observations demonstrate that many features of areal organization are consistent across adulthood, and reveal sources of age-related brain variation that contribute to the differences.</span>

<p>by Ernest C. Y. Ho, Juan Nicolas Malagón, Abha Ahuja, Rama Singh, Ellen Larsen</p>

The morphogenesis of sex combs (SCs), a male trait in many species of fruit flies, is an excellent system in which to study the cell biology, genetics and evolution of a trait. In <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, where the incipient SC rotates from horizontal to a vertical position, three signal comb properties have been documented: length, final angle and shape (linearity). During SC rotation, in which many cellular processes are occurring both spatially and temporally, it is difficult to distinguish which processes are crucial for which attributes of the comb. We have used a novel approach combining simulations and experiments to uncover the spatio-temporal dynamics underlying SC rotation. Our results indicate that 1) the final SC shape is primarily controlled by the inhomogeneity of initial cell size in cells close to the immature comb, 2) the final angle is primarily controlled by later cell expansion and 3) a temporal sequence of cell expansion mitigates the malformations generally associated with longer rotated SCs. Overall, our work has linked together the morphological diversity of SCs and the cellular dynamics behind such diversity, thus providing important insights on how evolution may affect SC development via the behaviours of surrounding epithelial cells.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/EZcUqc7bSzc" width="1" />

The cardiac muscarinic receptor (M2R) regulates heart rate, in part, by modulating the acetylcholine (ACh) activated K<sup>+</sup> current <i>I</i><sub>K,ACh</sub> through dissociation of G-proteins, that in turn activate K<sub>ACh</sub> channels. Recently, M2Rs were noted to exhibit intrinsic voltage sensitivity, i.e. their affinity for ligands varies in a voltage dependent manner. The voltage sensitivity of M2R implies that the affinity for ACh (and thus the ACh effect) varies throughout the time course of a cardiac electrical cycle. The aim of this study was to investigate the contribution of M2R voltage sensitivity to the rate and shape of the human sinus node action potentials in physiological and pathophysiological conditions. We developed a Markovian model of the <i>I</i><sub>K,ACh</sub> modulation by voltage and integrated it into a computational model of human sinus node. We performed simulations with the integrated model varying ACh concentration and voltage sensitivity. Low ACh exerted a larger effect on <i>I</i><sub>K,ACh</sub> at hyperpolarized versus depolarized membrane voltages. This led to a slowing of the pacemaker rate due to an attenuated slope of phase 4 depolarization with only marginal effect on action potential duration and amplitude. We also simulated the theoretical effects of genetic variants that alter the voltage sensitivity of M2R. Modest negative shifts in voltage sensitivity, predicted to increase the affinity of the receptor for ACh, slowed the rate of phase 4 depolarization and slowed heart rate, while modest positive shifts increased heart rate. These simulations support our hypothesis that altered M2R voltage sensitivity contributes to disease and provide a novel mechanistic foundation to study clinical disorders such as atrial fibrillation and inappropriate sinus tachycardia.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/5GHzKb9ZyCk" width="1" />

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/41/8905?rss=1">Modulation of Beta Bursts in the Subthalamic Nucleus Predicts Motor Performance</a></h4>

<p>Considerable evidence suggests a role of beta-band oscillations in voluntary movements. However, most of the studies linking beta power to motor performance are based on data averaged across trials that ignore the fast dynamics of oscillatory activity and trial-to-trial variations in motor responses. Recently, emphasis has shifted from the functional implications of the mean beta power to the presence and nature of episodic bursts of beta activity. Here we test the hypothesis that beta bursts, though short in duration in more physiological state, may help explain spontaneous variations in motor behavior of human adults at the single-trial level. To this end, we recorded local field potential activity from the subthalamic nucleus of parkinsonian patients of both genders whose motor behavior had been normalized as far as possible through treatment with the dopamine prodrug, levodopa. We found that beta bursts present in a time-limited window well before movement onset in the contralateral subthalamic nucleus reduce the peak velocity of that movement and that this effect is further amplified by the amplitude of the burst. Additionally, prolonged reaction times are observed when bursts occur immediately after the GO cue. Together, these results suggest that the modulation of the timing and amplitude of beta bursts might serve to dynamically adapt motor performance. These results offer new insight in the pathology of Parkinson's disease, and suggest that beta bursts whose presence and nature are modulated by context may have a physiological role in modulating behavior.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Beta oscillations (~13–30 Hz) have been increasingly interpreted as transient bursts rather than as rhythmically sustained oscillations (Feingold et al., 2015). Prolonged and increased probability of beta bursts in the subthalamic nucleus correlates with the severity of motor impairment in Parkinson's disease (Tinkhauser et al., 2017a, b). However, it remains unclear whether beta bursts act to modify motor performance on a trial-by-trial basis under more physiological condition. Here, we found that, according to the time window in which they fall, beta bursts reduced the velocity of the forthcoming movement or prolonged the reaction time. These results offer new insight in the pathology of Parkinson's disease and also suggest that the modulation of beta bursts might serve to dynamically adapt motor performance.</p>

<p>Obesity affects &gt;600 million people worldwide, a staggering number that appears to be on the rise. One of the lesser known consequences of obesity is its deleterious effects on cognition, which have been well documented across many cognitive domains and age groups. To investigate the cellular mechanisms that underlie obesity-associated cognitive decline, we used diet-induced obesity in male mice and found memory impairments along with reductions in dendritic spines, sites of excitatory synapses, increases in the activation of microglia, the brain's resident immune cells, and increases in synaptic profiles within microglia, in the hippocampus, a brain region linked to cognition. We found that partial knockdown of the receptor for fractalkine, a chemokine that can serve as a "find me" cue for microglia, prevented microglial activation and cognitive decline induced by obesity. Furthermore, we found that pharmacological inhibition of microglial activation in obese mice was associated with prevention of both dendritic spine loss and cognitive degradation. Finally, we observed that pharmacological blockade of microglial phagocytosis lessened obesity-associated cognitive decline. These findings suggest that microglia play an active role in obesity-associated cognitive decline by phagocytosis of synapses that are important for optimal function.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Obesity in humans correlates with reduced cognitive function. To investigate the cellular mechanisms underlying this, we used diet-induced obesity in mice and found impaired performance on cognitive tests of hippocampal function. These deficits were accompanied by reduced numbers of dendritic spines, increased microglial activation, and increased synaptic profiles within microglia. Inhibition of microglial activation by transgenic and pharmacological methods prevented cognitive decline and dendritic spine loss in obese mice. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of the phagocytic activity of microglia was also sufficient to prevent cognitive degradation. This work suggests that microglia may be responsible for obesity-associated cognitive decline and dendritic spine loss.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/41/8874?rss=1">Differentiating between Models of Perceptual Decision Making Using Pupil Size Inferred Confidence</a></h4>

<p>During perceptual decisions, subjects often rely more strongly on early, rather than late, sensory evidence, even in tasks when both are equally informative about the correct decision. This early psychophysical weighting has been explained by an integration-to-bound decision process, in which the stimulus is ignored after the accumulated evidence reaches a certain bound, or confidence level. Here, we derive predictions about how the average temporal weighting of the evidence depends on a subject's decision confidence in this model. To test these predictions empirically, we devised a method to infer decision confidence from pupil size in 2 male monkeys performing a disparity discrimination task. Our animals' data confirmed the integration-to-bound predictions, with different internal decision bounds and different levels of correlation between pupil size and decision confidence accounting for differences between animals. However, the data were less compatible with two alternative accounts for early psychophysical weighting: attractor dynamics either within the decision area or due to feedback to sensory areas, or a feedforward account due to neuronal response adaptation. This approach also opens the door to using confidence more broadly when studying the neural basis of decision making.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> An animal's ability to adjust decisions based on its level of confidence, sometimes referred to as "metacognition," has generated substantial interest in neuroscience. Here, we show how measurements of pupil diameter in macaques can be used to infer their confidence. This technique opens the door to more neurophysiological studies of confidence because it eliminates the need for training on behavioral paradigms to evaluate confidence. We then use this technique to test predictions from competing explanations of why subjects in perceptual decision making often rely more strongly on early evidence: the way in which the strength of this effect should depend on a subject's decision confidence. We find that a bounded decision formation process best explains our empirical data.</p>

<p>During aging, acetylcholine receptor (AChR) clusters become fragmented and denervated at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Underpinning molecular mechanisms are not well understood. We showed that LRP4, a receptor for agrin and critical for NMJ formation and maintenance, was reduced at protein level in aged mice, which was associated with decreased MuSK tyrosine phosphorylation, suggesting compromised agrin-LRP4-MuSK signaling in aged muscles. Transgenic expression of LRP4 in muscles alleviated AChR fragmentation and denervation and improved neuromuscular transmission in aged mice. LRP4 ubiquitination was augmented in aged muscles, suggesting increased LRP4 degradation as a mechanism for reduced LRP4. We found that sarcoglycan α (SGα) interacted with LRP4 and delayed LRP4 degradation in cotransfected cells. AAV9-mediated expression of SGα in muscles mitigated AChR fragmentation and denervation and improved neuromuscular transmission in aged mice. These observations support a model where compromised agrin-LRP4-MuSK signaling serves as a pathological mechanism of age-related NMJ decline and identify a novel function of SGα in stabilizing LRP4 for NMJ stability in aged mice.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> This study provides evidence that LRP4, a receptor of agrin that is critical for NMJ formation and maintenance, is reduced at protein level in aged muscles. Transgenic expression of LRP4 in muscles ameliorates AChR fragmentation and denervation and improves neuromuscular transmission in aged mice, demonstrating a critical role of the agrin-LRP4-MuSK signaling. Our study also reveals a novel function of SGα to prevent LRP4 degradation in aged muscles. Finally, we show that NMJ decline in aged mice can be mitigated by AAV9-mediated expression of SGα in muscles. These observations provide insight into pathological mechanisms of age-related NMJ decline and suggest that improved agrin-LRP4-MuSK signaling may be a target for potential therapeutic intervention.</p>

<p>Deficits in motivation and cognition are hallmark symptoms of multiple psychiatric diseases. These symptoms are disruptive to quality of life and often do not improve with available medications. In recent years there has been increased interest in the role of the immune system in neuropsychiatric illness, but to date no immune-related treatment strategies have come to fruition. The cytokine granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) is known to have trophic and neuroprotective properties in the brain, and we recently identified it as a modulator of neuronal and behavioral plasticity. By combining operant tasks that assess discrete aspects of motivated behavior and decision-making in male mice and rats with subsecond dopamine monitoring via fast-scan cyclic voltammetry, we defined the role of G-CSF in these processes as well as the neural mechanism by which it modulates dopamine function to exert these effects. G-CSF enhanced motivation for sucrose as well as cognitive flexibility as measured by reversal learning. These behavioral outcomes were driven by mesolimbic dopamine system plasticity, as systemically administered G-CSF increased evoked dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens independent of clearance mechanisms. Importantly, sustained increases in G-CSF were required for these effects as acute exposure did not enhance behavioral outcomes and decreased dopamine release. These effects seem to be a result of the ability of G-CSF to alter local inflammatory signaling cascades, particularly tumor necrosis factor α. Together, these data show G-CSF as a potent modulator of the mesolimbic dopamine circuit and its ability to appropriately attend to salient stimuli.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Emerging evidence has highlighted the importance of the immune system in psychiatric diseases states. However, the effects of peripheral cytokines on motivation and cognitive function are largely unknown. Here, we report that granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), a pleiotropic cytokine with known trophic and neuroprotective properties in the brain, acts directly on dopaminergic circuits to enhance their function. These changes in dopaminergic dynamics enhance reward learning and motivation for natural stimuli. Together, these results suggest that targeting immune factors may provide a new avenue for therapeutic intervention in the multiple psychiatric disorders that are characterized by motivational and cognitive deficits.</p>

<p>Transforming a brief sensory event into a persistent neural response represents a mechanism for linking temporally disparate stimuli together to support learning. The cerebellum requires this type of persistent input during trace conditioning to engage associative plasticity and acquire adaptively timed conditioned responses (CRs). An initial step toward identifying the sites and mechanisms generating and transmitting persistent signals to the cerebellum is to identify the input pathway. The medial auditory thalamic nuclei (MATN) are the necessary and sufficient source of auditory input to the cerebellum for delay conditioning in rodents and a possible input to forebrain sites generating persistent signals. Using pharmacological and computational approaches, we test (1) whether the necessity of MATN during auditory eyelid conditioning is conserved across species, (2) whether the MATN are necessary for the expression of trace eyelid CRs, and if so, (3)whether this relates to the generation of persistent signals. We find that contralateral inactivation of MATN with muscimol largely abolished trace and delay CRs in male rabbits. Residual CRs were decreased in amplitude, but CR timing was unaffected. Results from large-scale cerebellar simulations are consistent with previous experimental demonstrations that silencing only CS-duration inputs does not abolish trace CRs, and instead affects their timing. Together, these results suggest that the MATN are a necessary component of both the direct auditory stimulus pathway to the cerebellum and the pathway generating task-essential persistent signals.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Persistent activity is required for working memory-dependent tasks, such as trace conditioning, and represents a mechanism by which sensory information can be used over time for learning and cognition. This neuronal response entails the transformation of a discrete sensory-evoked response into a signal that extends beyond the stimulus event. Understanding the generation and transmission of this stimulus transformation requires identifying the input sources necessary for task-essential persistent signals. We report that the medial auditory thalamic nuclei are required for the expression of auditory trace conditioning and suggest that these nuclei are a component of the pathway-generating persistent signals. Our study provides a foundation for testing circuit-level mechanisms underlying persistent activity in a cerebellar learning model with identified inputs and well defined behavioral outputs.</p>

<p>Prediction errors are critical for associative learning. In the brain, these errors are thought to be signaled, in part, by midbrain dopamine neurons. However, although there is substantial direct evidence that brief increases in the firing of these neurons can mimic positive prediction errors, there is less evidence that brief pauses mimic negative errors. Whereas pauses in the firing of midbrain dopamine neurons can substitute for missing negative prediction errors to drive extinction, it has been suggested that this effect might be attributable to changes in salience rather than the operation of this signal as a negative prediction error. Here we address this concern by showing that the same pattern of inhibition will create a cue able to meet the classic definition of a conditioned inhibitor by showing suppression of responding in a summation test and slower learning in a retardation test. Importantly, these classic criteria were designed to rule out explanations founded on attention or salience; thus the results cannot be explained in this manner. We also show that this pattern of behavior is not produced by a single, prolonged, ramped period of inhibition, suggesting that it is precisely timed, sudden change and not duration that conveys the teaching signal.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Here we show that brief pauses in the firing of midbrain dopamine neurons are sufficient to produce a cue that meets the classic criteria defining a conditioned inhibitor, or a cue that predicts the omission of a reward. These criteria were developed to distinguish actual learning from salience or attentional effects; thus these results formally show that brief pauses in the firing of dopamine neurons can serve as key teaching signals in the brain. Interestingly, this was not true for gradual prolonged pauses, suggesting it is the dynamic change in firing that serves as the teaching signal.</p>

<p>The dorsal horn of the spinal cord represents the first relay station in the pain pathway where primary nociceptive inputs are modulated by local circuits and by descending signals before being relayed to supraspinal nuclei. To determine whether dopamine can modulate primary nociceptive A- and C-fiber signals, the effects of dopamine were tested on the excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) recorded from large lamina I neurons and from retrograde-labeled spinoparabrachial lamina I neurons upon stimulation of the L4/L5 dorsal root in horizontal spinal cord slices <i>in vitro</i>. Dopamine inhibited the EPSCs in a dose-dependent manner, with substantial inhibition (33%) at 1 μm and maximum inhibition (~70%) at 10–20 μm. Dopamine reduced the frequency of miniature EPSCs recorded from large lamina I neurons, increased the paired pulse depression ratio of paired EPSCs, and induced similar inhibition of EPSCs after dialysis of large lamina I neurons with GDP-β-S, consistent with actions at presynaptic sites. Pharmacological experiments suggested that the inhibitory effects of dopamine were largely mediated by D4 receptors (53%). Similar inhibition (66%) by dopamine was observed on EPSCs recorded from ipsilateral large lamina I neurons 6 d after injection of complete Freund's adjuvant in the hindpaw, suggesting that dopamine downregulates primary nociceptive inputs to lamina I neurons during chronic inflammatory pain. We propose that presynaptic inhibition of primary nociceptive inputs to lamina I projection neurons is a mechanism whereby dopamine can inhibit incoming noxious stimuli to the dorsal horn of the spinal cord.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Lamina I projection neurons represent the main output for the pain signals from the dorsal horn of the spinal cord to brainstem and thalamic nuclei. We found that dopamine inhibits the nociceptive A- and C-fiber synaptic inputs to lamina I projection neurons via presynaptic actions. Similar inhibitory effects of dopamine on the EPSCs were observed in rats subjected to complete Freund's adjuvant to induce peripheral inflammation, suggesting that dopamine inhibits the synaptic inputs to lamina I neurons in the setting of injury. A better understanding of how primary nociceptive inputs to the dorsal horn of the spinal cord are modulated by descending monoaminergic signals may help in the development of new pharmacological strategies to selectively downregulate the output from lamina I projection neurons.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/41/8798?rss=1">The Role of Cholinergic Midbrain Neurons in Startle and Prepulse Inhibition</a></h4>

<p>One of the two major cholinergic centers of the mammalian brain is located in the midbrain, i.e., the pedunculopontine tegmentum (PPTg) and the adjacent laterodorsal tegmentum. These cholinergic neurons have been shown to be important for e.g., arousal, reward associations, and sleep. They also have been suggested to mediate sensorimotor gating, measured as prepulse inhibition of startle (PPI). PPI disruptions are a hallmark of schizophrenia and are observed in various other psychiatric disorders, where they are associated with, and often predictive of, other cognitive symptoms. PPI has been proposed to be mediated by a short midbrain circuitry including inhibitory cholinergic projections from PPTg to the startle pathway. Although the data indicating the involvement of the PPTg is very robust, some more recent evidence challenges that there is a cholinergic contribution to PPI. We here use transient optogenetic activation of specifically the cholinergic PPTg neurons in male and female rats to address their role in startle modulation in general, and in PPI specifically. Although we could confirm the crucial role of PPTg cholinergic neurons in associative reward learning, validating our experimental approach, we found that activation of cholinergic PPTg neurons did not inhibit startle responses. In contrast, activation of cholinergic PPTg neurons enhanced startle, which is in accordance with their general role in arousal and indicate a potential involvement in sensitization of startle. We conclude that noncholinergic PPTg neurons mediate PPI in contrast to the longstanding hypothetical view that PPI is mediated by cholinergic PPTg neurons.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Activation of cholinergic neurons in the midbrain has been assumed to mediate prepulse inhibition of startle (PPI), a common measure of sensorimotor gating that is disrupted in schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders. We here revisit this long-standing hypothesis using optogenetic activation of these specific neurons combined with startle testing in rats. In contrast to the hypothetical role of these neurons in startle modulation, we show that their activation leads to an increase of baseline startle and to prepulse facilitation. This supports recent data by others that have started to cast some doubt on the cholinergic hypothesis of PPI, and calls for a revision of the theoretical construct of PPI mechanisms.</p>

<p>The anterolateral motor cortex (ALM) and ventral medial (VM) thalamus are functionally linked to support persistent activity during motor planning. We analyzed the underlying synaptic interconnections using optogenetics and electrophysiology in mice (female/male). In cortex, thalamocortical (TC) axons from VM thalamus excited VM-projecting pyramidal tract (PT) neurons in layer 5B of ALM. These axons also strongly excited layer 2/3 neurons (which strongly excite PT neurons, as previously shown) but not VM-projecting corticothalamic (CT) neurons in layer 6. The strongest connections in the VM -&gt; PT circuit were localized to apical tuft dendrites of PT neurons, in layer 1. These tuft inputs were selectively augmented after blocking hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels. In thalamus, axons from ALM PT neurons excited ALM-projecting VM neurons, located medially in VM. These axons provided weak input to neurons in mediodorsal nucleus, and little or no input either to neurons in the GABAergic reticular thalamic nucleus or to neurons in VM projecting to primary motor cortex (M1). Conversely, M1 PT axons excited M1- but not ALM-projecting VM neurons. Our findings indicate, first, a set of cell type-specific connections forming an excitatory thalamo-cortico-thalamic loop for ALM  VM communication and a circuit-level substrate for supporting reverberant activity in this system. Second, a key feature of this loop is the prominent involvement of layer 1 synapses onto apical dendrites, a subcellular compartment with distinct signaling properties, including HCN-mediated gain control. Third, the segregation of the ALM  VM loop from M1-related circuits of VM adds cellular-level support for the concept of parallel pathway organization in the motor system.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Anterolateral motor cortex (ALM), a higher-order motor area in the mouse, and ventromedial (VM) thalamus are anatomically and functionally linked, but their synaptic interconnections at the cellular level are unknown. Our results show that ALM pyramidal tract neurons monosynaptically excite ALM-projecting thalamocortical neurons in a medial subdivision of VM thalamus, and vice versa. The thalamo-cortico-thalamic loop formed by these recurrent connections constitutes a circuit-level substrate for supporting reverberant activity in this system.</p>

<p>Two major checkpoints of development in cerebral cortex are the acquisition of continuous spontaneous activity and the modulation of this activity by behavioral state. Despite the critical importance of these functions, the circuit mechanisms of their development remain unknown. Here we use the rodent visual system as a model to test the hypothesis that the locus of circuit change responsible for the developmental acquisition of continuity and state dependence measured in sensory cortex is relay thalamus, rather than the local cortical circuitry or the interconnectivity of the two structures. We conducted simultaneous recordings in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) and primary visual cortex (VC) of awake, head-fixed male and female rats using linear multielectrode arrays throughout early development. We find that activity in dLGN becomes continuous and positively correlated with movement (a measure of state dependence) on P13, the same day as VC, and that these properties are not dependent on VC activity. By contrast, silencing dLGN after P13 causes activity in VC to become discontinuous and movement to suppress, rather than augment, cortical firing, effectively reversing development. Thalamic bursting, a core characteristic of non-aroused states, emerged later, on P16, suggesting these processes are developmentally independent. Together our results indicate that cellular or circuit changes in relay thalamus are critical drivers for the maturation of background activity, which occurs around term in humans.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The developing brain acquires two crucial features, continuous spontaneous activity and its modulation by arousal state, around term in humans and before the onset of sensory experience in rodents. This developmental transition in cortical activity, as measured by electroencephalogram (EEG), is an important milestone for normal brain development and indicates a good prognosis for babies born preterm and/or suffering brain damage such as hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. By using the awake rodent visual system as a model, we identify changes occurring at the level of relay thalamus, the major input to cortex, as the critical driver of EEG maturation. These results could help understand the circuit basis of human EEG development to improve diagnosis and treatment of infants in vulnerable situations.</p>

<p>Neuromuscular control of voluntary movement may be simplified using muscle synergies similar to those found using non-negative matrix factorization. We recently identified synergies in electromyography (EMG) recordings associated with both voluntary movement and movement evoked by high-frequency long-duration intracortical microstimulation applied to the forelimb representation of the primary motor cortex (M1). The goal of this study was to use stimulus-triggered averaging (StTA) of EMG activity to investigate the synergy profiles and weighting coefficients associated with poststimulus facilitation, as synergies may be hard-wired into elemental cortical output modules and revealed by StTA. We applied StTA at low (LOW, ~15 μA) and high intensities (HIGH, ~110 μA) to 247 cortical locations of the M1 forelimb region in two male rhesus macaques while recording the EMG of 24 forelimb muscles. Our results show that 10–11 synergies accounted for 90% of the variation in poststimulus EMG facilitation peaks from the LOW-intensity StTA dataset while only 4–5 synergies were needed for the HIGH-intensity dataset. Synergies were similar across monkeys and current intensities. Most synergy profiles strongly activated only one or two muscles; all joints were represented and most, but not all, joint directions of motion were represented. Cortical maps of the synergy weighting coefficients suggest only a weak organization. StTA of M1 resulted in highly diverse muscle activations, suggestive of the limiting condition of requiring a synergy for each muscle to account for the patterns observed.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Coordination of muscle activity and the neural origin of potential muscle synergies remains a fundamental question of neuroscience. We previously demonstrated that high-frequency long-duration intracortical microstimulation-evoked synergies were unrelated to voluntary movement synergies and were not clearly organized in the cortex. Here we present stimulus-triggered averaging facilitation-related muscle synergies, suggesting that when fundamental cortical output modules are activated, synergies approach the limit of single-muscle control. Thus, we conclude that if the CNS controls movement via linear synergies, those synergies are unlikely to be called from M1. This information is critical for understanding neural control of movement and the development of brain–machine interfaces.</p>

<p>Using region-specific injection of hyaluronic acid, we developed a mouse model of acute retinal detachment (RD) to investigate molecular mechanisms of photoreceptor cell death triggered by RD. We focused on the transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) ion channel, which functions as a thermosensor, osmosensor, and/or mechanosensor. After RD, the number of apoptotic photoreceptors was reduced by ~50% in TRPV4KO mice relative to wild-type mice, indicating the possible involvement of TRPV4 activation in RD-induced photoreceptor cell death. Furthermore, TRPV4 expressed in Müller glial cells can be activated by mechanical stimuli caused by RD-induced swelling of these cells, resulting in release of the cytokine MCP-1, which is reported as a mediator of Müller glia-derived strong mediator for RD-induced photoreceptor death. We also found that the TRPV4 activation by the Müller glial swelling was potentiated by body temperature. Together, our results suggest that RD adversely impacts photoreceptor viability via TRPV4-dependent cytokine release from Müller glial cells and that TRPV4 is part of a novel molecular pathway that could exacerbate the effects of hypoxia on photoreceptor survival after RD.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Identification of the mechanisms of photoreceptor death in retinal detachment is required for establishment of therapeutic targets for preventing loss of visual acuity. In this study, we found that TRPV4 expressed in Müller glial cells can be activated by mechanical stimuli caused by RD-induced swelling of these cells, resulting in release of the cytokine MCP-1, which is reported as a mediator of Müller glia-derived strong mediator for RD-induced photoreceptor death. We also found that the TRPV4 activation by the Müller glial swelling was potentiated by body temperature. Hence, TRPV4 inhibition could suppress cell death in RD pathological conditions and suggests that TRPV4 in Müller glial cells might be a novel therapeutic target for preventing photoreceptor cell death after RD.</p>

<p>Regulators of G-protein signaling (RGS) proteins negatively modulate presynaptic μ-opioid receptor inhibition of GABA release in the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG). Paradoxically, we find that G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) activation of G-protein-gated inwardly rectifying K<sup>+</sup> channels (GIRKs) in the vlPAG is reduced in an agonist- and receptor-dependent manner in transgenic knock-in mice of either sex expressing mutant RGS-insensitive Gαo proteins. μ-Opioid receptor agonist activation of GIRK currents was reduced for DAMGO and fentanyl but not for [Met<sup>5</sup>]-enkephalin acetate salt hydrate (ME) in the RGS-insensitive heterozygous (Het) mice compared with wild-type mice. The GABA<sub>B</sub> agonist baclofen-induced GIRK currents were also reduced in the Het mice. We confirmed the role of Gαo proteins in μ-opioid receptor and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor signaling pathways in wild-type mice using myristoylated peptide inhibitors of Gαo<sub>1</sub> and Gαi<sub>1–3</sub>. The results using these inhibitors indicate that receptor activation of GIRK channels is dependent on the preference of the agonist-stimulated receptor for Gαo versus that for Gαi. DAMGO and fentanyl-mediated GIRK currents were reduced in the presence of the Gαo<sub>1</sub> inhibitor, but not the Gαi<sub>1–3</sub> inhibitors. In contrast, the Gαo<sub>1</sub> peptide inhibitor did not affect ME activation of GIRK currents, which is consistent with results in the Het mice, but the Gαi<sub>1–3</sub> inhibitors significantly reduced ME-mediated GIRK currents. Finally, the reduction in GIRK activation in the Het mice plays a role in opioid- and baclofen-mediated spinal antinociception, but not supraspinal antinociception. Thus, our studies indicate that RGS proteins have multiple mechanisms of modulating GPCR signaling that produce negative and positive regulation of signaling depending on the effector.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Regulators of G-protein signaling (RGS) proteins positively modulate GPCR coupling to GIRKs, and this coupling is critical for opioid- and baclofen-mediated spinal antinociception, whereas μ-opioid receptor-mediated supraspinal antinociception depends on presynaptic inhibition that is negatively regulated by RGS proteins. The identification of these opposite roles for RGS proteins has implications for signaling via other GPCRs.</p>

<p>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients often exhibit slowed information processing speed that can underlie diverse symptoms. Processing speed depends on neural circuit function at synapses, in the soma, and along axons. Long axons in white matter (WM) tracts are particularly vulnerable to TBI. We hypothesized that disrupted axon–myelin interactions that slow or block action potential conduction in WM tracts may contribute to slowed processing speed after TBI. Concussive TBI in male/female mice was used to produce traumatic axonal injury in the corpus callosum (CC), similar to WM pathology in human TBI cases. Compound action potential velocity was slowed along myelinated axons at 3 d after TBI with partial recovery by 2 weeks, suggesting early demyelination followed by remyelination. Ultrastructurally, dispersed demyelinated axons and disorganized myelin attachment to axons at paranodes were apparent within CC regions exhibiting traumatic axonal injury. Action potential conduction is exquisitely sensitive to paranode abnormalities. Molecular identification of paranodes and nodes of Ranvier detected asymmetrical paranode pairs and abnormal heminodes after TBI. Fluorescent labeling of oligodendrocyte progenitors in <i>NG2CreER;mTmG</i> mice showed increased synthesis of new membranes extended along axons to paranodes, indicating remyelination after TBI. At later times after TBI, an overall loss of conducting axons was observed at 6 weeks followed by CC atrophy at 8 weeks. These studies identify a progression of both myelinated axon conduction deficits and axon–myelin pathology in the CC, implicating WM injury in impaired information processing at early and late phases after TBI. Furthermore, the intervening recovery reveals a potential therapeutic window.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major global health concern. Across the spectrum of TBI severities, impaired information processing can contribute to diverse functional deficits that underlie persistent symptoms. We used experimental TBI to exploit technical advantages in mice while modeling traumatic axonal injury in white matter tracts, which is a key pathological feature of human TBI. A combination of approaches revealed slowed and failed signal conduction along with damage to the structure and molecular composition of myelinated axons in the white matter after TBI. An early regenerative response was not sustained yet reveals a potential time window for intervention. These insights into white matter abnormalities underlying axon conduction deficits can inform strategies to improve treatment options for TBI patients.</p>

<p>We take an image science perspective on the problem of determining brain
network connectivity given functional activity. But adapting the concept of
image resolution to this problem, we provide a new perspective on network
partitioning for individual brain parcellation. The typical goal here is to
determine densely-interconnected subnetworks within a larger network by
choosing the best edges to cut. We instead define these subnetworks as
resolution cells, where highly-correlated activity within the cells makes edge
weights difficult to determine from the data. Subdividing the resolution
estimates into disjoint resolution cells via clustering yields a new variation,
and new perspective, on spectral clustering. This provides insight and
strategies for open questions such as the selection of model order and the
optimal choice of preprocessing steps for functional imaging data. The approach
is demonstrated using functional imaging data, where we find the proposed
approach produces parcellations which are more predictive across multiple scans
versus conventional methods, as well as versus alternative forms of spectral
clustering.

<p>While objects from different categories can be reliably decoded from fMRI
brain response patterns, it has proved more difficult to distinguish visually
similar inputs, such as different instances of the same category. Here, we
apply a recently developed deep learning system to the reconstruction of face
images from human fMRI patterns. We trained a variational auto-encoder (VAE)
neural network using a GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) unsupervised
training procedure over a large dataset of celebrity faces. The auto-encoder
latent space provides a meaningful, topologically organized 1024-dimensional
description of each image. We then presented several thousand face images to
human subjects, and learned a simple linear mapping between the multi-voxel
fMRI activation patterns and the 1024 latent dimensions. Finally, we applied
this mapping to novel test images, turning the obtained fMRI patterns into VAE
latent codes, and ultimately the codes into face reconstructions. Qualitative
and quantitative evaluation of the reconstructions revealed robust pairwise
decoding (&gt;95% correct), and a strong improvement relative to a baseline model
(PCA decomposition). Furthermore, this brain decoding model can readily be
recycled to probe human face perception along many dimensions of interest; for
example, the technique allowed for accurate gender classification, and even to
decode which face was imagined, rather than seen by the subject.

<p>The flow of information through the brain is reflected by the activity
patterns of neural cells. Indeed, these firing patterns are widely used as
input data to predictive models that relate stimuli and animal behavior to the
activity of a population of neurons. However, relatively little attention was
paid to single neuron spike trains as predictors of cell or network properties
in the brain. In this work, we introduce an approach to neuronal spike train
data mining which enables effective classification and clustering of neuron
types and network activity states based on single-cell spiking patterns. This
approach is centered around applying state-of-the-art time series
classification/clustering methods to sequences of interspike intervals recorded
from single neurons. We demonstrate good performance of these methods in tasks
involving classification of neuron type (e.g. excitatory vs. inhibitory cells)
and/or neural circuit activity state (e.g. awake vs. REM sleep vs. nonREM sleep
states) on an open-access cortical spiking activity dataset.

<p>Temporal resolution of visual information processing is thought to be an
important factor in predator-prey interactions, shaped in the course of
evolution by animals' ecology. Here I show that light can be considered to have
a dual role of a source of information, which guides motor actions, and an
environmental feedback for those actions. I consequently show how temporal
perception might depend on behavioral adaptations realized by the nervous
system. I propose an underlying mechanism of synaptic clock, with every synapse
having its characteristic time unit, determined by the persistence of memory
traces of synaptic inputs, which is used by the synapse to tell time. The
present theory offers a testable framework, which may account for numerous
experimental findings, including the interspecies variation in temporal
resolution and the properties of subjective time perception, specifically the
variable speed of perceived time passage, depending on emotional and
attentional states or tasks performed.

Cardiovascular dysfunction becomes recognized as a risk for dementia. In this issue of Neuron, Park et al. (2018) report the age-related, brain endothelial-specific upregulation of acid sphingomyelinase (ASM), leading to blood-brain barrier malfunction, neurodegeneration, and memory deficits that were mitigated by ASM inhibition in mice.

Neurexins have been established as a major coordinator of synapse assembly, functioning through interactions with postsynaptic cell adhesion molecules. Kurshan et al. now show that a C. elegans “dwarf neurexin” lacking its extracellular interaction domains can conduct synapse formation independent of postsynaptic partners.

Abstract<p>Our aim was to study the mechanisms that contribute to the development of discrete thalamic nuclei during mouse embryogenesis (both sexes included). We characterized the expression of the transcription factor coding gene <i>Zic4</i> and the distribution of cells that expressed <i>Zic4</i> in their lineage. We used genetic fate mapping to show that <i>Zic4</i>-lineage cells mainly contribute to a subset of thalamic nuclei, in particular the lateral geniculate nuclei, which are crucial components of the visual pathway. We observed that almost all <i>Zic4</i>-lineage diencephalic progenitors express the transcription factor Pax6 at variable location-dependent levels. We used conditional mutagenesis to delete either one or both copies of <i>Pax6</i> from <i>Zic4</i>-lineage cells. We found that <i>Zic4</i>-lineage cells carrying either homozygous or heterozygous loss of <i>Pax6</i> contributed in abnormally high numbers to one or both of the main lateral geniculate nuclei. This could not be attributed to a change in cell production and was likely due to altered sorting of thalamic cells. Our results indicate that positional information encoded by the levels of Pax6 in diencephalic progenitors is an important determinant of the eventual locations of their daughter cells.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> The development of the thalamus is a process in which cells that initially appear similar give rise to distinct cell groups called nuclei. How these nuclei form is poorly understood. We utilised a mouse model in which cells that express the gene <i>Zic4</i> can be followed. We studied the consequences of knocking out either one or both copies of the gene encoding the Pax6 transcription factor in these <i>Zic4</i>-lineage cells. We found that these mutations had significant effects on the contribution of <i>Zic4</i>-lineage cells to specifically visual thalamic nuclei. This was not attributable to a change in <i>Zic4</i>-lineage cell production in mutants. Rather, we suggest that mutation of Pax6 affects the distribution of <i>Zic4</i>-lineage neurons to specific thalamic nuclei.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0220-18.2018v1?rss=1">Identifying the in Vivo Cellular Correlates of Antipsychotic Drugs</a></h4>

Abstract<p>GPCRs such as 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> and D2 are implicated in the therapeutic and the side effects of antipsychotics. However, the pattern of brain activity that leads to the behavioural effects of antipsychotics is poorly understood. To address this question, we used the transgenic ‘FosTRAP’ mice (<i>Mus musculus</i>), where a fluorescent reporter marks the cells responsive to the stimulus of interest. Here the stimulus was an administration of various antipsychotic drugs. In case of typical antipsychotics such as Haloperidol, the <i>c-fos</i> active cells were predominantly found in the striatum whereas in case of the atypical antipsychotics (Clozapine and Olanzapine) <i>c-fos</i> induced cells were more numerous in the cortical regions e.g., orbital cortex, piriform cortex. Curiously, we also observed ependymal cells to be a novel cellular target of atypical antipsychotics. 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> is considered to be a major target for atypical antipsychotics. Therefore, we bred ‘FosTRAP’ mice with 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> knockout mice and tested their response to the prototype of atypical antipsychotics- Clozapine. Interestingly, the absence of 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> did not significantly affect the number of <i>c-fos</i> induced cells in the cortical regions. However, the ependymal cells showed a dramatically reduced response to Clozapine in the absence of 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>. In summary, the TRAP system has allowed us to identify various region-specific activity induced by antipsychotics and novel cellular targets of the antipsychotics. These results serve as a ‘proof of principle’ study that can be extended to explore the biochemical and physiological changes brought about by antipsychotics and specifically identify antipsychotic-responsive cells in the live tissue.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Antipsychotic drugs have been the first choice of treatment for mental illnesses such as Schizophrenia. Thorough understanding of the cellular and neuronal targets of these drugs should deepen our understanding of the pathophysiology of the mental disorders and help the development of improved therapy. We report here the use of FosTrap mice that allowed us to label cells and brain areas that were responsive to the antipsychotic treatment. We identified brain regions such as orbital cortex, piriform cortex and ventral posteromedial thalamus as the targets of the atypical class of antipsychotics. Importantly, we also report for the first time that, ependymal cells, lining the ventricles, are targeted by the atypical antipsychotics and this effect is modulated by the 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor.</p>

<p>Brain Computer Interfaces (BCIs) based on visual evoked potentials (VEP)
allow for spelling from a keyboard of flashing characters. Among VEP BCIs,
code-modulated visual evoked potentials (c-VEPs) are designed for high-speed
communication . In c-VEPs, all characters flash simultaneously. In particular,
each character flashes according to a predefined 63-bit binary sequence
(m-sequence), circular-shifted by a different time lag. For a given character,
the m-sequence evokes a VEP in the electroencephalogram (EEG) of the subject,
which can be used as a template. This template is obtained during a calibration
phase at the beginning of each session. Then, the system outputs the desired
character after a predefined number of repetitions by estimating its time lag
with respect to the template. Our work avoids the calibration phase, by
extracting from the VEP relative lags between successive characters, and
predicting the full word using a dictionary.

<p>Neuronal morphology is an essential element for brain activity and function.
We take advantage of current availability of brain-wide neuron digital
reconstructions of the Pyramidal cells from a mouse brain, and analyze several
emergent features of brain-wide neuronal morphology. We observe that axonal
trees are self-affine while dendritic trees are self-similar. We also show that
tree size appear to be random, independent of the number of dendrites within
single neurons. Moreover, we consider inhomogeneous branching model which
stochastically generates rooted 3-Cayley trees for the brain-wide neuron
topology. Based on estimated order-dependent branching probability from actual
axonal and dendritic trees, our inhomogeneous model quantitatively captures a
number of topological features including size and shape of both axons and
dendrites. This sheds lights on a universal mechanism behind the topological
formation of brain-wide axonal and dendritic trees.

<p>Testing two potentially multivariate variables for statistical dependence on
the basis finite samples is a fundamental statistical challenge. Here we
explore a family of tests that adapt to the complexity of the relationship
between the variables, promising robust power across scenarios. Building on the
distance correlation, we introduce a family of adaptive independence criteria
based on nonlinear monotonic transformations of distances. We show that these
criteria, like the distance correlation and RKHS-based criteria, provide
dependence indicators. We propose a class of adaptive (multi-threshold) test
statistics, which form the basis for permutation tests. These tests empirically
outperform some of the established tests in average and worst-case statistical
sensitivity across a range of univariate and multivariate relationships and
might deserve further exploration.

<p>Steady state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)-based brain computer interfaces
have shown its robustness in achieving high information transfer rate.
State-of-the-art training-based SSVEP decoding methods such as extended
Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) and Task-Related Component Analysis (TRCA)
are the major players that elevate the efficiency of SSVEP-based BCI through
individualized calibration process. However, the calibration may be
time-consuming in order to collect sufficient training templates, deteriorating
the practicality in real-world context. This study aims to develop a
cross-subject transferring approach to reduce the need of training data from a
new user. The proposed least-squares transformation (LST) method was able to
significantly reduce the training templates required for TRCA-based SSVEP
detection on a 40-class SSVEP dataset from 8 subjects. This study shed light on
plug-and-play high speed SSVEP-based BCI for further practical applications.

<p>by Vasileios Vavourakis, Triantafyllos Stylianopoulos, Peter A. Wijeratne</p>

The delivery of blood-borne therapeutic agents to solid tumours depends on a broad range of biophysical factors. We present a novel multiscale, multiphysics, in-silico modelling framework that encompasses dynamic tumour growth, angiogenesis and drug delivery, and use this model to simulate the intravenous delivery of cytotoxic drugs. The model accounts for chemo-, hapto- and mechanotactic vessel sprouting, extracellular matrix remodelling, mechano-sensitive vascular remodelling and collapse, intra- and extravascular drug transport, and tumour regression as an effect of a cytotoxic cancer drug. The modelling framework is flexible, allowing the drug properties to be specified, which provides realistic predictions of in-vivo vascular development and structure at different tumour stages. The model also enables the effects of neoadjuvant vascular normalisation to be implicitly tested by decreasing vessel wall pore size. We use the model to test the interplay between time of treatment, drug affinity rate and the size of the vessels endothelium pores on the delivery and subsequent tumour regression and vessel remodelling. Model predictions confirm that small-molecule drug delivery is dominated by diffusive transport and further predict that the time of treatment is important for low affinity but not high affinity cytotoxic drugs, the size of the vessel wall pores plays an important role in the effect of low affinity but not high affinity drugs, that high affinity cytotoxic drugs remodel the tumour vasculature providing a large window for the normalisation of the vascular architecture, and that the combination of large pores and high affinity enhances cytotoxic drug delivery efficiency. These results have implications for treatment planning and methods to enhance drug delivery, and highlight the importance of in-silico modelling in investigating the optimisation of cancer therapy on a personalised setting.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/G8Cye4lL4dQ" width="1" />

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/QfNrS1Ht3hA/article">Interactive reservoir computing for chunking information streams</a></h4>

<p>by Toshitake Asabuki, Naoki Hiratani, Tomoki Fukai</p>

Chunking is the process by which frequently repeated segments of temporal inputs are concatenated into single units that are easy to process. Such a process is fundamental to time-series analysis in biological and artificial information processing systems. The brain efficiently acquires chunks from various information streams in an unsupervised manner; however, the underlying mechanisms of this process remain elusive. A widely-adopted statistical method for chunking consists of predicting frequently repeated contiguous elements in an input sequence based on unequal transition probabilities over sequence elements. However, recent experimental findings suggest that the brain is unlikely to adopt this method, as human subjects can chunk sequences with uniform transition probabilities. In this study, we propose a novel conceptual framework to overcome this limitation. In this process, neural networks learn to predict dynamical response patterns to sequence input rather than to directly learn transition patterns. Using a mutually supervising pair of reservoir computing modules, we demonstrate how this mechanism works in chunking sequences of letters or visual images with variable regularity and complexity. In addition, we demonstrate that background noise plays a crucial role in correctly learning chunks in this model. In particular, the model can successfully chunk sequences that conventional statistical approaches fail to chunk due to uniform transition probabilities. In addition, the neural responses of the model exhibit an interesting similarity to those of the basal ganglia observed after motor habit formation.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/QfNrS1Ht3hA" width="1" />

<p>We describe a framework of hybrid cognition by formulating a hybrid cognitive
agent that performs hierarchical active inference across a human and a machine
part. We suggest that, in addition to enhancing human cognitive functions with
an intelligent and adaptive interface, integrated cognitive processing could
accelerate emergent properties within artificial intelligence. To establish
this, a machine learning part learns to integrate into human cognition by
explaining away multi-modal sensory measurements from the environment and
physiology simultaneously with the brain signal. With ongoing training, the
amount of predictable brain signal increases. This lends the agent the ability
to self-supervise on increasingly high levels of cognitive processing in order
to further minimize surprise in predicting the brain signal. Furthermore, with
increasing level of integration, the access to sensory information about
environment and physiology is substituted with access to their representation
in the brain. While integrating into a joint embodiment of human and machine,
human action and perception are treated as the machine's own. The framework can
be implemented with invasive as well as non-invasive sensors for environment,
body and brain interfacing. Online and offline training with different machine
learning approaches are thinkable. Building on previous research on shared
representation learning, we suggest a first implementation leading towards
hybrid active inference with non-invasive brain interfacing and state of the
art probabilistic deep learning methods. We further discuss how implementation
might have effect on the meta-cognitive abilities of the described agent and
suggest that with adequate implementation the machine part can continue to
execute and build upon the learned cognitive processes autonomously.

<p>Machine learning can extract information from neural recordings, e.g.,
surface EEG, ECoG and {\mu}ECoG, and therefore plays an important role in many
research and clinical applications. Deep learning with artificial neural
networks has recently seen increasing attention as a new approach in brain
signal decoding. Here, we apply a deep learning approach using convolutional
neural networks to {\mu}ECoG data obtained with a wireless, chronically
implanted system in an ovine animal model. Regularized linear discriminant
analysis (rLDA), a filter bank component spatial pattern (FBCSP) algorithm and
convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) were applied to auditory evoked
responses captured by {\mu}ECoG. We show that compared with rLDA and FBCSP,
significantly higher decoding accuracy can be obtained by ConvNets trained in
an end-to-end manner, i.e., without any predefined signal features. Deep
learning thus proves a promising technique for {\mu}ECoG-based brain-machine
interfacing applications.

<p>Artificial intelligence algorithms are capable of fantastic exploits, yet
they are still grossly inefficient compared with the brain's ability to learn
from few exemplars or solve problems that have not been explicitly defined.
What is the secret that the evolution of human intelligence has unlocked?
Generalization is one answer, but there is more to it. The brain does not
directly solve difficult problems, it is able to recast them into new and more
tractable problems. Here we propose a model whereby higher cognitive functions
profoundly interact with reinforcement learning to drastically reduce the
degrees of freedom of the search space, simplifying complex problems and
fostering more efficient learning.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Cortical D2 dopamine receptor (<span style="font-style: italic;">Drd2</span>) have mostly been examined in the context of cognitive function regulation and neurotransmission modulation of medial prefrontal cortex by principal neurons and parvalbumin positive, fast-spiking, interneurons in schizophrenia. Early studies suggested the presence of D2 receptors in several cortical areas, albeit with major technical limitations. We used combinations of transgenic reporter systems, recombinase activated viral vectors, quantitative translatome analysis, and high sensitivity in situ hybridization to identify D2 receptor expressing cells and establish a map of their respective projections. Our results identified previously uncharacterized clusters of D2 expressing neurons in limbic and sensory regions of the adult mouse brain cortex. Characterization of these clusters by translatome analysis and cell type specific labeling revealed highly heterogeneous expression of D2 receptors in principal neurons and various populations of interneurons across cortical areas. Transcript enrichment analysis also demonstrated variable levels of D2 receptor expression and several orphan G-protein-coupled receptors coexpression in different neuronal clusters, thus suggesting strategies for genetic and therapeutic targeting of D2 expressing neurons in specific cortical areas. These results pave the way for a thorough re-examination of cortical D2 receptor functions, which could provide information about neuronal circuits involved in psychotic and mood disorders.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Epilepsy is a multifactorial disorder associated with neuronal hyperexcitability that affects more than 1% of the human population. It has long been known that adenosine can reduce seizure generation in animal models of epilepsies. However, in addition to various side effects, the instability of adenosine has precluded its use as an anticonvulsant treatment. Here we report that a stable analogue of diadenosine-tetraphosphate: AppCH<sub>2</sub>ppA effectively suppresses spontaneous epileptiform activity in vitro and in vivo in a Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) mouse model (<span style="font-style: italic;">Tsc1</span><sup><span style="font-style: italic;">+/−</span></sup>), and in postsurgery cortical samples from TSC human patients. These effects are mediated by enhanced adenosine signaling in the cortex post local neuronal adenosine release. The released adenosine induces A1 receptor-dependent activation of potassium channels thereby reducing neuronal excitability, temporal summation, and hypersynchronicity. AppCH<sub>2</sub>ppA does not cause any disturbances of the main vital autonomous functions of <span style="font-style: italic;">Tsc1</span><sup><span style="font-style: italic;">+/</span>−</sup> mice in vivo. Therefore, we propose this compound to be a potent new candidate for adenosine-related treatment strategies to suppress intractable epilepsies.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Psychiatric conditions marked by impairments in cognitive control often emerge during adolescence, when the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and its inputs undergo structural and functional maturation and are vulnerable to disruption by external events. It is not known, however, whether there exists a specific temporal window within the broad range of adolescence when the development of PFC circuitry and its related behaviors are sensitive to disruption. Here we show, in male mice, that repeated exposure to amphetamine during early adolescence leads to impaired behavioral inhibition, aberrant PFC dopamine connectivity, and reduced PFC dopamine function in adulthood. Remarkably, these deficits are not observed following exposure to the exact same amphetamine regimen at later times. These findings demonstrate that there is a critical period for the disruption of the adolescent maturation of cognitive control and PFC dopamine function and suggest that early adolescence is particularly relevant to the emergence of psychopathology in humans.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Attention and saccadic adaptation (SA) are critical components of visual perception, the former enhancing sensory processing of selected objects, the latter maintaining the eye movements accuracy toward them. Recent studies propelled the hypothesis of a tight functional coupling between these mechanisms, possibly due to shared neural substrates. Here, we used magnetoencephalography to investigate for the first time the neurophysiological bases of this coupling and of SA per se. We compared visual discrimination performance of 12 healthy subjects before and after SA. Eye movements and magnetic signals were recorded continuously. Analyses focused on gamma band activity (GBA) during the pretarget period of the discrimination and the saccadic tasks. We found that GBA increases after SA. This increase was found in the right hemisphere for both postadaptation saccadic and discrimination tasks. For the latter, GBA also increased in the left hemisphere. We conclude that oculomotor plasticity involves GBA modulation within an extended neural network which persists after SA, suggesting a possible role of gamma oscillations in the coupling between SA and attention.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>There is now converging evidence that others’ actions are represented in the motor system. However, social cognition requires us to represent not only the actions but also the interactions of others. To do so, it is imperative that the motor system can represent multiple observed actions. The current fMRI study investigated whether this is possible by measuring brain activity from 29 participants while they observed 2 right hands performing sign language gestures. Three key results were obtained. First, brain activity in the premotor and parietal motor cortex was stronger when 2 hands performed 2 different gestures than when 1 hand performed a single gesture. Second, both individual observed gestures could be decoded from brain activity in the same 2 regions. Third, observing 2 different gestures compared with 2 identical gestures activated brain areas related to motor conflict, and this activity was correlated with parietal motor activity. Together, these results show that the motor system is able to represent multiple observed actions, and as such reveal a potential mechanism by which third-party social encounters could be processed in the brain.</span>

<p>by Iksoo Huh, Isabel Mendizabal, Taesung Park, Soojin V. Yi</p>

Recent advances in epigenomics have made it possible to map genome-wide regulatory regions using empirical methods. Subsequent comparative epigenomic studies have revealed that regulatory regions diverge rapidly between genome of different species, and that the divergence is more pronounced in enhancers than in promoters. To understand genomic changes underlying these patterns, we investigated if we can identify specific sequence fragments that are over-enriched in regulatory regions, thus potentially contributing to regulatory functions of such regions. Here we report numerous sequence fragments that are statistically over-enriched in enhancers and promoters of different mammals (which we refer to as ‘sequence determinants’). Interestingly, the degree of statistical enrichment, which presumably is associated with the degree of regulatory impacts of the specific sequence determinant, was significantly higher for promoter sequence determinants than enhancer sequence determinants. We further used a machine learning method to construct prediction models using sequence determinants. Remarkably, prediction models constructed from one species could be used to predict regulatory regions of other species with high accuracy. This observation indicates that even though the precise locations of regulatory regions diverge rapidly during evolution, the functional potential of sequence determinants underlying regulatory sequences may be conserved between species.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Q4TbfATi4e4" width="1" />

<p>by Istvan T. Kleijn, Laurens H. J. Krah, Rutger Hermsen</p>

In bacterial cells, gene expression, metabolism, and growth are highly interdependent and tightly coordinated. As a result, stochastic fluctuations in expression levels and instantaneous growth rate show intricate cross-correlations. These correlations are shaped by feedback loops, trade-offs and constraints acting at the cellular level; therefore a quantitative understanding requires an integrated approach. To that end, we here present a mathematical model describing a cell that contains multiple proteins that are each expressed stochastically and jointly limit the growth rate. Conversely, metabolism and growth affect protein synthesis and dilution. Thus, expression noise originating in one gene propagates to metabolism, growth, and the expression of all other genes. Nevertheless, under a small-noise approximation many statistical quantities can be calculated analytically. We identify several routes of noise propagation, illustrate their origins and scaling, and establish important connections between noise propagation and the field of metabolic control analysis. We then present a many-protein model containing &gt;1000 proteins parameterized by previously measured abundance data and demonstrate that the predicted cross-correlations between gene expression and growth rate are in broad agreement with published measurements.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/BQy09pr4TN8" width="1" />

                <h4><a href="http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/5/ENEURO.0221-18.2018?rss=1">Cocaine Exposure Modulates Perineuronal Nets and Synaptic Excitability of Fast-Spiking Interneurons in the Medial Prefrontal Cortex</a></h4>

Abstract
<p>We previously reported that perineuronal nets (PNNs) are required for cocaine-associated memories. Perineuronal nets are extracellular matrix that primarily surrounds parvalbumin (PV)-containing, GABAergic fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs) in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Here we measured the impact of acute (1 d) or repeated (5 d) cocaine exposure on PNNs and PV cells within the prelimbic and infralimbic regions of the mPFC. Adult rats were exposed to 1 or 5 d of cocaine and stained for PNNs (using <i>Wisteria floribunda</i> agglutinin) and PV intensity 2 or 24 h later. In the prelimbic and infralimbic PFC, PNN staining intensity decreased 2 h after 1 d of cocaine exposure but increased after 5 d of cocaine exposure. Cocaine also produced changes in PV intensity, which generally lagged behind that of PNNs. In the prelimbic PFC, both 1 and 5 d of cocaine exposure increased GAD65/67 puncta near PNN-surrounded PV cells, with an increase in the GAD65/67-to-VGluT1 puncta ratio after 5 d of cocaine exposure. In the prelimbic PFC, slice electrophysiology studies in FSIs surrounded by PNNs revealed that both 1 and 5 d of cocaine exposure reduced the number of action potentials 2 h later. Synaptic changes demonstrated that 5 d of cocaine exposure increased the inhibition of FSIs, potentially reducing the inhibition of pyramidal neurons and contributing to their hyperexcitability during relapse behavior. These early and rapid responses to cocaine may alter the network stability of PV FSIs that partially mediate the persistent and chronic nature of drug addiction.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.02107">A framework for the comparison of different EEG acquisition solutions. (arXiv:1810.02107v1 [q-bio.NC])</a></h4>

<p>The purpose of this work is to propose a framework for the benchmarking of
EEG amplifiers, headsets, and electrodes providing objective recommendation for
a given application. The framework covers: data collection paradigm, data
analysis, and statistical framework. To illustrate, data was collected from 12
different devices totaling up to 6 subjects per device. Two data acquisition
protocols were implemented: a resting-state protocol eyes-open (EO) and
eyes-closed (EC), and an Auditory Evoked Potential (AEP) protocol.
Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) on alpha band (EO/EC) and Event Related Potential
(ERP) were extracted as objective quantification of physiologically meaningful
information. Then, visual representation, univariate statistical analysis, and
multivariate model were performed to increase results interpretability.
Objective criteria show that the spectral SNR in alpha does not provide much
discrimination between systems, suggesting that the acquisition quality might
not be of primary importance for spectral and specifically alpha-based
applications. On the contrary, AEP SNR proved much more variable stressing the
importance of the acquisition setting for ERP experiments. The multivariate
analysis identified some individuals and some systems as independent
statistically significant contributors to the SNR. It highlights the importance
of inter-individual differences in neurophysiological experiments (sample size)
and suggests some device might objectively be superior to others when it comes
to ERP recordings. However, the illustration of the proposed benchmarking
framework suffers from severe limitations including small sample size and sound
card jitter in the auditory stimulations. While these limitations hinders a
definite ranking of the evaluated hardware, we believe the proposed
benchmarking framework to be a modest yet valuable contribution to the field.

Speech has long been recognized as ‘special’. Here, we suggest that one of the reasons for speech being special is that our auditory system has evolved to encode it in an efficient, optimal way. The theory of efficient neural coding argues that our perceptual systems have evolved to encode environmental stimuli in the most efficient way. Mathematically, this can be achieved if the optimally efficient codes match the statistics of the signals they represent. Experimental evidence suggests that the auditory code is optimal in this mathematical sense: statistical properties of speech closely match response properties of the cochlea, the auditory nerve, and the auditory cortex.

Many pathological conditions, such as seizures, stroke, and spreading depression, are associated with substantial changes in ion concentrations in the extracellular space (ECS) of the brain. An understanding of the mechanisms that govern ECS concentration dynamics may be a prerequisite for understanding such pathologies. To estimate the transport of ions due to electrodiffusive effects, one must keep track of both the ion concentrations and the electric potential simultaneously in the relevant regions of the brain. Although this is currently unfeasible experimentally, it is in principle achievable with computational models based on biophysical principles and constraints. Previous computational models of extracellular ion-concentration dynamics have required extensive computing power, and therefore have been limited to either phenomena on very small spatiotemporal scales (micrometers and milliseconds), or simplified and idealized 1-dimensional (1-D) transport processes on a larger scale. Here, we present the 3-D Kirchhoff-Nernst-Planck (KNP) framework, tailored to explore electrodiffusive effects on large spatiotemporal scales. By assuming electroneutrality, the KNP-framework circumvents charge-relaxation processes on the spatiotemporal scales of nanometers and nanoseconds, and makes it feasible to run simulations on the spatiotemporal scales of millimeters and seconds on a standard desktop computer. In the present work, we use the 3-D KNP framework to simulate the dynamics of ion concentrations and the electrical potential surrounding a morphologically detailed pyramidal cell. In addition to elucidating the single neuron contribution to electrodiffusive effects in the ECS, the simulation demonstrates the efficiency of the 3-D KNP framework. We envision that future applications of the framework to more complex and biologically realistic systems will be useful in exploring pathological conditions associated with large concentration variations in the ECS.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/m141eIlY3sI" width="1" />

<p>by Ling Chen, Alexandra E. Fish, John A. Capra</p>

Genomic regions with gene regulatory enhancer activity turnover rapidly across mammals. In contrast, gene expression patterns and transcription factor binding preferences are largely conserved between mammalian species. Based on this conservation, we hypothesized that enhancers active in different mammals would exhibit conserved sequence patterns in spite of their different genomic locations. To investigate this hypothesis, we evaluated the extent to which sequence patterns that are predictive of enhancers in one species are predictive of enhancers in other mammalian species by training and testing two types of machine learning models. We trained support vector machine (SVM) and convolutional neural network (CNN) classifiers to distinguish enhancers defined by histone marks from the genomic background based on DNA sequence patterns in human, macaque, mouse, dog, cow, and opossum. The classifiers accurately identified many adult liver, developing limb, and developing brain enhancers, and the CNNs outperformed the SVMs. Furthermore, classifiers trained in one species and tested in another performed nearly as well as classifiers trained and tested on the same species. We observed similar cross-species conservation when applying the models to human and mouse enhancers validated in transgenic assays. This indicates that many short sequence patterns predictive of enhancers are largely conserved. The sequence patterns most predictive of enhancers in each species matched the binding motifs for a common set of TFs enriched for expression in relevant tissues, supporting the biological relevance of the learned features. Thus, despite the rapid change of active enhancer locations between mammals, cross-species enhancer prediction is often possible. Our results suggest that short sequence patterns encoding enhancer activity have been maintained across more than 180 million years of mammalian evolution.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/b9OpfD0Vd78" width="1" />

Abstract<p>In central respiratory circuitry, synaptic excitation is responsible for synchronizing neuronal activity in the different respiratory rhythm phases, whereas chloride-mediated inhibition is important for shaping the respiratory pattern itself. The potassium chloride co-transporter KCC2, which serves to maintain low intraneuronal Cl<sup>-</sup> concentration and thus render chloride-mediated synaptic signaling inhibitory, exists in two isoforms, KCC2a and KCC2b. KCC2 is essential for functional breathing motor control at birth, but the specific contribution of the KCC2a isoform remains unknown. Here, to address this issue we investigated the respiratory phenotype of mice deficient for KCC2a. <i>In vivo</i> plethysmographic recordings revealed that KCC2a-deficient pups at P0 transiently express an abnormally low breathing rate and a high occurrence of apneas. Immunostainings confirmed that KCC2a is normally expressed in the brainstem neuronal groups involved in breathing (preBötzinger complex, parafacial respiratory group, hypoglossus nucleus), and is absent in these regions in the KCC2a<sup>-/-</sup> mutant. However, in variously reduced <i>in vitro</i> medullary preparations, spontaneous rhythmic respiratory activity is similar to that expressed in wild-type preparations, as is hypoglossal motor output, and no respiratory pauses are detected, suggesting that the rhythm-generating networks are not intrinsically affected in mutants at P0. In contrast, inhibitory neuromodulatory influences exerted by the pons on respiratory rhythmogenesis are stronger in the mutant, thereby explaining the breathing anomalies observed <i>in vivo</i>. Thus, our results indicate that the KCC2a isoform is important for establishing proper breathing behavior at the time of birth, but by acting at site(s) that are extrinsic to the central respiratory networks themselves.</p><p><b>Significance statement</b> The expression of the neuronal specific potassium chloride co-transporter KCC2 is necessary for the generation of respiratory activity at birth, but the specific role of the KCC2a isoform in this process remains unknown. By examining <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> the breathing motor output of newborn KCC2a<sup>-/-</sup> mice we observed a lower breathing frequency and a high occurrence of apneas at birth. These anomalies, expressed mainly at P0 (day of birth), do not arise from changes in the brainstem respiratory rhythm-generating circuits, but appear to result from abnormally strong inhibitory pontine neuromodulatory influences that target these networks. Our results provide evidence for a transient but important role of the KCC2a isoform in the proper development of the central respiratory command.</p>

Abstract<p>Rodents actively whisk their vibrissae, which, when they come in contact with surrounding objects, enables rodents to gather spatial information about the environment. Cortical motor command of whisking is crucial for the control of vibrissa movement. Using awake and head-fixed rats, we investigated the correlations between axonal projection patterns and firing properties in identified layer 5 neurons in the motor cortex, which are associated with vibrissa movement. We found that cortical neurons that sent axons to the brainstem fired preferentially during large-amplitude vibrissae movements and that corticocallosal neurons exhibited a high firing rate during small vibrissa movements or during a quiet state. The differences between these two corticofugal circuits may be related to the mechanisms of motor-associated information processing.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> The contents of cortical motor commands and the pathways that they take are two important questions in neuroscience. Previous studies in rodents reported that motor cortex neurons exhibit variable activity patterns during whisking behavior. We combined physiological and morphological analyses of single neurons to provide more detail for understanding the neural circuit related to motor control.</p>

ABSTRACT<p>Frontal eye field (FEF) in macaque monkeys contributes to visual attention, visual-motor transformations and production of eye movements. Traditionally, neurons in FEF have been classified by the magnitude of increased discharge rates following visual stimulus presentation, during a waiting period, and associated with eye movement production. However, considerable heterogeneity remains within the traditional visual, visuomovement and movement categories. Cluster analysis is a data-driven method of identifying self-segregating groups within a dataset. Because many cluster analysis techniques exist and outcomes vary with analysis assumptions, consensus clustering aggregates over multiple analyses, identifying robust groups. To describe more comprehensively the neuronal composition of FEF, we applied a consensus clustering technique for unsupervised categorization of patterns of spike rate modulation measured during a memory-guided saccade task. We report ten functional categories, expanding on the traditional three. Categories were distinguished by latency, magnitude, and sign of visual response, presence of sustained activity, and dynamics, magnitude and sign of saccade-related modulation. Consensus clustering can include other metrics and can be applied to datasets from other brain regions to provide better information guiding microcircuit models of cortical function.</p><p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The contribution of a brain region cannot be understood without knowing the diversity, arrangement, and circuitry of constituent neurons. Traditional descriptions of frontal eye field include visual, visuo-saccadic, and saccadic categories. Here, we employ a novel consensus clustering method to identify more reliably functional categories in neural data. While confirming the traditional categories, consensus clustering distinguishes additional, previously unappreciated diversity in neural activity patterns. Such information is necessary to formulate correct microcircuit models of cortical function.</p>

A major aspect of the regulatory function of mast cells appears to be their role as intermediaries between the nervous and immune systems. Mast cells are activated by neurotransmitters allowing neural control of innate and adaptive immunity. Conversely, mast cells secrete mediators including neurotransmitters and neurotrophic factors that directly influence nerves, causing acute activation and/or long-lasting changes in excitability and phenotype. While some basic mechanisms underlying mast cell–nerve communication are well-established, the full extent to which this relationship influences health and disease is unclear.

<p>by Richard A. Erickson, Michael N. Fienen, S. Grace McCalla, Emily L. Weiser, Melvin L. Bower, Jonathan M. Knudson, Greg Thain</p>

Biologists and environmental scientists now routinely solve computational problems that were unimaginable a generation ago. Examples include processing geospatial data, analyzing -omics data, and running large-scale simulations. Conventional desktop computing cannot handle these tasks when they are large, and high-performance computing is not always available nor the most appropriate solution for all computationally intense problems. High-throughput computing (HTC) is one method for handling computationally intense research. In contrast to high-performance computing, which uses a single "supercomputer," HTC can distribute tasks over many computers (e.g., idle desktop computers, dedicated servers, or cloud-based resources). HTC facilities exist at many academic and government institutes and are relatively easy to create from commodity hardware. Additionally, consortia such as Open Science Grid facilitate HTC, and commercial entities sell cloud-based solutions for researchers who lack HTC at their institution. We provide an introduction to HTC for biologists and environmental scientists. Our examples from biology and the environmental sciences use HTCondor, an open source HTC system.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/dyQK2MYcEVQ" width="1" />

<p>Microcirculatory damage is a common complication for those with vascular risk factors, such as diabetes. To resolve vascular insults, the brain's immune cells (microglia) must rapidly envelop the site of injury. Currently, it is unknown whether Type 1 diabetes, a condition associated with chronic immune system dysfunction, alters microglial responses to damage and what mechanisms are responsible. Using <i>in vivo</i> two-photon microscopy in adult male mice, we show that microglial envelopment of laser-induced cerebral microbleeds is diminished in a hyperglycemic mouse model of Type 1 diabetes, which could not be fully rescued with chronic insulin treatment. Microglia were important for vessel repair because reduced microglial accumulation in diabetic mice or near-complete depletion in healthy controls was associated with greater secondary leakage of the damaged vessel. Broadly suppressing inflammation with dexamethasone in diabetic mice but not healthy controls, significantly enhanced microglial responses to microbleeds and attenuated secondary vessel leakage. These enhancements were associated with changes in IFN- signaling because dexamethasone suppressed abnormally high levels of IFN- protein levels in brain and blood serum of diabetic mice. Further, blocking IFN- in diabetic mice with neutralizing antibodies restored normal microglial chemotaxic responses and purinoceptor <i>P2ry12</i> gene expression, as well as mitigated secondary leakage. These results suggest that abnormal IFN- signaling disrupts microglial function in the diabetic brain, and that immunotherapies targeting IFN- can stimulate microglial repair of damaged vessels.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Although Type 1 diabetes is an established risk factor for vascular complications, such as microbleeds, and is known to hinder wound healing in the body, no study has examined how diabetes impacts the brain's innate immune reparative response (involving cells called microglia) to vascular injury. Here we show that microglial responses to brain microbleeds were diminished in diabetic animals, which also exacerbated secondary leakage from damaged vessels. These impairments were related to abnormally high levels of the proinflammatory cytokine IFN- because reducing IFN- with immunosuppressant drugs or blocking antibodies helped restore normal microglial responses and repair of damaged vessels. These data highlight the use of IFN- modulating therapeutics to enhance vascular repair in at-risk populations.</p>

<p>Improving extinction learning is essential to optimize psychotherapy for persistent fear-related disorders. In two independent studies (both <i>n</i> = 24), we found that goal-directed eye movements activate a dorsal frontoparietal network and transiently deactivate the amygdala (<sub><i>p</i></sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.17). Connectivity analyses revealed that this downregulation potentially engages a ventromedial prefrontal pathway known to be involved in cognitive regulation of emotion. Critically, when eye movements followed memory reactivation during extinction learning, it reduced spontaneous fear recovery 24 h later (<sub><i>p</i></sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.21). Stronger amygdala deactivation furthermore predicted a stronger reduction in subsequent fear recovery after reinstatement (<i>r</i> = 0.39). In conclusion, we show that extinction learning can be improved with a noninvasive eye-movement intervention that triggers a transient suppression of the amygdala. Our finding that another task which taxes working memory leads to a similar amygdala suppression furthermore indicates that this effect is likely not specific to eye movements, which is in line with a large body of behavioral studies. This study contributes to the understanding of a widely used treatment for traumatic symptoms by providing a parsimonious account for how working-memory tasks and goal-directed eye movements can enhance extinction-based psychotherapy, namely through neural circuits (e.g., amygdala deactivation) similar to those that support cognitive control of emotion.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Fear-related disorders represent a significant burden on individual sufferers and society. There is a high need to optimize treatment, in particular via noninvasive means. One potentially effective intervention is execution of eye movements following trauma recall. However, a neurobiological understanding of how eye movements reduce traumatic symptoms is lacking. We demonstrate that goal-directed eye-movements, like working-memory tasks, deactivate the amygdala, the core neural substrate of fear learning. Effective connectivity analyses revealed amygdala deactivation potentially engaged dorsolateral and ventromedial prefrontal pathways. When applied during safety learning, this deactivation predicts a reduction in later fear recovery. These findings provide a parsimonious and mechanistic account of how behavioral manipulations taxing working memory and suppressing amygdala activity can alter retention of emotional memories.</p>

<p>Using predictions based on environmental regularities is fundamental for adaptive behavior. While it is widely accepted that predictions across different stimulus attributes (e.g., time and content) facilitate sensory processing, it is unknown whether predictions across these attributes rely on the same neural mechanism. Here, to elucidate the neural mechanisms of predictions, we combine invasive electrophysiological recordings (human electrocorticography in 4 females and 2 males) with computational modeling while manipulating predictions about content ("what") and time ("when"). We found that "when" predictions increased evoked activity over motor and prefrontal regions both at early (~180 ms) and late (430–450 ms) latencies. "What" predictability, however, increased evoked activity only over prefrontal areas late in time (420–460 ms). Beyond these dissociable influences, we found that "what" and "when" predictability interactively modulated the amplitude of early (165 ms) evoked responses in the superior temporal gyrus. We modeled the observed neural responses using biophysically realistic neural mass models, to better understand whether "what" and "when" predictions tap into similar or different neurophysiological mechanisms. Our modeling results suggest that "what" and "when" predictability rely on complementary neural processes: "what" predictions increased short-term plasticity in auditory areas, whereas "when" predictability increased synaptic gain in motor areas. Thus, content and temporal predictions engage complementary neural mechanisms in different regions, suggesting domain-specific prediction signaling along the cortical hierarchy. Encoding predictions through different mechanisms may endow the brain with the flexibility to efficiently signal different sources of predictions, weight them by their reliability, and allow for their encoding without mutual interference.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Predictions of different stimulus features facilitate sensory processing. However, it is unclear whether predictions of different attributes rely on similar or different neural mechanisms. By combining invasive electrophysiological recordings of cortical activity with experimental manipulations of participants' predictions about content and time of acoustic events, we found that the two types of predictions had dissociable influences on cortical activity, both in terms of the regions involved and the timing of the observed effects. Further, our biophysical modeling analysis suggests that predictability of content and time rely on complementary neural processes: short-term plasticity in auditory areas and synaptic gain in motor areas, respectively. This suggests that predictions of different features are encoded with complementary neural mechanisms in different brain regions.</p>

Abstract
<p>Fast-rising sensory events evoke a series of functionally heterogeneous event-related potentials (ERPs). Stimulus repetition at 1 Hz induces a strong habituation of the largest ERP responses, the vertex waves (VWs). VWs are elicited by stimuli regardless of their modality, provided that they are salient and behaviorally relevant. In contrast, the effect of stimulus repetition on the earlier sensory components of ERPs has been less explored, and the few existing results are inconsistent. To characterize how the different ERP waves habituate over time, we recorded the responses elicited by 60 identical somatosensory stimuli (activating either non-nociceptive Aβ or nociceptive A afferents), delivered at 1 Hz to healthy human participants. We show that the well-described spatiotemporal sequence of lateralized and vertex ERP components elicited by the first stimulus of the series is largely preserved in the smaller-amplitude, habituated response elicited by the last stimuli of the series. We also found that the earlier lateralized sensory wave habituates across the 60 trials following the same decay function of the VWs: this decay function is characterized by a large drop at the first stimulus repetition followed by smaller decreases at subsequent repetitions. Interestingly, the same decay functions described the habituation of ERPs elicited by repeated non-nociceptive and nociceptive stimuli. This study provides a neurophysiological characterization of the effect of prolonged and repeated stimulation on the main components of somatosensory ERPs. It also demonstrates that both lateralized waves and VWs are obligatory components of ERPs elicited by non-nociceptive and nociceptive stimuli.</p>

Abstract<p>We previously reported that perineuronal nets (PNNs) are required for cocaine-associated memories. Perineuronal nets are extracellular matrix that primarily surrounds parvalbumin (PV)-containing, GABAergic fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs) in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Here we measured the impact of acute (1 day) or repeated (5 days) cocaine exposure on PNNs and PV cells within the prelimbic and infralimbic regions of the mPFC. Adult rats were exposed to 1 day or 5 days of cocaine and stained for PNNs (using <i>Wisteria floribunda</i> agglutinin, WFA) and PV intensity 2 h or 24 h later. In the prelimbic and infralimbic PFC, PNN staining intensity decreased 2 hr after 1 day of cocaine but increased after 5 days of cocaine. Cocaine also produced changes in PV intensity, which generally lagged behind that of PNNs. In the prelimbic PFC, both 1 and 5 days of cocaine increased GAD65/67 puncta near PNN-surrounded PV cells, with an increase in the ratio of GAD65/67:VGluT1 puncta after 5 days of cocaine exposure. In the prelimbic PFC, slice electrophysiology studies in FSIs surrounded by PNNs revealed that both 1 and 5 days of cocaine reduced the number of action potentials 2 h later. Synaptic changes demonstrated that 5 d cocaine increased inhibition of FSIs, potentially reducing the inhibition of pyramidal neurons and contributing to their hyperexcitability during relapse behavior. These early and rapid responses to cocaine may alter network stability of PV FSIs that partially mediate the persistent and chronic nature of drug addiction.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Parvalbumin-containing, FSIs control the inhibitory:excitatory balance in the adult CNS, and the majority of these are surrounded by PNNs. The mPFC is critical to relapse in cocaine addiction, yet few studies have focused on the impact of cocaine exposure on PV interneurons that profoundly control output of the mPFC. Our studies highlight the impact of cocaine on PV and PNN levels and intrinsic and synaptic properties of PNN-surrounded FSIs in the mPFC. These findings point to a key upstream mechanism by which FSIs may contribute to the consistently observed increase in mPFC excitatory output of pyramidal neurons that contribute to cocaine reinstatement, and they have broader implications for understanding how PNN-surrounded neurons may control aberrant learning processes involved in addiction.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0227-18.2018v1?rss=1">Simultaneous assessment of homonymous and heteronymous monosynaptic reflex excitability in the adult rat</a></h4>

Abstract<p>In order to successfully produce motor tasks such as locomotion, the central nervous system must coordinate contractions of antagonistic and synergistic muscles across multiple joints. This coordination is largely dependent upon the function of proprioceptive afferents, which make monosynaptic connections with homonymous motoneurons. Homonymous pathways have been well studied in both health and disease but their collateral fibres projecting to heteronymous, synergistic muscles receive relatively less attention. This is surprising given that proprioceptive afferent collaterals have significant effects on the excitability of heteronymous motoneurons, and that their synaptic terminal density is activity dependent. It is likely that the relative lack of literature is due to the lack of a preparation which allows synergistic heteronymous pathways to be assessed <i>in vivo</i>. Here we describe a method to simultaneously evoke homonymous and heteronymous (synergistic) monosynaptic reflexes and study their modulation by descending pathways in adult rats. Through stimulation of the medial plantar nerve, we were able to produce an H reflex in the intrinsic foot muscles of the hind paw with a latency of 10.52 ± 3.8 ms. Increasing the stimulus intensity evoked a robust signal with a monosynaptic latency (11.32 ± 0.35 ms), recorded in the ipsilateral gastrocnemius. Our subsequent analyses suggest that gastrocnemius motoneurons were activated via heteronymous afferent collaterals from the medial plantar nerve. These reflexes could be evoked bilaterally and were modulated by conditioning stimuli to the cortex and reticular formation. Interestingly, cortical stimulation was equally efficient at modulating both ipsilateral and contralateral reflexes, indicating that cortical modulation of lumbar sensory afferents lacks the laterality demonstrated by studies of cortical muscle activation. This technique represents a novel, relatively simple way to assess heteronymous afferent pathways in normal motor control as well as in models of motor disorders where adaptive and maladaptive plasticity of proprioceptive afferents and descending systems affects functional outcomes.</p><p><b>Significance statement</b> This study describes a method for simultaneously recording bilateral homonymous and heteronymous proprioceptive afferent reflexes in rodents. Bilateral stimulation of the medial plantar nerve produced homonymous H reflexes in intrinsic foot muscles of both hind paws as well as heteronymous monosynaptic reflexes in the gastrocnemius muscles. We used this technique to assess cortical and reticular modulation of homonymous and heteronymous reflexes. Surprisingly, cortical conditioning of reflexes revealed a lack of laterality in modulation of homonymous and heteronymous reflexes. This technique will be extremely useful for further studies of heteronymous afferent pathways in normal and dysfunctional motor states, such as spinal cord injury, stroke and cerebral palsy.</p>

Abstract<p>The perception of gender and age of unfamiliar faces is reported to vary idiosyncratically across retinal locations such that, for example, the same androgynous face may appear to be male at one location but female at another. Here we test spatial heterogeneity for the recognition of the <i>identity</i> of personally familiar faces in human participants. We found idiosyncratic biases that were stable within participants and that varied more across locations for low as compared to high familiar faces. These data suggest that like face gender and age, face identity is processed, in part, by independent populations of neurons monitoring restricted spatial regions and that the recognition responses vary for the same face across these different locations. Moreover, repeated and varied social interactions appear to lead to adjustments of these independent face recognition neurons so that the same familiar face is eventually more likely to elicit the same recognition response across widely separated visual field locations. We provide a mechanistic account of this reduced retinotopic bias based on computational simulations.</p><p><b>Significance statement</b> In this work we tested spatial heterogeneity for the recognition of personally familiar faces.

Our data suggest that, like face gender and age, face identity is processed by independent populations of neurons monitoring restricted spatial regions and that recognition may vary for the same face at these different locations. Unlike previous findings, our data and computational simulation address the effects of learning and show how increased familiarity modifies the representation of face identity in face-responsive cortical areas. This new perspective has broader implications for understanding how learning optimizes visual processes for socially salient stimuli.</p>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>We have previously reported that the blockage of TrkB and TrkC signaling in primary culture of opossum neocortical cells affects neurogenesis that involves a range of processes including cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Here, we studied whether TrkB and TrkC activity specifically affects various types of progenitor cell populations during neocortex formation in the Monodelphis opossum in vivo. We found that the inhibition of TrkB and TrkC activities affects the same proliferative cellular phenotype, but TrkC causes more pronounced changes in the rate of cell divisions. Additionally, inhibition of TrkB and TrkC does not affect apoptosis in vivo, which was found in cell culture experiments. The lack of TrkB and TrkC receptor activity caused the arrest of newly generated neurons; therefore, they could not penetrate the subplate zone. We suggest that at this time point in development, migration consists of 2 steps. During the initial step, neurons migrate and reach the base of the subplate, whereas during the next step the migration of neurons to their final position is regulated by TrkB or TrkC signaling.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The hippocampus is a subcortical structure critical for learning and memory, and a thorough understanding of its neurodevelopment is important for studying these processes in health and disease. However, few studies have quantified the typical developmental trajectory of the structure in childhood and adolescence. This study examined the cross-sectional age-related changes and sex differences in hippocampal shape in a multisite, multistudy cohort of 1676 typically developing children (age 1–22 years) using a novel intrinsic brain mapping method based on Laplace–Beltrami embedding of surfaces. Significant age-related expansion was observed bilaterally and nonlinear growth was observed primarily in the right head and tail of the hippocampus. Sex differences were also observed bilaterally along the lateral and medial aspects of the surface, with females exhibiting relatively larger surface expansion than males. Additionally, the superior posterior lateral surface of the left hippocampus exhibited an age–sex interaction with females expanding faster than males. Shape analysis provides enhanced sensitivity to regional changes in hippocampal morphology over traditional volumetric approaches and allows for the localization of developmental effects. Our results further support evidence that hippocampal structures follow distinct maturational trajectories that may coincide with the development of learning and memory skills during critical periods of development.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The brain has separate specialized computational units to process faces and voices located in occipital and temporal cortices. However, humans seamlessly integrate signals from the faces and voices of others for optimal social interaction. How are emotional expressions, when delivered by different sensory modalities (faces and voices), integrated in the brain? In this study, we characterized the brains’ response to faces, voices, and combined face–voice information (congruent, incongruent), which varied in expression (neutral, fearful). Using a whole-brain approach, we found that only the right posterior superior temporal sulcus (rpSTS) responded more to bimodal stimuli than to face or voice alone but only when the stimuli contained emotional expression. Face- and voice-selective regions of interest, extracted from independent functional localizers, similarly revealed multisensory integration in the face-selective rpSTS only; further, this was the only face-selective region that also responded significantly to voices. Dynamic causal modeling revealed that the rpSTS receives unidirectional information from the face-selective fusiform face area, and voice-selective temporal voice area, with emotional expression affecting the connection strength. Our study promotes a hierarchical model of face and voice integration, with convergence in the rpSTS, and that such integration depends on the (emotional) salience of the stimuli.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome (22q11.2DS) is a genetic condition associated with a high prevalence of neuropsychiatric conditions that include autism spectrum disorder (ASD). While evidence suggests that clinical phenotypes represent distinct neurodevelopmental outcomes, it remains unknown whether this translates to the level of neurobiology. To fractionate the 22q11.2DS phenotype on the level of neuroanatomy, we examined differences in vertex-wise estimates of cortical volume, surface area, and cortical thickness between 1) individuals with 22q11.2DS (<span style="font-style: italic;">n</span> = 62) and neurotypical controls (<span style="font-style: italic;">n</span> = 57) and 2) 22q11.2DS individuals with ASD symptomatology (<span style="font-style: italic;">n</span> = 30) and those without (<span style="font-style: italic;">n</span> = 25). We firstly observed significant differences in surface anatomy between 22q11.2DS individuals and controls for all 3 neuroanatomical features, predominantly in parietotemporal regions, cingulate and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices. We also established that 22q11.2DS individuals with ASD symptomatology were neuroanatomically distinct from 22q11.2DS individuals without ASD symptoms, particularly in brain regions that have previously been linked to ASD (e.g., dorsolateral prefrontal cortices and the entorhinal cortex). Our findings indicate that different clinical 22q11.2DS phenotypes, including those with ASD symptomatology, may represent different neurobiological subgroups. The spatially distributed patterns of neuroanatomical differences associated with ASD symptomatology in 22q11.2DS may thus provide useful information for patient stratification and the prediction of clinical outcomes.</span>

Recent advances in Ca2+ imaging have given neuroscientists a tool to follow the activity of large numbers of individual neurons simultaneously in vivo in the brains of animals as they are presented with sensory stimulation, respond to environmental challenges, and engage in behaviors. The Ca2+ sensors used to transduce changes in cellular Ca2+ into changes in fluorescence must bind Ca2+ to produce a signal. By binding Ca2+, these sensors can act as buffers, often reducing the magnitude of a Ca2+ change severalfold, and producing a proportional slowing of the rates of change.

Millisecond variations in spiking patterns can radically alter motor behavior, suggesting that traditional rate-based theories of motor control require revision. The importance of spike timing in sensorimotor control arises from dynamic interactions between the nervous system, muscles, and the body. New mechanisms, model systems, and theories are revealing how these interactions shape behavior.

The auditory modality is fundamentally a temporal sense that requires analysis of changes in sound signals on timescales ranging from microseconds to minutes. To generate a faithful representation of changes in sound intensity and frequency over time, sound offsets (disappearances) as well as sound onsets (appearances) must be encoded by the auditory system. We review here the computational significance, perceptual roles, anatomical locations, and cellular and network origins of sound-offset responses in the mammalian auditory brain.

Sensorimotor predictions are essential for adaptive behavior. In natural environments, events that demand sensorimotor predictions unfold across many timescales, and corresponding temporal predictions (either explicit or implicit) should therefore emerge in brain dynamics. Neuronal oscillations are scale-specific processes found in several frequency bands. They underlie periodicity in sensorimotor processing and can represent temporal predictions via their phase dynamics. These processes build upon endogenous neural rhythmicity and adapt in response to exogenous timing demands.

The rate of affective disorder is substantially higher in women than in men, and considerable evidence points to the actions of ovarian hormones in mediating this disparity. In this Opinion, we discuss the hypothesis that cyclic changes in ovarian hormone levels produce cyclic alterations in connectivity between the intrinsic networks of the brain. These alterations produce specific temporal windows within the menstrual cycle when internetwork connectivity is increased, associated with increased stress reactivity and better memory for unpleasant, arousing events, leading to increased negative mood and susceptibility to affective disorder.

Over the 40 years that TINS has been in existence, there has been substantial progress in understanding the types, organisation, and neural mechanisms of memory. The selectivity of memory maintenance and retention remains a puzzle, and we here summarise two contributions of our own research to this enigma: the striking impact of the novelty and surprise often of other events happening around the time that a new memory is encoded and how activated prior knowledge guides the updating process that characterises aspects of memory consolidation.

Speakers of different languages think about time differently in accordance with the spatial metaphors common in their languages. Furthermore, learning new spatial metaphors in language instills new non-linguistic representations of time, suggesting that language can play a causal role in constructing mental timelines.

The neocortex is one of the most distinctive structures of the mammalian brain, yet also one of the most varied in terms of both size and organization. Multiple processes have contributed to this variability, including evolutionary mechanisms (i.e., alterations in gene sequence) that alter the size, organization, and connections of neocortex, and activity dependent mechanisms that can also modify these same features. Thus, changes to the neocortex can occur over different time-scales, including within a single generation.

The ability to detect time intervals and temporal patterns is critical to some of the most fundamental computations the brain performs, including the ability to communicate and appraise a dynamically changing environment. Many of these computations take place on the scale of tens to hundreds of milliseconds. Electrophysiological evidence shows that some neurons respond selectively to duration, interval, rate, or order. Because the time constants of many time-varying neural and synaptic properties, including short-term synaptic plasticity (STP), are also in the range of tens to hundreds of milliseconds, they are strong candidates to underlie the formation of temporally selective neurons.

GABAergic interneurons, which are highly diverse, have long been thought to contribute to the timing of neural activity as well as to the generation and shaping of brain rhythms. GABAergic activity is crucial not only for entrainment of oscillatory activity across a neural population, but also for precise regulation of the timing of action potentials and the suppression of slow-timescale correlations. The diversity of inhibition provides the potential for flexible regulation of patterned activity, but also poses a challenge to identifying the elements of excitatory–inhibitory interactions underlying network engagement.

Nervous systems control locomotion using rhythmically active networks that orchestrate motor neuron firing patterns. Whether animals use common or distinct genetic programs to encode motor rhythmicity remains unclear. Cross-species comparisons have revealed remarkably conserved neural patterning systems but have also unveiled divergent circuit architectures that can generate similar locomotor behaviors.

The rotation of the Earth around its axis causes periodic exposure of half of its surface to sunlight. This daily recurring event has been internalized in most organisms in the form of cellular circadian clock mechanisms. These cellular clocks are synchronized with each other in various ways to establish circadian networks that build the circadian program in tissues and organs, coordinating physiology and behavior in the entire organism. In the mammalian brain, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) receives light information via the retina and synchronizes its own neuronal clocks to the light signal.

Abstract
<p>Reproductive endocrine disorders are prominent comorbidities of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) in both men and women. The neural mechanisms underlying these comorbidities remain unclear, but hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons may be involved. Here, we report the first direct demonstrations of aberrant GnRH neuron function in an animal model of epilepsy. Recordings of GnRH neuron firing and excitability were made in acute mouse brain slices prepared two months after intrahippocampal injection of kainate (KA) or control saline, a well-established TLE model in which most females develop comorbid estrous cycle disruption. GnRH neurons from control females showed elevated firing and excitability on estrus compared with diestrus. By contrast, cells from KA-injected females that developed prolonged, disrupted estrous cycles (KA-long) showed the reverse pattern. Firing rates of cells from KA-injected females that maintained regular cycles (KA-regular) were not different from controls on diestrus, but were reduced on estrus. In KA-injected males, only GnRH neurons in the medial septum displayed elevated firing. In contrast to the diestrus versus estrus and sex-specific changes in firing, GnRH neuron intrinsic excitability was elevated in all KA-injected groups, indicating a role for afferent synaptic and neuromodulatory inputs in shaping overall changes in firing activity. Furthermore, KA-injected females showed cycle-stage-specific changes in circulating sex steroids on diestrus and estrus that also differed between KA-long and KA-regular groups. Together, these findings reveal that the effects of epilepsy on the neural control of reproduction are dynamic across the estrous cycle, distinct in association with comorbid estrous cycle disruption severity, and sex-specific.</p>
