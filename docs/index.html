              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00721">A Turing Test for Artificial Nets devoted to model Human Vision</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.00721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this 2022 work we argued that, despite claims about successful modeling of the visual brain using artificial nets, the problem is far from being solved (even for low-level vision). Examples of open issues include: where should we read from ANNs in order to reproduce human behavior?, this ad-hoc read-out is considered part of the brain model or not?, should we use artificial psychophysics or artificial physiology?, in the case of ANNs, artificial experiments should literally match the experiments done with humans?. There is a clear need of rigorous procedures for experimental tests for ANNs devoted to model the visual brain, and more generally, to understand ANNs devoted to generic vision tasks. Following our experience in using low-level facts from Quantitative Visual Neuroscience in computer vision, in this work we presented the idea of developing a low-level dataset compiling the basic spatio-temporal and chromatic facts that are known to happen in the retina-V1 pathway, and they are not currently available in existing databases such as BrainScore. In our results we checked the behavior of three recently proposed models with similar architecture: (1) A parametric model tuned via Maximum Differentiation [Malo & Simoncelli SPIE 15, Martinez et al. PLOS 18, Martinez et al. Front. Neurosci. 19], (2) A non-parametric model called PerceptNet tuned to maximize the correlation with human opinion on subjective distortions [Hepburn et al. IEEE ICIP 19], and (3) A model with the same encoder as PerceptNet, but tuned for image segmentation (published as Hernandez-Camara et al. Patt.Recogn.Lett. 23). Results on 10 compelling psycho/physio visual facts show that the first model is the one with closer behavior to the humans in terms of receptive fields, but more interestingly, on the nonlinear behavior when facing complex spatio-chromatic patterns of a range of luminances and contrasts.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01299">Probabilistic adaptation of language comprehension for individual speakers: Evidence from neural oscillations</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.01299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Listeners adapt language comprehension based on their mental representations of speakers, but how these representations are dynamically updated remains unclear. We investigated whether listeners probabilistically adapt their comprehension based on the likelihood of speakers producing stereotype-incongruent utterances. Our findings reveal two potential mechanisms: a speaker-general mechanism that adjusts overall expectations about speaker-content relationships, and a speaker-specific mechanism that updates individual speaker models. In two EEG experiments, participants heard speakers make stereotype-congruent or incongruent utterances, with incongruency base rate manipulated between blocks. In Experiment 1, speaker incongruency modulated both high-beta (21-30 Hz) and theta (4-6 Hz) oscillations: incongruent utterances decreased oscillatory power in low base rate condition but increased it in high base rate condition. The theta effect varied with listeners' openness trait: less open participants showed theta increases to speaker-incongruencies, suggesting maintenance of speaker-specific information, while more open participants showed theta decreases, indicating flexible model updating. In Experiment 2, we dissociated base rate from the target speaker by manipulating the overall base rate using an alternative non-target speaker. Only the high-beta effect persisted, showing power decrease for speaker-incongruencies in low base rate condition but no effect in high base rate condition. The high-beta oscillations might reflect the speaker-general adjustment, while theta oscillations may index the speaker-specific model updating. These findings provide evidence for how language processing is shaped by social cognition in real time.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00780">Constructing Fundamentals for the Theory of Proportions and Symbolic Allusions Applied Interdisciplinarily</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.00780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Theory of Proportions and Symbolic Allusions applied Interdisciplinary (TPASAI) is a framework that integrates mathematics, linguistics, psychology, and game theory to uncover hidden patterns and proportions in reality. Its central idea is that numerical encoding of symbols, dates, and language can reveal recurring structures and connections that reflect universal principles. By applying fractal analysis, the theory identifies patterns across different scales, offering a unifying perspective on the structure of the world. One key aspect of TPASAI is symbolic analysis, which allows for the reinterpretation of traumatic experiences in psychotherapy. For example, assigning numerical values to elements like fingers, dates, or words can help individuals uncover meaningful associations between personal experiences and collective symbols. This approach encourages cognitive flexibility and provides a therapeutic avenue for recontextualizing emotions. The theory also incorporates principles of game theory, which frame reality as a system of symbolic "codes" governed by rules that can be understood and strategically used. This perspective is especially useful for psychological conditions like obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), enabling patients to approach their obsessions as decipherable patterns rather than rigid constraints. TPASAI has practical applications in psychology, education, and technology. In education, it aids in teaching mathematical and linguistic concepts by exploring connections between symbolic representations and real-world events. In technology, the methodology can be employed in ciphering and natural language processing. The innovation of TPASAI lies in its ability to merge the structured rigor of mathematics with the interpretative flexibility of symbolic analysis, offering a deeper understanding of events and relationships.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01334">Deep generative computed perfusion-deficit mapping of ischaemic stroke</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.01334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Focal deficits in ischaemic stroke result from impaired perfusion downstream of a critical vascular occlusion. While parenchymal lesions are traditionally used to predict clinical deficits, the underlying pattern of disrupted perfusion provides information upstream of the lesion, potentially yielding earlier predictive and localizing signals. Such perfusion maps can be derived from routine CT angiography (CTA) widely deployed in clinical practice. Analysing computed perfusion maps from 1,393 CTA-imaged-patients with acute ischaemic stroke, we use deep generative inference to localise neural substrates of NIHSS sub-scores. We show that our approach replicates known lesion-deficit relations without knowledge of the lesion itself and reveals novel neural dependents. The high achieved anatomical fidelity suggests acute CTA-derived computed perfusion maps may be of substantial clinical-and-scientific value in rich phenotyping of acute stroke. Using only hyperacute imaging, deep generative inference could power highly expressive models of functional anatomical relations in ischaemic stroke within the pre-interventional window.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01360">A Relative Homology Theory of Representation in Neural Networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.01360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Previous research has proven that the set of maps implemented by neural networks with a ReLU activation function is identical to the set of piecewise linear continuous maps. Furthermore, such networks induce a hyperplane arrangement splitting the input domain into convex polyhedra $G_J$ over which the network $\Phi$ operates in an affine manner.
  In this work, we leverage these properties to define the equivalence class of inputs $\sim_\Phi$, which can be split into two sets related to the local rank of $\Phi_J$ and the intersections $\cap \text{Im}\Phi_{J_i}$. We refer to the latter as the overlap decomposition $O_\Phi$ and prove that if the intersections between each polyhedron and the input manifold are convex, the homology groups of neural representations are isomorphic to relative homology groups $H_k(\Phi(M)) \simeq H_k(M,O_\Phi)$. This lets us compute Betti numbers without the choice of an external metric. We develop methods to numerically compute the overlap decomposition through linear programming and a union-find algorithm.
  Using this framework, we perform several experiments on toy datasets showing that, compared to standard persistent homology, our relative homology-based computation of Betti numbers tracks purely topological rather than geometric features. Finally, we study the evolution of the overlap decomposition during training on various classification problems while varying network width and depth and discuss some shortcomings of our method.

                arXiv:2502.01427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial neural networks face the stability-plasticity dilemma in continual learning, while the brain can maintain memories and remain adaptable. However, the biological strategies for continual learning and their potential to inspire learning algorithms in neural networks are poorly understood. This study presents a minimal model of the fly olfactory circuit to investigate the biological strategies that support continual odor learning. We introduce the fly olfactory circuit as a plug-and-play component, termed the Fly Model, which can integrate with modern machine learning methods to address this dilemma. Our findings demonstrate that the Fly Model enhances both memory stability and learning plasticity, overcoming the limitations of current continual learning strategies. We validated its effectiveness across various challenging continual learning scenarios using commonly used datasets. The fly olfactory system serves as an elegant biological circuit for lifelong learning, offering a module that enhances continual learning with minimal additional computational cost for machine learning.

                arXiv:2309.10821v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A feature of the brains of intelligent animals is the ability to learn to respond to an ensemble of active neuronal inputs with a behaviorally appropriate ensemble of active neuronal outputs. Previously, a hypothesis was proposed on how this mechanism is implemented at the cellular level within the neocortical pyramidal neuron: the apical tuft or perisomatic inputs initiate "guess" neuron firings, while the basal dendrites identify input patterns based on excited synaptic clusters, with the cluster excitation strength adjusted based on reward feedback. This simple mechanism allows neurons to learn to classify their inputs in a surprisingly intelligent manner. Here, we revise and extend this hypothesis. We modify synaptic plasticity rules to align with behavioral time scale synaptic plasticity (BTSP) observed in hippocampal area CA1, making the framework more biophysically and behaviorally plausible. The neurons for the guess firings are selected in a voluntary manner via feedback connections to apical tufts in the neocortical layer 1, leading to dendritic Ca2+ spikes with burst firing, which are postulated to be neural correlates of attentional, aware processing. Once learned, the neuronal input classification is executed without voluntary or conscious control, enabling hierarchical incremental learning of classifications that is effective in our inherently classifiable world. In addition to voluntary, we propose that pyramidal neuron burst firing can be involuntary, also initiated via apical tuft inputs, drawing attention towards important cues such as novelty and noxious stimuli. We classify the excitations of neocortical pyramidal neurons into four categories based on their excitation pathway: attentional versus automatic and voluntary/acquired versus involuntary. Additionally, we hypothesize that dendrites within pyramidal neuron minicolumn bundles are coupled via depolarization...

Abstract: Recent work has provided new insights into the temporal specialization of Intratelencephalic (IT) and Pyramidal tract neurons (PT). However, functional and anatomical differences of IT and PT have not been connected yet. This perspective article contributes by highlighting empirical studies about the connectivity of IT and PT as well as their specialization in sensory and motor processing in diverse brain regions. We further review conceptual models that would align with the connectivity motif. We conclude that further research is needed to understand the role of the unidirectional connectivity from IT to PT in temporal processing and suggest concrete experiments.

                arXiv:2409.12990v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial neural networks (ANNs) were inspired by the architecture and functions of the human brain and have revolutionised the field of artificial intelligence (AI). Inspired by studies on the latent geometry of the brain, in this perspective paper we posit that an increase in the research and application of hyperbolic geometry in ANNs and machine learning will lead to increased accuracy, improved feature space representations and more efficient models across a range of tasks. We examine the structure and functions of the human brain, emphasising the correspondence between its scale-free hierarchical organization and hyperbolic geometry, and reflecting on the central role hyperbolic geometry plays in facilitating human intelligence. Empirical evidence indicates that hyperbolic neural networks outperform Euclidean models for tasks including natural language processing, computer vision and complex network analysis, requiring fewer parameters and exhibiting better generalisation. Despite its nascent adoption, hyperbolic geometry holds promise for improving machine learning models through brain-inspired geometric representations.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14615">Single-neuron deep generative model uncovers underlying physics of neuronal activity in Ca imaging data</a></h4>

Abstract: Calcium imaging has become a powerful alternative to electrophysiology for studying neuronal activity, offering spatial resolution and the ability to measure large populations of neurons in a minimally invasive manner. This technique has broad applications in neuroscience, neuroengineering, and medicine, enabling researchers to explore the relationship between neuron location and activity. Recent advancements in deep generative models (DGMs) have facilitated the modeling of neuronal population dynamics, uncovering latent representations that provide insights into behavior prediction and neuronal variance. However, these models often rely on spike inference algorithms and primarily focus on population-level dynamics, limiting their applicability for single-neuron analyses. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework for single-neuron representation learning using autoregressive variational autoencoders (AVAEs). Our approach embeds individual neurons' spatiotemporal signals into a reduced-dimensional space without the need for spike inference algorithms. The AVAE excels over traditional linear methods by generating more informative and discriminative latent representations, improving tasks such as visualization, clustering, and the understanding of neuronal activity. Additionally, the reconstruction performance of the AVAE outperforms the state of the art, demonstrating its ability to accurately recover the original fluorescence signal from the learned representation. Using realistic simulations, we show that our model captures underlying physical properties and connectivity patterns, enabling it to distinguish between different firing and connectivity types. These findings position the AVAE as a versatile and powerful tool for advancing single-neuron analysis and lays the groundwork for future integration of multimodal single-cell datasets in neuroscience.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00577">Discovering robust biomarkers of psychiatric disorders from resting-state functional MRI via graph neural networks: A systematic review</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2405.00577v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNN) have emerged as a popular tool for modelling functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) datasets. Many recent studies have reported significant improvements in disorder classification performance via more sophisticated GNN designs and highlighted salient features that could be potential biomarkers of the disorder. However, existing methods of evaluating their robustness are often limited to cross-referencing with existing literature, which is a subjective and inconsistent process. In this review, we provide an overview of how GNN and model explainability techniques (specifically, feature attributors) have been applied to fMRI datasets for disorder prediction tasks, with an emphasis on evaluating the robustness of potential biomarkers produced for psychiatric disorders. Then, 65 studies using GNNs that reported potential fMRI biomarkers for psychiatric disorders (attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder, major depressive disorder, schizophrenia) published before 9 October 2024 were identified from 2 online databases (Scopus, PubMed). We found that while most studies have performant models, salient features highlighted in these studies (as determined by feature attribution scores) vary greatly across studies on the same disorder. Reproducibility of biomarkers is only limited to a small subset at the level of regions and few transdiagnostic biomarkers were identified. To address these issues, we suggest establishing new standards that are based on objective evaluation metrics to determine the robustness of these potential biomarkers. We further highlight gaps in the existing literature and put together a prediction-attribution-evaluation framework that could set the foundations for future research on discovering robust biomarkers of psychiatric disorders via GNNs.

                arXiv:2406.13730v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a control-oriented delay-based modeling approach for the exponential stabilization of a scalar neutral functional differential equation, which is then applied to the local exponential stabilization of a one-layer neural network of Hopfield type with delayed feedback. The proposed approach utilizes a recently developed partial pole placement method for linear functional differential equations, leveraging the coexistence of real spectral values to explicitly prescribe the exponential decay of the closed-loop solution. While a delayed proportional (P) feedback control may achieve stabilization, it requires higher gains and only allows for a shorter maximum delay compared to the proportional-derivative (PD) feedback control presented in this work. The framework provides a practical illustration of the stabilization strategy, improving upon previous literature results that characterize the solution's exponential decay for simple real spectral values. This approach enhances neural stability in cases where the inherent dynamics are stable and offers a method to achieve local exponential stabilization with a prescribed decay rate when the inherent dynamics are unstable.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01253">Metareasoning in uncertain environments: a meta-BAMDP framework</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2408.01253v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: \textit{Reasoning} may be viewed as an algorithm $P$ that makes a choice of an action $a^* \in \mathcal{A}$, aiming to optimize some outcome. However, executing $P$ itself bears costs (time, energy, limited capacity, etc.) and needs to be considered alongside explicit utility obtained by making the choice in the underlying decision problem. Finding the right $P$ can itself be framed as an optimization problem over the space of reasoning processes $P$, generally referred to as \textit{metareasoning}. Conventionally, human metareasoning models assume that the agent knows the transition and reward distributions of the underlying MDP. This paper generalizes such models by proposing a meta Bayes-Adaptive MDP (meta-BAMDP) framework to handle metareasoning in environments with unknown reward/transition distributions, which encompasses a far larger and more realistic set of planning problems that humans and AI systems face. As a first step, we apply the framework to Bernoulli bandit tasks. Owing to the meta problem's complexity, our solutions are necessarily approximate. However, we introduce two novel theorems that significantly enhance the tractability of the problem, enabling stronger approximations that are robust within a range of assumptions grounded in realistic human decision-making scenarios. These results offer a resource-rational perspective and a normative framework for understanding human exploration under cognitive constraints, as well as providing experimentally testable predictions about human behavior in Bernoulli Bandit tasks.

Abstract: Human intelligence, the most evident and accessible form of source of reasoning, hosted by biological hardware, has evolved and been refined over thousands of years, positioning itself today to create new artificial forms and preparing to self--design their evolutionary path forward. Beginning with the advent of foundation models, the rate at which human and artificial intelligence interact with each other has exceeded any anticipated quantitative figures. The close engagement led both bits of intelligence to be impacted in various ways, which naturally resulted in complex confluences that warrant close scrutiny. In the sequel, using a novel taxonomy, we shall explore the interplay between human and machine intelligence, focusing on the crucial role humans play in developing ethical, responsible, and robust intelligent systems. We briefly delve into various aspects of implementation inspired by the mechanisms underlying neuroscience and human cognition. In addition, we propose future perspectives, capitalizing on the advantages of symbiotic designs to suggest a human-centered direction for next-generation developments, focusing on the augmentation role of AI. We finalize this evolving document with some thoughts and open questions yet to be addressed by the broader community.

                arXiv:2409.19717v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern recording techniques enable neuroscientists to simultaneously study neural activity across large populations of neurons, with capturing predictor-dependent correlations being a fundamental challenge in neuroscience. Moreover, the fact that input covariates often lie in restricted subdomains, according to experimental settings, makes inference even more challenging. To address these challenges, we propose a set of nonparametric mean-covariance regression models for high-dimensional neural activity with restricted inputs. These models reduce the dimensionality of neural responses by employing a lower-dimensional latent factor model, where both factor loadings and latent factors are predictor-dependent, to jointly model mean and covariance across covariates. The smoothness of neural activity across experimental conditions is modeled nonparametrically using two Gaussian processes (GPs), applied to both loading basis and latent factors. Additionally, to account for the covariates lying in restricted subspace, we incorporate graph information into the covariance structure. To flexibly infer the model, we use an MCMC algorithm to sample from posterior distributions. After validating and studying the properties of proposed methods by simulations, we apply them to two neural datasets (local field potential and neural spiking data) to demonstrate the usage of models for continuous and counting observations. Overall, the proposed methods provide a framework to jointly model covariate-dependent mean and covariance in high dimensional neural data, especially when the covariates lie in restricted domains. The framework is general and can be easily adapted to various applications beyond neuroscience.

                arXiv:2502.00593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quality-Diversity is a family of evolutionary algorithms that generate diverse, high-performing solutions through local competition principles inspired by natural evolution. While research has focused on improving specific aspects of Quality-Diversity algorithms, surprisingly little attention has been paid to investigating alternative formulations of local competition itself -- the core mechanism distinguishing Quality-Diversity from traditional evolutionary algorithms. Most approaches implement local competition through explicit collection mechanisms like fixed grids or unstructured archives, imposing artificial constraints that require predefined bounds or hard-to-tune parameters. We show that Quality-Diversity methods can be reformulated as Genetic Algorithms where local competition occurs through fitness transformations rather than explicit collection mechanisms. Building on this insight, we introduce Dominated Novelty Search, a Quality-Diversity algorithm that implements local competition through dynamic fitness transformations, eliminating the need for predefined bounds or parameters. Our experiments show that Dominated Novelty Search significantly outperforms existing approaches across standard Quality-Diversity benchmarks, while maintaining its advantage in challenging scenarios like high-dimensional and unsupervised spaces.

Abstract: This paper proposes a new hybrid algorithm, combining FA, SSO, and the N-R method to accelerate convergence towards global optima, named the Hybrid Firefly Algorithm and Sperm Swarm Optimization with Newton-Raphson (HFASSON). The performance of HFASSON is evaluated using 23 benchmark functions from the CEC 2017 suite, tested in 30, 50, and 100 dimensions. A statistical comparison is performed to assess the effectiveness of HFASSON against FA, SSO, HFASSO, and five hybrid algorithms: Water Cycle Moth Flame Optimization (WCMFO), Hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization and Genetic Algorithm (HPSOGA), Hybrid Sperm Swarm Optimization and Gravitational Search Algorithm (HSSOGSA), Grey Wolf and Cuckoo Search Algorithm (GWOCS), and Hybrid Firefly Genetic Algorithm (FAGA). Results from the Friedman rank test show the superior performance of HFASSON. Additionally, HFASSON is applied to Cognitive Radio Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (CR-VANET), outperforming basic CR-VANET in spectrum utilization. These findings demonstrate HFASSON's efficiency in wireless network applications.

Abstract: Data-intensive computing tasks, such as training neural networks, are crucial for artificial intelligence applications but often come with high energy demands. One promising solution is to develop specialized hardware that directly maps neural networks, utilizing arrays of memristive devices to perform parallel multiply-accumulate operations.

Additionally, we developed the device in Python to facilitate the design of a memcapacitive-based accelerator. Our proposed framework employs a crossbar array of memcapacitor devices to train a neural network capable of digit classification and CIFAR dataset recognition. We tested the non-ideal characteristics of the constructed memcapacitor-based neural network. The system achieved an impressive 98.4% training accuracy in digit recognition and 94.4% training accuracy in CIFAR recognition, highlighting its effectiveness. This study demonstrates the potential of memcapacitor-based neural network systems in handling classification tasks and sets the stage for further advancements in neuromorphic computing.

                arXiv:2502.00029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Financial metrics like the Sharpe ratio are pivotal in evaluating investment performance by balancing risk and return. However, traditional metrics often struggle with robustness and generalization, particularly in dynamic and volatile market conditions. This paper introduces AlphaSharpe, a novel framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) to iteratively evolve and optimize financial metrics. AlphaSharpe generates enhanced risk-return metrics that outperform traditional approaches in robustness and correlation with future performance metrics by employing iterative crossover, mutation, and evaluation. Key contributions of this work include: (1) an innovative use of LLMs for generating and refining financial metrics inspired by domain-specific knowledge, (2) a scoring mechanism to ensure the evolved metrics generalize effectively to unseen data, and (3) an empirical demonstration of 3x predictive power for future risk-return forecasting. Experimental results on a real-world dataset highlight the superiority of AlphaSharpe metrics, making them highly relevant for portfolio managers and financial decision-makers. This framework not only addresses the limitations of existing metrics but also showcases the potential of LLMs in advancing financial analytics, paving the way for informed and robust investment strategies.

                arXiv:2502.00074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, 4D Radar has emerged as a crucial sensor for 3D object detection in autonomous vehicles, offering both stable perception in adverse weather and high-density point clouds for object shape recognition. However, processing such high-density data demands substantial computational resources and energy consumption. We propose SpikingRTNH, the first spiking neural network (SNN) for 3D object detection using 4D Radar data. By replacing conventional ReLU activation functions with leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) spiking neurons, SpikingRTNH achieves significant energy efficiency gains. Furthermore, inspired by human cognitive processes, we introduce biological top-down inference (BTI), which processes point clouds sequentially from higher to lower densities. This approach effectively utilizes points with lower noise and higher importance for detection. Experiments on K-Radar dataset demonstrate that SpikingRTNH with BTI significantly reduces energy consumption by 78% while achieving comparable detection performance to its ANN counterpart (51.1% AP 3D, 57.0% AP BEV). These results establish the viability of SNNs for energy-efficient 4D Radar-based object detection in autonomous driving systems.

                arXiv:2502.00112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: SAGRAD (Simulated Annealing GRADient), a Fortran 77 program for computing neural networks for classification using batch learning, is discussed. Neural network training in SAGRAD is based on a combination of simulated annealing and M{\o}ller's scaled conjugate gradient algorithm, the latter a variation of the traditional conjugate gradient method, better suited for the nonquadratic nature of neural networks. Different aspects of the implementation of the training process in SAGRAD are discussed, such as the efficient computation of gradients and multiplication of vectors by Hessian matrices that are required by M{\o}ller's algorithm; the (re)initialization of weights with simulated annealing required to (re)start M{\o}ller's algorithm the first time and each time thereafter that it shows insufficient progress in reaching a possibly local minimum; and the use of simulated annealing when M{\o}ller's algorithm, after possibly making considerable progress, becomes stuck at a local minimum or flat area of weight space. Outlines of the scaled conjugate gradient algorithm, the simulated annealing procedure and the training process used in SAGRAD are presented together with results from running SAGRAD on two examples of training data.

Abstract: While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success, their design largely relies on empirical intuition rather than theoretical understanding. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of GNN behavior through three fundamental aspects: (1) we establish that \textbf{$k$-layer} Message Passing Neural Networks efficiently aggregate \textbf{$k$-hop} neighborhood information through iterative computation, (2) analyze how different loop structures influence neighborhood computation, and (3) examine behavior across structure-feature hybrid and structure-only tasks. For deeper GNNs, we demonstrate that gradient-related issues, rather than just over-smoothing, can significantly impact performance in sparse graphs. We also analyze how different normalization schemes affect model performance and how GNNs make predictions with uniform node features, providing a theoretical framework that bridges the gap between empirical success and theoretical understanding.

                arXiv:2502.00213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformer models are challenging to optimize with SGD and typically require adaptive optimizers such as Adam. However, the reasons behind the superior performance of Adam over SGD remain unclear. In this study, we investigate the optimization of transformer models by focusing on \emph{gradient heterogeneity}, defined as the disparity in gradient norms among parameters. Our analysis shows that gradient heterogeneity hinders gradient-based optimization, including SGD, while sign-based optimization, a simplified variant of Adam, is less affected. We further examine gradient heterogeneity in transformer models and show that it is influenced by the placement of layer normalization. Additionally, we show that the momentum term in sign-based optimization is important for preventing the excessive growth of linear-head parameters in tasks with many classes. Experimental results from fine-tuning transformer models in both NLP and vision domains validate our theoretical analyses. This study provides insights into the optimization challenges of transformer models and offers guidance for designing future optimization algorithms.

Abstract: Scaffolding Large Language Models (LLMs) into multi-agent systems often improves performance on complex tasks, but the safety impact of such scaffolds has not been as thoroughly explored.

Our REDAGENTBREEDER evolves scaffolds towards jailbreaking the base LLM while achieving high task success, while BLUEAGENTBREEDER instead aims to combine safety with task reward. We evaluate the systems discovered by the different instances of AGENTBREEDER and popular baselines using widely recognized reasoning, mathematics, and safety benchmarks.

Abstract: This work investigates a novel approach to boost adversarial robustness and generalization by incorporating structural prior into the design of deep learning models. Specifically, our study surprisingly reveals that existing dictionary learning-inspired convolutional neural networks (CNNs) provide a false sense of security against adversarial attacks. To address this, we propose Elastic Dictionary Learning Networks (EDLNets), a novel ResNet architecture that significantly enhances adversarial robustness and generalization. This novel and effective approach is supported by a theoretical robustness analysis using influence functions. Moreover, extensive and reliable experiments demonstrate consistent and significant performance improvement on open robustness leaderboards such as RobustBench, surpassing state-of-the-art baselines. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to discover and validate that structural prior can reliably enhance deep learning robustness under strong adaptive attacks, unveiling a promising direction for future research.

                arXiv:2502.01330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Linear recurrent neural networks enable powerful long-range sequence modeling with constant memory usage and time-per-token during inference. These architectures hold promise for streaming applications at the edge, but deployment in resource-constrained environments requires hardware-aware optimizations to minimize latency and energy consumption. Unstructured sparsity offers a compelling solution, enabling substantial reductions in compute and memory requirements--when accelerated by compatible hardware platforms. In this paper, we conduct a scaling study to investigate the Pareto front of performance and efficiency across inference compute budgets. We find that highly sparse linear RNNs consistently achieve better efficiency-performance trade-offs than dense baselines, with 2x less compute and 36% less memory at iso-accuracy. Our models achieve state-of-the-art results on a real-time streaming task for audio denoising. By quantizing our sparse models to fixed-point arithmetic and deploying them on the Intel Loihi 2 neuromorphic chip for real-time processing, we translate model compression into tangible gains of 42x lower latency and 149x lower energy consumption compared to a dense model on an edge GPU. Our findings showcase the transformative potential of unstructured sparsity, paving the way for highly efficient recurrent neural networks in real-world, resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) hold promise for energy-efficient, biologically inspired computing. We identify substantial informatio loss during spike transmission, linked to temporal dependencies in traditional Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron-a key factor potentially limiting SNN performance. Existing SNN architectures also underutilize modern GPUs, constrained by single-bit spike storage and isolated weight-spike operations that restrict computational efficiency. We introduce ${SpikePack}$, a neuron model designed to reduce transmission loss while preserving essential features like membrane potential reset and leaky integration. ${SpikePack}$ achieves constant $\mathcal{O}(1)$ time and space complexity, enabling efficient parallel processing on GPUs and also supporting serial inference on existing SNN hardware accelerators. Compatible with standard Artificial Neural Network (ANN) architectures, ${SpikePack}$ facilitates near-lossless ANN-to-SNN conversion across various networks. Experimental results on tasks such as image classification, detection, and segmentation show ${SpikePack}$ achieves significant gains in accuracy and efficiency for both directly trained and converted SNNs over state-of-the-art models. Tests on FPGA-based platforms further confirm cross-platform flexibility, delivering high performance and enhanced sparsity. By enhancing information flow and rethinking SNN-ANN integration, ${SpikePack}$ advances efficient SNN deployment across diverse hardware platforms.

Abstract: Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning (EvoRL) has emerged as a promising approach to overcoming the limitations of traditional reinforcement learning (RL) by integrating the Evolutionary Computation (EC) paradigm with RL. However, the population-based nature of EC significantly increases computational costs, thereby restricting the exploration of algorithmic design choices and scalability in large-scale settings. To address this challenge, we introduce $\texttt{$\textbf{EvoRL}$}$, the first end-to-end EvoRL framework optimized for GPU acceleration. The framework executes the entire training pipeline on accelerators, including environment simulations and EC processes, leveraging hierarchical parallelism through vectorization and compilation techniques to achieve superior speed and scalability. This design enables the efficient training of large populations on a single machine. In addition to its performance-oriented design, $\texttt{$\textbf{EvoRL}$}$ offers a comprehensive platform for EvoRL research, encompassing implementations of traditional RL algorithms (e.g., A2C, PPO, DDPG, TD3, SAC), Evolutionary Algorithms (e.g., CMA-ES, OpenES, ARS), and hybrid EvoRL paradigms such as Evolutionary-guided RL (e.g., ERL, CEM-RL) and Population-Based AutoRL (e.g., PBT). The framework's modular architecture and user-friendly interface allow researchers to seamlessly integrate new components, customize algorithms, and conduct fair benchmarking and ablation studies. The project is open-source and available at: https://github.com/EMI-Group/evorl.

                arXiv:2501.17168v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tree-based Genetic Programming (TGP) is a key evolutionary algorithm widely used in symbolic regression, feature engineering, and scientific modeling. Its high computational demands make GPU acceleration essential for scalable and high-performance evolutionary computation. However, GPU acceleration of TGP faces three key challenges: inefficient tree encoding, highly heterogeneous genetic operations, and limited parallelism in fitness evaluation. To address these challenges, we introduce EvoGP, a comprehensive GPU-accelerated TGP framework. First, we design a tensorized encoding scheme to represent tree with different structures as tensors with the same shape, optimizing memory access and enabling efficient parallel execution. Second, we propose a unified parallel framework for genetic operations by leveraging shared computational primitives and implementing dedicated CUDA kernels for scalable performance. Third, we present a fully parallel fitness evaluation strategy for symbolic regression, exploiting both population-level and data-level parallelism to maximize GPU utilization. Moreover, we implement a comprehensive library to provide rich algorithm operators and benchmark problems. EvoGP is extensively tested on various tasks, including symbolic regression, classification, and robotics control, demonstrating its versatility and effectiveness across diverse application scenarios. Experimental results show that EvoGP achieves up to a 140.89x speedup over the state-of-the-art GPU-based TGP implementation, while maintaining or exceeding the accuracy of baseline methods. EvoGP is open-source and accessible at: https://github.com/EMI-Group/evogp.

                arXiv:2307.15712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Energy efficiency in computation is ultimately limited by noise, with quantum limits setting the fundamental noise floor. Analog physical neural networks hold promise for improved energy efficiency compared to digital electronic neural networks. However, they are typically operated in a relatively high-power regime so that the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is large, and the noise can be treated as a perturbation. We study optical neural networks where all layers except the last are operated in the limit that each neuron can be activated by just a single photon, and as a result the noise on neuron activations is no longer merely perturbative. We show that by using a physics-based probabilistic model of the neuron activations in training, it is possible to perform accurate machine-learning inference in spite of the extremely high shot noise (SNR ~ 1). We experimentally demonstrated MNIST handwritten-digit classification with a test accuracy of 98% using an optical neural network with a hidden layer operating in the single-photon regime; the optical energy used to perform the classification corresponds to just 0.038 photons per multiply-accumulate (MAC) operation. Our physics-aware stochastic training approach might also prove useful with non-optical ultra-low-power hardware.

                arXiv:2411.04728v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by biological processes, neuromorphic computing leverages spiking neural networks (SNNs) to perform inference tasks, offering significant efficiency gains for workloads involving sequential data. Recent advances in hardware and software have shown that embedding a small payload within each spike exchanged between spiking neurons can enhance inference accuracy without increasing energy consumption. To scale neuromorphic computing to larger workloads, split computing - where an SNN is partitioned across two devices - is a promising solution. In such architectures, the device hosting the initial layers must transmit information about the spikes generated by its output neurons to the second device. This establishes a trade-off between the benefits of multi-level spikes, which carry additional payload information, and the communication resources required for transmitting extra bits between devices. This paper presents the first comprehensive study of a neuromorphic wireless split computing architecture that employs multi-level SNNs. We propose digital and analog modulation schemes for an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) radio interface to enable efficient communication. Simulation and experimental results using software-defined radios reveal performance improvements achieved by multi-level SNN models and provide insights into the optimal payload size as a function of the connection quality between the transmitter and receiver.

We introduce the Expanded Integral of the Exponential Linear Unit (xIELU), a trainable piecewise activation function derived by integrating trainable affine transformations applied to the Exponential Linear Unit (ELU). xIELU combines two key properties for the gradient: (1) a trainable and linearly increasing gradient for positive inputs, similar to Squared ReLU (ReLU$^2$), and (2) a trainable gradient that can take negative values for negative inputs, inspired by Expanded SiLU (xSiLU). Conceptually, xIELU can be viewed as an extension of ReLU$^2$ to handle negative inputs. The trainable parameters in xIELU allow it to adaptively reduce its nonlinearity for higher-level representations deeper in the network. In experiments with 1.1B and 3B parameter Llama models trained on 125B tokens of FineWeb Edu, xIELU achieves lower perplexity compared to popular activation functions like ReLU$^2$ and SwiGLU when matched for the same compute cost and parameter count. A reference implementation is available at https://github.com/Anonymous5823/xielu.

Abstract: Missing data is a pervasive challenge in wireless networks and many other domains, often compromising the performance of machine learning and deep learning models. To address this, we propose a novel framework, FGATT, that combines the Fuzzy Graph Attention Network (FGAT) with the Transformer encoder to perform robust and accurate data imputation. FGAT leverages fuzzy rough sets and graph attention mechanisms to capture spatial dependencies dynamically, even in scenarios where predefined spatial information is unavailable. The Transformer encoder is employed to model temporal dependencies, utilizing its self-attention mechanism to focus on significant time-series patterns. A self-adaptive graph construction method is introduced to enable dynamic connectivity learning, ensuring the framework's applicability to a wide range of wireless datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in imputation accuracy and robustness, particularly in scenarios with substantial missing data. The proposed model is well-suited for applications in wireless sensor networks and IoT environments, where data integrity is critical.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17312">Improving Pareto Set Learning for Expensive Multi-objective Optimization via Stein Variational Hypernetworks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2412.17312v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Expensive multi-objective optimization problems (EMOPs) are common in real-world scenarios where evaluating objective functions is costly and involves extensive computations or physical experiments. Current Pareto set learning methods for such problems often rely on surrogate models like Gaussian processes to approximate the objective functions. These surrogate models can become fragmented, resulting in numerous small uncertain regions between explored solutions. When using acquisition functions such as the Lower Confidence Bound (LCB), these uncertain regions can turn into pseudo-local optima, complicating the search for globally optimal solutions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach called SVH-PSL, which integrates Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) with Hypernetworks for efficient Pareto set learning. Our method addresses the issues of fragmented surrogate models and pseudo-local optima by collectively moving particles in a manner that smooths out the solution space. The particles interact with each other through a kernel function, which helps maintain diversity and encourages the exploration of underexplored regions. This kernel-based interaction prevents particles from clustering around pseudo-local optima and promotes convergence towards globally optimal solutions. Our approach aims to establish robust relationships between trade-off reference vectors and their corresponding true Pareto solutions, overcoming the limitations of existing methods. Through extensive experiments across both synthetic and real-world MOO benchmarks, we demonstrate that SVH-PSL significantly improves the quality of the learned Pareto set, offering a promising solution for expensive multi-objective optimization problems.

	<p>Background/Objectives: Recent research suggests that video games may serve as cognitive training tools to enhance visual working memory (VWM) capacity. However, the effectiveness of game-based cognitive training remains debated, and the underlying neural mechanisms, as well as the relationship between training efficacy and game design factors, are unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of video game training on VWM capacity and explore its neural correlates. Methods: Two groups underwent 56 daily 20 min training sessions with two distinct video games targeting different cognitive skills: a reaction-time training game and a VWM-specific training game. Behavioral assessments included accuracy, hit response times, correct rejection response times, and Cowan&amp;amp;rsquo;s K values. Neural correlates were measured through Negative Slow Wave (NSW) activity using EEG. Decision tree classification analyses were applied to NSW data across sessions and set sizes to identify patterns linked to VWM capacity. Results: Preliminary results are that both groups showed improvements in behavioral measures (accuracy, response times, and Cowan&amp;amp;rsquo;s K values). NSW analyses revealed a main effect of set size in both groups, and classification results indicated that NSW patterns differed between groups, across sessions, and set sizes, supporting the relationship between NSW and VWM capacity. Conclusions: These findings contribute to understanding NSW as a neurophysiological correlate of VWM capacity, demonstrating its plasticity through video game training. Simple video games could effectively enhance behavioral and neural aspects of VWM, encouraging their potential as accessible cognitive training tools.</p>

                <p>Chronic pain is a debilitative disease affecting one in five adults globally and is a major risk factor for anxiety (  <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B15">Goldberg and McGee, 2011</cross-ref>;   <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B23">Lurie, 2018</cross-ref>). Given the current dearth of available treatments for both individuals living with chronic pain and mental illnesses, there is a critical need for research into the molecular mechanisms involved in order to discover novel treatment targets. Cellular homeostasis is crucial for normal bodily functions, and investigations of this process may provide better understanding of the mechanisms driving the development of chronic pain. Using the spared nerve injury (SNI) model of neuropathic pain, we found contrasting roles for BECLIN-1 in the development of pain hypersensitivity and anxiety-like behaviors in a sex-dependent manner. Remarkably, we found that male SNI mice with impaired BECLIN-1 function demonstrated heightened mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity compared with male wild-type SNI mice, while female SNI mice with impaired BECLIN-1 function demonstrated similar thresholds to the female wild-type SNI mice. We also found that disruptions of BECLIN-1 prevented SNI-induced increases in anxiety-like behaviors in male mice. Our data thus indicate that BECLIN-1 is differentially involved in the nociceptive and emotional components of chronic pain in male but not female mice.</p>

                <p>Food intake is controlled by multiple converging signals: hormonal signals that provide information about energy homeostasis and hedonic and motivational aspects of food and food cues that can drive nonhomeostatic or "hedonic" feeding. The ventral pallidum (VP) is a brain region implicated in the hedonic and motivational impact of food and food cues, as well as consumption of rewards. Disinhibition of VP neurons has been shown to generate intense hyperphagia, or overconsumption. While VP GABA neurons have been implicated in cue-elicited reward-seeking and motivation, the role of these neurons in the hyperphagia resulting from VP activation remains unclear. Here, we used designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs to activate VP GABA neurons in nonrestricted male and female rats during chow and sucrose consumption. We found that activation of VP GABA neurons increases consumption of chow and sucrose in male rats, but not female rats. Together, these findings suggest that activation of VP GABA neurons can stimulate consumption of routine or highly palatable rewards selectively in male rats.</p>

Given the high global seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2, understanding the risk of reinfection has become increasingly important. Models developed to track trends in reinfection risk should be robust against possible biases arising from imperfect data observation processes. We performed simulation-based validation of an existing catalytic model designed to detect changes in the risk of reinfection by SARS-CoV-2. The catalytic model assumes the risk of reinfection is proportional to observed infections. Validation involved using simulated primary infections, consistent with the number of observed infections in South Africa. To assess the performance of the catalytic model, we simulated reinfection datasets that incorporated different processes that may bias inference, including imperfect observation and mortality. A Bayesian approach was used to fit the model to simulated data, assuming a negative binomial distribution around the expected number of reinfections, and model projections were compared to the simulated data using different magnitudes of change in reinfection risk. We assessed the model’s ability to accurately detect changes in reinfection risk when included in the simulations, as well as the occurrence of false positives when reinfection risk remained constant. The model parameters converged in most scenarios leading to model outputs aligning with anticipated outcomes. The model successfully detected changes in the risk of reinfection when such a change was introduced to the data. Low observation probabilities (10%) of both primary- and reinfections resulted in low numbers of observed cases from the simulated data and poor convergence. The model’s performance was assessed on simulated data representative of the South African SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, reflecting its timing of waves and outbreak magnitude. Model performance under similar scenarios may be different in settings with smaller epidemics (and therefore smaller numbers of reinfections). Ensuring model parameter convergence is essential to avoid false-positive detection of shifts in reinfection risk. While the model is robust in most scenarios of imperfect observation and mortality, further simulation-based validation for regions experiencing smaller outbreaks is recommended. Caution must be exercised in directly extrapolating results across different epidemiological contexts without additional validation efforts.

Vaccines which can transmit from vaccinated to unvaccinated animals may be especially useful for increasing immunity in hard to reach populations or in populations where achieving high coverage is logistically infeasible. However, gauging the public health utility for future use of such transmissible vaccines and assessing their risk-benefit tradeoff, given their potential for unintended evolution, hinges on accurate estimates of their indirect protective effect. Here, we establish the conditions under which a two-stage randomized field trial can characterize the protective effects of a transmissible vaccine relative to a traditional vaccine. We contrast the sample sizes required to adequately power these trials when the vaccine is weakly and strongly transmissible. We also identify how required sample sizes change based on the characteristics of host ecology such as the overdispersion of the contact structure of the population, as well as the efficacy of the vaccine and timing of vaccination. Our results indicate the range of scenarios where two-stage randomized field trial designs are feasible and appropriate to capture the protective effects of transmissible vaccines. Our estimates identify the protective benefit of using transmissible vaccines compared to traditional vaccines, and thus can be used to weigh against evolutionary risks.

                <p>by Nathanaël Hozé, Margarita Pons-Salort, C. Jessica E. Metcalf, Michael White, Henrik Salje, Simon Cauchemez</p>

Population-based serological surveys are a key tool in epidemiology to characterize the level of population immunity and reconstruct the past circulation of pathogens. A variety of serocatalytic models have been developed to estimate the force of infection (FOI) (i.e., the rate at which susceptible individuals become infected) from age-stratified seroprevalence data. However, few tool currently exists to easily implement, combine, and compare these models. Here, we introduce an R package, <i>Rsero</i>, that implements a series of serocatalytic models and estimates the FOI from age-stratified seroprevalence data using Bayesian methods. The package also contains a series of features to perform model comparison and visualise model fit. We introduce new serocatalytic models of successive outbreaks and extend existing models of seroreversion to any transmission model. The different features of the package are illustrated with simulated and real-life data. We show we can identify the correct epidemiological scenario and recover model parameters in different epidemiological settings. We also show how the package can support serosurvey study design in a variety of epidemic situations. This package provides a standard framework to epidemiologists and modellers to study the dynamics of past pathogen circulation from cross-sectional serological survey data.

                <p>by Grace C. McKenzie-Smith, Scott W. Wolf, Julien F. Ayroles, Joshua W. Shaevitz</p>

Animal behavior spans many timescales, from short, seconds-scale actions to daily rhythms over many hours to life-long changes during aging. To access longer timescales of behavior, we continuously recorded individual <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> at 100 frames per second for up to 7 days at a time in featureless arenas on sucrose-agarose media. We use the deep learning framework SLEAP to produce a full-body postural dataset for 47 individuals resulting in nearly 2 billion pose instances. We identify stereotyped behaviors such as grooming, proboscis extension, and locomotion and use the resulting ethograms to explore how the flies’ behavior varies across time of day and days in the experiment. We find distinct daily patterns in all stereotyped behaviors, adding specific information about trends in different grooming modalities, proboscis extension duration, and locomotion speed to what is known about the <i>D. melanogaster</i> circadian cycle. Using our holistic measurements of behavior, we find that the hour after dawn is a unique time point in the flies’ daily pattern of behavior, and that the behavioral composition of this hour tracks well with other indicators of health such as locomotion speed and the fraction of time spend moving vs. resting. The method, data, and analysis presented here give us a new and clearer picture of <i>D. melanogaster</i> behavior across timescales, revealing novel features that hint at unexplored underlying biological mechanisms.

                <p>by Irene Ojeda-Naharros, Tirthasree Das, Ralph A. Castro, J. Fernando Bazan, Christian Vaisse, Maxence V. Nachury</p>

The G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) melanocortin receptor 4 (MC4R) is an essential regulator of body weight homeostasis. MC4R is unusual among GPCRs in that its activity is regulated by 2 opposing physiological ligands, the agonist ⍺-MSH and the antagonist/inverse agonist AgRP. Paradoxically, while MC4R localizes and functions at the cilium of hypothalamic neurons, the ciliary levels of MC4R are very low under unrestricted feeding conditions. Here, we find that the constitutive activity of MC4R is responsible for the continuous depletion of MC4R from cilia and that inhibition of MC4R’s activity via AgRP leads to a robust accumulation of MC4R in cilia. Ciliary targeting of MC4R is mediated by its partner MRAP2 and the constitutive exit of MC4R from cilia relies on the sensor of activation β-arrestin, on ubiquitination, and on the BBSome ciliary trafficking complex. Thus, while MC4R exits cilia via conventional mechanisms, it only accumulates in cilia when its activity is suppressed by AgRP.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003024">Detailed characterisation of the trypanosome nuclear pore architecture reveals conserved asymmetrical functional hubs that drive mRNA export</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Bernardo Papini Gabiatti, Johanna Krenzer, Silke Braune, Timothy Krüger, Martin Zoltner, Susanne Kramer</p>

Nuclear export of mRNAs requires loading the mRNP to the transporter Mex67/Mtr2 in the nucleoplasm, controlled access to the pore by the basket-localised TREX-2 complex and mRNA release at the cytoplasmic site by the DEAD-box RNA helicase Dbp5. Asymmetric localisation of nucleoporins (NUPs) and transport components as well as the ATP dependency of Dbp5 ensure unidirectionality of transport. Trypanosomes possess homologues of the mRNA transporter Mex67/Mtr2, but not of TREX-2 or Dbp5. Instead, nuclear export is likely fuelled by the GTP/GDP gradient created by the Ran GTPase. However, it remains unclear, how directionality is achieved since the current model of the trypanosomatid pore is mostly symmetric. We have revisited the architecture of the trypanosome nuclear pore complex using a novel combination of expansion microscopy, proximity labelling and streptavidin imaging. We could confidently assign the NUP76 complex, a known Mex67 interaction platform, to the cytoplasmic site of the pore and the NUP64/NUP98/NUP75 complex to the nuclear site. Having defined markers for both sites of the pore, we set out to map all 75 trypanosome proteins with known nuclear pore localisation to a subregion of the pore using mass spectrometry data from proximity labelling. This approach defined several further proteins with a specific localisation to the nuclear site of the pore, including proteins with predicted structural homology to TREX-2 components. We mapped the components of the Ran-based mRNA export system to the nuclear site (RanBPL), the cytoplasmic site (RanGAP, RanBP1) or both (Ran, MEX67). Lastly, we demonstrate, by deploying an auxin degron system, that NUP76 holds an essential role in mRNA export consistent with a possible functional orthology to NUP82/88. Altogether, the combination of proximity labelling with expansion microscopy revealed an asymmetric architecture of the trypanosome nuclear pore supporting inherent roles for directed transport. Our approach delivered novel nuclear pore associated components inclusive positional information, which can now be interrogated for functional roles to explore trypanosome-specific adaptions of the nuclear basket, export control, and mRNP remodelling.

                <p>by Huaji Jiang, Yingchao Xie, Zhiqiang Hu, Jiansen Lu, Jiahuan Zhang, Hongyu Li, Ke Zeng, Wenqiang Peng, Cheng Yang, Junsheng Huang, Zelong Han, Xiaochun Bai, Xiao Yu</p>

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic and potentially life-threatening inflammatory disease of gastroenteric tissue characterized by episodes of intestinal inflammation, but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we explore the role and precise mechanism of Van-Gogh-like 2 (VANGL2) during the pathogenesis of IBD. VANGL2 decreases in IBD patients and dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in mice. Myeloid VANGL2 deficiency exacerbates the progression of DSS-induced colitis in mice and specifically enhances the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages. NLRP3-specific inhibitor MCC950 effectively alleviates DSS-induced colitis in VANGL2 deficient mice. Mechanistically, VANGL2 interacts with NLRP3 and promotes the autophagic degradation of NLRP3 through enhancing the K27-linked polyubiquitination at lysine 823 of NLRP3 by recruiting E3 ligase MARCH8, leading to optineurin (OPTN)-mediated selective autophagy. Notably, decreased VANGL2 in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells from IBD patients results in overt NLRP3 inflammasome activation and sustained inflammation. Taken together, this study demonstrates that VANGL2 acts as a repressor of IBD progression by inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome activation and provides insights into the crosstalk between inflammation and autophagy in preventing IBD.

                Background Body gesture recognition has become a fundamental technique in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). As human-machine interaction evolves, there is an increasing need for precise and efficient gesture detection systems. However, current methods face limitations such as accuracy constraints, high computational complexity, and limited adaptability. This study addresses these challenges by proposing an innovative approach to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of body gesture recognition systems. Methods The proposed system integrates advanced algorithms and techniques to improve performance. A Marker-Based Watershed Algorithm is employed for accurate image segmentation, enhancing region detection. Feature extraction uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), while a Wavelet Transform-Based Pre-Processing technique improves input data quality. A unique component of this method is the application of the Crow Search Algorithm to optimize model efficiency. An Optimized Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) is utilized for gesture classification, aiming to increase precision and computational effectiveness. Results The proposed approach achieves a gesture recognition accuracy rate of 99%. Compared to traditional methods such as Decision Trees (DT), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Improved Neural Networks (INN), the Optimized PNN demonstrates a 2.21% improvement in overall accuracy. The implementation, carried out in Python, showcases the robustness and adaptability of the system across diverse HCI applications. Conclusions This work presents a comprehensive solution to the challenges of body gesture recognition by integrating cutting-edge algorithms. Combining the Marker-Based Watershed Algorithm, CNN-based feature extraction, and Crow Search Optimization significantly enhances the system’s accuracy and efficiency. By addressing the shortcomings of existing methods, this approach provides a more responsive, reliable, and flexible gesture recognition system, contributing to the advancement of HCI technologies. The results demonstrate the potential for improved human-computer interaction through more effective and precise gesture detection.

                Claywell et al. show that Toxoplasma egress is controlled by a negative feedback loop. PKAc1 is activated after invasion to inhibit egress by targeting processes between cGMP production and Ca2+ signaling. PKAc1 activation of PDE2 serves to deplete cAMP, thus downregulating PKAc1 activity and permitting egress through the PKG/CDPK pathway.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98934">Template switching during DNA replication is a prevalent source of adaptive gene amplification</a></h4>

              
                Copy number variants (CNVs) are an important source of genetic variation underlying rapid adaptation and genome evolution. Whereas point mutation rates vary with genomic location and local DNA features, the role of genome architecture in the formation and evolutionary dynamics of CNVs is poorly understood. Previously, we found the <i>GAP1</i> gene in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> undergoes frequent amplification and selection in glutamine-limitation. The gene is flanked by two long terminal repeats (LTRs) and proximate to an origin of DNA replication (autonomously replicating sequence, ARS), which likely promote rapid <i>GAP1</i> CNV formation. To test the role of these genomic elements on CNV-mediated adaptive evolution, we evolved engineered strains lacking either the adjacent LTRs, ARS, or all elements in glutamine-limited chemostats. Using a CNV reporter system and neural network simulation-based inference (nnSBI) we quantified the formation rate and fitness effect of CNVs for each strain. Removal of local DNA elements significantly impacts the fitness effect of <i>GAP1</i> CNVs and the rate of adaptation. In 177 CNV lineages, across all four strains, between 26% and 80% of all <i>GAP1</i> CNVs are mediated by Origin Dependent Inverted Repeat Amplification (ODIRA) which results from template switching between the leading and lagging strand during DNA synthesis. In the absence of the local ARS, distal ones mediate CNV formation via ODIRA. In the absence of local LTRs, homologous recombination can mediate gene amplification following <i>de novo</i> retrotransposon events. Our study reveals that template switching during DNA replication is a prevalent source of adaptive CNVs.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/87527">Dendritic growth and synaptic organization from activity-independent cues and local activity-dependent plasticity</a></h4>

              
                Dendritic branching and synaptic organization shape single-neuron and network computations. How they emerge simultaneously during brain development as neurons become integrated into functional networks is still not mechanistically understood. Here, we propose a mechanistic model in which dendrite growth and the organization of synapses arise from the interaction of activity-independent cues from potential synaptic partners and local activity-dependent synaptic plasticity. Consistent with experiments, three phases of dendritic growth – overshoot, pruning, and stabilization – emerge naturally in the model. The model generates stellate-like dendritic morphologies that capture several morphological features of biological neurons under normal and perturbed learning rules, reflecting biological variability. Model-generated dendrites have approximately optimal wiring length consistent with experimental measurements. In addition to establishing dendritic morphologies, activity-dependent plasticity rules organize synapses into spatial clusters according to the correlated activity they experience. We demonstrate that a trade-off between activity-dependent and -independent factors influences dendritic growth and synaptic location throughout development, suggesting that early developmental variability can affect mature morphology and synaptic function. Therefore, a single mechanistic model can capture dendritic growth and account for the synaptic organization of correlated inputs during development. Our work suggests concrete mechanistic components underlying the emergence of dendritic morphologies and synaptic formation and removal in function and dysfunction, and provides experimentally testable predictions for the role of individual components.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97764">Single-cell sequencing provides clues about the developmental genetic basis of evolutionary adaptations in syngnathid fishes</a></h4>

              
                Seahorses, pipefishes, and seadragons are fishes from the family Syngnathidae that have evolved extraordinary traits including male pregnancy, elongated snouts, loss of teeth, and dermal bony armor. The developmental genetic and cellular changes that led to the evolution of these traits are largely unknown. Recent syngnathid genome assemblies revealed suggestive gene content differences and provided the opportunity for detailed genetic analyses. We created a single-cell RNA sequencing atlas of Gulf pipefish embryos to understand the developmental basis of four traits: derived head shape, toothlessness, dermal armor, and male pregnancy. We completed marker gene analyses, built genetic networks, and examined the spatial expression of select genes. We identified osteochondrogenic mesenchymal cells in the elongating face that express regulatory genes <i>bmp4, sfrp1a</i>, and <i>prdm16</i>. We found no evidence for tooth primordia cells, and we observed re-deployment of osteoblast genetic networks in developing dermal armor. Finally, we found that epidermal cells expressed nutrient processing and environmental sensing genes, potentially relevant for the brooding environment. The examined pipefish evolutionary innovations are composed of recognizable cell types, suggesting that derived features originate from changes within existing gene networks. Future work addressing syngnathid gene networks across multiple stages and species is essential for understanding how the novelties of these fish evolved.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/87078">Live imaging of excitable axonal microdomains in ankyrin-G-GFP mice</a></h4>

              
                The axon initial segment (AIS) constitutes not only the site of action potential initiation, but also a hub for activity-dependent modulation of output generation. Recent studies shedding light on AIS function used predominantly post-hoc approaches since no robust murine in vivo live reporters exist. Here, we introduce a reporter line in which the AIS is intrinsically labeled by an ankyrin-G-GFP fusion protein activated by Cre recombinase, tagging the native <i>Ank3</i> gene. Using confocal, superresolution, and two-photon microscopy as well as whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in vitro, ex vivo<i>,</i> and in vivo, we confirm that the subcellular scaffold of the AIS and electrophysiological parameters of labeled cells remain unchanged. We further uncover rapid AIS remodeling following increased network activity in this model system, as well as highly reproducible in vivo labeling of AIS over weeks. This novel reporter line allows longitudinal studies of AIS modulation and plasticity in vivo in real-time and thus provides a unique approach to study subcellular plasticity in a broad range of applications.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93633">Volumetric trans-scale imaging of massive quantity of heterogeneous cell populations in centimeter-wide tissue and embryo</a></h4>

              
                We established a volumetric trans-scale imaging system with an ultra-large field-of-view (FOV) that enables simultaneous observation of millions of cellular dynamics in centimeter-wide three-dimensional (3D) tissues and embryos. Using a custom-made giant lens system with a magnification of ×2 and a numerical aperture (NA) of 0.25, and a CMOS camera with more than 100 megapixels, we built a trans-scale scope AMATERAS-2, and realized fluorescence imaging with a transverse spatial resolution of approximately 1.1 µm across an FOV of approximately 1.5×1.0 cm<sup>2</sup>. The 3D resolving capability was realized through a combination of optical and computational sectioning techniques tailored for our low-power imaging system. We applied the imaging technique to 1.2 cm-wide section of mouse brain, and successfully observed various regions of the brain with sub-cellular resolution in a single FOV. We also performed time-lapse imaging of a 1-cm-wide vascular network during quail embryo development for over 24 hr, visualizing the movement of over 4.0×10<sup>5</sup> vascular endothelial cells and quantitatively analyzing their dynamics. Our results demonstrate the potential of this technique in accelerating production of comprehensive reference maps of all cells in organisms and tissues, which contributes to understanding developmental processes, brain functions, and pathogenesis of disease, as well as high-throughput quality check of tissues used for transplantation medicine.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89421">An emerging view of neural geometry in motor cortex supports high-performance decoding</a></h4>

              
                Decoders for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) assume constraints on neural activity, chosen to reflect scientific beliefs while yielding tractable computations. Recent scientific advances suggest that the true constraints on neural activity, especially its geometry, may be quite different from those assumed by most decoders. We designed a decoder, MINT, to embrace statistical constraints that are potentially more appropriate. If those constraints are accurate, MINT should outperform standard methods that explicitly make different assumptions. Additionally, MINT should be competitive with expressive machine learning methods that can implicitly learn constraints from data. MINT performed well across tasks, suggesting its assumptions are well-matched to the data. MINT outperformed other interpretable methods in every comparison we made. MINT outperformed expressive machine learning methods in 37 of 42 comparisons. MINT’s computations are simple, scale favorably with increasing neuron counts, and yield interpretable quantities such as data likelihoods. MINT’s performance and simplicity suggest it may be a strong candidate for many BCI applications.

">Exploring Synergies in Brain-Machine Interfaces: Compression vs. Performance</a></h4>

              
                Individuals with severe neurological injuries often rely on assistive technologies, but current methods have limitations in accurately decoding multi-degree-of-freedom (DoF) movements. Intracortical brain-machine interfaces (iBMIs) use neural signals to provide a more natural control method, but currently struggle with higher-DoF movements--something the brain handles effortlessly. It has been theorized that the brain simplifies high-DoF movement through muscle synergies, which link multiple muscles to function as a single unit. These synergies have been studied using dimensionality reduction techniques like principal component analysis (PCA), non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), and demixed PCA (dPCA) and successfully used to reduce noise and improve offline decoder stability in non-invasive applications. However, their effectiveness in improving decoding and generalizability for implanted recordings across varied tasks is unclear. Here, we evaluated if brain and muscle synergies can enhance iBMI performance in non-human primates performing a two-DoF finger task. Specifically, we tested if PCA, dPCA, and NMF could compress and denoise brain and muscle data and improve decoder generalization across tasks. Our results showed that while all methods effectively compressed data with minimal loss in decoding accuracy, none improved performance through denoising. Additionally, none of the methods enhanced generalization across tasks. These findings suggest that while dimensionality reduction can aid data compression, alone it may not reveal the "true" control space needed to improve decoder performance or generalizability. Further research is required to determine whether synergies are the optimal control framework or if alternative approaches are required to enhance decoder robustness in iBMI applications.

">Estradiol promotes habituation learning via an unidentified target, bypassing the suppressive effects of established Estrogen Receptors</a></h4>

              
                Habituating to the constant stimuli in the environment is a critical learning process conserved across species. We use a larval zebrafish visual response to sudden darkness as a model for studying habituation learning, where zebrafish reduce their responses to repeated stimulations. In this paradigm, treatment with estradiol strongly increases learning rate, resulting in more strongly suppressed responses. We used mutant lines for the Estrogen Receptors (esr1, esr2a, esr2b, gper1) in an attempt to identify the receptor(s) mediating these effects. These experiments failed to identify a necessary receptor (or combination of receptors). Surprisingly, esr1, esr2a, and gper1 mutants showed weak but consistent increases in habituation, indicating these receptors suppress habituation learning. These experiments demonstrate that estradiol is a complex modulator of learning in our model, where the learning-promoting effects are mediated by an unidentified estradiol target, and the classical Estrogen Receptors act in competition to subtly suppress learning.

">Inhibition of adenylyl cyclase 1 (AC1) and exchange protein directly activated by cAMP (EPAC) restores ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channel activity after chronic opioid exposure</a></h4>

              
                Prolonged exposure to Gi/o receptor agonists such as opioids can lead to a sensitization of adenylyl cyclases (ACs), resulting in heterologous sensitization or cyclic AMP (cAMP) overshoot. The molecular consequences of cAMP overshoot are not well understood, but this adaptive response is suggested to play a critical role in the development of opioid tolerance and withdrawal. We found that genetic reduction of AC1 and simultaneous upregulation of ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channel subunits, SUR1 or Kir6.2, significantly attenuated morphine tolerance and reduced naloxone-precipitated withdrawal. In vitro models utilized an EPAC2-GFP-cAMP biosensor to investigate sensitization of adenylyl cyclase in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells and HEK{Delta}AC3/6 knockout cells. Acute application of DAMGO significantly decreased the cAMP signal from the EPAC2-GFP-cAMP biosensor, while chronic DAMGO administration resulted in enhanced cAMP production following AC stimulation. Inhibition of cAMP overshoot was observed with naloxone (NAL), pertussis toxin (PTX), and the neddylation inhibitor, MLN4924 (Pevonedistat), as well as co-expression of {beta}-adrenergic receptor kinase C-terminus ({beta}ARK-CT). After establishment of the AC1-EPAC sensitization in the in vitro models, we found that inhibition of AC1 or EPAC enhanced potassium channel activity after chronic morphine treatment, using a thallium-based assay in SH-SY5Y cells. Similar data were obtained in mouse dorsal root ganglia (DRG) after chronic morphine treatment. This study presents evidence for investigating further AC1 signaling as a target for opioid tolerance and withdrawal, by increasing EPAC activity and affecting potassium channels downstream of opioid receptors.

">Huntingtin inclusion bodies have distinct immunophenotypes and ubiquitination profiles in the Huntington's disease human cerebral cortex</a></h4>

              
                Huntington's disease (HD) is a hereditary neurodegenerative condition caused by a CAG repeat expansion mutation in the gene encoding the huntingtin (Htt) protein. The accumulation of Htt inclusion bodies is a pathological hallmark of HD and a common target for therapeutic strategies. However, the limited efficacy of treatments targeting the Htt protein highlights the need for a better understanding of the role of Htt inclusion bodies in HD pathogenesis. This study examined the heterogeneity of Htt inclusion body composition by co-labelling with three Htt epitope-specific antibodies to characterize Htt inclusion body 'immunophenotype'. We then characterized the size and sub-cellular location of Htt inclusions with distinct immunophenotypes. Using multiplex immunohistochemistry, we also examined the ubiquitination profile of each immunophenotype. Our findings demonstrate that Htt inclusions have a range of immunophenotypes, with some labelled by only one of the three antibodies and others exhibiting co-labelling by several antibodies, thus demonstrating the heterogeneity in inclusion composition and structure. We outline evidence that inclusion bodies exclusively labelled with the EM48 antibody are small, non-nuclear, and more abundant in HD cases with increased CAG repeat length, higher Vonsattel grade, and earlier age of onset. We also find that Htt inclusion bodies labelled by multiple antibodies are more likely to be ubiquitinated, predominantly by K63- rather than K48-linked ubiquitin, suggesting preferential degradation by autophagy. Lastly, we show that ubiquitinated Htt inclusion bodies are more highly immunoreactive for ubiquilin 2 than p62. Our findings highlight the need for multiple antibodies to capture the full spectrum of Htt pathology in HD and imply that future studies should consider the diversity of inclusion body composition and structure when correlating pathology formation to neurodegeneration, clinical symptoms, or disease severity.

">Mental exploration of future choices during immobility theta oscillations</a></h4>

              
                Mental exploration enables flexible evaluation of potential future choices, guiding decision-making without requiring direct real-world iterations. Although the hippocampus is known to be active while imagining the future, the precise mechanisms that support mental exploration of future choices remain unclear. In the hippocampus, the theta rhythm (4-12 Hz) is prevalent during movement and supports memory coding during real-world exploration by organizing neuronal activity patterns into short virtual path segments (theta sequences) around the rat's location. We observed these theta-related neural activity patterns during movement in a hippocampus-dependent working memory task and also, unexpectedly, theta oscillations and theta-related neural activity during immobility. Compared to standard theta sequences during movement, theta sequences during immobility differed in that they occurred at a shifted theta phase and preferentially represented remote locations, in particular the next choice in the working memory task. Coding for future locations was also observed during awake sharp wave ripple, but these short-lasting events occurred rarely and were biased toward frequently visited locations. Therefore, our findings suggest that recurring bouts of theta oscillations during immobility, which are also observed in primates and humans, support the cognitive demands of mental exploration in the hippocampal network and facilitate ongoing predictions of future choices.

">Active zone maturation state controls synaptic output and release mode and is differentially regulated by neuronal activity</a></h4>

              
                Synapse formation requires the gradual accumulation of cytomatrix proteins and voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VDCCs) at presynaptic active zones (AZs) to support neurotransmitter release. To correlate AZ maturation with synaptic output, quantal imaging was performed at serially imaged time-stamped Drosophila synapses. Evoked release strength correlated strongly with AZ age and accumulation of late AZ scaffolds, while immature sites lacking VDCC accumulation supported spontaneous release. To examine how neuronal activity regulates AZ maturation and protein accumulation, the effects of disruptions to SV fusion or action potential generation were analyzed. Decreasing neuronal activity reduced AZ seeding and caused hyperaccumulation of presynaptic material at existing AZs. Although enlarged AZs are also observed in rab3 mutants, activity reduction acted through an independent mechanism that required postsynaptic glutamate receptor-dependent signaling. Together, these data indicate AZ maturation state sets distinct presynaptic release modes and output strength, with neuronal activity shaping both AZ number and size across development.

">Multi-output computation by single neuron biophysics in a visual system</a></h4>

              
                As long anticipated (Sandberg and Bostrom 2008; Seung 2012; Szigeti et al. 2014), connectomics is providing a new foundation for brain simulation by replacing theoretical assumptions about network connectivity with solid empirical facts. Connectomics also yields detailed information about neuronal morphology, which is useful for simulating the biophysics of single neurons (Yang et al. 2016; Meier and Borst 2019; T. X. Liu et al. 2022). Here I introduce a formalism for simulating a brain as a network of synapses interacting via an effective resistance matrix. By computing this matrix for fly visual interneurons, I find evidence that some neurons may be true multi-output devices, neither well approximated as point neurons (Lappalainen et al. 2024; Shiu et al. 2024), nor as collections of functionally independent compartments (Meier and Borst 2019). Within a linear approximation, such a neuron is instead equivalent to a hierarchy of virtual neurons that spatially pool over multiple length scales. The computational powers of multi-output neurons may support highly sophisticated normalizations in the fly visual system (Seung 2024a).

">Fmr1 KO causes delayed rebound spike timing in mediodorsal thalamocortical neurons through regulation of HCN channel activity</a></h4>

              
                Background: The neurodevelopmental disorder Fragile X syndrome (FXS) results from hypermethylation of the FMR1 gene which prevents FMRP production. FMRP modulates the expression and function of a wide variety of proteins, including voltage-gated ion channels such as Hyperpolarization-Activated Cyclic Nucleotide gated (HCN) channels, which are integral to rhythmic activity in thalamic structures. Thalamocortical pathology, particularly involving the mediodorsal thalamus (MD), has been implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders. MD connectivity with mPFC is integral to executive functions like working memory and social behaviors that are disrupted in FXS. Methods: We used a combination of retrograde labeling and ex vivo brain slice whole cell electrophysiology in 40 wild type and 42 Fmr1 KO male mice to investigate how a lack of Fmr1 affects intrinsic cellular properties in lateral (MD-L) and medial (MD-M) MD neurons that project to the medial prefrontal cortex (MD[-&gt;]mPFC neurons). Results: In MD-L neurons, Fmr1 knockout caused a decrease in HCN-mediated membrane properties such as voltage sag and membrane afterhyperpolarization. These changes in subthreshold properties were accompanied by changes in suprathreshold neuron properties such as the variability of action potential burst timing. Conclusions: In Fmr1 knockout mice, reduced HCN channel activity in MD[-&gt;]mPFC neurons impairs both the timing and magnitude of HCN-mediated membrane potential regulation. Changes in response timing may adversely affect rhythm propagation in Fmr1 KO thalamocortical circuitry. MD thalamic neurons are critical for maintaining rhythmic activity involved in cognitive and affective functions. Understanding specific mechanisms of thalamocortical circuit activity may lead to therapeutic interventions for individuals with FXS.

">Post-Ictal Gamma Oscillations Predict Hippocampal Structural Integrity in Mesial Temporal Lobe Epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                The underlying histopathology and epileptic network of patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE) are difficult to ascertain. Here, we report a novel electrical activity following seizure termination, termed post-ictal gamma oscillations (PIGOs), recorded in mice with intrahippocampal kainic acid injection and a patient with mTLE. PIGOs are characterized by a spectral shift of increased power in gamma frequencies relative to decreased power in other frequencies, generating a gamma peak. PIGOs are accompanied by increased intracellular calcium levels among parvalbumin-positive interneurons and a direct current shift. Only a subgroup of animals in the study had PIGOs. These animals had less pronounced hippocampal sclerosis (HS) than those without PIGOs. To illustrate the translational potential of these findings, we analyzed data from two patients with unilateral mTLE, one with PIGOs and the other without. The patient with PIGOs had symmetrical hippocampi on neuroimaging, whereas the other exhibited overly decreased interictal glucose uptake in left hippocampus, suggesting left-sided HS. After receiving laser ablation of mesial temporal regions, the patient with PIGOs became seizure-free, whereas the other did not. Our results suggest that PIGOs may serve as a biomarker for a milder form of HS in patients with mTLE and for predicting treatment outcomes.

">Protein-Like Polymer for Inhibition of Tau Fibril Propagation in Human-Derived Models of Neurodegeneration</a></h4>

              
                The misfolding, aggregation, and spread of tau protein fibrils underlie tauopathies, a diverse class of neurodegenerative diseases for which effective treatments remain elusive. Among these are corticobasal dementia (CBD) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), canonical examples of 4-repeat (4R) tauopathies characterized by tau isoforms exclusively with four microtubule-binding repeat domains. We target this 4R tau isoform-specific mechanism by focusing on misfolded tau's distinctive stem-loop-stem structural motif formed by the junction of the 4R-defining alternatively spliced exon and the adjacent constitutive exon. A synthetic peptide based on this stem-loop-stem sequence can induce aggregation and spread in an isoform-specific manner. Here, we develop a protein-like polymer (PLP) in which multiple copies of this synthetic peptide form a brush-like structure capable of preventing tau aggregation by binding and capping fibril ends in vitro, in human brain organoids, and in cellular models with an EC50 of 105 +/- 14 nM. PLPs demonstrate robust activity against fibrils derived from CBD and PSP patient brains and a PS19 mouse tauopathy model. Previous tau-targeted treatments have primarily focused on broad tau clearance, aggregation inhibition, or microtubule stabilization, often lacking isoform specificity and precision. In contrast, this approach targets the 4R tau isoform's unique structural motif, offering a tailored therapeutic intervention for diseases like CBD and PSP. Supported by prior studies showing blood-brain barrier penetrance and safety profiles, this tau-binding PLP offers a promising translational path toward clinical applications in tauopathy treatment.

">The NeflE397K mouse model demonstrates muscle pathology and motor function deficits consistent with CMT2E</a></h4>

              
                Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease affects approximately 1 in 2,500 people and represents a heterogeneous group of inherited peripheral neuropathies characterized by progressive motor and sensory dysfunction. CMT type 2E is a result of mutations in the neurofilament light (NEFL) gene with predominantly autosomal dominant inheritance, often presenting with a progressive neuropathy with distal muscle weakness, sensory loss, gait disturbances, foot deformities, reduced nerve conduction velocity (NCV) without demyelination and typically reduced compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitude values. Several Nefl mouse models exist that either alter the mouse Nefl gene or overexpress a mutated human NEFL transgene, each recapitulating various aspects of CMT2E disease. We generated the orthologous NEFLE396K mutation in the mouse C57BL/6 background, NeflE397K. In a separate report, we extensively characterized the electrophysiology deficits and axon pathology in NeflE397K mice. In this manuscript, we report our characterization of NeflE397K motor function deficits, muscle pathology and changes in breathing Nefl+/E397K and NeflE397K/E397K mice demonstrated progressive motor coordination deficits and muscle weakness through the twelve months of age analyzed, consistent with our electrophysiology findings. Additionally, Nefl+/E397K and NeflE397K/E397K mice showed alterations in muscle fiber area, diameter and composition as disease developed. Lastly, Nefl mutant mice showed increased number of apneas under normoxia conditions and increased erratic breathing as well as tidal volume under respiratory challenge conditions. NeflE397K/E397K mice phenotypes and pathology were consistently more severe than Nefl+/E397K mice. Collectively, these novel CMT2E models present with a clinically relevant phenotype and make it an ideal model for the evaluation of therapeutics.

">Regulation of hippocampal excitatory synapse development by the adhesion G-protein coupled receptor Brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor 2 (BAI2/ADGRB2)</a></h4>

              
                Glutamatergic synapses and their associated dendritic spines are critical information processing sites within the brain. Proper development of these specialized cellular junctions is important for normal brain functionality. Synaptic adhesion G protein-coupled receptors (aGPCRs) have been identified as regulators of synapse development and function. While two members of the Brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor (BAI/ADGRB) subfamily of synaptic aGPCRs, BAI1/ADGRB1 and BAI3/ADGRB3, have been found to mediate synapse and spine formation, BAI2/ADGRB2 function remains uncharacterized at the synapse. Here, we show that endogenous BAI2 is expressed throughout the nervous system with prominent expression in synapse dense regions of the hippocampus. In dissociated hippocampal cultures, BAI2 is highly enriched at large postsynaptic sites, defined by the size of the postsynaptic scaffold PSD95. Loss of BAI2 negatively impacts glutamatergic synapses across development in dissociated hippocampal cultures. In contrast, GABAergic synapse density is unchanged. Furthermore, BAI2 deficient neurons have significant alterations in spine morphology with decreased density of mature PSD95-containing mushroom-shaped spines compared with wild-type neurons. Interestingly, no major alterations in dendritic complexity were observed in BAI2 deficient neurons, in contrast to previous results for the other BAIs. The reduction in mature mushroom-shaped spine is commensurate with a reduction in spine volume and head diameter. Altogether, these results demonstrate that the aGPCR BAI2 is an important regulator of glutamatergic synapse and PSD95-associated spine development in cultured hippocampal neurons. These results expand the knowledge of the BAI subfamily of aGPCRs in mediating excitatory synapse and spine development and highlight differences unique to BAI2.

">Shared Alteration of Whole-Brain Connectivity and Olfactory Deficits in Multiple Autism Mouse Models</a></h4>

              
                Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a disconnection condition influenced by both heterogeneous genetic and environmental factors, yet it remains unclear whether common connectivity deficits exist. Here, we demonstrate that different ASD-linked mutations lead to distinct circuit abnormalities but share deficits in the piriform cortex and olfactory discrimination. Using advanced artificial intelligence, we developed a whole-brain mapping platform to analyze the distribution of the Thy1-YFP projection neurons in three ASD mouse models (Tbr1+/-, Nf1+/-, Vcp+/R95G). Our analysis revealed changes in axonal patterns and neuronal distribution, indicating deficits in projection neuron differentiation and maintenance. Notably, the piriform cortex consistently exhibited reduced YFP+ cells and signals and impaired functionality across all models. Visual and somatosensory cortices were also affected, but the patterns varied. These findings highlight that the sensory regions, especially the piriform cortex, are susceptible to ASD-related mutations, strengthening the notion that different sensory experiences are common in ASD.

">On CA1 ripple oscillations: reevaluating asynchronicity evidence</a></h4>

              
                Sharp-wave ripples (SWRs) are hippocampal network oscillations associated with memory consolidation. They are characterized by the co-occurrence of fast and slow field potentials across CA1 layers: the fast-frequency oscillations, known as ripples, are prominent in the pyramidal cell layer, where they coincide with increased neuronal spiking, while slower negative transients, referred to as sharp waves, occur simultaneously in the stratum radiatum. SWRs have traditionally been considered globally synchronous across the hippocampus; however, recent evidence suggests that ripples may be less synchronous than previously thought, particularly between the two hemispheres (Villalobos et al., 2017). In this study, we revisited this question using a unique dataset from probes spanning the septo-temporal axis of CA1. Our results demonstrate that ripples are phase-locked within but not between hemispheres, although their occurrence remains time-locked across both the septo-temporal axis and hemispheres. We also observed similar synchronicity pattern for spiking activity: neurons are locally phase-coupled and globally time-coupled to ripple events. Interneurons exhibit a much stronger phase coupling to both ipsilateral and contralateral ripples than pyramidal neurons. These findings suggest that ripples are locally phase-coupled through pyramidal-interneuron interactions, with global time-locking likely driven by a common bilateral CA3 input and potentially modulated by interneuron circuits.

">Association of human gut microbiota with Alzheimers disease pathogenesis: An exploratory clinical study</a></h4>

              
                The relationship between Alzheimer's disease (AD) onset and the brain-gut axis has garnered increasing attention. This study aimed to investigate the potential role of the brain-gut axis in AD pathogenesis, with a specific focus on microbiota composition. This exploratory study enrolled 10 patients with AD and 13 healthy adults, grouped by age ([&le;]30 years, 31-40 years, and [&ge;]41 years). Fecal samples were collected, and 16S rRNA gene sequencing was employed to analyze differences in fecal microbiota composition at the bacterial species level. Certain bacterial species appeared more abundant in the AD group (e.g., Ruminococcus inulinivorans and Ruminococcus torques), while others were relatively more abundant in healthy adults (e.g., Prevotella vulgatus 1, Bacteroides wexlerae, Clostridium butyricum, and Alistipes rectalis). However, these differences were not statistically significant, likely because of the limited sample size. These findings suggest that fecal microbiota composition may differ between patients with AD and healthy individuals, with a potential intermediate group at risk of AD development. Larger-scale clinical studies are necessary to further elucidate the bacterial species associated with AD pathogenesis, potentially enabling the use of microbiota composition as a screening tool to distinguish between healthy individuals, patients with AD, and those with preclinical AD.

	<p>Background: Pathophysiological models of pediatric bipolar disorder (PBD) are lacking. Multimodal approaches may provide a comprehensive description of the complex relationship between the brain and behavior. Aim: To assess behavioral, neuropsychological, neurophysiological, and neuroanatomical alterations in youth with PBD. Methods: Subjects with PBD (n = 23) and healthy controls (HCs, n = 23) underwent (a) clinical assessments encompassing the severity of psychiatric symptoms, (b) neuropsychological evaluation, (c) analyses of event-related potentials (related to the passive viewing of fearful, neutral, and happy faces during electroencephalography recording, and (d) cortical thickness and deep gray matter volume measurement using magnetic resonance imaging. Canonical correlation analyses were used to assess the relationships between these dimensions. Results: Youth with PBD had higher levels of anxiety (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) and borderline personality features (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), greater commission errors for negative stimuli (p = 0.003), delayed deliberation time (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), and smaller risk adjustment scores (p = 0.002) than HCs. Furthermore, they showed cortical thinning in the frontal, parietal, and occipital areas (all p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) and greater P300 for happy faces (p = 0.29). In youth with PBD, cortical thickening and P300 amplitude positively correlated with more commission errors for negative stimuli, longer deliberation times, reduced risk adjustment, higher levels of panic and separation anxiety, and greater levels of negative relationships, whereas they negatively correlated with levels of depression (overall loadings &amp;amp;gt; or &amp;amp;lt;0.3). Limitations: Small sample size, cross-sectional design, and limited variables investigated. Conclusions: This preliminary work showed that multimodal assessment might be a viable tool for providing a pathophysiological model that unifies brain and behavioral alterations in youth with PBD.</p>

	<p>Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by persistent deficits in social communication and interaction, along with restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities. ASD encompasses a wide spectrum of clinical presentations and functional impairments, ranging from mild to severe. Despite its prevalence, the underlying physiopathological mechanisms of ASD remain largely unknown, resulting in a lack of effective targeted therapeutic interventions, contributing to significant financial and emotional burdens on affected families and the healthcare system. Emerging evidence suggests that dysfunction in the tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) pathway may impair the activity of monoaminergic and nitric oxide (NO)-dependent neurons in individuals with ASD. To explore this potential mechanism, we conducted a systematic review to analyze such impairments to gather information on whether the off-label use of BH4 could represent a novel pharmacological approach for managing ASD. Following the PRISMA 2020 guidelines, we systematically reviewed the literature from four databases: PubMed, Virtual Health Library, Cochrane Library, and SciELO, from January 1967 to December 2021. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the Newcastle&amp;amp;ndash;Ottawa scale. The inclusion criteria for this systematic review focused on identifying articles published in English that contained the following keywords, used in various combinations: autism, ASD, autism spectrum disorder, BH4, tetrahydrobiopterin, neopterin, NO, nitric oxide. The analysis was performed between December 2020 and December 2021. The collected data demonstrated that BH4 metabolism was altered in individuals with ASD. Lower levels of BH4 were reported in biological samples from ASD-affected individuals compared to age- and sex-matched controls. Additionally, neopterin levels were elevated in plasma and urine, but decreased in cerebrospinal fluid, while nitric oxide levels were consistently reported to be higher across studies. Treatment with BH4 has shown potential in improving ASD-related symptoms. The reported increase in neopterin in biological fluids indicates inflammation, while the reduction in BH4 levels suggests a potential shift in its metabolic role. Specifically, BH4 may be diverted from its primary role in neurotransmitter synthesis to function as an antioxidant or to perpetuate inflammation through NO production. Given that BH4 is a critical cofactor in monoaminergic neurotransmission, its dysfunction highlights the molecule&#039;s therapeutic potential. BH4, already FDA-approved for other conditions, emerges as a promising off-label candidate to alleviate ASD symptomatology.</p>

">Prenatal adversity configures a subpopulation of ventral dentate granule cells for recruitment to drive innate anxiety</a></h4>

              
                Adverse prenatal environment is a risk factor for the development of psychiatric disorders. Although studies have implicated epigenetic mechanisms, little is known about how epigenomic changes come about and lead to abnormal behaviors in affected individuals. We sought to identify epigenomic and transcriptomic signatures induced by a proinflammatory gestational environment in the ventral dentate gyrus (vDG), a hippocampal region linked to avoidance of threatening contexts, that persist and promote anxiety-like behavior in mice. Here we show that adversity shifted the methylation of enhancers and promoters with intermediate methylation and altered synapse-related gene expression, resulting in epigenetic and transcriptional heterogeneity in the vDG. Exposure to an anxiogenic environment recruited vDG neurons with the most transcriptional alterations. Differentially expressed synapse-relevant genes in ensemble neurons tended to be differentially methylated. Finally, this ensemble exhibited higher activity in threatening than safe environment suggesting a prenatal adversity-induced epigenetic and neurobiological sequence that leads to anxiety.

">A Sensitive Soma-localized Red Fluorescent Calcium Indicator for Multi-Modality Imaging of Neuronal Populations In Vivo</a></h4>

              
                Recent advancements in genetically encoded calcium indicators, particularly those based on green fluorescent proteins, have optimized their performance for monitoring neuronal activities in a variety of model organisms. However, progress in developing red-shifted GECIs, despite their advantages over green indicators, has been slower, resulting in fewer options for end-users. In this study, we explored topological inversion and soma-targeting strategies, which are complementary to conventional mutagenesis, to re-engineer a red genetically encoded calcium indicator, FRCaMP, for enhanced in vivo performance. The resulting sensors, FRCaMPi and soma-targeted FRCaMPi (SomaFRCaMPi), exhibit up to 2-fold higher dynamic range and peak {Delta}F/F0 per single AP compared to widely used jRGECO1a in neurons in culture and in vivo. Compared to jRGECO1a and FRCaMPi, SomaFRCaMPi reduces erroneous correlation of neuronal activity in the brains of mice and zebrafish by two- to four-fold due to diminished neuropil contamination without compromising the signal-to-noise ratio. Under wide-field imaging in primary somatosensory and visual cortex in mice with high labeling density (80-90%), SomaFRCaMPi exhibits up to 40% higher SNR and decreased artifactual correlation across neurons. Altogether, SomaFRCaMPi improves the accuracy and scale of neuronal activity imaging at single-neuron resolution in densely labeled brain tissues due to a 2-3-fold enhanced automated neuronal segmentation, 50% higher fraction of responsive cells, up to 2-fold higher SNR compared to jRGECO1a. Our findings highlight the potential of SomaFRCaMPi, comparable to the most sensitive soma-targeted GCaMP, for precise spatial recording of neuronal populations using popular imaging modalities in model organisms such as zebrafish and mice.

">Neuronal endolysosomal acidification relies on interactions between transmembrane protein 184B (TMEM184B) and the vesicular proton pump</a></h4>

              
                Disruption of endolysosomal acidification is a hallmark of several neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. Impaired acidification causes accumulation of toxic protein aggregates and disrupts neuronal homeostasis, yet the molecular mechanisms regulating endolysosomal pH in neurons remain poorly understood. A critical regulator of lumenal acidification is the vacuolar ATPase (V- ATPase), a proton pump whose activity depends on dynamic assembly of its V0 and V1 subdomains. In this study, we identify transmembrane protein 184B (TMEM184B) as a novel regulator of endolysosomal acidification in neurons. TMEM184B is an evolutionarily conserved 7-pass transmembrane protein required for synaptic structure and function, and sequence variation in TMEM184B causes neurodevelopmental disorders, but the mechanism for this effect is unknown. We performed proteomic analysis of TMEM184B-interacting proteins and identified enrichment of components involved in endosomal trafficking and function, including the V-ATPase. TMEM184B localizes to early and late endosomes, further supporting a role in the endosomal system. Loss of TMEM184B results in significant reductions in endolysosomal acidification within cultured mouse cortical neurons. This alteration in pH is associated with impaired assembly of the V-ATPase V0 and V1 subcomplexes in the absence of TMEM184B, suggesting a mechanism by which TMEM184B promotes flux through the endosomal pathway. Overall, these findings identify a new contributor in maintaining endosomal function and provide a mechanistic basis for disrupted neuronal function in human TMEM184B-associated nervous system disorders.

">Dose Escalation in Pentylenetetrazol Kindling Detects Differences in Chronic Seizure Susceptibility</a></h4>

              
                Objective: Pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) kindling is a widely used model for inducing epileptogenesis and evaluating long-term seizure susceptibility differences among animals. This model is typically performed by chronic, repetitive exposures to a constant subconvulsive PTZ dose. However, the effectiveness of the commonly used subconvulsive dose (35mg/kg) varies among different animal groups and experimental conditions due to factors such as species, age, sex, and genetic background. The objective of this study was to characterize a novel model of kindling, the PTZ Dose Escalation (PTZ-DE) model, which assesses chronic seizure threshold with enhanced sensitivity by empirically determining the minimally effective dose to induce PTZ kindling for specific experimental conditions. Methods: This study investigated the efficacy and validity of the PTZ-DE model by comparing its performance to the standard PTZ kindling approach across a series of conditions. First, the ability of the PTZ-DE model to produce the gradual increase in chronic seizure severity response characteristic of PTZ kindling was compared to the standard model across multiple animal background characteristics (strain, sex). Next, the validity of this model was investigated by determining whether the PTZ-DE model could replicate similar changes in chronic seizure susceptibility previously published using the standard approach after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Lastly, the PTZ-DE model efficacy to detect seizure differences was measured in a condition (glyburide treatment) in which alterations to chronic seizure susceptibility were not detected with standard kindling. Results: This study found that the PTZ-DE model corrects for background differences in PTZ susceptibility, replicates known differences in chronic seizure thresholds after TBI, and identifies new alterations in seizure threshold not detected with traditional kindling methods. Significance: The PTZ-DE model may prove to be a superior tool to standard PTZ kindling for discovering new pathological mechanisms of epileptogenesis and for developing targeted therapies for chronic seizure management, as evidenced by its ability to detect subtle differences in seizure susceptibility across various experimental conditions.

">Multilingual Computational Models Reveal Shared Brain Responses to 21 Languages</a></h4>

              
                At the heart of language neuroscience lies a fundamental question: How does the human brain process the rich variety of languages? Recent developments in Natural Language Processing, particularly in multilingual neural network language models, offer a promising avenue to answer this question by providing a theory-agnostic way of representing linguistic content across languages. Our study leverages these advances to ask how the brains of native speakers of 21 languages respond to linguistic stimuli, and to what extent linguistic representations are similar across languages. We combined existing (12 languages across 4 language families; n=24 participants) and newly collected fMRI data (9 languages across 4 language families; n=27 participants) to evaluate a series of encoding models predicting brain activity in the language network based on representations from diverse multilingual language models (20 models across 8 model classes). We found evidence of cross-lingual robustness in the alignment between language representations in artificial and biological neural networks. Critically, we showed that the encoding models can be transferred zero-shot across languages, so that a model trained to predict brain activity in a set of languages can account for brain responses in a held-out language, even across language families. These results imply a shared component in the processing of different languages, plausibly related to a shared meaning space.

	<p>Background/Objectives Studies in rodents indicate that disruptions in both cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) signaling pathways are involved in the development of hyperactive behavior. We examined whether vinpocetine, a phosphodiesterase type 1 inhibitor that enhances brain cAMP and cGMP levels, could mitigate locomotor hyperactivity in mice exposed to lead during early development. Methods Swiss mice were exposed to 90 ppm of lead in their drinking water throughout gestation and the first ten postnatal days. At postnatal day 10 (PN10), blood lead levels (BLLs) were about 30 &amp;amp;micro;g/dL. At PN30, animals either received vinpocetine (20 mg/kg, i.p.) or a vehicle 4 h before the evaluation of locomotor activity in the open field. Results Lead-exposed males did not display differences in locomotor activity compared to controls, while lead-exposed females showed a significant increase in locomotion. Vinpocetine treatment significantly reversed the lead-induced hyperactivity in females. Conclusions These findings suggest that the cAMP and cGMP signaling pathways play a role in the hyperactivity induced by lead exposure.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The neurodegenerative processes driving the build-up of disability in progressive multiple sclerosis (P-MS) have not been fully elucidated. Recent data link cellular senescence (CS) to neurodegeneration. We investigated for evidence of CS in P-MS and sought to determine its pattern.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used 53BP1, p16, and lipofuscin as markers of CS in white matter lesions (WMLs), normal appearing white matter (NAWM), normal appearing cortical gray matter (NAGM), control white matter (CWM), and control gray matter (CGM) on autopsy material from patient with P-MS and healthy controls. Senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) factors were quantified in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>P16<sup>+</sup> cell counts were significantly increased in WMLs and GMLs, compared with NAWM, CWM, NAGM, and CGM and lipofuscin<sup>+</sup> cells were significantly increased in WMLs, compared with NAWM and CWM, indicating more abundant CS in demyelinated lesions. The 53BP1<sup>+</sup> cells in WMLs were significantly increased compared with NAWM and CWM. The 53BP1<sup>+</sup> and p16<sup>+</sup> cells were found significantly more abundant in acute active WMLs and GMLs, compared with chronic inactive lesions. Co-localization studies showed evidence of CS in neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia, and macrophages. Among the quantified CSF SASP factors, IL-6, MIF, and MIP1a levels correlated with 53BP1<sup>+</sup> cell counts in NAGM, whereas IL-10 levels correlated with p16<sup>+</sup> cell counts in NAWM. P16<sup>+</sup> cell counts in WMLs exhibited an inverse correlation with time to requiring a wheelchair and with age at death.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our data indicates that CS primarily affects actively demyelinating gray and WMLs. A higher senescent cell load in P-MS is associated with faster disability progression and death. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective is to evaluate cognitive and behavioral progression and identify early predictors of these changes in a cohort of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A total of 161 ALS patients were tested at diagnosis (T0), and 107 were re-tested after 1 year (T1) using cognitive/behavioral tests. All patients underwent whole-genome sequencing, and 46 patients (ALS-normal cognition [CN]) underwent [18F]Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of the 161 patients, 107 were re-rested at T1; non-retested patients included 10 with frontotemporal dementia and 44 who were either non-testable or deceased. At T0, 67 patients (62.6%) were classified as ALS-CN, whereas 40 (38.4%) showed some degree of cognitive/behavioral impairment. Eighteen ALS-CN patients (26.9%) experienced cognitive decline at T1. Phenoconverters had lower baseline scores in letter fluency (Letter Fluency Test [FAS]) (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), Edinburgh Cognitive and Behavioral ALS Screen (ECAS) verbal fluency score (<i>p</i> = 0.017). Both tests were independently predictive of phenoconversion in binary logistic regression models, with optimal cut-off scores of 28.75 and 14.2, with good sensitivity and specificity. Other predictors included older age, lower education, and ALS-related genetic variants. Phenoconverters were hypometabolic in the left temporal lobe. Thirteen (32.5%) of the 40 patients with cognitive impairment at T0 worsened by T1, with FAS (<i>p</i> = 0.02) and the ECAS verbal fluency score (<i>p</i> = 0.023) predicting further decline.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Approximately 30% of ALS patients experienced cognitive/behavioral decline within the first year after diagnosis. FAS and ECAS verbal fluency were predictive of cognitive phenoconversion. Our findings highlight the importance of early detection of at-risk individuals and the need for longitudinal cognitive assessments to monitor disease progression. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27186?af=R">Neuroimaging Predictors of Cognitive Resilience against Alzheimer's Disease Pathology</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Some individuals demonstrate greater cognitive resilience—the ability to maintain cognitive performance despite adverse brain-related changes—through as yet unknown mechanisms. We examined whether cortical thickness in several brain regions confers resilience against cognitive decline in amyloid-positive adults by moderating the effects of thinner cortex in Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related brain regions and of higher levels of tau.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Amyloid-positive participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative with relevant imaging data were included (n = 160, observations = 473). Risk factors included an AD brain signature and cerebrospinal fluid phosphorylated tau. Cognitive measures were episodic memory and executive function composites. Mixed effects models tested whether region-specific cortical thickness moderated relationships between markers of AD risk and memory or executive function.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Cross-sectionally, thicker cortex in 8 regions minimized the negative impact of thinner cortex/smaller volume in AD signature regions on executive function. Longitudinally, higher baseline thickness in a composite of these 8 regions predicted less memory decline (<i>p</i> = 0.007) and weakened negative effects of phosphorylated tau on memory decline (<i>p</i> = 0.014), independent of baseline cognition and risk markers.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We identified 8 cortical regions that appear to confer cognitive resilience cross-sectionally and longitudinally in the face of established indicators of AD pathology. Brain regions fostering executive function may enable compensation in later memory performance and confer cognitive resilience against effects of phosphorylated tau and AD-related cortical changes. These “resilience” regions suggest the value of focusing on brain regions beyond only those determined to be AD-related and may partially explain variability in AD-related cognitive trajectories.

                Several recent studies, enabled by advances in neuroimaging methods and large-scale datasets, have identified areas in human ventral visual cortex that respond more strongly to food images than to images of many other categories, adding to our knowledge about the broad network of regions that are responsive to food. This finding raises important questions about the evolutionary and developmental origins of a possible food-selective neural population, as well as larger questions about the origins of category-selective neural populations more generally. Here, we propose a framework for how visual properties of food (particularly color) and nonvisual signals associated with multimodal reward processing, social cognition, and physical interactions with food may, in combination, contribute to the emergence of food selectivity. We discuss recent research that sheds light on each of these factors, alongside a broader account of category selectivity that incorporates both visual feature statistics and behavioral relevance.

">VIP interneurons control hippocampal place cell remapping through transient disinhibition in novel environments.</a></h4>

              
                Hippocampal place cells dynamically reorganize their activity, or 'remap', to encode novel spatial environments, a process tightly regulated by inhibitory networks. Here, we identify vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-expressing interneurons as key regulators of this plasticity. Using all-optical methods in mice navigating virtual reality, we show that novel environments trigger a transient increase in VIP interneuron activity, which facilitates rapid place field formation and stable spatial map construction. Bidirectional optogenetic manipulation -suppressing or upregulating VIP interneuron activity- modulates the speed of spatial map formation and alters signatures of behavioral timescale plasticity (BTSP), a mechanism critical for place field induction. Both insufficient and excessive VIP interneuron activity impair reward-seeking behavior specifically in novel environments, revealing that a precise balance of VIP activity is essential for spatial learning. Our findings demonstrate that VIP interneurons gate a temporal window for place cell plasticity, mediating the impact of environmental novelty on hippocampal remapping and spatial memory.

">Grin2a Dysfunction Impairs Cognitive Flexibility by Disrupting LC Modulation of mPFC Circuits</a></h4>

              
                Cognitive flexibility, a key executive function, is impaired in psychiatric disorders involving prefrontal cortical dysfunction. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) regulates cognitive flexibility and receives noradrenergic input from the locus coeruleus (LC). Mutations in GRIN2A, encoding GluN2A-containing NMDA receptors, impair cognitive flexibility and psychiatric resilience, yet the circuit mechanisms remain unclear. Optogenetic LC[-&gt;]mPFC activation improved reversal learning in wild-type and Grin2a heterozygous (HET) mice but not in knockouts (KO), indicating a loss of noradrenergic modulation. Grin2a mutants displayed disrupted gamma and high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) in the mPFC. Exogenous norepinephrine failed to restore oscillatory activity, implicating 2-adrenoceptors in NE-driven cortical dynamics. Increased LC innervation and norepinephrine transporter (NET) expression in Grin2a mutants suggest excessive noradrenergic input and impaired NE clearance. These findings identify GluN2A as essential for LC-driven prefrontal network synchronization and cognitive flexibility, offering insights into NE dysfunction in psychiatric disorders.

">Dicer loss in Muller glia leads to a defined sequence of pathological events beginning with cone dysfunction</a></h4>

              
                Purpose: The loss of Dicer in Muller glia (MG) results in severe photoreceptor degeneration as it occurs in retinitis pigmentosa or AMD. However, the sequence of events leading to this severe degenerative state is unknown. The aim of this study was to conduct a chronological functional and structural characterization of the pathological events in MG-specific Dicer-cKO mice in vivo and histologically. Methods: To delete Dicer and mature microRNAs (miRNAs) in MG, two conditional Dicer1 knock-out mouse strains namely RlbpCre:Dicer-cKOMG and GlastCre:Dicer-cKOMG, were created. Optical coherence tomography (OCT), electroretinograms (ERGs) as well as histological analyses were conducted to investigate structural and functional changes up to six months after Dicer deletion. Results: Dicer/miRNA loss in MG leads to 1) impairments of the external limiting membrane (ELM) / retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), 2) cone photoreceptor dysfunction and 3) retinal remodeling and functional loss of the inner retina, 1, 3 and 6 months after Dicer loss, respectively, in both strains. Furthermore, in the Rlbp:Dicer-cKOMG strain, rod photoreceptor impairment was found 4 months after Dicer depletion (4) accompanied by alteration of RPE integrity (5). Conclusions: MG Dicer loss in the adult mouse retina impacts cone function prior to any measurable changes in rod function, suggesting a pivotal role for MG Dicer and miRNAs in supporting cone health. A partially impaired RPE however seems to accelerate rod degeneration and overall degenerative events.

">A Bayesian decision-making model of implicit motor learning from internal and external errors</a></h4>

              
                A key challenge for the sensorimotor system is deciding which errors to learn from and which to ignore. Recent work has shown that humans are remarkably precise in parsing movement errors into internally- and externally-generated components for this purpose: Participants automatically ignore internally-generated reaching errors caused by motor noise, yet implicitly adapt to size-matched externally-generated errors caused by visuomotor rotations (Ranjan & Smith 2018, 2022). Following replication of these results with 16 neurotypical adults, we formalized our understanding of this behavior with a novel Bayesian decision-making model. The Parsing of Internal and External Causes of Error (PIECE) model frames adaptation as a process of causal inference regarding the source of error, with the magnitude of motor corrections reflecting a combination of state estimation and the observer's degree-of-belief that their movement was externally perturbed. Thus, PIECE presents a challenge to a class of computational models that frames adaptation as a process of re-aligning the perceived hand position with the movement goal. We show that only PIECE can capture the precise parsing of internal versus external errors observed. Combined, this work provides a normative explanation of how the nervous system discounts intrinsic motor noise and adapts to perturbations, keeping movements finely-calibrated.

">BlueBerry: Closed-loop wireless optogenetic manipulation in freely moving animals</a></h4>

              
                Optogenetics is a powerful tool for neuroscientists, enabling manipulations of neuronal activity to explore their effects on behavior. Recent advances in wireless technology enabled the development of novel remotely controlled optogenetic devices, thereby promising to facilitate the study of more complex behaviors, including social interactions. Yet, studying such behaviors in real time and automated manner in large scale naturalistic settings or with multiple animals remains challenging. In addition, many published devices can only be reproduced in labs having specific engineering skills and fabrication facilities and are thus not accessible for the larger neuroscience community. Here we introduce BlueBerry, an open-source, multi-channel optogenetic device that can be assembled with off the shelf components. The lightweight (1.4 g) design and robust long-range communication makes Blueberry an ideal tool for behavior-triggered optogenetic studies with multiple animals interacting freely in a large-scale setting. We show how BlueBerry can be used to guide decision making during spatial navigation and demonstrate for the first time that social dynamics can be rapidly altered in groups of mice by triggering specific social behavior with closed-loop optogenetics.

">The relationship between neural differentiation and exploratory eye movements in healthy young and older adults</a></h4>

              
                Age-related neural dedifferentiation, characterized by lower selectivity of neural responses in the high-level sensory cortex, is thought to be a major contributor to age-related cognitive decline. However, the mechanisms that underlie dedifferentiation are poorly understood. Building on prior evidence that exploratory eye movements differ with age, we investigated the role that eye movement might play in age-related declines in neural selectivity. Healthy young and older adults of both sexes underwent fMRI with simultaneous eye-tracking as they viewed words paired with images of scenes and objects prior to a memory test. Consistent with numerous prior reports, multivoxel pattern similarity analysis (PSA) of the fMRI data revealed age-related neural dedifferentiation in scene-selective, but not object-selective cortex. Eye movements, operationalized as the number of gaze fixations made during stimulus viewing, were elevated in older adults. Analyses examining the relationship between trial-wise estimates of neural selectivity and fixation count revealed an age-invariant positive relationship in the object-selective lateral occipital complex. However, this association was found to be age-dependent in scene-selective cortex, such that there was a robust positive relationship between scene selectivity and fixation count in young, but not older adults. Lastly, scene-related selectivity in the parahippocampal place area predicted subsequent memory performance independently of age group and fixation counts at encoding. These findings suggest that age-related neural dedifferentiation in scene-selective cortex may relate to declines in the functional specialization of exploratory eye movements during scene viewing.

Significance statementHealthy aging is associated with lower neural selectivity in brain regions responsive to distinct categories of perceptual stimuli. This phenomenon is most commonly observed in scene-selective cortex, although the underlying reasons remain unknown. Here, we report that trial-wise estimates of neural selectivity positively covary with the number of eye movements made during stimulus viewing. However, we also report an age-related breakdown in this relationship within scene-selective cortex, consistent with the notion that age differences in eye movements and neural selectivity reflect deficits in the extraction and binding of visual information into memory. The present findings highlight the complex interactions that occur between age, neural selectivity and eye movements, and provide novel insights into neural and behavioral mechanisms underlying cognitive aging.

">Metabolic reprogramming in the spinal cord drives the transition to pain chronicity</a></h4>

              
                Acute injuries can progress into painful states that endure long after healing. The mechanism underlying this transition remains unclear, but metabolic adaptations to the bioenergy demands imposed by injury are plausible contributors. Here we show that peripheral injury activates AKT/mTORC1 in afferent segments of the mouse spinal cord, redirecting local core metabolism toward biomass production while simultaneously suppressing autophagy-mediated biomass reclamation. This metabolic shift supports neuroplasticity, but creates a resource bottleneck that depletes critical spinal cord nutrients. Preventing this depletion with a modified diet normalizes biomass generation and autophagy and halts the transition to chronic pain. This effect, observed across multiple pain models, requires activation of the nutrient sensors, sirtuin-1 and AMPK, as well as restoration of autophagy. The findings identify metabolic reprogramming as a key driver of the progression to pain chronicity and point to nutritional and pharmacological interventions that could prevent this progression after surgery or other physical traumas.

">A Human Neuron Alzheimer's Disease Model Reveals Barriers to Senolytic Translatability</a></h4>

              
                Therapeutic successes in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) largely fail to translate into clinical trials, with experimental drugs rarely validated in human models before being administered to humans. To address this, we developed an accessible method for long-term culture of commercially available primary human neurons and astrocytes, along with an amyloid-beta 1-42 (A{beta})-based in vitro AD model. Using this system, we evaluated two senolytic regimens previously shown to be effective in AD mouse models-Navitoclax and Dasatinib plus Quercetin (DQ) -and the natural killer cell line NK92 for emerging immune-mediated senescent cell ablation therapies. NK92 cells preferentially-but not exclusively-targeted A{beta}-treated neurons and astrocytes with senescent-like phenotypes. DQ demonstrated a safe profile for human neurons, but Navitoclax exhibited non-selective neurotoxicity. These findings highlight risks of Navitoclax and NK-based interventions and underscore the critical need for human-relevant models in the AD drug-development pipeline to improve safety and clinical translatability.

">Gut-Brain Hydraulics: Brain motion and CSF circulation is driven by mechanical coupling with the abdomen</a></h4>

              
                The brain moves within the skull, but the drivers and function of this motion are not understood. We visualized brain motion relative to the skull in awake head-fixed mice using high-speed, multi-plane two-photon microscopy. Brain motion was primarily rostrally and laterally directed, and was tightly correlated with locomotion, but not with respiration or the cardiac cycle. Electromyography recordings in abdominal muscles and microCT reconstructions of the trunk and spinal vasculature showed that brain motion was driven by abdominal muscle contractions that activate a hydraulic-like vascular connection between the nervous system and the abdominal cavity. Externally-applied abdominal pressure generated brain motion similar to those seen during abdominal muscle contractions. Simulations showed that brain motion drives substantial volumes of interstitial fluid through and out of the brain (at volumetric rates several times higher than production) into the subarachnoid space, in the opposite direction of fluid flow seen during sleep. The brain is hydraulically linked to the abdominal compartment, and fluid flow in the brain is coupled to body movements, providing a mechanism by which the mechanics of the viscera directly impact brain health.

">FETCH enables fluorescent labeling of membrane proteins in vivo with spatiotemporal control in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Fluorescent labeling approaches are crucial for elucidating protein function and dynamics. While enhancer trapping in Drosophila has been useful for the characterization of gene transcription, protein-specific visualization in vivo has been more elusive. To overcome these limitations, we developed Fluorescent Endogenous Tagging with a Covalent Hook (FETCH) to label cell surface proteins (CSPs) in vivo through a stable covalent bond mediated by the DogTag-DogCatcher peptide partner system. FETCH leverages a spontaneous covalent isopeptide bond that forms between the 23-amino acid DogTag and the 15-kDa DogCatcher. Unlike most tags that work best at protein termini, DogTag is optimized for function in protein loops, expanding the range of sites that can be targeted in proteins. In FETCH, DogTag is introduced into extracellular loops of CSPs through genome engineering, enabling covalent bond formation with a genetically encoded DogCatcher-GFP fusion protein that can be secreted from a variety of cell types. We describe a flow cytometry-based platform for the identification of efficient DogTag insertion sites in vitro and demonstrate the ability to visualize both tagged DIP- and Dpr10 in vivo, two immunoglobulin superfamily proteins that facilitate neuronal target recognition at Drosophila neuromuscular junctions and brain synapses. The versatility of FETCH enables fluorescent labeling with precise temporal and spatial control in vivo, enabling applications previously unfeasible.

                Background Primiparous mothers face diverse challenges during pregnancy and post-childbirth. There is limited data on the effectiveness of postnatal educational programs for new mothers (Subramanian et al., 2020). This study aimed to assess the efficacy of an educational program designed to improve primiparous mothers’ attitudes toward newborn communication, general health, feeding, and swallowing. The objectives were (1) to develop an attitude questionnaire (AQ), a parent education program [Newborn Communication, Health, Feeding and Swallowing Education Program (N-CHFSEP)], and a feedback questionnaire (FQ); and (2) to estimate the efficacy of N-CHFSEP pre- and post-delivery. The research, conducted between August 2023 and February 2024, involved 98 primiparous mothers who gave birth to healthy newborns through any delivery method. Participants were proficient in English or Kannada. The study excluded mothers delivering multiples, those with significant medical or psychological issues, and health professionals. Methods The study had two phases: Phase 1 developed and validated the AQ, N-CHFSEP, and FQ. N-CHFSEP covered key topics, including milestones in communication, feeding, and general health from birth to 6 months. Phase 2 administered these tools to participants. The data was analyzed using descriptive statistics, paired t-tests, and chi-square tests. Results 93% of mothers reported increased confidence in recognizing communication, feeding, and health-related signs in their infants after completing the program. This change was statistically significant (p < 0.05). Sociodemographic factors like maternal age, education, occupation, and family type significantly influenced confidence levels. Feedback from participants highlighted the program’s effectiveness in enhancing knowledge, with suggestions for improvements. Conclusions N-CHFSEP significantly boosted mothers’ confidence in newborn care, contributing to better maternal and infant health. However, the study lacked a control group, and the effectiveness was evaluated only immediately after the program. Future research could incorporate practical demonstrations and hands-on training to further enhance the program’s impact.

                <p>by Xu Shi, Xiao Wang, Lu Jin, Leena Halakivi-Clarke, Robert Clarke, Andrew F. Neuwald, Jianhua Xuan</p>

We develop a Bayesian approach, BayesIso, to identify differentially expressed isoforms from RNA-seq data. The approach features a novel joint model of the sample variability and the deferential state of isoforms. Specifically, the within-sample variability and the between-sample variability of each isoform are modeled by a Poisson-Lognormal model and a Gamma-Gamma model, respectively. Using a Bayesian framework, the differential state of each isoform and the model parameters are jointly estimated by a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. Extensive studies using simulation and real data demonstrate that BayesIso can effectively detect isoforms of less differentially expressed and differential transcripts for genes with multiple isoforms. We applied the approach to breast cancer RNA-seq data and uncovered a unique set of isoforms that form key pathways associated with breast cancer recurrence. First, PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling and PTEN signaling pathways are identified as being involved in breast cancer development. Further integrated with protein-protein interaction data, pathways of Jak-STAT, mTOR, MAPK and Wnt signaling are revealed in association with breast cancer recurrence. Finally, several pathways are activated in the early recurrence of breast cancer. In tumors that occur early, members of pathways of cellular metabolism and cell cycle (such as CD36 and TOP2A) are upregulated, while immune response genes such as NFATC1 are downregulated.

                Background We propose the creation of a journal transparency tool (JTT), which will allow users to obtain information about a given scholarly journal’s operations and policies. We are obtaining preferences from different stakeholders to inform the development of this tool. This study aimed to identify the publishing community’s preferences for the JTT. Methods We conducted a modified three-round Delphi survey. Representatives from publishing houses and journal publishers were recruited through purposeful and snowball sampling. The first two Delphi rounds involved an online survey with items about JTT metrics and user features. During the third round, participants discussed and voted on JTT metric items that did not reach consensus after round 2 within a virtual consensus meeting. We defined consensus as 80% agreement to include or exclude an item in the JTT. Results Eighty-six participants completed the round 1 survey, and 43 participants (50% of round 1) completed the round 2 survey. In both rounds, respondents voted on JTT user feature and JTT metric item preferences and answered open-ended survey questions regarding the JTT. In round 3, a total of 21 participants discussed and voted on JTT metric items that did not reach consensus after round 2 during an online consensus group meeting. Fifteen out of 30 JTT metric items and none of the four JTT user feature items reached the 80% consensus threshold after all rounds of voting. Analysis of the round 3 online consensus group transcript resulted in two themes: ‘factors impacting support for JTT metrics’ and ‘suggestions for user clarity.’ Conclusions Participants suggested that the publishing community’s primary concerns for a JTT are to ensure that the tool is relevant, user-friendly, accessible, and equitable. The outcomes of this research will contribute to developing and refining the tool in accordance with publishing preferences.

                Vandal et al. performed a biological sex-based study on the role of the Alzheimer’s disease (AD) genetic factor CD2AP in brain blood vessels. Using mouse models and human AD samples, they identified a vasodilatory signaling pathway centered on CD2AP that can potentially be harnessed to treat cerebrovascular dysfunction in AD.

Panx1-targeted therapies offer broad potential for managing neuropathic pain, with sex-specific interventions targeting leptin or VEGF.

                Ye et al. uncover that nuclear-localized HKDC1 functions as a protein kinase and promotes hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression by phosphorylating RBBP5, facilitating MLL1 complex assembly, and upregulating H3K4me3. They identify elevated levels of HKDC1 and phosphorylated RBBP5 as potential therapeutic targets and prognostic biomarkers for HCC.

                Schachter et al. reveal that GSDMD mediates early ATP release in macrophages during NLRP3 activation. This process occurs prior to pyroptotic cell death and is independent of NINJ1-dependent cell lysis. The released ATP drives monocyte recruitment. Other N-terminal GSDMs also increase ATP permeability, highlighting their potential role in immune modulation.

                Graham et al. demonstrate that BRCA2 and PALB2 protect centromere integrity in non-cancerous cells through distinct mechanisms, partly counteracting the mismatch repair factor MLH1. In cancer cells, BRCA2 remains essential for centromere protection, highlighting its critical role in preventing chromosome instability and the interplay between homologous recombination and mismatch repair pathways.

                Liu et al. report a cryo-EM structure of the CXCR4 tetramer, with each protomer assembled into a rotationally symmetric arrangement. Structural and functional analyses demonstrate molecular interactions that stabilize the tetrameric architecture of CXCR4 via TM1/2 and TM5/6/7. These results suggest allosteric antagonism of CXCR4 through tetramerization.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100268">Supralinear dendritic integration in murine dendrite-targeting interneurons</a></h4>

              
                Non-linear summation of synaptic inputs to the dendrites of pyramidal neurons has been proposed to increase the computation capacity of neurons through coincidence detection, signal amplification, and additional logic operations such as XOR. Supralinear dendritic integration has been documented extensively in principal neurons, mediated by several voltage-dependent conductances. It has also been reported in parvalbumin-positive hippocampal basket cells, in dendrites innervated by feedback excitatory synapses. Whether other interneurons, which support feed-forward or feedback inhibition of principal neuron dendrites, also exhibit local non-linear integration of synaptic excitation is not known. Here, we use patch-clamp electrophysiology, and two-photon calcium imaging and glutamate uncaging, to show that supralinear dendritic integration of near-synchronous spatially clustered glutamate-receptor mediated depolarization occurs in NDNF-positive neurogliaform cells and oriens-lacunosum moleculare interneurons in the mouse hippocampus. Supralinear summation was detected via recordings of somatic depolarizations elicited by uncaging of glutamate on dendritic fragments, and, in neurogliaform cells, by concurrent imaging of dendritic calcium transients. Supralinearity was abolished by blocking NMDA receptors (NMDARs) but resisted blockade of voltage-gated sodium channels. Blocking L-type calcium channels abolished supralinear calcium signalling but only had a minor effect on voltage supralinearity. Dendritic boosting of spatially clustered synaptic signals argues for previously unappreciated computational complexity in dendrite-projecting inhibitory cells of the hippocampus.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95125">Predicting individual traits from models of brain dynamics accurately and reliably using the Fisher kernel</a></h4>

              
                Predicting an individual’s cognitive traits or clinical condition using brain signals is a central goal in modern neuroscience. This is commonly done using either structural aspects, such as structural connectivity or cortical thickness, or aggregated measures of brain activity that average over time. But these approaches are missing a central aspect of brain function: the unique ways in which an individual’s brain activity unfolds over time. One reason why these dynamic patterns are not usually considered is that they have to be described by complex, high-dimensional models; and it is unclear how best to use these models for prediction. We here propose an approach that describes dynamic functional connectivity and amplitude patterns using a Hidden Markov model (HMM) and combines it with the Fisher kernel, which can be used to predict individual traits. The Fisher kernel is constructed from the HMM in a mathematically principled manner, thereby preserving the structure of the underlying model. We show here, in fMRI data, that the HMM-Fisher kernel approach is accurate and reliable. We compare the Fisher kernel to other prediction methods, both time-varying and time-averaged functional connectivity-based models. Our approach leverages information about an individual’s time-varying amplitude and functional connectivity for prediction and has broad applications in cognitive neuroscience and personalised medicine.
