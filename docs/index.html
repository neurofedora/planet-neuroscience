              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14360">Embodied sensorimotor control: computational modeling of the neural control of movement</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2509.14360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review how sensorimotor control is dictated by interacting neural populations, optimal feedback mechanisms, and the biomechanics of bodies. First, we outline the distributed anatomical loops that shuttle sensorimotor signals between cortex, subcortical regions, and spinal cord. We then summarize evidence that neural population activity occupies low-dimensional, dynamically evolving manifolds during planning and execution of movements. Next, we summarize literature explaining motor behavior through the lens of optimal control theory, which clarifies the role of internal models and feedback during motor control. Finally, recent studies on embodied sensorimotor control address gaps within each framework by aiming to elucidate neural population activity through the explicit control of musculoskeletal dynamics. We close by discussing open problems and opportunities: multi-tasking and cognitively rich behavior, multi-regional circuit models, and the level of anatomical detail needed in body and network models. Together, this review and recent advances point towards reaching an integrative account of the neural control of movement.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14418">Theoretical Note: The Relation Between Structure and Dynamics in Psychological Networks of Attitudes</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2509.14418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two claims of the Causal Attitude Network (CAN) model and the descendent Attitude Entropy framework (AE) are indicative of significant theoretical hurdles facing the psychological network modeling efforts of attitudes. The first claim is that the dynamics of change in an Ising like attitude network, under perturbation of any one single node, can be inferred from the static network attributes of said node. The second claim is that psychological network models of attitudes with Ising like dynamics will maximize both attitudinal consistency and accuracy when within the small world topological regime. The first claim, one with significant application potentials, has not been sufficiently tested; the second claim, one with high theoretical novelty, has never been addressed. Using a set of analytic results and simulations, we found little support for these claims; in short, the predictions are not logically consistent with the theory. Our results have implications beyond attitude models to the larger field of psychological networks (e.g., in clinical psychology) in reference to how we should explain and understand their dynamics.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14446">Mouse vs. AI: A Neuroethological Benchmark for Visual Robustness and Neural Alignment</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2509.14446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual robustness under real-world conditions remains a critical bottleneck for modern reinforcement learning agents. In contrast, biological systems such as mice show remarkable resilience to environmental changes, maintaining stable performance even under degraded visual input with minimal exposure. Inspired by this gap, we propose the Mouse vs. AI: Robust Foraging Competition, a novel bioinspired visual robustness benchmark to test generalization in reinforcement learning (RL) agents trained to navigate a virtual environment toward a visually cued target. Participants train agents to perform a visually guided foraging task in a naturalistic 3D Unity environment and are evaluated on their ability to generalize to unseen, ecologically realistic visual perturbations. What sets this challenge apart is its biological grounding: real mice performed the same task, and participants receive both behavioral performance data and large-scale neural recordings (over 19,000 neurons across visual cortex) for benchmarking. The competition features two tracks: (1) Visual Robustness, assessing generalization across held-out visual perturbations; and (2) Neural Alignment, evaluating how well agents' internal representations predict mouse visual cortical activity via a linear readout. We provide the full Unity environment, a fog-perturbed training condition for validation, baseline proximal policy optimization (PPO) agents, and a rich multimodal dataset. By bridging reinforcement learning, computer vision, and neuroscience through a shared, behaviorally grounded task, this challenge advances the development of robust, generalizable, and biologically inspired AI.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14455">Charting trajectories of human thought using large language models</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2509.14455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Language provides the most revealing window into the ways humans structure conceptual knowledge within cognitive maps. Harnessing this information has been difficult, given the challenge of reliably mapping words to mental concepts. Artificial Intelligence large language models (LLMs) now offer unprecedented opportunities to revisit this challenge. LLMs represent words and phrases as high-dimensional numerical vectors that encode vast semantic knowledge. To harness this potential for cognitive science, we introduce VECTOR, a computational framework that aligns LLM representations with human cognitive map organisation. VECTOR casts a participant's verbal reports as a geometric trajectory through a cognitive map representation, revealing how thoughts flow from one idea to the next. Applying VECTOR to narratives generated by 1,100 participants, we show these trajectories have cognitively meaningful properties that predict paralinguistic behaviour (response times) and real-world communication patterns. We suggest our approach opens new avenues for understanding how humans dynamically organise and navigate conceptual knowledge in naturalistic settings.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14053">Network representations reveal structured uncertainty in music</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2509.14053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Music, as a structured yet perceptually rich experience, can be modeled as a network to uncover how humans encode and process auditory information. While network-based representations of music are increasingly common, the impact of feature selection on structural properties and cognitive alignment remains underexplored. In this study, we evaluated eight network models, each constructed from symbolic representations of piano compositions using distinct combinations of pitch, octave, duration, and interval, designed to be representative of existing approaches in the literature. By comparing these models through topological metrics, entropy analysis, and divergence with respect to inferred cognitive representations, we assessed both their structural and perceptual efficiency. Our findings reveal that simpler, feature-specific models better match human perception, whereas complex, multidimensional representations introduce cognitive inefficiencies. These results support the view that humans rely on modular, parallel cognitive networks--an architecture consistent with theories of predictive processing and free energy minimization. Moreover, we find that musical networks are structurally organized to guide attention toward transitions that are both uncertain and inferable. The resulting structure concentrates uncertainty in a few frequently visited nodes, creating local entropy gradients that alternate between stable and unpredictable regions, thereby enabling the expressive dynamics of tension and release that define the musical experience. These findings show that network structures make the organization of uncertainty in music observable, offering new insight into how patterned flows of expectation shape perception, and open new directions for studying how musical structures evolve across genres, cultures, and historical periods through the lens of network science.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14498">Data coarse graining can improve model performance</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2509.14498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lossy data transformations by definition lose information. Yet, in modern machine learning, methods like data pruning and lossy data augmentation can help improve generalization performance. We study this paradox using a solvable model of high-dimensional, ridge-regularized linear regression under 'data coarse graining.' Inspired by the renormalization group in statistical physics, we analyze coarse-graining schemes that systematically discard features based on their relevance to the learning task. Our results reveal a nonmonotonic dependence of the prediction risk on the degree of coarse graining. A 'high-pass' scheme--which filters out less relevant, lower-signal features--can help models generalize better. By contrast, a 'low-pass' scheme that integrates out more relevant, higher-signal features is purely detrimental. Crucially, using optimal regularization, we demonstrate that this nonmonotonicity is a distinct effect of data coarse graining and not an artifact of double descent. Our framework offers a clear, analytical explanation for why careful data augmentation works: it strips away less relevant degrees of freedom and isolates more predictive signals. Our results highlight a complex, nonmonotonic risk landscape shaped by the structure of the data, and illustrate how ideas from statistical physics provide a principled lens for understanding modern machine learning phenomena.

                arXiv:2509.14827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cortical surface reconstruction (CSR) from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is fundamental to neuroimage analysis, enabling morphological studies of the cerebral cortex and functional brain mapping. Recent advances in learning-based CSR have dramatically accelerated processing, allowing for reconstructions through the deformation of anatomical templates within seconds. However, ensuring the learned deformations are optimal in terms of deformation energy and consistent across training runs remains a particular challenge. In this work, we design a Minimal Energy Deformation (MED) loss, acting as a regularizer on the deformation trajectories and complementing the widely used Chamfer distance in CSR. We incorporate it into the recent V2C-Flow model and demonstrate considerable improvements in previously neglected training consistency and reproducibility without harming reconstruction accuracy and topological correctness.

                arXiv:2509.14910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamic of thermosensitive neuronal networks under the influence of external electric fields is explored, focusing on hybrid coupling models that incorporate both electrical and chemical synapses. Numerical simulations reveal a variety of complex behaviors, including coherent, incoherent, and chimera states, which are influenced by the frequency of the external field and the cell size. Specificaly chemical coupling is shown to enhances the appearance of a typical chimera states called traveling chimera states, while the external electric field modulates synchronization based on its frequency. Low-frequency fields induce localized synchronization, whereas high-frequency fields exert minimal influence. The study also investigates the role of intrinsic electric fields, represented by cell size, and their effect on both individual neuron activity and network dynamics. These findings enhance the understanding of how external fields control collective neuronal behavior and open up new possibilities for the modulation of neural activity.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07637">Synaptic Theory of Chunking in Working Memory</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2408.07637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Working memory often appears to exceed its basic span by organizing items into compact representations called chunks. Chunking can be learned over time for familiar inputs; however, it can also arise spontaneously for novel stimuli. Such on-the-fly structuring is crucial for cognition, yet the underlying neural mechanism remains unclear. Here we introduce a synaptic theory of chunking, in which short-term synaptic plasticity enables the formation of chunk representations in working memory. We show that a specialized population of ``chunking neurons'' selectively controls groups of stimulus-responsive neurons, akin to gating. As a result, the network maintains and retrieves the stimuli in chunks, thereby exceeding the basic capacity. Moreover, we show that our model can dynamically construct hierarchical representations within working memory through hierarchical chunking. A consequence of this proposed mechanism is a new limit on the number of items that can be stored and subsequently retrieved from working memory, depending only on the basic working memory capacity when chunking is not invoked. Predictions from our model were confirmed by analyzing single-unit responses in epileptic patients and memory experiments with verbal material. Our work provides a novel conceptual and analytical framework for understanding how the brain organizes information in real time.

To address this, individualized simulation offers a promising solution by modeling subject-specific neurodevelopmental trajectories, enabling the identification of subtle deviations from normative patterns that might act as biomarkers of risk. While generative models have shown potential for simulating neurodevelopment, prior approaches often struggle to preserve subject-specific cortical folding patterns or to reproduce region-specific morphological variations. In this paper, we present a novel graph-diffusion network that supports controllable simulation of cortical maturation. Using cortical surface data from the developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP), we demonstrate that the model maintains subject-specific cortical morphology while modeling cortical maturation sufficiently well to fool an independently trained age regression network, achieving a prediction accuracy of $0.85 \pm 0.62$.

Abstract: We present a numerical framework for solving neural field equations on surfaces using Radial Basis Function (RBF) interpolation and quadrature. Neural field models describe the evolution of macroscopic brain activity, but modeling studies often overlook the complex geometry of curved cortical domains. Traditional numerical methods, such as finite element or spectral methods, can be computationally expensive and challenging to implement on irregular domains. In contrast, RBF-based methods provide a flexible alternative by offering interpolation and quadrature schemes that efficiently handle arbitrary geometries with high-order accuracy. We first develop an RBF-based interpolatory projection framework for neural field models on general surfaces. Quadrature for both flat and curved domains are derived in detail, ensuring high-order accuracy and stability as they depend on RBF hyperparameters (basis functions, augmenting polynomials, and stencil size). Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate the convergence of our method, highlighting its advantages over traditional approaches in terms of flexibility and accuracy. We conclude with an exposition of numerical simulations of spatiotemporal activity on complex surfaces, illustrating the method's ability to capture complex wave propagation patterns.

                arXiv:2501.16370v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the Residual Integral Solver Network (RISN), a novel neural network architecture designed to solve a wide range of integral and integro-differential equations, including one-dimensional, multi-dimensional, ordinary and partial integro-differential, systems, fractional types, and Helmholtz-type integral equations involving oscillatory kernels. RISN integrates residual connections with high-accuracy numerical methods such as Gaussian quadrature and fractional derivative operational matrices, enabling it to achieve higher accuracy and stability than traditional Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN). The residual connections help mitigate vanishing gradient issues, allowing RISN to handle deeper networks and more complex kernels, particularly in multi-dimensional problems. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that RISN consistently outperforms not only classical PINNs but also advanced variants such as Auxiliary PINN (A-PINN) and Self-Adaptive PINN (SA-PINN), achieving significantly lower Mean Absolute Errors (MAE) across various types of equations. These results highlight RISN's robustness and efficiency in solving challenging integral and integro-differential problems, making it a valuable tool for real-world applications where traditional methods often struggle.

                arXiv:2509.04622v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Representational similarity metrics are fundamental tools in neuroscience and AI, yet we lack systematic comparisons of their discriminative power across model families. We introduce a quantitative framework to evaluate representational similarity measures based on their ability to separate model families-across architectures (CNNs, Vision Transformers, Swin Transformers, ConvNeXt) and training regimes (supervised vs. self-supervised). Using three complementary separability measures-dprime from signal detection theory, silhouette coefficients and ROC-AUC, we systematically assess the discriminative capacity of commonly used metrics including RSA, linear predictivity, Procrustes, and soft matching. We show that separability systematically increases as metrics impose more stringent alignment constraints. Among mapping-based approaches, soft-matching achieves the highest separability, followed by Procrustes alignment and linear predictivity. Non-fitting methods such as RSA also yield strong separability across families. These results provide the first systematic comparison of similarity metrics through a separability lens, clarifying their relative sensitivity and guiding metric choice for large-scale model and brain comparisons.

">Opposite Priming Effects on Identity vs. Category Recognition Require Conscious Awareness</a></h4>

              
                How conscious and unconscious priming differentially modulate object recognition at different levels of abstraction (identity vs. category) remains incompletely understood, despite extensive research. We used a binocular rivalry paradigm with Continuous Flash Suppression (CFS) to manipulate conscious awareness with image or word primes while participants performed a name-picture verification task probing identity and category recognition for faces and animal bodies. Behavioral results revealed a striking dissociation: consciously perceived primes facilitated identity recognition but impaired category recognition. This effect was most pronounced with image primes, face targets, and right visual field presentations. Under unconscious priming, no such effects were observed. To elucidate the underlying mechanism, we applied a Drift Diffusion Model, which revealed that conscious priming selectively enhanced the efficiency of evidence accumulation and introduced a pre-decisional bias for identity decisions, with no reliable change for category decisions. Our findings demonstrate a double dissociation where conscious awareness is required for priming to exert robust and opposite effects on identity and category recognition. This finding challenges the view of priming as a uniformly facilitatory process, providing a new mechanistic framework for understanding how consciousness and abstraction level interact to shape visual perception.

">No evidence of neural feature-specific pre-activation during the prediction of an upcoming stimulus</a></h4>

              
                Our brains constantly make predictions about upcoming events based on prior knowledge of the environment. Although several neural mechanisms have been proposed to support this capacity, it is not yet clear how the brain makes such predictions. A compelling hypothesis is that the brain pre-activates a sensory template of a predictable stimulus before it appears. In a recent study, Demarchi et al. had participants listen to sequences of sounds with different levels of predictability. For some sequences, participants could anticipate the next sound (in regular sequences), for others not (in random sequences). Using magnetoencephalography recordings and machine-learning methods to decode sounds from brain signals, Demarchi et al. concluded that auditory predictions pre-activate tone-specific neural templates before the sound onset. In our reanalysis of their data, we demonstrate that their results can be fully explained by a bias induced by the structure of the sequences: because the most likely stimulus also happens to be physically close to the previous one, spurious higher-than-chance decoding performance arises before the sound onset. We provide general criteria to assess whether a study is affected by this confound and requires a reexamination. We conclude that there is no evidence of anticipatory predictive perception in the Demarchi et al. dataset, and that existing evidence for feature-specific pre-activation during prediction in humans remains inconclusive.

">Internal and external contexts drive distinct dynamics in shared action-encoding striatal neurons</a></h4>

              
                Animals can flexibly initiate actions guided by external cues or by internal drive. Disease states often disrupt cue-driven and self-paced actions in distinct ways, underscoring separable neural mechanisms. Such differences could arise from specialized circuits dedicated to each action mode or shared neuronal populations that shift their dynamics across contexts. To distinguish between these possibilities, we developed a task in which mice performed a lever press either spontaneously or in response to a cue, enabling direct comparison of internally and externally triggered movements. Two-photon calcium imaging in dorsolateral striatum revealed subpopulations of neurons tuned to the cue, movement, or post-movement periods. One cluster was consistently active around movement regardless of context, yet population dynamics diverged prior to action. Support vector machine decoding and subspace analyses revealed distinct context and action components within the same population. Both D1- and D2-SPNs contributed to both subspaces, with D1-SPNs more active at the time of the sensory stimulus. These results show that context shapes dynamics in shared action-encoding neurons within striatal circuits, suggesting that different initiation contexts are funneled into a common action space that flexibly supports movement execution.

">Geometric constraints on the architecture of mammalian cortical connectomes</a></h4>

              
                The intricate network of axonal fibres that forms the mammalian cortical connectome has a complex topology, being organized in a way that is neither completely regular nor random, as well as a characteristic topography, in which specific anatomical locations are imbued with distinctive connectivity profiles. The mechanisms that give rise to such properties remain a mystery. Here, we formulate a simple analytic model derived from neural field theory that prioritizes physical constraints on connectome architecture by assuming that connectivity is preferentially concentrated between pairs of cortical locations that facilitate the excitation of resonant geometric modes of the cortex. We show that the model outperforms existing approaches in reproducing multiple topological and topographical properties of cortical connectomes mapped at spatial scales spanning orders of magnitude in humans, chimpanzees, macaques, marmosets, and mice, as mapped with either non-invasive diffusion magnetic resonance imaging or invasive viral tract-tracing. Our findings thus point to a fundamental role of geometry in shaping the multiscale architecture of cortical connectomes that has been conserved across 90 million years of evolution.

                <p>Understanding how neural circuits integrate sensory and state information to support context-dependent behavior is a central challenge in neuroscience. Oviposition is a complex process during which a fruit fly integrates context and sensory information to choose an optimal location to lay her eggs. The circuit that controls oviposition is known, but how the oviposition circuit integrates multiple sensory modalities and internal states is not. Using the Hemibrain connectome, we identified the oviposition inhibitory neuron (oviIN) as a key hub in the oviposition circuit and analyzed its inputs to uncover potential parallel pathways that may be responsible for computations related to sensory integration and decision-making. We applied a network analysis to the subconnectome of inputs to the oviIN to identify clusters of interconnected neurons&mdash;many of which are uncharacterized cell types. Our findings indicate that the inputs to oviIN form multiple parallel pathways through the unstructured neuropils of the superior protocerebrum, a region implicated in context-dependent processing.</p>

                Background Muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) is a clinically aggressive disease requiring intensive treatment. The two principal curative approaches are radical cystectomy (RC) and bladder preservation therapy, most commonly trimodal therapy (TMT), which combines maximal transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURBT) with concurrent chemoradiation. While both strategies have demonstrated comparable oncologic outcomes in select patient populations, their impact on health-related quality of life (QoL) remains a crucial differentiator—particularly in real-world, resource-constrained settings where cultural and logistical considerations shape patient preferences and treatment access. Objectives The QUEST (Quality of life and Evaluation of Survival in Treatment of bladder cancer) study aims to evaluate and compare QoL outcomes and survival metrics in MIBC patients undergoing either RC or bladder preservation. It seeks to generate institution-specific data using validated patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), thereby supporting individualized, evidence-informed decision-making. Methods This prospective, single-center, observational cohort study will enroll 94 patients with non-metastatic MIBC (cT2–T4aN0M0) who are eligible for either treatment approach. Participants will self-select their treatment modality following multidisciplinary counselling. QoL will be assessed longitudinally using the Bladder Cancer Index (BCI) and EORTC QLQ-C30 at baseline and multiple post-treatment intervals. Secondary endpoints include overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and correlation of PROM scores with survival. Stratification and statistical adjustments will address inherent selection bias. Discussion The QUEST study will provide critical insights into the lived experiences and clinical outcomes of MIBC patients in eastern India. By integrating PROMs into routine oncologic evaluation, it will help bridge the gap between survival-centric and patient-centric care models.

                This study evaluated the performance of the sub-base material of High Court Road, Kabale, Uganda, using the California Bearing Ratio and Triaxial Compression Tests. Optimizing sub-base material selection is expected to enhance road longevity, minimize maintenance costs, and ensure sustainable, value-for-money construction, ultimately improving infrastructure reliability and reducing long-term performance. Field samples were collected at one-meter depth and tested for California Bearing Ratio and shear strength parameters of cohesion, angle of internal friction, and stress-strain behavior of the soil under varying axial loads, to evaluate the overall suitability under estimated loading conditions. Laboratory tests indicate that the sub-base consists predominantly of fine-grained soil, classified as high-plasticity clay based on the Unified Soil Classification System. Compaction results show maximum dry densities between 16.05 kN/m3 and 18.03 kN/m3, with Optimum Moisture Content between 18.9% and 23.3%. Shear strength parameters indicate cohesion values ranging from 67.5 kPa to 95.2 kPa, which fall below the recommended minimum of 100 kPa for stable sub-base performance. The angle of internal friction ranges from 9.00° to 19.71°, lower than the 26°–29° range typically required for stability and high bearing capacity. The CBR values range from 2% to 13%, significantly below the recommended minimum of 30% for sub-base layers. This confirms that the current sub-base material has poor load-bearing capacity and is unsuitable for supporting expected traffic loads. To support the anticipated traffic load, the study recommends construction using a 450 mm thick sub-base material embedded in the 950 mm thick pavement, attaining a minimum of 98% compaction, stabilization using lime/cement, and reinforcement of the sub-base with geosynthetics. An alternative pavement design comprising a 225 mm sub-base, in a 725 mm thick pavement, is also recommended, particularly in instances where granular material and crushed stones are more readily available

                The cardiac Purkinje network plays a vital role in the heart’s electrical conduction system, ensuring efficient and synchronized ventricular contraction. When impaired—particularly by ischemia—it can trigger life-threatening arrhythmias. In this study, we present an advanced computational model of the Purkinje network that integrates cell-level heterogeneity, spatial organization, and localized ischemic zones with customizable severity gradients. Developed in Python using open-source libraries (NumPy, matplotlib, pandas, seaborn), the model generates rich visualizations of network structure, conduction velocities, ischemia severity, and electrophysiological parameters. Simulations demonstrate how ischemia alters conduction and refractoriness in a spatially dependent manner, providing insights into arrhythmogenic risk. This modeling framework can advance understanding of cardiac conduction under pathological conditions and support therapeutic development.

                Background Behavioral expression rarely depends on a single determinant; it emerges from the convergence of neural, hormonal, and contextual factors. The lordosis reflex in female rats is a well-studied model requiring hypothalamic circuits, ovarian hormones, and somatosensory input, yet these findings have been framed qualitatively without a formal law specifying how the factors combine. Methods I propose a candidate law of convergence, formalized by the ARCH × Φ framework, in which behavior is modeled as a multiplicative product of Archetype (A: neural substrate), Drive (D: hormonal priming), Context (C: tactile stimulation), and a modulatory threshold field (Φ: arousal, neuromodulation, stress). Drawing on decades of lesion, hormone, and tactile manipulation studies, I evaluate three necessity tests of lordosis: loss of the ventromedial hypothalamus (A), ovariectomy without estradiol–progesterone replacement (D), and removal of flank stimulation (C). Results Across these tests, lordosis fails when any single factor is absent, even when the others are intact. This supports conjunctive necessity rather than additive sufficiency. Incorporating Φ explains modulatory influences such as dopamine, serotonin, stress, and development, which shift the threshold for expression. Conclusions This synthesis reframes lordosis as a model system for testing a general principle of conjunctive behavioral control. The proposed law of convergence generates falsifiable predictions, integrates disparate findings across neuroendocrinology and ethology, and may extend to other motivated behaviors, including aggression, caregiving, and social bonding. By moving from description to quantitative formulation, the ARCH × Φ framework advances toward a predictive field theory of behavior.

Simulating within-host virus sequence evolution allows for the investigation of factors such as the role of recombination in virus diversification and the impact of selective pressures on virus evolution. Here, we provide a new software to simulate virus within-host evolution called wavess (within-host adaptive virus evolution sequence simulator), a discrete-time individual-based model and a corresponding user-friendly R package. The underlying model simulates recombination, a latent infected cell reservoir, and three forms of selection: conserved sites fitness and replicative fitness in comparison to a reference sequence, and immune fitness including cross-reactivity imposed by a co-evolving immune response. In the R package, we also provide functions to generate model inputs from empirical data, as well as functions to analyze the simulation outputs. At user-defined time points, the software returns various counts related to the virus population(s) and a set of sampled virus sequences. We applied this model to investigate the selection pressures on HIV-1 <i>env</i> sequences longitudinally collected from 11 individuals. The best-fitting immune cost differed across individuals, mirroring the real-world expectation of heterogeneous immune responses among human hosts. Furthermore, the phylogenies reconstructed from these simulated sequences were similar to the phylogenies reconstructed from the real sequences for all summary statistics tested. To our knowledge, compared to other similar models, wavess has been more rigorously validated against real within-host virus sequences, and is the first to be implemented as an R package. The wavess R package can be downloaded from https://github.com/MolEvolEpid/wavess.

                <p>by Israël Tankam Chedjou, Ruairí Donnelly, Christopher A. Gilligan</p>

Cassava viral diseases, including Cassava Mosaic Disease (CMD) and Cassava Brown Streak Disease (CBSD), pose significant threats to global food security, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. This study explores the potential of varietal mixtures as a sustainable disease management strategy by introducing CropMix, a novel web-based application. The application encodes a flexible insect-borne plant pathogen transmission model to predict and optimize yields under scenarios of varietal mixtures. For instance, we use the application to evaluate the ability of virus-resistant cassava varieties (which may have lower yields in the absence of disease) to protect more susceptible varieties against CMD and CBSD, and we also consider mixtures involving tolerant varieties and non-host crops. For CMD, the high transmission rates of cassava mosaic virus (genus <i>Begomovirus</i>) limits the efficacy of mixtures, with susceptible monocultures emerging as more productive than susceptible-resistant mixtures whatever the whitefly pressure. In contrast, for CBSD, varietal mixtures demonstrate substantial benefits, with resistant varieties shielding susceptible ones and mitigating severe yield losses under moderate or high insect pressure. Management strategies involving non-host crops and complementary control measures, such as roguing, can further enhance outcomes. The model’s simplicity and adaptability make it suitable for tailoring recommendations to diverse insect-borne crop viral diseases and agroecological contexts. The study emphasizes the need for integrating real-world data and participatory frameworks to refine and implement disease management strategies. We discuss the critical balance between agronomic potential and farmer acceptability, underscoring the importance of collaborative efforts to ensure sustainable cassava production.

                <p>by Shiqi Luo, Qiuyi Wang, Ao Chen, Liang Huang, Yaoqi Liu, Xin Zong, Yuanhui Mao</p>

Macrophages require rapid and tightly controlled regulatory mechanisms to respond to environmental disruptions. While transcriptional regulation has been well characterized, the mechanisms underlying translational control in macrophages remain poorly understood. Here, we investigated the dynamics of mRNA translation in mouse macrophages during acute, intermediate, and prolonged LPS exposure. Our results reveal clear phase-specific translational regulation during macrophage polarization, which initially increases the synthesis of inflammatory mediators and cytokines, while simultaneously suppressing the expression of cell cycle-related genes. Mechanistically, we observed pervasive upstream translation in the 5′ UTRs of cell cycle-related mRNAs, which contributes to cell cycle arrest during the early phase of inflammatory response. Notably, we identified a unique codon preference toward A/U in the third position of codons in macrophages, which contrasts with the G/C preference commonly observed in other tissues. AU codon preference increases the stability and translation efficiency of cell cycle-related mRNAs, promoting cell cycle restoration after extended LPS exposure. These findings reveal that uORF translation and codon usage bias are critical components of translational regulation during macrophage polarization, highlighting a potential therapeutic intervention for modulating immune activation via macrophage-specific codon optimization.

                <p>by Monami Nishio, Xingyu Liu, Allyson P. Mackey, Michael J. Arcaro</p>

Postnatal brain development in primates involves prolonged structural maturation of the cortex, laying the foundation for advanced perceptual and cognitive functions. In humans, cortical development is thought to progress along a hierarchical gradient from early-maturing sensorimotor regions to later-developing association areas. However, developmental changes across cortical depth, which contribute to both local computation and large-scale network integration, have been largely unexplored. It also remains unclear which features of these maturational trajectories are conserved across primates and how they may have been further extended or modified in humans. Using the T1-weighted/T2-weighted (T1w/T2w) MRI ratio as a noninvasive measure of cortical microarchitecture, we systematically compared depth-dependent and regional developmental trajectories in humans and macaques. We identified a conserved “inside-out” gradient of maturation, with deeper cortical depths exhibiting steeper increases in T1w/T2w ratio and earlier plateaus than superficial depths. This depth-dependent pattern was embedded within a broader hierarchical gradient of maturation across the cortical surface, extending from sensorimotor regions to association cortex. While the spatial structure of these gradients was shared across species, humans exhibited markedly prolonged development across the entire cortical hierarchy, including both sensory and association cortices, and across cortical depths. These findings suggest that conserved developmental gradients are elaborated in humans to support an extended window of postnatal plasticity, enabling the experience-dependent refinement of cortical circuits that underlie the complex, integrative functions central to human perception and cognition.

Scientific communities need to understand and eliminate barriers that prevent people with diverse backgrounds from contributing to and participating in science. However, the combined impact of individuals’ linguistic, economic, and gender backgrounds on their scientific productivity is poorly understood. Using a survey of 908 environmental scientists, we show that being a woman is associated with up to a 45% reduction in the number of English-language publications, compared to men. Being a woman, a non-native English speaker, and from a low-income country is associated with up to a 70% reduction, compared to male native English speakers from a high-income country. The linguistic and economic productivity gap narrows when based on the total number of English- and non-English-language publications. We call for an explicit effort to consider linguistic, economic, and gender backgrounds and incorporate non-English-language publications when assessing the performance and contribution of scientists.

                Background Ovarian tumors remain one of the most lethal gynecological malignancies due to delayed diagnosis. Differentiating benign from malignant adnexal masses is crucial to guide clinical management. While ultrasound is the first-line imaging modality, its limitations in certain indeterminate cases justify the use of MRI, particularly through the O-RADS classification (Ovarian-Adnexal Reporting and Data System). However, challenges remain in interpreting solid components and enhancement curves. Methods This retrospective study included 89 patients with 116 adnexal masses deemed indeterminate on ultrasound. All patients underwent pelvic MRI using a standardized protocol, including diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and ADC mapping. Adnexal masses were classified according to O-RADS, and ADC values were used to refine classifications between categories 3–4 and 4–5. Final diagnoses were confirmed by histopathological analysis after surgical resection. Results Integration of ADC values improved diagnostic accuracy. Six masses initially classified as O-RADS 3 were upgraded to O-RADS 4 based on ADC cut-offs, and 18 O-RADS 4 masses were reclassified as O-RADS 5. Additionally, eight lesions initially classified as O-RADS 4 were reclassified to O-RADS 3. The integrated O-RADS/ADC strategy demonstrated excellent diagnostic performance, with sensitivity reaching 100%, specificity of 95.1%, positive predictive value (PPV) of 97.4%, and negative predictive value (NPV) of 100%. The diagnostic accuracy, calculated using Youden’s index, was 0.95. Furthermore, the use of non-contrast-enhanced MRI sequences (T2-weighted imaging, DWI, and ADC mapping) alone also provided robust diagnostic performance, achieving a sensitivity of 98.67% and a specificity of 90.48%. Conclusions: Incorporating ADC values into the O-RADS classification enhances the diagnostic performance of MRI in evaluating adnexal masses. This refined approach enables more accurate stratification of malignancy risk, improves clinical decision-making, and may help avoid unnecessary surgery, particularly in women where fertility preservation is a concern.

                This study analyzed international research on systems thinking in science education from 2014 to 2025. Systems thinking, as it points out the links between parts of complex systems, is being seen as an important skill for managing issues such as climate change, loss of biodiversity, and sustainability. Despite its importance, genetics is introduced differently in education around the world. Using Scopus data, we study the main contributors to this field, emerging research themes, and how different institutions are teaming up, with sustainability, STEM education, and interdisciplinary learning being areas that are gaining importance. This information highlights the need for international research partnerships and support for teachers to teach systems thinking and improve students’ skills to face real-life problems. The results can help improve how policymakers, educators, and researchers introduce systems thinking into classrooms.

                Background Critical thinking is a collection of dispositions and abilities related to individuals’ analytical, creative, and practical cognitive and decision-making skills. The development of optimal critical thinking skills better prepares students for college and their careers. The measurement of critical thinking actual abilities like inquisitiveness, open-mindedness, or systemic thinking among college students is limited. Similarly, the assessment of all types of critical thinking like creative or practical from the perspectives of students is meager. Methods This research utilizes original data collected from 803 college students between 2020 and 2021 after securing institutional review approval for the research. Self-reported data on 30 items instrument measuring students’ ratings of their analytical, creative, and practical thinking is used. Descriptive statistics, independent samples t-tests, and correlation analysis all were used to estimate the prevalence of critical thinking, and whether gender or language influence it or not. Results Results indicate that undergraduate students rated their abilities in critical thinking is very high. On all three types of critical thinking (analytical thinking, creative thinking, practical thinking), students scored between 117 and 123 on a 30-150 scale, indicating a high score. Additionally, gender and language have little to no influence over critical thinking scores. Further, analytical, creative, and practical thinking are independent from each other evident in the low correlations among all three elements. The results suggest the emergence of the Dunning-Kruger effect concerning students’ critical thinking assessment. Conclusions There is a colossal gap between students- self-reported ratings and their actual performance on critical thinking instruments. More rigorous assessments of dispositions and abilities are needed utilizing existing validated instruments in literature.

                Epilepsy affects approximately 70 million people globally, with nearly 80% living in low- and middle-income countries. From 1990 to 2021, childhood idiopathic epilepsy cases increased by 26.34%. Despite treatment advancements, stigma, fear, and misconceptions, especially in schools, hinder the inclusion of learners with epilepsy. School-based educational interventions have emerged as a vital strategy to raise awareness and reduce stigma. This scoping review aims to identify and map the types of epilepsy-related curricula in primary and secondary schools and special education settings worldwide, evaluating their effectiveness. Using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodology, a comprehensive search strategy will be implemented across electronic databases and grey literature sources. Eligible studies will include various research designs focusing on educational interventions for learners, educators, or school communities. Study selection and data extraction will be performed independently by two reviewers, with a third reviewer resolving any disagreements. The findings will be synthesized through thematic analysis. The review is expected to reveal significant variation in the design and evaluation of epilepsy curricula, with many lacking standardized implementations. It aims to inform the development of relevant and scalable education strategies, ultimately supporting inclusive, equitable, and stigma-free learning environments for students with epilepsy.

                The study explores the factors that influence entrepreneurial intention and action among university students in five Latin American countries, integrating correlation analyses, multiple regressions, and visualizations through Raincloud Plots. Although numerous emotional, cognitive, and contextual profile variables were measured, this report presents only those that showed significant differences between countries or were identified as relevant predictors of entrepreneurial intention and action. Key variables such as entrepreneurial attitude, self-efficacy, entrepreneurial action in its discovery phase, university training, and empathy were identified as significant predictors of entrepreneurial intention. Self-awareness, self-efficacy, and entrepreneurial attitude explained the discovery phase. In contrast, financial knowledge, emotional well-being, flow at work, self-efficacy, and low cognitive load were determinants in the exploitation phase. The findings highlight the need for an adaptive curriculum that incorporates emotional competencies, training pathways differentiated by entrepreneurial stage, and support strategies that include mentoring, early diagnosis, and well-being management.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Sensitive behavioral measures are needed for clinical trials in ataxias and other neurodegenerative diseases. We hypothesized that quantitative analysis of eye movements during a natural multi-component task (passage reading) could produce a measure capable of capturing subclinical signs and disease progression.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Binocular gaze sampled at 1000 hertz (Hz) was collected from 102 individuals with ataxia (including 36 spinocerebellar ataxias, 12 Friedreich's ataxia, and 5 multiple system atrophy) and 70 healthy controls. Longitudinal data were available for 26 participants with ataxia in the ongoing Neurobooth natural history study. The Reading Eye Abnormality Digital (READ) score was developed by training a regression model to aggregate saccade and fixation kinematics.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Mean displacement of fixations, the number and frequency of saccades, and the proportion of regressive saccades were related to oculomotor dysfunction, speech dysfunction, and overall ataxia severity. The READ score was reliable (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = 0.96, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and correlated with Brief Ataxia Rating Scale (BARS) total score (<i>r</i> = 0.82, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), oculomotor (<i>r</i> = 0.52, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), and speech (<i>r</i> = 0.73, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) subscores, and patient reports of function including patient-reported outcome measures (PROM)-Ataxia (<i>r</i> = 0.51, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and the Dysarthria Impact Scale (DIS; <i>r</i> = 0.53, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). The READ score detected subclinical oculomotor (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.69, <i>p</i> = 0.02) and speech signs (AUC = 0.72, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and disease progression (<i>d</i> = 0.36, <i>p</i> = 0.03). The BARS total did not reach statistical significance in capturing progression between study visits in this cohort (<i>d</i> = 0.27, <i>p</i> = 0.08).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Digital measures of eye movements are a promising approach for sensitively measuring ataxia in clinical trials (including early-stage disease) and may have utility in other neurodegenerative diseases affecting speech or ocular control. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

<p>Recapitulative schema of different exploratory levels of the evolutionary impact on human neurological diseases.
</p>
<br/>
<p>Clinical neuroscience focuses on the mechanisms of brain function, but this approach falls short of insights into how the central nervous system (CNS) evolved, both in health and disease. Here, we discuss evolutionary concepts relevant to understanding human brain diseases, on the genetic, subcellular, cellular, connectomic, behavioral, and cultural levels. By revisiting common neurological diseases, we discuss evolved residues from our ancestors, mechanisms of exaptation, antagonistic pleiotropy, and human longevity with the consequent outpacing of biological evolution by cultural evolution. An evolution-based conceptual framework can propel transdisciplinary research targeting the constraints imposed by and compensatory adaptations involved in human-specific neurological diseases.

                Background Multi-sectoral settings such as hospitals, health care centres, clinics, schools, workplaces, community events, and online platforms play an important role in reaching individuals from various socioeconomic backgrounds and delivering health promotion interventions that change behaviour and improve health outcomes. The aim of this review was to systematically review the nature and effectiveness of eye health promotion interventions implemented by eye health professionals across various multi-sectoral settings. Method This review was conducted using the Centre for Review and Dissemination guidelines for conducting systematic reviews and reported in accordance with the PRISMA 2020 statement. A comprehensive and systematic search was conducted on electronic databases such as PubMed, Web of Science, and Medline, CINAHL and Academic Search Complete hosted on EBSCOHost and supplemented with a hand search for relevant studies published between 1999 and 2024. Two independent reviewers screened eligible studies, extracted data, and assessed study quality using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT) 2018. The eligibility criterion was met by 80 studies out of 15 554 screened. Results Eye health promotion interventions identified among studies were categorised as health education, health counselling, vision screening, eye screening and training programmes, health prevention, health promotion, health policy, ophthalmic intervention programmes, comprehensive eye examination and screening for diabetic retinopathy. Most studies showed a significant impact of eye health promotion interventions. Conclusion Overall, studies demonstrated a diverse range of strategies that have shown significant effectiveness across various settings. This systematic review highlights the effectiveness of eye health promotion interventions, whilst identifying gaps in compliance, follow-up systems, and policy integration.

                Hyslop et al. identify CD7 as a tissue-specific receptor essential for maintaining terminally exhausted CD8+ T cells during chronic infection. CD7 is highly expressed on a CD101+Tim3low liver-resident subset, supports persistence via regulation of apoptosis, and is similarly upregulated on PD-1+CD39+ TILs in human head and neck cancer.

                Rossi-Smith et al. investigated how the amino acid taurine modulates inflammation. They show that NLRP3 inflammasome activation triggers taurine loss from macrophages, disrupting cellular ion balance and amplifying inflammation. Blocking taurine export restores balance, revealing a potential therapeutic target for hyperinflammatory diseases.

                Kuo and McCall introduce a strategy for neural-circuit-selective pharmacology. Using ex vivo calcium imaging combined with pharmacological profiling of the locus coeruleus, the authors identify a combination of projection-selective GPCR agonists. In vivo, this combination synergistically enhances antinociception by dampening the noradrenergic projection to the medial prefrontal cortex.

                Ishida et al. use an engineered fetal liver (FL)-derived endothelial cell niche to characterize FL hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) at single cell resolution and uncover signals supporting their self-renewal. Rare, serially transplantable FL-HSCs were found to uniquely exhibit delayed differentiation, symmetric cell division behavior, and transcriptional signatures of biosynthetic dormancy.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/84243">Distinct functions of cardiac β-adrenergic receptors in the T-tubule vs. outer surface membrane</a></h4>

              
                β-adrenoceptors (β-ARs) regulate cardiac function during sympathetic nerve stimulation. β-ARs are present in both the cardiac T-tubule (TTM) and outer surface membrane (OSM), but how their location impacts their function is unknown. Here, we developed a technology based on size exclusion to explore the function of β-ARs located in the OSM. We synthetized a PEG-Iso molecule by covalently linking isoprenaline (Iso) to a 5000 Da PolyEthylene-Glycol (PEG) chain to increase the size of the β-AR agonist and prevent it from accessing the T-tubule network. The affinity of PEG-Iso and Iso on β<sub>1</sub>- and β<sub>2</sub>-ARs was measured using radioligand binding. Molecular dynamics simulation was used to assess PEG-Iso conformation and visualise the accessibility of the Iso moiety to water. Using confocal microscopy, we show that PEGylation constrains molecules outside the T-tubule network of adult rat ventricular myocytes (ARVMs) due to the presence of the extracellular glycocalyx. β-AR activation in OSM with PEG-Iso produced a lower stimulation of [cAMP]<sub>i</sub> than Iso but a larger stimulation of cytosolic PKA at equivalent levels of [cAMP]<sub>I</sub> and similar effects on excitation-contraction coupling parameters. However, PEG-Iso produced a much lower stimulation of nuclear cAMP and PKA than Iso. Thus, OSM β-ARs in ARVMs control mainly cytosolic cAMP/PKA pathway and contractility, while TTM β-ARs control mainly nuclear cAMP, PKA and consequent nuclear protein phosphorylation. Size exclusion strategy using ligand PEGylation provides a unique approach to evaluate the respective contribution of T-tubule <i>vs.</i> outer surface membrane proteins in cardiac cells.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104037">Recovery of the full in vivo firing range in post-lesion surviving DA SN neurons associated with Kv4.3-mediated pacemaker plasticity</a></h4>

              
                Dopamine (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) control several essential functions, including the voluntary movement, learning and motivated behavior. Healthy DA SN neurons show diverse firing patterns <i>in vivo</i>, ranging from slow pacemaker-like activity (1-10 Hz) to transient high frequency bursts (&lt;100 Hz), interspersed with pauses that can last hundreds of milliseconds. Recent <i>in vivo</i> patch experiments have started to reveal the subthreshold mechanisms underlying this physiological diversity, but the impact of challenges like cell loss on the <i>in vivo</i> activity of adult DA SN neurons, and how these may relate to behavioral disturbances, are still largely unknown. We investigated the <i>in vivo</i> electrophysiological properties of surviving SN DA neurons after partial unilateral 6-OHDA lesions, a single-hit, non-progressive model of neuronal cell loss. We show that mice subjected to this model have an initial motor impairment, measured by asymmetrical rotations in the open field test, which recovered over time. At 3 weeks post-lesion, when open field locomotion was strongly impaired, surviving DA SN neurons showed a compressed <i>in vivo</i> dynamic firing range, characterized by a 10-fold reduction of <i>in vivo</i> burst firing compared to controls. This <i>in vivo</i> phenotype was accompanied by pronounced <i>in vitro</i> pacemaker instability. In contrast, in the chronic post-lesion phase (&gt;2 months), where turning symmetry in open field locomotion had recovered, surviving SN DA neurons displayed the full dynamic range of <i>in vivo</i> firing, including <i>in vivo</i> bursting, similar to controls. The normalized <i>in vivo</i> firing pattern was associated with a 2-fold acceleration of stable <i>in vitro</i> pacemaking, mediated by Kv4.3 potassium channel downregulation. Our findings demonstrate the existence of a homeostatic pacemaker plasticity mechanism in surviving DA SN neurons after pronounced cell loss.

">Morphological heterogeneity of human astrocytes in cerebral organoids</a></h4>

              
                Astrocytes are a type of glial cell in the central nervous system responsible for modulating synaptic transmissions, tissue repair, maintaining homeostasis, and are therefore implicated in many neurological diseases. Human cortical astrocytes are more structurally complex, larger, and have unique subtypes in comparison to the commonly studied rodent cortical astrocytes. As access to human cortical tissue is sparse, cerebral organoids (COs) derived from human pluripotent stem cells have emerged as a promising in vitro model for studying the human cortex. Astrocyte subtypes unique to humans are recapitulated in COs but have not been quantitatively assessed (1, 2). In this study, we characterized human astrocytes in situ in sliced COs cultured at the air-liquid interface (ALI-COs). By 4 months of age, ALI-COs express many mature astrocyte markers and showed increasing levels of GFAP with longer culture durations. By employing immunostaining, tissue clearing, morphological reconstruction, and unsupervised clustering analysis, three major GFAP+ astrocyte subtypes were identified in ALI-COs. All subtypes exhibited greater morphological complexity than their mouse counterparts, as revealed by increased branching and longer branch extensions. However, consistent with the mid-gestation fetal stage of the ALI-COs, astrocytes did not fully recapitulate the complexity observed in adult human astrocytes, which are known to continue maturation postnatally.

">A hardwired neural circuit for temporal difference learning</a></h4>

              
                The neurotransmitter dopamine plays a major role in learning by acting as a teaching signal to update the brain's predictions about rewards. A leading theory proposes that this process is analogous to a reinforcement learning algorithm called temporal difference (TD) learning, and that dopamine acts as the error term within the TD algorithm (TD error). Although many studies have demonstrated similarities between dopamine activity and TD errors, the mechanistic basis for dopaminergic TD learning remains unknown. Here, we combined large-scale neural recordings with patterned optogenetic stimulation to examine whether and how the key steps in TD learning are accomplished by the circuitry connecting dopamine neurons and their targets. Replacing natural rewards with optogenetic stimulation of dopamine axons in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in a classical conditioning task gradually generated TD error-like activity patterns in dopamine neurons by specifically modifying the task-related activity of NAc neurons expressing the D1 dopamine receptor (D1 neurons). In turn, patterned optogenetic stimulation of NAc D1 neurons in naive animals drove dopamine neuron spiking according to the TD error of the stimulation pattern, indicating that TD computations are hardwired into this circuit. The transformation from D1 neurons to dopamine neurons could be described by a biphasic linear filter, with a rapid positive and delayed negative phase, that effectively computes a temporal difference. This finding suggests that the time horizon over which the TD algorithm operates--the temporal discount factor--is set by the balance of the positive and negative components of the linear filter, pointing to a circuit-level mechanism for temporal discounting. These results provide a new conceptual framework for understanding how the computations and parameters governing animal learning arise from neurobiological components.

">Methylphenidate-induced reductions in choice impulsivity are associated with alterations in cortico-striatal beta oscillations.</a></h4>

              
                Impulsive choice- preferring small, immediate rewards over larger, delayed reward- is a hallmark of many psychiatric disorders. Methylphenidate, a dopamine and noradrenaline transporter inhibitor, reduces impulsivity, but the neural mechanisms underlying this effect remain unclear. Identifying a neurophysiological signature of methylphenidate action could be used clinically to predict treatment response and guide drug development. To this end, we recorded local field potentials (LFP) from 32 electrodes spanning cortico-striatal circuits in rats performing a temporal discounting task, under saline or methylphenidate treatment conditions. Methylphenidate decreased beta frequency (15-30 Hz) power and connectivity for small, immediate rewards while simultaneously increasing beta power for large, delayed rewards. Reduced connectivity in cortico-striatal networks during small rewards predicted increased preference for delayed rewards. These findings suggest that methylphenidate influences discounting behavior by modulating reward-evoked beta oscillations in cortico-striatal networks. Thus, beta oscillations may serve as a translational biomarker of treatment responsivity to monoaminergic drugs, providing a circuit-level assay to measure and predict changes in impulsive behavior.

">A groove brain-music interface for enhancing individual experience of urge to move</a></h4>

              
                When we listen to music, we often feel a pleasurable urge to move to music, known as groove. While previous studies have identified musical features that contribute to the groove experience, such as syncopation and tempo, they also report individual differences in which kinds of music people experience groove. Therefore, recommending groove-eliciting music requires accounting for individual differences. In this study, we aimed to develop a groove brain-music interface (G-BMI) that generates personalized playlists to maximize each individual's groove experience, using a neurofeedback system based on in-ear EEG. Twenty-four participants listened to three high-groove and three low-groove musical excerpts and rated their "urge to move." Using these ratings and the recorded EEG, we trained two LASSO models to build the G-BMI. Model 1 predicted urge to move from acoustic features extracted with VGGish, a pretrained neural network. Model 2 classified EEG data as recorded during listening to high-groove or low-groove music. Using Model 1, we ranked 7,225 candidate songs by predicted groove and assembled one groove-augmenting and one groove-diminishing playlist. Using Models 1 and 2, we created two additional playlists that updated Model 1 and the ranking in real-time based on in-ear EEG. Participants then listened to all four playlists and rated them on items including "urge to move." The groove-augmenting playlist that incorporated EEG achieved the highest "urge to move" ratings. These findings suggest that a personalized neurofeedback system employing EEG can help maximize individual groove experience.

">Common brain network dynamics capture attention fluctuations in tasks and movies</a></h4>

              
                Attentional states are highly dynamic and variable, fluctuating from moment to moment and showing stark differences across contexts. To what extent does functional brain reorganization capture variability in attentional states? In the present study we utilize a time-resolved measure of functional MRI connectivity to examine and compare the extent to which univariate activity and functional networks reflect second-to-second sustained attentional fluctuations. Sustained attention was measured objectively, using auditory and visual tasks, and subjectively while participants watched and listened to narratives. Results revealed that objective measures of sustained attention to images and sounds involved common patterns of neural activity and functional interactions. Additionally, networks related to sustained attentional performance during controlled tasks also predicted fluctuations in subjective attentional engagement while participants watched movies and listened to a podcast. Generalization between experimental and everyday task contexts highlights the robustness of time-resolved functional networks for capturing dynamic fluctuations in sustained attentional states.

">Efficient Coding of Spatial Frequency in Natural Images: Cross-frequency Dependence</a></h4>

              
                Research suggests that spatial frequency (SF) channels in the visual system operate with a degree of independence. However, the independence model has been questioned by evidence of non-additive effects in compound gratings, indicating complex interactions between SF channels. These studies, however, typically employ artificial stimuli, leaving questions about SF processing in natural scenes. Efficient Coding hypothesis, which posits that the visual system minimizes redundancy and retains relevant information, predicts a dependence between HSF and LSF. In this study, we examined interactions between LSF and HSF using natural and phase-scrambled images to explore SF integration during perception. Participants completed an SF identification task, using both natural and scrambled images to isolate the role of phase alignment. Our results indicate that HSF and LSF interact primarily in phase-aligned conditions, with phase scrambling driving independent processing of two SFs and reducing error rates. These findings suggest that phase alignment enhances perceptual efficiency, facilitating a trade-off between accuracy and redundancy reduction in natural scene processing.

">The Rational Irrational: Better Learners Show Stronger Frequency Heuristics</a></h4>

              
                Does favoring less valuable options that deliver more frequent rewards reflect flawed decision-making or an adaptive strategy under complex environments? Frequency effects, defined as a bias toward more frequently rewarded but less valuable options, have traditionally been viewed as maladaptive decision-making deficits. In the present study, we used a within-subject design in which participants completed a four-option reinforcement learning task twice, once under a baseline condition and once with a reward frequency manipulation, to test whether better baseline learning predicts greater or lesser susceptibility to frequency-based biases. Participants were first trained on two fixed option pairs and then transferred their knowledge to novel pairings in a testing phase. Across conditions, higher training accuracy generally predicted higher test accuracy, with one critical exception: on trials where a more valuable option was pitted against a more frequently rewarded but less valuable alternative, participants with higher training accuracy exhibited a stronger bias toward the more frequent option. Moreover, baseline optimal choice rates in these specific trials were unrelated to--and even slightly negatively correlated with--optimal choice rates under the frequency condition. Computational modeling further showed that participants with better baseline learning performance were better fit by frequency-sensitive models in the frequency condition and they weighed frequency-based processing more heavily than value-based processing. Overall, these findings suggest that frequency effects, rather than signaling flawed learning, manifest more strongly in individuals with better baseline learning performance. This seemingly irrational bias may, under conditions of uncertainty, reflect a flexible, adaptive strategy that emerges among the best learners when value-based approaches are costly or unreliable.

">TDP-43 pathology triggers SRRM4-dependent cryptic splicing of G3BP1 in ALS/FTD</a></h4>

              
                Loss of nuclear TDP-43 is a defining feature of the neurodegenerative diseases amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), yet how this leads to selective neuronal vulnerability is poorly understood. Here, using human iPSC-derived neurons and a large multi-omics dataset of ALS/FTD patients, we demonstrate that TDP-43 pathology induces the inclusion of an in-frame cryptic exon in human G3BP1. The resulting CRYPTIC G3BP1 protein contains an additional 10 amino acids within the highly conserved NTF2L domain, which acts as a dominant negative and disrupts stress granule dynamics. We further show that cryptic exon inclusion in G3BP1 upon TDP-43 loss is enriched in neurons. Mechanistically, the loss of TDP-43 unmasks a binding site for the neuron-specific splicing regulator SRRM4 within intron 2 of G3BP1, enabling the inclusion of the cryptic exon. Collectively, our findings reveal that neuron-specific regulatory mechanisms intersect with TDP-43 -mediated splicing and suggest a mechanistic basis for the increased neuronal vulnerability observed in ALS/FTD.

">Olfactory Bulb Pinprick Induction of Cortical Spreading Depolarizations</a></h4>

              
                Cortical spreading depolarization (CSD) is a wave of cellular depolarization followed by prolonged depression of neuronal activity and is associated with a broad array of neurological diseases, including migraine with aura, traumatic brain injury, and stroke. Traditional CSD induction methods for animal studies have included pinprick, concentrated potassium chloride (KCl) application, and electrical stimulation. These methods are invasive and can cause injury to the cortex. Recently, a non-invasive approach using optogenetics has become available, but requires the use of transgenic mice or transfection of an optogene, which limits its wide adoption. Here, we describe a novel approach using olfactory bulb needle insertion in rodents to induce CSD. We also included KCl-induced CSDs as a comparator in the same mice. Olfactory bulb pinprick resulted in CSDs on every attempt (n = 18/18) as confirmed with optical intrinsic signal imaging. Histological analysis revealed that needle disruption in the caudal olfactory bulb, which is continuous with the cerebral cortex, may account for the propagation of CSD from the olfactory bulb to the cortex. Olfactory bulb pinprick reliably induces CSD and is non-invasive with respect to cortex. The approach may prove to be useful in rodent studies where maintenance of cortical integrity is important.

">How do visual and conceptual factors predict the composition of typical scene drawings?</a></h4>

              
                Imagine you are asked to draw a typical bedroom, what would you put on paper? Your choice of objects is likely to depend on visual occurrence statistics (i.e., the objects present in previously encountered bedrooms) and semantic relations between objects and scenes (i.e., the semantic relationship between the bedroom and its constituent objects). To investigate how these two factors contribute to the composition of typical scene drawings, we analyzed 1,192 drawings of six indoor scene categories, obtained from 303 participants. For each object featured in the drawings, we estimated its visual occurrence frequency from the ADE20K dataset of annotated scene images, and its semantic relatedness to the scene concept from a word2vec language processing model. Across all scenes of a given category, generalized linear models revealed that visual and conceptual factors both predicted the likelihood of an object featuring in the scene drawings, with a combined model outperforming both single-factor models. We further computed the visual and semantic specificity of objects for a given scene, that is, how diagnostic an object is for the scene. Object specificity offered only weak predictive power when predicting the selection of objects, yet even infrequently drawn objects remained diagnostic of their scenes. Taken together, we show that visual and conceptual factors jointly shape the composition of typical scene drawings. By releasing a large dataset of typical scene drawings alongside this work, we further provide a starting point for future studies exploring other critical properties of human drawings.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>To make optimal decisions, intelligent agents must learn latent environmental states from discrete observations. Bayesian frameworks argue that integration of evidence over time allows us to refine our state belief by reducing uncertainty about alternate possibilities. How is this increasing belief precision during learning reflected in the brain? We propose that temporal neural variability should scale with the degree of reduction of uncertainty during learning. In a sample of 47 healthy adults, we found that BOLD signal variability (SD<sub>BOLD</sub>, as measured across independent learning trials) indeed compressed with successive exposure to decision-related evidence. Crucially, more accurate participants expressed greater SD<sub>BOLD</sub> compression primarily in default mode network regions, possibly reflecting the increasing precision of their latent state belief during more efficient learning. Further, computational modeling of behavior suggested that more accurate subjects held a more unbiased (flatter) prior belief over possible states that allowed for larger uncertainty reduction during learning, which was directly reflected in SD<sub>BOLD</sub> changes. Our results provide first evidence that neural variability compresses with increasing belief precision during effective learning, proposing a flexible mechanism for how we come to learn the probabilistic nature of the world around us.</span>

                <p>Auditory perception can be modulated by other sensory stimuli. However, we do not fully understand the neural mechanisms that support multisensory behavior. Here, while male nonhuman primates detected a target vocalization that was embedded in a background chorus of vocalizations, we recorded spiking activity from the primary auditory cortex (A1). We found that a congruent video of a monkey eliciting the target vocalization improved the monkeys' behavior, relative to their performance when we only presented a static image of the monkey. As a proxy for the functional organization of A1, we compared the contribution of neurons with significant spectrotemporal response fields (STRFs) with those that had nonsignificant STRFs (nSTRFs). Because, on average, STRF and nSTRF neurons have different spike waveform shapes, firing rates, and neural-correlation structure, we hypothesized that they might belong to different neural populations. Consistent with this, we found that, although STRF neurons encode stimulus information through synchronized activity, task-related information in the primate A1 is encoded more as a structured dynamic process in the population of nSTRF neurons. Together, these findings suggest that modulatory multisensory behavior is supported by nSTRF neurons and identifies, for the first time, a functional differentiation between the role that STRF and nSTRF neurons contribute to behavior.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/38/e0084252025?rss=1">Characterization of Auditory Responsive Neurons in the Mouse Superior Colliculus to White Noise and Frequency-Restricted Sounds</a></h4>

              
                <p>Locating the source of a specific sound in a complex environment and determining its saliency is critical for survival. The superior colliculus (SC), a sensorimotor midbrain structure, plays an important role in sound localization and has been shown to have a topographic map of the auditory space in a range of species. In mice, previous studies using broadband white noise stimuli found that high-frequency monaural spectral cues and interaural-level differences (ILDs) are used to generate a neuron's spatially restricted receptive field (RF) and that these RFs are organized topographically along the azimuth. However, in a naturalistic environment, the auditory stimuli that an animal encounters may have restricted spectral components, although these sound sources can still be localized efficiently. It remains unknown whether and how the SC neurons respond to frequency-restricted sounds and, in turn, how this changes the organization of their RFs into a topographic map. Here, we show results from large-scale in vivo physiological recordings of SC neurons from male and female mice in response to white noise, naturalistic ultrasonic pup call, and chirps. We find that mouse SC auditory neurons respond to a pup call and chirps with distinct temporal patterns and a spatial preference predominantly at ~60&deg; in contralateral azimuth. In addition, we categorized auditory SC neurons based on their spectrotemporal RF patterns and demonstrated that there are at least four classes of auditory-responsive neurons in the SC that lie in different locations along the anteroposterior axis of the SC.</p>

                <p>The left inferior parietal lobe (IPL) supports diverse cognitive functions through the finely differentiated yet coordinated interactions of its subregions, including the supramarginal gyrus (SMG), angular gyrus (AG), and lateral bank of the intraparietal sulcus (lbIPS). However, how these subregions dynamically represent and exchange information during cognitive processing remains unclear. Language processing, integrating visual form, phonology, and semantics provide an ideal model for investigating the IPL's functional capabilities and dynamics. To overcome the limitations of traditional neuroimaging techniques that lack the spatiotemporal resolution to capture these fast-evolving processes and univariate analyses unable to detect fine-grained representational structure in neural signals, we employed stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) in 13 epilepsy patients (eight males and five females) performing an oral word reading task. Combining SEEG with representational similarity analysis (RSA), a multivariate approach linking neural activity patterns to cognitive models, we mapped spatiotemporal language information dynamics across IPL subregions. Results revealed dynamic functional differentiation within the left IPL: the SMG and AG exhibited sequential language representations, with the SMG showing early semantics, followed by phonology and later visual form and semantics; the AG showed early semantics followed by visual form; in contrast, the lbIPS was engaged only in visual form representation. Connectivity analyses revealed the dynamic coordination among IPL subregions throughout the task. These findings demonstrate that the left IPL operates as a dynamic network, where functional specialization and interregional information exchange collectively support complex cognitive processes.</p>

                <p>Abnormal excitatory synaptic transmission in the human prefrontal cortex has been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia based primarily on genetic evidence. However, changes in synaptic function cannot be predicted from altered gene expressions, but determining the amount, density, and subsynaptic distribution of synaptic proteins is the only reliable indirect readout of function. Detecting proteins in individual synapses of human postmortem tissues has been severely constrained by technical limitations. Here we overcome this limitation by optimizing a high-resolution, quantitative localization method to facilitate antigen recognition at excitatory synapses in postmortem brains of both sexes. Using PSD-95 immunoreactivity as molecular marker of excitatory synapses, we demonstrate the lack of significant differences in synapse density and size in upper cortical layers of control and schizophrenia subjects. The synaptic densities of postsynaptic AMPA and NMDA receptor subunits and presynaptic molecules Bassoon and Munc13-1 are also indistinguishable between control and schizophrenia subjects. The number of Munc13-1 nanoclusters, marking presynaptic neurotransmitter release sites, does not differ either. Excitatory synapses on parvalbumin expressing interneurons contain similar AMPA but significantly lower NMDA receptor densities in schizophrenia compared with control subjects. Our study provides the first comprehensive comparison of key functionally relevant synaptic proteins in individual human excitatory synapses and demonstrates that changes in the molecular composition of only a specific subset of excitatory synapses may contribute to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.</p>

                <p>Selectivity for sensory modality characterizes distinct subregions of the human brain, well beyond the primary sensory cortices. We previously identified frontal and posterior cortical regions that are preferentially recruited for visual versus auditory attention and working memory (WM). Here, we extend our approach to include tactile cognition and to characterize cortical regions recruited by WM in each of three sensory modalities. The joint organization of visual-selective, auditory-selective, tactile-selective, and supramodal WM recruitment within individual subjects has not been fully investigated previously. Male and female human subjects participated in a blocked fMRI task requiring them to perform <I>N-</I>back WM judgments in auditory, visual, or tactile (haptic) modalities. We confirmed our prior reports of multiple visual-biased and auditory-biased frontal lobe regions. We also observed several bilateral tactile-selective regions abutting previously described visual- and auditory-selective regions, including the dorsal and ventral precentral sulcus, the postcentral sulcus, and the anterior intraparietal sulcus. Several cortical regions were recruited by WM in all three sensory modalities in individual subjects, including the precentral sulcus, inferior frontal sulcus, intraparietal sulcus, anterior insula, and presupplementary motor area. Supramodal regions exhibited substantial overlap with visual-biased regions in the frontal and parietal cortex and comparatively little overlap with tactile- or auditory-biased regions. Lastly, resting-state analyses revealed that auditory-, visual-, and tactile-selective WM regions segregate into modality-specific networks that span the frontal and posterior cortex. Together, these results shed light on the functional organization of sensory-selective and supramodal regions supporting higher-order cognition.</p>

                <p>There is growing evidence that sensory neurons within the dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) are equipped with mechanisms for "gating" nociceptive information before it enters the central nervous system. However, direct in vivo evidence remains limited due to the anatomical inaccessibility of the DRG. Here, we developed a decerebrate, arterially perfused preparation of the rat (of either sex) that allows simultaneous recordings from the C8 spinal nerve (SN) and dorsal root (DR), with full access to the corresponding DRG in the absence of anesthesia. The C8 segment contributes to the median nerve supplying the forepaw, which was used for sensory stimulation. Spikes in DR were recorded and temporally matched to their origin spikes in the SN. Noxious mechanical stimulation to the forepaw increased firing in both the SN and the DR, and application of GABA (200&nbsp;&micro;M) or the GABA reuptake inhibitor, NO-711 (200&nbsp;&micro;M), directly into the DRG significantly reduced firing frequency only in the DR without affecting SN activity. Spike sorting revealed that this reduction in the spike rate from SN to DR, a phenomenon we term here as "filtering," was greater for C-fiber spikes compared with A-fiber spikes. Innocuous stimuli (brush/cotton bud strokes and proprioceptive stimulation) also increased firing in both SN and DR, but GABA application into the DRG failed to reduce DR firing rates. Taken together, our findings lend direct support to the hypothesis of peripheral gating of the nociceptive signaling at the DRG and highlight the therapeutic potential of these peripheral structures.</p>

                <p>The neurotransmitter release and the synaptic vesicle cycle require a specific lipidic composition of presynaptic and vesicle membranes. Phospholipids with long-chain acyl groups are necessary to confer to membranes the physical properties necessary for synaptic transmission. Elovl5 is crucial for the elongation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) beyond 18-carbon atoms, and its deletion or mutation causes cerebellar motor deficits in humans and mice. In the mouse cerebellum of both sexes, deletion of <I>Elovl5</I> increased 18- and 20-carbon atoms PUFAs, decreased long-chain PUFAs, and increased saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids. Electrophysiological recordings in Purkinje cells revealed that basal synaptic transmission was preserved in <I>Elovl5</I> knock-out mice. However, the recovery from depression of the climbing fiber synapse lacked the fast phase, suggesting a deficit in replenishment of the readily releasable pool of synaptic vesicles. The parallel fiber synapse showed slower replenishment rate of the readily releasable pool at relatively high but physiological frequencies of 50 and 100&nbsp;Hz. Endocannabinoids contain a long-chain PUFA, and in Purkinje cells, they mediate the synaptically induced suppression of excitation (SSE). In <I>Elovl5</I> knock-out mice, SSE had a shorter duration, suggesting a role of Elovl5 in this form of synaptic plasticity. Accordingly, we show dramatic change in length and level of unsaturation of lipids in synaptosomes isolated from <I>Elovl5</I> knock-out mice. These results suggest that the shift in PUFA lipidic species caused by the absence of Elovl5, in the cerebellar cortex, is responsible for specific deficits in neurotransmitter release.</p>

                <p>The homophilic adhesion molecule Kirrel3 drives synapse formation between dentate granule (DG) neurons and GABA neurons, and Kirrel3 gene variants are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders in humans. However, the circuit function and behavioral relevance of Kirrel3-expressing neurons are unknown. Using intersectional genetics, we identified a population of Kirrel3-expressing GABA neurons that regulate memory discrimination in male and female mice. Using chemogenetics with in vivo electrophysiology and behavioral assays, we discovered that activating Kirrel3-expressing GABA neurons, but not parvalbumin neurons, potently inhibits CA3 neuron activity and impairs contextual memory discrimination during recall, revealing a critical role for these neurons in the retrieval of precise memories. Light and electron microscopy of Kirrel3-expressing GABA neurons suggests that they receive direct excitation from DG neurons and project onto CA3 dendrites. Together, this multiscale approach demonstrates how cell type-specific expression of adhesion molecules mark subsets of neurons that control key features guiding memory and behavior.</p>

Mechanistically, <I>miR-153</I> directly targeted Karyopherin alpha 5 (KPNA5), a nuclear transport protein that facilitates nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) nuclear translocation. <I>miR-153</I> suppressed <I>KPNA5</I> via two binding sites in its 3'UTR, impairing NRF2-mediated antioxidant responses and promoting oxidative stress, and KPNA5 bound to three nuclear localization sequences of NRF2 through protein interaction.

                <p>Olfactory dysfunction is a common outcome of brain injuries, negatively affecting quality of life. The adult mammalian nervous system has limited capacity for olfactory recovery, making it challenging to study olfactory regeneration and recovery. In contrast, zebrafish are ideal for such studies due to its extensive and lifelong regenerative abilities. In this work, we describe a model of excitotoxic injury in the olfactory bulb (OB) using quinolinic acid lesions in adult zebrafish of both sexes. We observed extensive neurodegeneration in both the OB and olfactory epithelium, including a reduction of bulbar volume, neuronal death, and impaired olfactory function. Recovery mechanisms involved tissue remodeling, cell proliferation, and neurogenesis, leading to full restoration of olfactory function by 21&nbsp;d. This study provides a model to further investigate the effects of excitotoxicity on olfactory dysfunction and highlights zebrafish's remarkable regenerative abilities, providing insights into potential therapeutic strategies for restoring olfactory function following brain injuries.</p>

During the COVID-19 pandemic non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) were taken to mitigate virus spread. Assessing their effectiveness is essential in policy support but often challenging, due to interactions between measures, the increase of immunity, variant emergence and seasonal effects. These factors make results difficult to interpret over a long period of time. Using a mechanistic approach, we estimate the overall effectiveness of sets of NPIs in reducing transmission over time. Our approach quantifies the effectiveness by comparing the observed effective reproduction number, which is the number of secondary infections caused by a typical infected person, to a counterfactual reproduction number if no NPIs were taken. The counterfactual reproduction number accounts for seasonal variations in transmissibility, for emergence of more transmissible variants, and for changes in immunity in the population. The immune fraction is reconstructed from age-specific data of longitudinal serological surveys and vaccination coverage, taking immunity loss due to waning into account. We estimate the effectiveness of NPIs in the Netherlands from the start of the pandemic in March 2020 until the emergence of the Omicron variant in November 2021. We find that the effectiveness of NPIs was high in March and April 2020 during the first pandemic wave and in January and February 2021, coinciding with the two periods with the most stringent measures. For both periods the effectiveness was estimated at approximately 50%, i.e., without any measures the reproduction number would have been twice as high as observed. The proposed approach synthesises available epidemiological data from different sources to reconstruct the population-level immunity. With sufficient data, it can be applied not only to COVID-19 but also to other directly transmitted diseases, such as influenza. This method provides a near real-time assessment of the effectiveness of control measures when the required data are available.

Nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequence from capsid protein of Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) binds to importin-<i>α</i> transport protein and clogs nuclear import. Prevention of viral NLS binding to importin-<i>α</i> may represent a viable therapeutic route. Here, we investigate the molecular mechanism by which two diffusively binding inhibitors, DP9 and DP9o, interfere with the binding of VEEV’s NLS peptide to importin-<i>α</i>. Our study uses all-atom replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations, which probe the competitive binding of the VEEV NLS fragment, the coreNLS peptide, and the inhibitors to importin-<i>α</i>. Our previous simulations of non-competitive binding of the coreNLS, in which it natively binds to importin-<i>α</i>, are used as a reference. Both inhibitors abrogate native peptide binding and reduce the fraction of its native interactions, but they fail to prevent its non-native binding to importin-<i>α</i>. As a result, these inhibitors turn the coreNLS into diffusive binder, which adopts a manifold of non-native binding poses. Competition from the inhibitors compromises the free energy of coreNLS binding to importin-<i>α</i> showing that they reduce its binding affinity. The inhibition mechanism is based on masking the native binding interactions formed by the coreNLS amino acids. Surprisingly, ligand interference with the binding interactions formed by importin-<i>α</i> amino acids contributes little to inhibition. We show that DP9 is a stronger inhibitor than DP9o. By comparative analysis of DP9 and DP9o interactions we determine the atomistic reason for a relative “success” of DP9, which is due to the intercalation of this inhibitor between the side chains of NLS lysine residues. To test our simulations, we performed AlphaScreen experiments measuring IC50 values for the inhibitors. AlphaScreen data confirmed <i>in silico</i> ranking of the inhibitors. By combining our recent studies, we discuss the putative mechanism by which diffusively binding inhibitors impact protein-protein interactions.

                <p>by Dennis N. Makau, Jonathan Arzt, Kimberly VanderWaal</p>

Accurately estimating cross-neutralization between serotype O foot-and-mouth disease viruses (FMDVs) is critical for guiding vaccine selection and disease management. In this study, we developed a machine learning approach to estimate r1 values—an established measure of antigenic similarity—using VP1 sequence data and published virus neutralization titer (VNT) results. Our dataset comprised 108 serum-virus pairs representing 73 distinct FMDV strains. We applied Boruta feature selection and random forest classifiers, optimizing model performance through tenfold cross-validation and sub-sampling to address class imbalance. Predictors included pairwise amino acid distances, site-specific polymorphisms, and differences in potential N-glycosylation sites. Using a 0.3 r1 threshold to define cross-neutralization, the final model achieved high accuracy (0.96), sensitivity (0.93), and specificity (0.96) in training, and performed robustly on independent test sets - accuracy was 0.75 (95% CI 0.60 and 0.90), F1 score 0.86% and PPV 0.77. Importantly, key VP1 residues—positions 48, 100, 135, 150, and 151—emerged as strong predictors of antigenic relationships. Our results demonstrate the utility of integrating routinely generated genomic data with machine learning to inform vaccine candidate selection and anticipate immune interactions among circulating FMDV strains. This approach offers a practical tool for accelerating vaccine decision-making and can be adapted to other FMDV serotypes. The latest version of the r<sub>1</sub> predictive model is available for access via a Shiny dashboard (https://dmakau.shinyapps.io/PredImmune-FMD/).

                <p>by Jiancheng Zhang, Xiangting Li, Xiaolu Guo, Zhaoyi You, Lucas Böttcher, Alex Mogilner, Alexander Hoffmann, Tom Chou, Mingtao Xia</p>

Proper regulation of cell signaling and gene expression is crucial for maintaining cellular function, development, and adaptation to environmental changes. Reaction dynamics in cell populations is often noisy because of (i) inherent stochasticity of intracellular biochemical reactions (“intrinsic noise”) and (ii) heterogeneity of cellular states across different cells that are influenced by external factors (“extrinsic noise”). In this work, we introduce an extrinsic-noise-driven neural stochastic differential equation (END-nSDE) framework that utilizes the Wasserstein distance to accurately reconstruct SDEs from stochastic trajectories measured across a heterogeneous population of cells (extrinsic noise). We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using both simulated and experimental data from three different systems in cell biology: (i) circadian rhythms, (ii) RPA-DNA binding dynamics, and (iii) NFκB signaling processes. Our END-nSDE reconstruction method can model how cellular heterogeneity (extrinsic noise) modulates reaction dynamics in the presence of intrinsic noise. It also outperforms existing time-series analysis methods such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and long short-term memory networks (LSTMs). By inferring cellular heterogeneities from data, our END-nSDE reconstruction method can reproduce noisy dynamics observed in experiments. In summary, the reconstruction method we propose offers a useful surrogate modeling approach for complex biophysical processes, where high-fidelity mechanistic models may be impractical.

                <p>by Xuwen Wang, Yanfang Guan, Wei Gao, Xin Lai, Wuqiang Cao, Xiaoyan Zhu, Xiaoling Zeng, Yuqian Liu, Shenjie Wang, Ruoyu Liu, Xin Yi, Shuanying Yang, Jiayin Wang</p>

Molecular residual disease (MRD) detection, initially developed for hematologic malignancies, has become a critical biomarker for monitoring solid tumors. MRD detection primarily relies on circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis using next-generation sequencing, offering high sensitivity and broad genomic coverage. However, challenges remain in designing cost-effective panels that maximize mutation detection while maintaining biological relevance. Fixed panels often lack sufficient patient-specific mutation coverage, while WES-based personalized MRD assays, despite their high sensitivity, are costly and less accessible. We developed a tumor comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP)-informed personalized MRD assay to detect tumor-derived mutations, which allowed us to design patient-specific personalized panels and meanwhile, provide a cost-effective alternative to whole exome sequencing (WES). To address these limitations, we developed MRDtarget, a heuristic multivariate Gaussian model-based targeted capture region selection method. By expanding beyond traditional hotspot regions, MRDtarget optimizes variant tracking for MRD detection, significantly improving sensitivity. Using a Bayesian inference-based heuristic approach, MRDtarget integrates multi-feature informativeness rates to identify optimal genomic regions for capture. Experimental results demonstrate that MRDtarget enables the detection of more variants per patient. This study underscores the importance of rational panel design to improve MRD sensitivity and provides a novel approach to enhance precision diagnostics and treatment for solid tumor patients.

                <p>by Pengcheng Lv, Dong Chen, Chao Zhang, Wei Duan, Pingping Lu, Kai Zhang, Liang Wang</p>

To execute goal-directed behavior, retrieval of both context and object information is crucial. Despite the ubiquity of such contextual computations in daily navigation, the neural mechanisms underlying this process in humans and its connection to behavior remain largely elusive. Leveraging intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recorded from epilepsy patients (<i>N</i> = 31) engaged in a context-dependent spatial navigation task, we uncovered distinct oscillatory patterns in the hippocampus (HC) and entorhinal cortex (EC) that represented context and object information, respectively. Notably, the covariation of these neural representations predicted behavioral performance. Furthermore, both representations were primarily driven by low-frequency oscillations (2–8 Hz). The synchronization of low-frequency oscillations between HC and EC was associated with enhanced object representations in the EC. These findings highlight the importance of low-frequency neural dynamics in mediating both local representations and interregional interactions within the hippocampal–entorhinal circuit during context-dependent spatial navigation.

Potassium ion (K<sup>+</sup>) dynamics are vital for various biological processes. However, the limited availability of detection tools for tracking intracellular and extracellular K<sup>+</sup> has impeded a comprehensive understanding of the physiological roles of K<sup>+</sup> in intact biological systems. In this study, we developed two novel red genetically encoded potassium indicators (RGEPOs), RGEPO1 and RGEPO2, through a combination of directed evolution in <i>Escherichia coli</i> and subsequent optimization in mammalian cells. RGEPO1, targeted to the extracellular membrane, and RGEPO2, localized in the cytoplasm, exhibited positive K<sup>+</sup>-specific fluorescence response with affinities of 3.55 and 14.81 mM in HEK293FT cells, respectively. We employed RGEPOs for real-time monitoring of subsecond K<sup>+</sup> dynamics in cultured neurons, astrocytes, acute brain slices, and the awake mouse in both intracellular and extracellular environments. Using RGEPOs, we were able, for the first time, to visualize intracellular and extracellular potassium transients during seizures in the brains of awake mice. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations provided new insights into the potassium-binding mechanisms of RGEPO1 and RGEPO2, revealing distinct K<sup>+</sup>-binding pockets and structural features. Thus, RGEPOs represent a significant advancement in potassium imaging, providing enhanced tools for real-time visualization of K<sup>+</sup> dynamics in various cell types and cellular environments.

                Nausea serves as a protective response against harmful ingested stimuli but can also be experienced as a discomforting aspect of various conditions. Recent insights have emerged regarding neural pathways and molecular mechanisms linked to this sensation. This often involves complex interactions of interoceptive neural pathways with the digestive, endocrine, and immune systems. This review summarizes recent findings using non-emetic (e.g., rodents) and emetic (e.g., ferrets, shrews, dogs) mammalian models to explore the molecular mechanisms of nausea, particularly in understudied malaise states. By investigating how nausea is triggered across different contexts, we aim to clarify the general sensory principles governing this response and to promote a shift in therapeutic research – from a top-down, observational paradigm to a bottom-up, mechanism-driven approach.

                In this issue of Neuron, Biane et al. used cellular-resolution recordings in ventral CA1 (vCA1) to comprehensively establish that it encodes stimulus features and identity, but not a generalized abstraction of valence. This suggests a complementary role of vCA1 to valence coding regions by providing stimulus-specific representations.

                In their recent study, Sasmita et al.1 reported that the parental origin of the 5xFAD (Tg6799) transgene substantially influences amyloid-β (Aβ) plaque deposition in this widely used amyloid model for this aspect of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology. Mice inheriting the transgene from the male parent exhibited approximately twice the plaque burden compared to those with maternal inheritance. This effect was consistent across multiple breeding colonies and independent of maternal care or in utero environment, indicating a robust and reproducible influence of parental origin on pathology.

                Ye et al. demonstrate a consistent developmental trajectory for variability in recurring brain state engagement (SEV) across four independent datasets (N > 3,000). SEV increases with age before plateauing in adolescence, with female participants reaching stabilization before male participants. SEV further predicts executive function (EF) in previously unseen individuals.

                This review examines how chronic opioid use reshapes medial ventral tegmental area circuits, increasing sensitivity to aversive stimuli, amplifying negative affect, and reinforcing withdrawal-avoidance behaviors that drive opioid misuse. It also explores how chronic pain may exacerbate these effects through heightened aversive signaling, further increasing misuse risk.

                Echeverry et al. show that Munc13-1 regulates insulin granule release via two C2B-domain dependent mechanisms: promoting Munc13-1 recruitment to granules and subsequent activation by Ca2+. The findings identify two separate Munc13-regulated mechanisms that act during granule priming and facilitation.

                Murata et al. show that in mouse diapause embryos, ∼5% of cells remain proliferative beyond D10, overturning the view that all embryonic cells uniformly enter G0. The p53-Bax pathway regulates epiblast cell numbers via apoptosis, and epiblast cell counts predict reactivation, a defining trait of diapause.

                Prakash and Inamdar show that mitochondrial remodeling during the endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition (EHT) drives hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) formation. Differential mitochondrial membrane potential governs HSPC heterogeneity, impacting their fate and lineage choice. Mitochondrial activity during EHT shapes postnatal hematopoietic homeostasis and reveals a developmental origin of HSPC heterogeneity.

                Intestinal pathogens employ different mechanisms to facilitate their infection and colonization in the intestines. Wang et al. demonstrate that Shigella sonnei elevates intracellular levels of cAMP by responding to bile salts. The cAMP signaling system then modulates c-di-GMP biosynthesis to promote fitness and pathogenicity of S. sonnei.
