              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16216">Topological decoding of grid cell activity via path lifting to covering spaces</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.16216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-dimensional neural activity often reside in a low-dimensional subspace, referred to as neural manifolds. Grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex provide a periodic spatial code that are organized near a toroidal manifold, independent of the spatial environment. Due to the periodic nature of its code, it is unclear how the brain utilizes the toroidal manifold to understand its state in a spatial environment. We introduce a novel framework that decodes spatial information from grid cell activity using topology. Our approach uses topological data analysis to extract toroidal coordinates from grid cell population activity and employs path-lifting to reconstruct trajectories in physical space. The reconstructed paths differ from the original by an affine transformation. We validated the method on both continuous attractor network simulations and experimental recordings of grid cells, demonstrating that local trajectories can be reliably reconstructed from a single grid cell module without external position information or training data. These results suggest that co-modular grid cells contain sufficient information for path integration and suggest a potential computational mechanism for spatial navigation.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17154">A Minimal Quantitative Model of Perceptual Suppression and Breakthrough in Visual Rivalry</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.17154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When conflicting images are presented to either eye, binocular fusion is disrupted. Rather than experiencing a blend of both percepts, often only one eye's image is experienced, whilst the other is suppressed from awareness. Importantly, suppression is transient - the two rival images compete for dominance, with stochastic switches between mutually exclusive percepts occurring every few seconds with law-like regularity. From the perspective of dynamical systems theory, visual rivalry offers an experimentally tractable window into the dynamical mechanisms governing perceptual awareness. In a recently developed visual rivalry paradigm - tracking continuous flash suppression (tCFS) - it was shown that the transition between awareness and suppression is hysteretic, with a higher contrast threshold required for a stimulus to breakthrough suppression into awareness than to be suppressed from awareness. Here, we present an analytically-tractable model of visual rivalry that quantitatively explains the hysteretic transition between periods of awareness and suppression in tCFS. Grounded in the theory of neural dynamics, we derive closed-form expressions for the duration of perceptual dominance and suppression, and for the degree of hysteresis (i.e. the depth of perceptual suppression), as a function of model parameters. Finally, our model yields a series of novel behavioural predictions, the first of which - distributions of dominance and suppression durations during tCFS should be approximately equal - we empirically validate in human psychophysical data.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17492">A theory for self-sustained balanced states in absence of strong external currents</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.17492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recurrent neural networks with balanced excitation and inhibition exhibit irregular asynchronous dynamics, which is fundamental for cortical computations. Classical balance mechanisms require strong external inputs to sustain finite firing rates, raising concerns about their biological plausibility. Here, we investigate an alternative mechanism based on short-term synaptic depression (STD) acting on excitatory-excitatory synapses, which dynamically balances the network activity without the need of external inputs. By employing numerical simulations and theoretical investigations we characterize the dynamics of a massively coupled network made up of $N$ rate-neuron models. Depending on the synaptic strength $J_0$, the network exhibits two distinct regimes: at sufficiently small $J_0$, it converges to a homogeneous fixed point, while for sufficiently large $J_0$, it exhibits Rate Chaos. For finite networks, we observe several different routes to chaos depending on the network realization. The width of the transition region separating the homogeneous stable solution from Rate Chaos appears to shrink for increasing $N$ and eventually to vanish in the thermodynamic limit. The characterization of the Rate Chaos regime performed by employing Dynamical Mean Field approaches allow us on one side to confirm that this novel balancing mechanism is able to sustain finite irregular activity even in the thermodynamic limit, and on the other side to reveal that the balancing occurs via dynamic cancellation of the input correlations generated by the massive coupling. Our findings show that STD provides an intrinsic self-regulating mechanism for balanced networks, sustaining irregular yet stable activity without the need of biologically unrealistic inputs. This work extends the balanced network paradigm, offering insights into how cortical circuits could maintain robust dynamics via synaptic adaptation.

                arXiv:2510.17593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Hopfield-type associative memory models, memories are stored in the connectivity matrix and can be retrieved subsequently thanks to the collective dynamics of the network. In these models, the retrieval of a particular memory can be hampered by overlaps between the network state and other memories, termed spurious overlaps since these overlaps collectively introduce noise in the retrieval process. In classic models, spurious overlaps increase the variance of synaptic inputs but do not affect the mean. We show here that in models equipped with a learning rule inferred from neurobiological data, spurious overlaps collectively reduce the mean synaptic inputs to neurons, and that this mean reduction causes in turn an increase in storage capacity through a sparsening of network activity. Our paper demonstrates a link between a specific feature of experimentally inferred plasticity rules and network storage capacity.

                arXiv:2311.06928v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the potential of the transformer models for learning Granger causality in networks with complex nonlinear dynamics at every node, as in neurobiological and biophysical networks. Our study primarily focuses on a proof-of-concept investigation based on simulated neural dynamics, for which the ground-truth causality is known through the underlying connectivity matrix. For transformer models trained to forecast neuronal population dynamics, we show that the cross attention module effectively captures the causal relationship among neurons, with an accuracy equal or superior to that for the most popular Granger causality analysis method. While we acknowledge that real-world neurobiology data will bring further challenges, including dynamic connectivity and unobserved variability, this research offers an encouraging preliminary glimpse into the utility of the transformer model for causal representation learning in neuroscience.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15947">WaveNet's Precision in EEG Classification</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2510.15947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a WaveNet-based deep learning model designed to automate the classification of EEG signals into physiological, pathological, artifact, and noise categories. Traditional methods for EEG signal classification, which rely on expert visual review, are becoming increasingly impractical due to the growing complexity and volume of EEG recordings. Leveraging a publicly available annotated dataset from Mayo Clinic and St. Anne's University Hospital, the WaveNet model was trained, validated, and tested on 209,232 samples with a 70/20/10 percent split. The model achieved a classification accuracy exceeding previous CNN and LSTM-based approaches, and was benchmarked against a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) baseline. Notably, the model distinguishes noise and artifacts with high precision, although it reveals a modest but explainable degree of misclassification between physiological and pathological signals, reflecting inherent clinical overlap. WaveNet's architecture, originally developed for raw audio synthesis, is well suited for EEG data due to its use of dilated causal convolutions and residual connections, enabling it to capture both fine-grained and long-range temporal dependencies. The research also details the preprocessing pipeline, including dynamic dataset partitioning and normalization steps that support model generalization.

                arXiv:2510.16327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the human brain, the allowed patterns of activity are constrained by the correlations between brain regions. Yet it remains unclear which correlations -- and how many -- are needed to predict large-scale neural activity. Here, we present an information-theoretic framework to identify the most important correlations, which provide the most accurate predictions of neural states. Applying our framework to cortical activity in humans, we discover that the vast majority of variance in activity is explained by a small number of correlations. This means that the brain is highly compressible: only a sparse network of correlations is needed to predict large-scale activity. We find that this compressibility is strikingly consistent across different individuals and cognitive tasks, and that, counterintuitively, the most important correlations are not necessarily the strongest. Together, these results suggest that nearly all correlations are not needed to predict neural activity, and we provide the tools to uncover the key correlations that are.

                arXiv:2505.22893v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding how cortex, subcortex and cerebellum integrate is a major challenge for neuroscience, however, studies of the brain's structural connectivity have mostly focused on cortico-cortical links. Here, we used diffusion imaging to construct the structural connectome of the entire human brain including 360 cortical, 233 subcortical, and 125 cerebellar regions of interest (ROIs). We found that the brain forms a modular and hierarchical network architecture, organized into modules of mixed cortical, subcortical and/or cerebellar regions, and whose cross-modular pathways are centralized through highly connected hub ROIs (a `rich-club'). This global rich-club is subcortically dominated and, surprisingly, composed of hub ROIs from all subcortical structures rather than one region like the thalamus, centralizing the communication pathways. This study improves our understanding of the human brain's organization. It provides structural evidence to question the prevalent cortico-centric notion by revealing a connectome centered at the subcortex but made of transversal pathways.

                arXiv:2509.07237v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Normative modelling is an increasingly common statistical technique in neuroimaging that estimates population-level benchmarks in brain structure. It enables the quantification of individual deviations from expected distributions whilst accounting for biological and technical covariates without requiring large, matched control groups. This makes it a powerful alternative to traditional case-control studies for identifying brain structural alterations associated with pathology. Despite the availability of numerous modelling approaches and several toolboxes with pre-trained models, the distinct strengths and limitations of normative modelling make it difficult to determine how and when to implement them appropriately. This review offers practical guidance and outlines statistical considerations for clinical researchers using normative modelling in neuroimaging. Through a worked example using clinical epilepsy data, we outline considerations for responsible implementation of pre-trained normative models, to support their broad and rigorous adoption in neuroimaging research.

                arXiv:2407.01656v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Abstraction is the process of extracting the essential features from raw data while ignoring irrelevant details. It is well known that abstraction emerges with depth in neural networks, where deep layers capture abstract characteristics of data by combining lower level features encoded in shallow layers (e.g. edges). Yet we argue that depth alone is not enough to develop truly abstract representations. We advocate that the level of abstraction crucially depends on how broad the training set is. We address the issue within a renormalisation group approach where a representation is expanded to encompass a broader set of data. We take the unique fixed point of this transformation -- the Hierarchical Feature Model -- as a candidate for a representation which is absolutely abstract. This theoretical picture is tested in numerical experiments based on Deep Belief Networks and auto-encoders trained on data of different breadth. These show that representations in neural networks approach the Hierarchical Feature Model as the data get broader and as depth increases, in agreement with theoretical predictions.

                arXiv:2510.16406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emotional stress often has a significant effect on the working performance of staff, but this effect is commonly neglected in existing staff scheduling methods. We study a call-center staff scheduling problem, which considers the evolution of work performance of staff under emotional stress. First, we present an emotional stress driven model that estimates the working performance of call-center employees based on not only skill levels but also emotional states. On the basis of the model, we formulate a combined short-term and long-term call-center staff scheduling problem aiming at maximizing the customer service level, which depends on the working performance of employees. We then propose a memetic optimization algorithm combining global mutation and neighborhood search assisted by deep reinforcement learning to efficiently solve this problem. Experimental results on real-world problem instances of bank call-center staff scheduling demonstrate the performance advantages of the proposed method over selected popular staff scheduling methods. By explicitly modeling and incorporating emotional stress, our method reflects a more realistic understanding and utilization of human behavior in staff scheduling.

Abstract: In this paper, a novel bio-inspired optimization algorithm is proposed, called Bombardier Beetle Optimizer (BBO). This type of species is very intelligent, which has an ability to defense and escape from predators. The principles of the former one is inspired by the defense mechanism of Bombardier Beetle against the predators, which the Bombardier Beetle triggers a toxic chemical spray when it feels threatened. This reaction occurs in a specialized reaction chamber inside its abdomen and includes a well regulated enzymatic mechanism, which comprises hot water vapor, oxygen, and irritating substances like p-benzoquinones. In addition, the proposed BBO simulates also the escape mechanism of Bombardier Beetle from predator, which it has the ability to calculate its distance from predator and it can fly away. The BBO is tested with optimizing Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC 2017) test bed suites. Moreover, it is compared against well-known metaheuristic optimization algorithms includes Chernobyl Disaster Optimizer (CDO), Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Bermuda Triangle Optimizer (BTO), Sperm Swarm Optimization (SSO) and Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA). The outcomes of this paper prove the BBO's efficiency in which outperforms the other algorithms in terms of convergence rate and quality of results.

Abstract: We present a Cortical Neural Pool (CNP) architecture featuring a high-speed, resource-efficient CORDIC-based Hodgkin Huxley (RCHH) neuron model. Unlike shared CORDIC-based DNN approaches, the proposed neuron leverages modular and performance-optimised CORDIC stages with a latency-area trade-off. The FPGA implementation of the RCHH neuron shows 24.5% LUT reduction and 35.2% improved speed, compared to SoTA designs, with 70% better normalised root mean square error (NRMSE). Furthermore, the CNP exhibits 2.85x higher throughput (12.69 GOPS) compared to a functionally equivalent CORDIC-based DNN engine, with only a 0.35% accuracy drop compared to the DNN counterpart on the MNIST dataset. The overall results indicate that the design shows biologically accurate, low-resource spiking neural network implementations for resource-constrained edge AI applications.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have sparse, event driven processing that can leverage neuromorphic applications. In this work, we introduce a multi-threading kernel that enables neuromorphic applications running at the edge, meaning they process sensory input directly and without any up-link to or dependency on a cloud service. The kernel shows speed-up gains over single thread processing by a factor of four on moderately sized SNNs and 1.7X on a Synfire network. Furthermore, it load-balances all cores available on multi-core processors, such as ARM, which run today's mobile devices and is up to 70% more energy efficient compared to statical core assignment. The present work can enable the development of edge applications that have low Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP), and can prototype the integration of neuromorphic chips.

Abstract: This paper introduces Direct Simplified Symbolic Analysis (DSSA), a new method for simplifying analog circuits. Unlike traditional matrix- or graph-based techniques that are often slow and memory-intensive, DSSA treats the task as a modeling problem and directly extracts the most significant transfer function terms. By combining Monte Carlo simulation with a genetic algorithm, it minimizes error between simplified symbolic and exact numeric expressions. Tests on five circuits in MATLAB show strong performance, with only 0.64 dB average and 1.36 dB maximum variation in dc-gain, along with a 6.8% average pole/zero error. These results highlight DSSA as an efficient and accurate tool for symbolic circuit analysis.

                arXiv:2510.15921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cross-market portfolio optimization has become increasingly complex with the globalization of financial markets and the growth of high-frequency, multi-dimensional datasets. Traditional artificial neural networks, while effective in certain portfolio management tasks, often incur substantial computational overhead and lack the temporal processing capabilities required for large-scale, multi-market data. This study investigates the application of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) for cross-market portfolio optimization, leveraging neuromorphic computing principles to process equity data from both the Indian (Nifty 500) and US (S&P 500) markets. A five-year dataset comprising approximately 1,250 trading days of daily stock prices was systematically collected via the Yahoo Finance API. The proposed framework integrates Leaky Integrate-andFire neuron dynamics with adaptive thresholding, spike-timingdependent plasticity, and lateral inhibition to enable event-driven processing of financial time series. Dimensionality reduction is achieved through hierarchical clustering, while populationbased spike encoding and multiple decoding strategies support robust portfolio construction under realistic trading constraints, including cardinality limits, transaction costs, and adaptive risk aversion. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that the SNN-based framework delivers superior risk-adjusted returns and reduced volatility compared to ANN benchmarks, while substantially improving computational efficiency. These findings highlight the promise of neuromorphic computation for scalable, efficient, and robust portfolio optimization across global financial markets.

                arXiv:2510.15930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Implementing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) has emerged as a promising alternative to GPUs, offering lower latency, greater power efficiency and greater flexibility. However, this development remains complex due to the hardware knowledge required and the long synthesis, placement and routing stages, which slow down design cycles and prevent rapid exploration of network configurations, making resource optimisation under severe constraints particularly challenging. This paper proposes a library of configurable convolution Blocks designed to optimize FPGA implementation and adapt to available resources. It also presents a methodological framework for developing mathematical models that predict FPGA resources utilization. The approach is validated by analyzing the correlation between the parameters, followed by error metrics. The results show that the designed blocks enable adaptation of convolution layers to hardware constraints, and that the models accurately predict resource consumption, providing a useful tool for FPGA selection and optimized CNN deployment.

                arXiv:2510.16851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ever-increasing scale of modern neural networks has brought unprecedented performance alongside daunting challenges in efficiency and interpretability. This paper addresses the core question of how to build large neural systems that learn efficient, modular, and interpretable representations. We propose Neuronal Group Communication (NGC), a theory-driven framework that reimagines a neural network as a dynamical system of interacting neuronal groups rather than a monolithic collection of neural weights. Instead of treating each weight as an independent trainable parameter, NGC treats weights as transient interactions between embedding-like neuronal states, with neural computation unfolding through iterative communication among groups of neurons. This low-rank, modular representation yields compact models: groups of neurons exchange low-dimensional signals, enabling intra-group specialization and inter-group information sharing while dramatically reducing redundant parameters. By drawing on dynamical systems theory, we introduce a neuronal stability metric (analogous to Lyapunov stability) that quantifies the contraction of neuron activations toward stable patterns during sequence processing. Using this metric, we reveal that emergent reasoning capabilities correspond to an external driving force or ``potential'', which nudges the neural dynamics away from trivial trajectories while preserving stability. Empirically, we instantiate NGC in large language models (LLMs) and demonstrate improved performance on complex reasoning benchmarks under moderate compression. NGC consistently outperforms standard low-rank approximations and cross-layer basis-sharing methods at comparable compression rates. We conclude by discussing the broader implications of NGC, including how structured neuronal group dynamics might relate to generalization in high-dimensional learning systems.

Abstract: Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) is of paramount importance in the development of high-performance, specialized artificial intelligence (AI) models, ranging from well-established machine learning (ML) solutions to the deep learning (DL) domain and the field of spiking neural networks (SNNs). The latter introduce further complexity due to the neuronal computational units and their additional hyperparameters, whose inadequate setting can dramatically impact the final model performance. At the cost of possible reduced generalization capabilities, the most suitable strategy to fully disclose the power of SNNs is to adopt an application-oriented approach and perform extensive HPO experiments. To facilitate these operations, automatic pipelines are fundamental, and their configuration is crucial. In this document, the Neural Network Intelligence (NNI) toolkit is used as reference framework to present one such solution, with a use case example providing evidence of the corresponding results. In addition, a summary of published works employing the presented pipeline is reported as a potential source of insights into application-oriented HPO experiments for SNN prototyping.

Abstract: Spiking neural network (SNN) has emerged as a promising paradigm in computational neuroscience and artificial intelligence, offering advantages such as low energy consumption and small memory footprint. However, their practical adoption is constrained by several challenges, prominently among them being performance optimization. In this study, we present a novel approach to enhance the performance of SNN for images through a new coding method that exploits bit plane representation. Our proposed technique is designed to improve the accuracy of SNN without increasing model size. Also, we investigate the impacts of color models of the proposed coding process. Through extensive experimental validation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our coding strategy in achieving performance gain across multiple datasets. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first research that considers bit planes and color models in the context of SNN. By leveraging the unique characteristics of bit planes, we hope to unlock new potentials in SNNs performance, potentially paving the way for more efficient and effective SNNs models in future researches and applications.

                arXiv:2412.02482v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In modern deep neural networks, the learning dynamics of the individual neurons is often obscure, as the networks are trained via global optimization. Conversely, biological systems build on self-organized, local learning, achieving robustness and efficiency with limited global information. We here show how self-organization between individual artificial neurons can be achieved by designing abstract bio-inspired local learning goals. These goals are parameterized using a recent extension of information theory, Partial Information Decomposition (PID), which decomposes the information that a set of information sources holds about an outcome into unique, redundant and synergistic contributions. Our framework enables neurons to locally shape the integration of information from various input classes, i.e. feedforward, feedback, and lateral, by selecting which of the three inputs should contribute uniquely, redundantly or synergistically to the output. This selection is expressed as a weighted sum of PID terms, which, for a given problem, can be directly derived from intuitive reasoning or via numerical optimization, offering a window into understanding task-relevant local information processing. Achieving neuron-level interpretability while enabling strong performance using local learning, our work advances a principled information-theoretic foundation for local learning strategies.

Abstract: When different objectives conflict with each other in multi-task learning, gradients begin to interfere and slow convergence, thereby potentially reducing the final model's performance. To address this, we introduce SON-GOKU, a scheduler that computes gradient interference, constructs an interference graph, and then applies greedy graph-coloring to partition tasks into groups that align well with each other. At each training step, only one group (color class) of tasks are activated, and the grouping partition is constantly recomputed as task relationships evolve throughout training. By ensuring that each mini-batch contains only tasks that pull the model in the same direction, our method improves the effectiveness of any underlying multi-task learning optimizer without additional tuning. Since tasks within these groups will update in compatible directions, multi-task learning will improve model performance rather than impede it. Empirical results on six different datasets show that this interference-aware graph-coloring approach consistently outperforms baselines and state-of-the-art multi-task optimizers. We provide extensive theory showing why grouping and sequential updates improve multi-task learning, with guarantees on descent, convergence, and accurately identifying what tasks conflict or align.

                <p>Sensory attenuation of auditory evoked potentials (AEPs), particularly N1 and P2 components, has been widely demonstrated in response to simple, repetitive stimuli sequences of isolated synthetic sounds. It remains unclear, however, whether these effects generalize to complex soundscapes where temporal and acoustic features vary more broadly and dynamically. In this study, we investigated whether the inter-onset interval (IOI), the time between successive sound events, modulates AEP amplitudes in a complex auditory scene. We derived acoustic onsets from a naturalistic soundscape and applied temporal response function (TRF) analysis to electroencephalography data recorded from normal hearing human listeners (<I>N</I> = 22, 16 females, 6 males). Our results showed that shorter IOIs are associated with attenuated N1 and P2 amplitudes, replicating classical adaptation effects in a naturalistic soundscape. These effects remained stable when controlling for other acoustic features such as intensity and envelope sharpness and across different TRF model specifications. Integrating IOI information into predictive modeling revealed that neural dynamics were captured more effectively than simpler onset models when training data were matched. These findings highlight the brain&rsquo;s sensitivity to temporal structure even in highly variable auditory environments, and show that classical lab findings generalize to naturalistic soundscapes. Our results underscore the need to include temporal features alongside acoustic ones in models of real-world auditory processing.</p>

                <p>Puerto Rico's cultural identity, shaped by Ta&iacute;no heritage, Spanish colonization, and US governance, emphasizes family, music, food, and collective participation. Drawing on these traditions, we developed NeuroBoricuas, a grassroots neuroscience education movement that reimagines outreach through cultural metaphors of parrandas and peer teaching. What began as a reflection on conventional Brain Awareness Week evolved into student-led demonstrations, the creation of the first neuroscience laboratory in a Puerto Rican high school, and a network of university chapters and high school clubs across the Island. These groups lead workshops, classroom visits, and community events, positioning students as both learners and teachers of neuroscience. A partnership with Backyard Brains provided affordable, hands-on tools that made neuroscience tangible for K-12 and university students, while events such as Explora tu Cerebro en la SanSe integrated science into Puerto Rico's most iconic cultural festival. To extend beyond outreach, the Bravo Lab Immersive Summer Program (BLISP) was launched in 2022, immersing undergraduates in advanced approaches including optogenetics, fiber photometry, and behavioral assays. BLISP emphasizes mentoring and peer-to-peer training, building confidence and scientific identity while creating pathways to graduate training. Recent collaborations, including NeuroBridges with the University of California, Irvine, have further expanded opportunities for Puerto Rican students through international partnerships. Together, NeuroBoricuas and BLISP demonstrate a scalable model of science education rooted in culture, identity, and community. Like a parranda, this movement grows as new voices join in, showing that neuroscience thrives when it is shared, celebrated, and carried forward collectively.</p>

                Background Educational initiatives could foster the adoption of open science (OS) and responsible research practices (RRPs). This single group pre-post study evaluated the impact of an educational intervention on increasing the adherence, knowledge and perceptions about adopting OS practices and RRPs among graduate researchers at a Brazilian University. Methods Graduate students from a southern Brazilian university were invited to participate in a course addressing OS and RRPs. The intervention was an online interactive course on OS and RRPs. The number of OS outputs, including Open Science Framework (OSF) accounts, study registrations, protocols, analysis plans, data sets, preprints, and the number of projects published by each participant were collected before and after the intervention. Additionally, a self-administered online questionnaire was applied before and after the intervention to evaluate participants’ perceptions on RRPs, OS practices and on the current researchers’ evaluation system. Results Eighty-four students finished the course and 80 agreed to participate in the study. The number of OSF accounts increased from 7 to 78 after the course, and the number of projects increased from 7 to 10, six months after the intervention. No registrations, protocols, analysis plans, data sets, or preprints were found after 6 and 12 months, respectively. The participants’ perceptions of the current research evaluation system and on the OS practices and RRPs changed positively with the intervention. Also, the intention to adopt practices like registration, protocol and preprint publications has noticeably increased after the course. Conclusions The number of participants’ OSF outputs showed little or no improvement after the intervention. The most important impact difference could be identified in terms of the participants’ perceptions and intentions to adhere to such practices in the future.

                Background As the field of bioinformatics continues to expand, the need for effective education and training becomes increasingly pressing. Despite global efforts to make bioinformatics education more inclusive, challenges remain in ensuring accessibility and linguistic diversity. A major barrier is the predominance of English-only resources, which can limit participation and learning outcomes among non-English-speaking communities. Methods This study investigated how linguistic accessibility affects learning outcomes in bioinformatics training. A two-day virtual and asynchronous workshop was hosted on the Gallantries platform under the Galaxy Training Network. Participants, primarily native Spanish speakers, were randomly assigned to one of three language conditions: human-translated Spanish materials, English materials, or machine-translated Spanish materials. Data were collected through pre- and post-workshop surveys focusing on demographics, English proficiency, language preference, and learning outcomes. Quantitative data were analyzed descriptively, and associations between English proficiency and language preference were tested using Pearson’s Chi-Square. Qualitative feedback from participants was examined through thematic analysis to identify key learning and engagement patterns. Results Findings reveal that linguistic familiarity plays a critical role in learner confidence and comprehension. Participants expressed a clear preference for materials available in their native language, underscoring the need for culturally and linguistically relevant educational resources. The analysis also identified key limitations in current translation practices used in scientific education, particularly in conveying specialized terminology accurately and naturally across languages. Conclusions The study highlights the importance of developing multilingual and culturally adapted bioinformatics resources to foster equitable access to training. Incorporating linguistic diversity into bioinformatics education has the potential to improve learner engagement and support the growth of a more globally inclusive scientific community.

                Introduction Acute severe ulcerative colitis (ASUC) is a medical emergency associated with high morbidity and around 1% mortality. Left-sided colitis (LSC) is a subtype of ulcerative colitis that requires timely multidisciplinary management, often involving gastroenterologists and colorectal surgeons. When corticosteroids and rescue therapies such as infliximab or cyclosporine fail, surgery is frequently indicated. Operative options include total proctocolectomy with ileal pouch–anal anastomosis (TPC-IPAA), total proctocolectomy with ileostomy (TPC-I), total abdominal colectomy (TAC), and subtotal colectomy (STC). In the United Kingdom, STC is the most common emergency operation, but it may not be optimal for patients with left-sided disease. This review aimed to determine the most appropriate surgical approach for acute LSC. Methods A systematic review was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Searches of Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Scopus identified studies published between 2001 and 1 November 2023. Eligible studies involved adult patients with LSC refractory to medical therapy who underwent surgery. Primary outcomes were patient-centred measures; secondary outcomes included short- and long-term surgical results. Studies on medical management alone, isolated proctitis, rectal cancer, non-human subjects, or non-English publications were excluded. Screening and data extraction were performed independently by two reviewers, with plans for GRADE assessment and meta-analysis if data permitted. Results Of 6,606 records screened, no study met full inclusion criteria. Six related studies were narratively reviewed. Outcomes were mixed: TAC was associated with higher complications in some studies but lower infection rates than TPC in others. Segmental colectomy carried a 35% reoperation rate and 4.2% mortality. Conclusion Evidence is insufficient to define the optimal emergency surgical strategy for acute LSC. While TAC remains the standard approach, its suitability for this subset is unclear. Disease-specific research is urgently needed. Registration: PROSPERO CRD42023473654.

                Cardiovascular diseases driven by hyperlipidemia are leading causes of death globally, with low- and middle-income countries carrying a disproportionate burden. Although statins continue to be the cornerstone of cholesterol therapy, unmet demands are sustained by cost, intolerance, and residual risk, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. When made as standardized extracts, Catha edulis, which has long been controversial due to its psychotropic alkaloids, is being explored more and more for its effects on metabolism. Improvements in lipid profiles (decreased low density lipoprotein-cholesterol and triglycerides, and increased high density lipoprotein-cholesterol), regulation of adipokines (decreased leptin and increased adiponectin) in high-fat diet animals are reported in preclinical study with lyophilized leaf extract. Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry and molecular docking implicate non-alkaloid phytochemicals that bind lipid-regulating targets, showing statin-like interactions with HMG-CoA Reductase. However, regular khat chewing is also linked to hepatic and cardiovascular problems in clinical and case-series research, highlighting an important difference between recreational exposures and regulated, standardized medication formulations. Standardization of extract manufacturing, regulatory pathways that distinguish medicinal from recreational use, ethically sound clinical trials, pharmacovigilance, and culturally sensitive communication are some of the policy options for African health systems that are outlined in this brief, which also summarizes the scientific evidence and clarifies the risks and benefits. With strict protections, Catha edulis may transform from a public health risk to a focused adjuvant in the treatment of dyslipidemia, particularly in areas where access to cutting-edge lipid-lowering medications is still a problem.

                The performance of women led SMEs is shaped by strategic factors that foster competitiveness and long-term sustainability, yet their effectiveness is often diminished by persistent socio-cultural barriers. This narrative review examines how such barriers influence the relationship between strategic factors including innovation, market positioning, risk management, and access to resources and the performance of women led SMEs across different cultural contexts. Drawing on peer reviewed articles published between 2015 and 2025, and using thematic analysis, the review finds that rigid gender norms, societal attitudes, levels of education, religious beliefs, family responsibilities, and institutional structures significantly reduce the impact of business strategies by limiting women’s decision-making power. These socio-cultural constraints also hinder women’s ability to engage with business networks and institutions, which are essential for driving business growth. The findings highlight the importance of developing context sensitive policies and culturally informed strategies to strengthen women’s strategic capabilities while addressing structural limitations. Embedding socio cultural awareness into enterprise development would support policy makers in crafting inclusive strategies that promote sustainable growth for women led SMEs.

                Background Despite increasing interest in changing and improving play opportunities in schools, there is lack of openly available methods for evaluating play quantitatively. Existing measures often focus on physical activity during play activities or prioritise the mapping of locations within which play occurs rather than evaluating play itself. Methods This paper introduces the Multidimensional Toolkit for the Assessment of Play in Schools (M-TAPS) and provides the results of an initial study examining the utility and reliability of the toolkit. The M-TAPS includes observations of individual children and scan observations of predefined areas of the playground; children’s activities, adventure/risk level and affect are coded. In addition, the M-TAPS includes child self-report questionnaires about emotions during playtime and playtime activities. Results The reliability study provided evidence of good reliability between coders and for children’s self-report of their emotions during playtime. There was some indication of validity between child self-report and coder observation. Conclusions The paper suggests that the M-TAPS may be useful for research focused on improving children’s play in schools where a quantitative measure is sought. The M-TAPS provides a flexible tool for supporting researchers with the results highlighting how the M-TAPS can provide insights into schools playtimes and how observation can be combined with children’s self-report. There is room for further development and refinement of the toolkit.

                Introduction Amyloidosis is a systemic disease caused by amyloid chain deposition. The thyroid is a very uncommon location. The prevalence of amyloid goiter is estimated to be 0.17. Cases presentation We report three cases of amyloid goiter (AG). Three men, aged between 30 and 42 years, were hospitalized in the medical department. Compressive signs were present in one patient. All the patients had normal thyroid hormone levels. Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA) revealed amyloid deposition in one case. All the patients underwent total thyroidectomy. All patients underwent surgery without complications and were treated with L thyroxine replacement therapy. A pathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of AG. A literature review was conducted using PubMed from 2019 to 2024. Conclusion Amyloid deposition is rarely associated with thyroid dysfunction. The discovery circumstance is generally thyroid enlargement and may be associated with compressive signs. Compressive and rapid enlargement of the thyroid may be an indication for surgery. FNA is generally less informative than core biopsy and surgery . Thyroidectomy is a therapeutic and diagnostic procedure. Clinicians should consider amyloid deposition in front of a growing goiter, particularly when systemic amyloidosis is known.

                Background Pilot errors and preconditions are major concerns that affected by multiple factors physiologically, psychologically and psychosocially. This study aimed to analyse the correlation between the internal and external risk factors, and pilot preconditions in Indonesia. Methods A cross-sectional study design with purposive sampling, directed to male pilots who had flight duty in the past seven days, underwent medical examination at the Aviation Medical Center, Jakarta, August 12–16, 2024. The data were collected through a self-report questionnaire, Trail Making Test A and B, laboratory tests (plasma lipid, fasting blood glucose), and physical measurements (height, weight, waist circumference, and blood pressure). The independent variables divided into internal factors (Age, Burnout, Metabolic Syndrome parameters); and external factors (Flight Time, Duty Time, Unscheduled Flight Duty, Number of Sectors, Sleep Duration). The dependent variables were pilot preconditions based on the Human Factor Analysis and Classification System (HFACS). Results A total of 122 participants participated and 28.7% had an Unscheduled Flight Duty in the last 30 days. Significant correlations were found between Adverse Mental State and HDL-Cholesterol (95%CI=1.52–5.80), Adverse Physiological State and Burnout [Personal (95%CI=0.005–0,04), Work-Related (95%CI=0.009–0.042)], Physical Mental Limitation and Fasting Blood Glucose (95%CI=(-0.479)–(-0.071)), Number of Sectors (95%CI=0.022–3.001). For Personal Readiness (PR), significant correlation was found between PR-Psychological Demand and Flight-Time One Year (95%CI=(0.000–0.001), Sleep Duration (95%CI=(-0.137)–(-0.013)), Waist Circumference (95%CI=(-0.014)–(-0.002)), PR-Social Support and Sleep Duration (95%IK=0.018–0.207), Client-Related Burnout (95%IK=(-0.011)–(-0.002)). Conclusions The internal factors that correlated with pilot preconditions in Indonesia were Waist Circumference, HDL-Cholesterol, Fasting Blood Glucose, Personal Burnout, Work, and Client-related burnout. External factors that correlated with pilot preconditions were the Number of Sectors, Flight-Time One Year and Sleep duration. These findings emphasize the need to address physical and mental health aspects of pilots to enhance aviation safety.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1139/v1?src=rss">Assessing the Impact of Social Culture and National Regulations on Women’s Engagement in Logistics Decision-Making in Uganda [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Women remain underrepresented in leadership within Uganda’s logistics sector, despite national commitments to gender equality. This study examines how national regulations and laws and social culture shape women’s engagement in decision-making, and whether regulations mediate culture’s influence. Methods A quantitative cross-sectional survey was administered to 298 logistics professionals sampled from private logistics companies, industry associations, and regulatory bodies. Using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM), we assessed reliability/validity of constructs and tested direct and mediated relationships among social culture, national regulations and laws, and women’s engagement in decision-making (WEDM). Model fit and predictive relevance were evaluated (e.g., SRMR, R2, Q2). Results National regulations and laws had a positive, statistically significant effect on WEDM (β = 0.036, p = 0.002), underscoring the role of formal legal frameworks in advancing women’s leadership. Social culture showed no significant direct effect on WEDM (β = 0.002, p = 0.942). However, culture negatively influenced regulations (β = −0.265, p < 0.001), and a significant indirect (mediated) pathway from social culture to WEDM via regulations was detected (β = −0.008, p = 0.039), indicating full mediation. Correlations mirrored these patterns (national regulations–WEDM r = 0.377, p < 0.001; social culture–WEDM r = −0.224, p < 0.001; social culture–regulations r = −0.182, p = 0.002). The model demonstrated good fit (SRMR = 0.075) and strong explanatory power (R2 = 0.971 for WEDM; Q2 = 0.969). Conclusions Robust and enforced national legal frameworks are pivotal for increasing women’s engagement in logistics decision-making, and they can buffer or redirect the effects of restrictive cultural norms. While the direct impact of social culture on engagement was non-significant, its indirect effect through regulations highlights the importance of coupling legal reforms with consistent enforcement and organisational practices to convert rights into outcomes. Policy and practice should therefore integrate (i) targeted gender-equality regulations and monitoring, (ii) organisational interventions (e.g., transparent promotion, anti-bias systems, leadership development), and (iii) societal initiatives that progressively shift norms, to achieve durable, inclusive leadership pipelines in logistics and similar male-dominated sectors.

                The Hainan Gymnure Neohylomys hainanensis is a small-size mammal which occurs in Hainan, China and north Vietnam. Here, we report the complete mitochondrial genome of N. hainanensis. The whole mitochondrial genome is 17,337 bp, and contains 13 protein-coding genes, 22 tRNAs, 2 rRNAs and one control region. The base composition of the N. hainanensis total mitogenome is: 33.4% A, 12.2% G, 33.1% T, and C 21.3%, with an A + T content of 66.5%. The K2P genetic distance analysis supports current taxonomy that places N. hainanensis, Hylomys suillus and Neotetracus sinensis in different genera. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that N . hainanensis is closely related to Neotetracus sinensis based on the complete mitochondrial genome sequences. The mitogenomic data will contribute to molecular phylogenetics and conservation genetics of the species.

                Abstract Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a widespread and progressively debilitating neurodegenerative disorder, with its global prevalence steadily increasing. Central to its pathogenesis is the PINK1 gene (PTEN-induced putative kinase 1), which plays a pivotal role in mitochondrial function and protecting cells from oxidative stress-induced apoptosis. This review explores the complex relationship between PINK1 mutations and PD, highlighting their involvement in key pathogenic mechanisms. It discusses how these mutations contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction, alterations in phosphorylation pathways, impaired autophagy, and heightened sensitivity to oxidative stress. These insights lay the groundwork for future research and therapeutic approaches, aiming to address the urgent need for effective PD interventions.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106549">Resident memory macrophages and trained innate immunity at barrier tissues</a></h4>

              
                Innate immune memory, or trained innate immunity (TII), represents a form of immunological adaptation in which innate immune cells, including myeloid and lymphoid cells, retain a trained state following prior exposure to immunological stimuli. This long-lasting modification either enhances or reduces the innate immune response to subsequent heterologous infections or inflammatory insults. While TII often provides protective benefits, including enhanced protection against pathogens and tumors, it can contribute to maladaptive inflammation in certain conditions. Epigenetic changes and metabolic reprogramming are key drivers of innate immune memory, but it is important to distinguish between transient acute changes and persistent modifications that define bona fide innate immune memory. Innate immune memory can be induced centrally, through systemic events that train hematopoietic progenitors in the bone marrow, or locally, via tissue-resident cells such as macrophages. The presence of trained tissue-resident immune cells offers significant advantages, but their responses may not always result in universally enhanced protection. This review explores recent advances in the understanding of tissue-resident memory macrophages and TII at barrier tissue sites, including the lung, skin, gut, and peritoneum, highlighting the implications for vaccine and immunotherapeutic strategies. Ongoing research promises to accelerate progress in this field and inform new clinical and vaccinology approaches.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103481">Probing the role of synaptic adhesion molecule RTN4RL2 in setting up cochlear connectivity</a></h4>

              
                Sound encoding depends on the precise and reliable neurotransmission at the afferent synapses between the sensory inner hair cells (IHCs) and spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs). The molecular mechanisms contributing to the formation, as well as interplay between the pre- and postsynaptic components, remain largely unclear. Here, we tested the role of the synaptic adhesion molecule and Nogo/RTN4 receptor homolog RTN4RL2 (also referred to as NgR2) in the development and function of afferent IHC–SGN synapses. Upon deletion of RTN4RL2 in mice (RTN4RL2 KO), presynaptic IHC active zones showed enlarged synaptic ribbons and a depolarized shift in the activation of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. The postsynaptic densities (PSDs) of SGNs were smaller and deficient of GluA2–4 AMPA receptor subunits despite maintained <i>Gria2</i> mRNA expression in SGNs. Next to synaptically engaged PSDs, we observed ‘orphan’ PSDs located away from IHCs, likely belonging to a subset of SGN peripheral neurites that do not contact the IHCs in RTN4RL2 KO cochleae, as found by volume electron microscopy reconstruction of SGN neurites. Auditory brainstem responses of RTN4RL2 KO mice showed increased sound thresholds indicating impaired hearing. Together, these findings suggest that RTN4RL2 contributes to the proper formation and function of auditory afferent synapses and is critical for normal hearing.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88824">The unique synaptic circuitry of specialized olfactory glomeruli in Drosophila melanogaster</a></h4>

              
                In the <i>Drosophila</i> olfactory system, most odorants are encoded in the antennal lobe in a combinatory way, activating several glomerular circuits. However, odorants of particular ecological role for the fly are encoded through activation of a single specialized olfactory pathway. Comparative analyses of densely reconstructed connectomes of one broadly tuned glomerulus (DL5) and one narrowly tuned glomerulus (DA2) gained detailed insight into the variations of synaptic circuitries of glomeruli with different computational tasks. Our approach combined laser branding of glomeruli of interest with volume-based focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy to enable precise targeting and analysis of the two glomeruli. We discovered differences in their neuronal innervation, synaptic composition, and specific circuitry of their major cell types: olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs), uniglomerular projection neurons, and multiglomerular neurons. By comparing our data with a previously mapped narrowly tuned glomerulus (VA1v), we identified putative generic features of narrowly tuned glomerular circuits, including higher density of neuronal fibers and synapses, lower degree of OSN lateralization, stronger axo-axonic connections between OSNs, dendro-dendritic connections between many uPNs, and lower degree of presynaptic input on OSN axons. In addition, this work revealed that the dendrites of the single uPN in DL5 contain a substantial amount of autapses interconnecting distant regions of the dendritic tree. The comparative analysis of glomeruli allows us to formulate synaptic motifs implemented in olfactory circuits with different computational demands.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/107121">Erythrocytosis-inducing PHD2 mutations implicate biological role for N-terminal prolyl-hydroxylation in HIF1α oxygen-dependent degradation domain</a></h4>

              
                Mutations in <i>EGLN1</i>, the gene encoding for hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) prolyl-4-hydroxylase 2 (PHD2), cause erythrocytosis and in rare cases the development of neuroendocrine tumors. In the presence of oxygen, PHD2 hydroxylates one or both conserved prolines in the oxygen-dependent degradation domain (ODD) of HIFα subunits, sufficiently marking HIFα for binding and ubiquitylation via the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor protein-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase and subsequent degradation by the 26S proteasome. However, prolyl-hydroxylation in the C-terminal ODD appears to be the predominant and sufficient event in triggering the oxygen-dependent destruction of HIFα, rendering the biological significance of N-terminal ODD proline unclear. Here, we examined seven disease-associated <i>EGLN1</i> mutations scattered across the catalytic core and showed definitively that all PHD2 mutants have a structural and/or catalytic activity defect as measured by time-resolved nuclear magnetic resonance. Notably, we identified one of the PHD2 mutants, P317R, to retain comparably wild-type capacity to hydroxylate the predominant proline in the C-terminal ODD but had uniquely compromised ability to hydroxylate the N-terminal ODD proline. These findings support the notion that deregulation of HIF ultimately underlies PHD2-driven erythrocytosis and challenge the currently held uncertainty that the N-terminal ODD prolyl-hydroxylation event is dispensable in normal hypoxic signaling pathway.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105309">Protein language model identifies disordered, conserved motifs implicated in phase separation</a></h4>

              
                Intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) play a critical role in phase separation and are essential for the formation of membraneless organelles (MLOs). Mutations within IDRs can disrupt their multivalent interaction networks, altering phase behavior and contributing to various diseases. Therefore, examining the evolutionary constraints of IDRs provides valuable insights into the relationship between protein sequences and phase separation. In this study, we utilized the ESM2 protein language model to map the residue-level mutational tolerance landscapes of IDRs. Our findings reveal that IDRs, particularly those actively participating in phase separation, contain conserved amino acids. This conservation is evident through mutational constraints predicted by ESM2 and supported by direct analyses of multiple sequence alignments. These conserved, disordered amino acids include residues traditionally identified as ‘stickers’ as well as ‘spacers’ and frequently form continuous sequence motifs. The strong conservation, combined with their potential role in phase separation, suggests that these motifs may act as functional units under evolutionary selection to support stable MLO formation. Our findings underscore the insights into phase separation’s molecular grammar made possible through evolutionary analysis enabled by protein language models.

">Sensory Neural Noise as a Limiting Factor in Visual Working Memory Precision in Neurotypicals and Schizophrenia</a></h4>

              
                The neural mechanisms that determine the capacity limits of working memory (WM) are not well understood, with traditional views identifying prefrontal circuitry as the source. Sensory encoding, however, remains an underexplored explanation for WM limits even though noise in sensory processing necessarily constrains brain functions that relay sensory inputs and mechanisms. Here we show that individual differences in internal sensory noise during visual processing predict visual WM capacity. Next, we show that the well-established WM deficits in schizophrenia can be linked to atypically high levels of visual sensory noise, providing a new explanatory framework for these deficits. Finally, we manipulated sensory noise levels in patients through transcranial direct current stimulation to the visual cortex, resulting in corresponding changes in visual WM precision. These findings show that sensory encoding fidelity may explain a significant amount of variance in WM function in both neurotypical adults and patients with schizophrenia.

">The Impact of Dance Movement Therapy on Subjective Well-Being and Quality of Life in Healthy Older Adults</a></h4>

              
                Undertaking physical and social activities such as dance and music have positive effects on the mental well-being, cognitive and physical abilities of older people. Dance Movement Therapy (DMT) is a complementary practice that uses dance and movement to stimulate creativity, enabling individuals to engage in positive inter-personal connections within a group. Therapeutic approaches involving DMT have been proven to promote positive mental health outcomes in various patient groups. This study aimed to evaluate the possible efficacy of DMT on the subjective perceptions of quality of life, satisfaction with life, and personal well-being of a sample of healthy adults aged over 65. Participants (n=25; females=17) took part in an 8-week DMT cycle on a once-weekly basis. The DMT cycle was preceded and followed by a one-hour session during which participants filled out the World Health Organization Quality of Life assessment (WHOQoL-BRIEF), the Satisfaction With LifeScale (SWLS), and the Wellbeing Index (PWI) scale. Comparison of pre- and post-DMT scores by repeated measures ANalysis Of VAriance (rmANOVA) showed a positive effect of DMT, especially in terms of overall quality of life and social relationships. Participants in the over-70s age group who showed significantly lower scores than their younger counterparts in terms of overall quality of life, Social subscale, and PWI, exhibited analogous DMT-related changes. Our findings suggest that DMT has the potential to foster a shared positive state of mind among older individuals, thereby facilitating social interaction not only among the elderly population but also among its most senior members.

">An image-computable, spatio-chromatic RF model of the midget RGC mosaic across the retina</a></h4>

              
                Accurate image-computable models of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) mosaics across the retina do not currently exist. Here, we deploy a novel computational framework which synthesizes mosaics of linear spatio-chromatic receptive fields (RFs) of ON midget RGCs (mRGCs) by integrating published anatomical, physiological, and optical quality measurements. We use the synthesized mRGC mosaics to simulate both in vivo and in vitro physiological experiments and demonstrate the model's consistency with published data. The model enables computation of how visual performance is shaped by the representation of visual information provided by the linear spatiochromatic processing stage of midget RGCs. The developed computational framework carefully accounts for the effect of physiological optics on mRGC responses, enables comparison of in vivo and in vitro data, and allows exploration of how different assumptions about RF organization, such as selectivity for the type of cones pooled by the RF center mechanism, affect physiological responses and psychophysical performance. The open-source and freely available implementation provides a platform for understanding how the linear spatiochromatic receptive field representation of the mRGCs shapes visual performance, as well as a foundation for future work that incorporates response nonlinearities, temporal filtering, and extends to additional RGC mosaics

">A data and task-constrained mechanistic model of the mouse outer retina shows robustness to contrast variations</a></h4>

              
                Visual processing starts in the outer retina where photoreceptors transform light into electrochemical signals. These signals are modulated by inhibition from horizontal cells and sent to the inner retina via excitatory bipolar cells. The outer retina is thought to play an important role in contrast invariant coding of visual information, but how the different cell types implement this computation together remains incompletely understood. To understand the role of each cell type, we developed a fully-differentiable biophysical model of a circular patch of mouse outer retina. The model includes 200 cone photoreceptors with a realistic phototransduction cascade and ribbon synapses as well as horizontal and bipolar cells, all with cell-type specific ion channels. Going beyond decades of work constraining biophysical models of neurons only by experimental data, we used a dual approach, constraining some parameters of the model with available measurements and others by a visual task: (1) We fit the parameters of the cone models to whole cell patch-clamp measurements of photocurrents and two-photon glutamate imaging measurements of synaptic release. (2) We then trained the spatiotemporal outer retina model with photoreceptors and the other cell types to perform a visual classification task with varying contrast and luminance levels. We found that our outer retina model could learn to solve the classification task despite contrast and luminance variance in the stimuli. Testing different cell type compositions and connectivity patterns, we found that feedback from horizontal cells did not further improve task performance beyond that of excitatory photoreceptors and bipolar cells. This is surprising given that horizontal cells are positioned to mediate communication across cones and that they add to the model's number of trainable parameters. Finally, we found that our model generalized better to out of distribution contrast levels than a linear classifier. Our work shows how the nonlinearities found in the outer retina can accomplish contrast invariant classification and teases apart the contributions of different cell types.

">Evaluating exon-skipping therapies targeting the central nervous system in Duchenne muscular dystrophy using high-resolution spatial transcriptomics</a></h4>

              
                Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is marked by progressive muscle degeneration due to dystrophin deficiency. Despite cognitive impairments in up to one-third of patients, central nervous system (CNS)-targeted dystrophin restoration remains relatively underexplored compared to muscle-focused therapies. Since dystrophin is expressed in the brain during development and postnatally, it is important to assess which aspects of CNS pathology could be rescued. However, studying Dmd is difficult due to its size, low-abundance transcripts, and with multiple isoforms, limiting the sensitivity and isoform resolution of standard sequencing methods. To overcome these limitations, we applied Xenium spatial transcriptomics to target splice junctions, enabling isoform-specific and exon 51 skipping events detection across brain regions and cell types. Using this approach, we analyzed mdx52 mice lacking the full-length and Dp140 isoforms, treated with two exon 51 skipping therapies (antisense oligonucleotides or AAV-U7ex51). We observed distinct spatial expression patterns in the wild type brain between the full-length isoforms (Dp427c/m/p1) and shorter isoforms (Dp71 and Dp40). The full-length isoforms were predominantly expressed in cortex layers 2/3-6b and the CA1 region, while the shorter isoforms were localized to cortex layer 1 and the dentate gyrus. Among the exon skipping therapies tested, U7ex51 delivered neonatally induced broad exon skipping in neurons and effectively restored full-length isoforms in the targeted cells. This study introduces the first subcellular-resolution spatial transcriptomic atlas of dystrophin presence and rescue in the CNS and demonstrates a framework for evaluating gene therapies in spatially and transcriptionally complex tissues such as the brain.

">Local translation controls early reactive changes in perisynaptic astrocyte processes at pre-symptomatic stages of Alzheimer s disease</a></h4>

              
                INTRODUCTION Understanding the progression of cellular dysfunction in preclinical Alzheimer s disease (AD) is essential for developing new therapeutic strategies. Early alterations in astrocyte perisynaptic functions have been observed in AD, yet the molecular underpinnings remain poorly characterized. Here, we hypothesized that local protein synthesis, a critical mechanism for maintaining astrocyte polarity and subcellular compartmentalization, could be impaired at early AD stages. METHODS We studied the effect of oligomeric Ab on mRNA translation by imaging puromycylated-nascent protein chains in primary astrocytes alone or in coculture with neurons. To further characterize effects on astrocyte translation, we extracted by translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP), ribosome-bound mRNAs from hippocampal astrocytes and perisynaptic astrocyte processes (PAP) in wild type (WT) and APPswe/PS1dE9 (APP) mice at 5.5 months, a pre-symptomatic stage corresponding to the initiation of Ab plaque formation. mRNAs were analyzed by high throughput RNA sequencing and compared between genotypes and astrocyte compartments. Results were further verified by RT qPCR in purified hippocampal synaptogliosomes as well as gliovascular units, and by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). We addressed the role of the Janus Kinase (JAK) Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3) pathway, a master regulator of reactive astrocytes, on the early mRNA expression and distribution in astrocytes by astrocyte-specific viral gene transfer of the pathway inhibitor Suppressor Of Cytokine Signaling 3 (SOCS3) in hippocampal astrocytes in WT and APP mice. RESULTS Ab induced global and local translational perturbations in primary astrocytes. 5.5 months APP PAPs showed prominent translational changes compared to whole APP astrocytes and WT. They were related mainly to axon development, neurotransmitter transport, inflammation and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Some upregulated mRNAs accumulated in APP PAPs from 3 months, but not in astrocyte perivascular processes (PvAP). From this stage, Serpina3n total mRNAs encoding the serine protease inhibitor A3 accumulated in astrocyte soma and PAPs, and this effect was rescued in PAPs upon JAK STAT3 inhibition. DISCUSSION Our findings show that in APP mice, significant translational changes predominantly occur in PAPs at pre-symptomatic stages of AD. They are sustained, as observed for Serpina3n, by the upregulation and distribution of total mRNAs specifically in PAPs from 3 months. The JAK-STAT3 pathway contribute to the distribution of Serpina3n mRNAs in APP PAPs as early as 3 months. These early local events could be related to soluble Ab as well as early synaptic dysregulations sensed by PAPs, which may trigger local astrocyte reactivity. Thus, targeting local translation in astrocytes may represent a promising therapeutic strategy to counteract early synaptic alterations in AD.

">Next-Generation Neural Mass Models Reproduce Features of Speech Processing</a></h4>

              
                Segregation of speech into syllables is a key step in neural speech processing. It relies on the alignment of neural activity with the rhythmic structure of speech. Two neurological mechanisms have been suggested: phase-resetting of existing neural oscillations, or evoked responses to acoustic features of the speech signal. From EEG experiment, it is known that a distinct feature of this neural entrainment is that its strength is correlated with phonemes sharpness. Here, we reproduce this EEG experiment in-silico. In particular, we use a biophysical neural mass model to simulate the neural response to the same near-isochronus, consonant-vowel stimuli as the EEG study. We compare this to the response of two other, phenomenological, models that are designed to represent the proposed mechanisms: one a phase-resetting oscillator, the other an evoked-response filter. The biophysical neural mass model captures population-level oscillations without being tailored to speech. All three models can reproduce the correlation between phoneme sharpness and entrainment strength. While both the phase-resetting and evoked models succeed in reproducing the experimental result, the phase-resetting model is arguably more parsimonious since it does not require the preprocessing the evoked model needs to convert a sound envelope into features. Interestingly, the neural mass model also succeeded, without being tailored to the stimulus, unlike the other two models. For example, it does not respond at a specific stimulus-targeted frequency and it is robust across different parameter settings. Our results suggest that generic oscillatory dynamics in cortical populations may be sufficient to generate sharpness-dependent entrainment to speech.

">Biologically Inspired Deep Neural Network Models for Visual Emotion Processing</a></h4>

              
                The perception of opportunities and threats in complex visual scenes represents one of the main functions of the human visual system. The underlying neurophysiology is often studied by having observers view pictures varying in affective content. While deep neural networks (DNNs) have shown promise in modeling visual recognition of objects, their capacity to model visual affective processing remains to be better understood. In this study, we proposed a biologically inspired deep neural network model, referred to as the Visual Cortex Amygdala (VCA) model, that integrates a vision transformer with an amygdala-mimetic module designed to reflect both the anatomical hierarchy and self-attention-based computational mechanisms of the human brain. We evaluated the model along three dimensions: (1) predictive accuracy for emotional valence and arousal, (2) representational alignment with human amygdala activity, and (3) neural mechanisms of emotion representation. Our results showed that (1) the model can predict with high accuracy human emotion ratings on 1,182 images from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) dataset (valence r > 0.9; arousal r > 0.7), (2) the model's internal representations aligned with functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data from the human amygdala, and (3) at the single neuron level, the amygdala module evolved emotion selectivity, and at the neuronal population level, the representational geometry became progressively more aligned with psychological models of emotion. Additional issues explored included (1) the effect of visual encoding and (2) the effect of structure and computational mechanisms on emotional assessment.

">Aberrant E-I Balance and Brain Criticality in Major Depressive Disorder</a></h4>

              
                Brain criticality and complexity are increasingly recognized as promising biomarkers for psychiatric disorders. In Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), disordered neural dynamics have been reported, but their nature and consistency remain incompletely understood. Here, we study brain criticality, excitation-inhibition (E/I) balance, combined excitation-inhibition strength (E+I), and complexity of brain dynamics associated with MDD. Using resting-state EEG from 183 patients with MDD and 133 healthy controls (HC), we identified disruptions of critical dynamics and excitation-inhibition balance which discriminate groups. We found that amplitude bistability is lower, and long-range temporal correlations are weaker in MDD, implying deviation from criticality. Excitation-inhibition metrics show frequency-specific alterations in MDD. Estimates of excitation-inhibition ratios (E/I) derived from the statistical properties of amplitude fluctuations show higher values in HC than MDD in the theta band, indicating relative over-excitation, and lower values in the gamma band, indicating relative over-inhibition. An excitation-inhibition strength index reflecting combined excitatory and inhibitory drive (E+I), was decreased in theta through beta bands and increased in gamma in MDD. Collectively, excitation-inhibition measures suggest decreased inhibitory drive in the mechanisms underlying theta oscillations in MDD and increased inhibitory drive in the mechanisms underlying gamma oscillations. Classification using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression achieved high accuracy and the predictive feature set includes measures of criticality, E/I ratios, and combined E+I strength. These findings elucidate pathological alterations of brain dynamics in MDD and define a complex system fingerprint, supporting the development of biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment.

">Ventral striatal astrocytes contribute to reinforcement learning</a></h4>

              
                Astrocytes influence synaptic plasticity and neuronal function through astrocytic calcium dynamics (ACD). However, astrocytes contribution to cognitive operations like reinforcement learning (RL) remains unclear. To examine this, we trained mice on a RL dependent probabilistic decision-making task. We attenuated ACD across distinct striatal regions, finding that ACD attenuation specifically in ventral striatum (VS) increased decision noisiness and impaired reward-guided choice. This effect was largely due to a reduction in win-stay behavior. Using in-vivo calcium imaging, we found that VS ACD correlated with reward prediction errors (RPEs). Furthermore, these trial-by-trial ACD fluctuations predicted trial-by-trial choice variability. Finally, ex-vivo slice electrophysiology and computational modeling revealed two mechanisms through which astrocytes could regulate behavioral variability: by regulating presynaptic excitatory-inhibitory balance, and by sharing RPE signals across populations of striatal neurons. Together, these results suggest that VS astrocytes contribute to cortico-striatal functions to mediate decision noisiness.

">Delay selection by spike-timing-dependent plasticity shapes efficient networks for signal transmission</a></h4>

              
                Information processing in the brain relies on efficient communication between different brain regions. Brain oscillations can control signal transmission in brain networks by modulating the timing and excitability of sender and receiver areas. For effective transmission, signals should arrive at target areas when their excitability is maximized. For reciprocally connected neural populations, this mechanism works if the transmission delay matches the period of their evoked oscillation. However, the mechanisms underlying such development of the connections with matched delays remain elusive. While transmission delays in brain networks change during development, the process by which delays are tuned for efficient transmission is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the well-known Hebbian learning rule can provide a mechanism for selecting connections with delays that match the period of network oscillations. We consider a reciprocally connected bi-layer network of excitatory and inhibitory neurons that generate network-level oscillations spontaneously or in response to external stimuli. When exposed to spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), the network self-organizes to potentiate connections with delays matching the oscillation period, while depressing those with non-matching delays. Our findings shed light on how transmission delays may evolve during learning and development to optimize the organization of brain networks for efficient signal transmission.

">Direction Selectivity in Naturalistic Action Observation: Distributed Representations Across the Action Observation Network</a></h4>

              
                Perceiving the direction of observed actions is critical for interpreting intentions and guiding social interaction. While direction selectivity has been extensively studied with simple stimuli such as dots, gratings, or point-light displays (PLDs), little is known about how the brain encodes direction in naturalistic, repetitive actions that are seen frequently in daily life. The present fMRI study investigated direction-selective representations during observation of complex actions performed along three bidirectional dimensions (left-right, up-down, front-back) within a 96-video stimulus set. The brain activity was analyzed using multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) and multiple regression representational similarity analysis (RSA). MVPA revealed above-chance classification of action direction across occipital, parietal, and motor cortices, with the highest decoding in occipital, primary motor, and somatosensory regions. Crucially, RSA demonstrated that when accounting for low-level and motor features, direction information was still represented in early visual cortex, occipito-temporal areas, parietal regions, and motor-related regions. These findings indicate that action direction is represented across multiple levels of the action observation network (AON), extending from early sensory regions to higher-order parietal and frontal cortices. By using naturalistic, repetitive action videos, this study provides new evidence that the coding of action direction in the human brain is broadly distributed, reflecting the complexity of perceiving actions in everyday life. These findings suggest that direction selectivity is a core feature of the action observation network, linking basic motion processing with higher-level action understanding.

">Spatiotemporal representations of contextual associations for real-world objects</a></h4>

              
                In the real world, objects always appear in context. Many objects are reliably associated with a certain scene context (e.g., pots appear in kitchens) and other objects that appear in the same context (e.g., pans appear together with pots). Previous neuroimaging work suggests that such contextual associations shape the neural representation of isolated objects even in the absence of the scene context. Yet, three key questions remain unanswered: (1) How do representations of contextual associations relate to perceptual and categorical representation in visual cortex, (2) how do they emerge across time, and (3) how are they mechanistically implemented? To answer these questions, we recorded fMRI and EEG while participants (human, both sexes) viewed isolated objects stemming from two scene contexts. Multivariate pattern analysis on the neural data revealed that objects from the same context were coded more similarly than objects from different contexts in object-selective LOC and scene-selective PPA, even when systematically controlling for perceptual and categorical similarities. Such contextual relation representations emerged relatively late during visual processing (i.e., after perceptual and categorical representations), specifically in the anterior PPA, and likely through a mixture of object-to-object and object-to-scene associations. Together, our results demonstrate that contextual relation representations emerged for isolated objects, and without a task that encourages their formation, suggesting that objects automatically activate context frames that support visual cognition in real-world environments.

">Prolactin Shapes Cortical Plasticity in Fathers</a></h4>

              
                Caregiving alters the mammalian brain to support infant survival. While hypothalamic circuits are known to drive innate parental behaviors, information about the effect of parenthood on sensory processing and perception remain scarce, especially in fathers. We longitudinally imaged the same neurons in male mouse primary auditory cortex (ACx) before, during, and after fatherhood using two-photon calcium imaging. Behaviorally, males shifted from pup-directed aggression and self-oriented behaviors to transient parental care. In ACx, fathers showed enhanced and faster discrimination of pup ultrasonic vocalizations compared with matched narrowband noise. Slice electrophysiology revealed increased intrinsic excitability accompanies fatherhood. Mechanistically, we found elevated prolactin signaling in ACx, and manipulating prolactin levels modified the improvement in neuronal discriminability. Together, these results identify, in males, cortical plasticity and link prolactin to experience-dependent plasticity of sensory circuits that support caregiving. Our findings outline a father-specific mechanism that differs in key aspects from similar mechanisms in mothers.

">SEIZURE OCCURRENCE IN FCD TYPE II IS PREDICTED BY LESION POSITION AND LINKED TO CYTOARCHITECTURAL ALTERATIONS</a></h4>

              
                Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) is a common malformation of cortical development and a major cause of early-onset, drug-resistant epilepsy. FCD type II is defined by abnormal lamination, altered cellular composition, and pathological cells, notably dysmorphic neurons (DNs) and balloon cells. DNs are thought to drive epileptogenicity through both cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous mechanisms, the latter including not only aberrant connectivity but also indirect modulation of excitability in local cell populations. We performed a multiscale structural and morphological analysis to elucidate the basis of FCD epileptogenicity and the impact of somatic mTOR mutations during brain development. Using a mouse model of FCD type II, we show that lesions in frontal and motor cortical regions are the strongest predictors of spontaneous seizure occurrence. This localization-dependent epileptogenicity offers an experimental explanation for the higher clinical epileptogenicity of frontal FCDs and suggests that posterior lesions may remain silent - an open question in human pathology. In our model, FCD tissue displayed considerable expansion, with cortical thickness up to ~20% in seizure-bearing animals. This expansion coincided with an overall ~40% reduction in neuronal density, consistent with tissue hypertrophy. DN density did not differ between seizure and non-seizure animals, challenging the notion that higher DN load directly predicts epileptogenesis. At the microscopic level, we describe DN axonal pathologies, including giant varicosities. In the cortex, these appeared as vesicle-filled boutons, whereas along callosal axons they were frequent but largely empty. Bouton density was markedly reduced in FCD cortex. Together, these findings leave the net synaptic effect of dysmorphic neurons unresolved, challenging the assumption that axonal hypertrophy translates into increased excitatory drive. While morphological abnormalities in FCD type II are well documented, their functional consequences remain incompletely understood. Here, we used macro- and microscopic structural features of FCDII to assess seizure susceptibility, providing new insights into epileptogenesis.

">Computational modelling of schizophrenia-associated alterations of ion-channel-encoding gene expression predicts a decrease in delta power</a></h4>

              
                Schizophrenia presents with a wide range of phenotypes that can help to understand the the mechanisms of the disease. Among these, alterations in delta oscillations are especially amenable to experimental investigation, yet the mechanisms underlying these changes remain insufficiently understood. Biophysically detailed computational modeling offers a powerful approach to investigate these phenomena, as it enables multi-scale integration of genetic and electrophysiological data. In this study, we developed a minimal network model composed of biophysically detailed, multicompartmental neurons to replicate experimental data on the effects of pharmacological blockage of gabaergic neurotransmission on delta-band power. We inserted post-mortem RNA expression data from the anterior cingulate and prefrontal cortices of individuals with schizophrenia and matched controls into the model to study the effects of schizophrenia-associated alterations of ion-channel expression on delta-oscillation power. Our simulations revealed a significant reduction in delta-band power in schizophrenia, driven by altered expression of calcium channel genes in pyramidal neurons. These results provide insights into the genetic contributions to oscillatory disruptions observed in schizophrenia, and our modelling framework can help to develop stratification strategies that bridge genetics and in vivo electrophysiology.

">Disrupted Integration-Segregation Balance in the Intact Hemisphere in Chronic Spatial Neglect</a></h4>

              
                Spatial neglect is a common and disabling consequence of right hemisphere stroke, characterized by a failure to attend to the contralesional left space, and frequently persists into the chronic stage. There is robust evidence on the role of right-hemisphere frontoparietal dysfunction, interhemispheric structural disconnection and maladaptive activity in the left hemisphere in the persistence of neglect. However, the specific impact of right frontoparietal dysfunction on the functional (re)organization of the left hemisphere remains poorly understood. In this study, we introduce a novel application of functional connectivity gradient analysis to investigate macroscale functional reorganization in the non-lesioned left hemisphere of patients with chronic left spatial neglect. Focusing on resting-state fMRI data, we demonstrate that abnormal segregation patterns in the left frontoparietal and default mode networks are robustly associated with neglect severity and spatial attentional bias. Notably, the principal gradienttypically capturing a global unimodal-to-transmodal hierarchy--was altered in these patients, suggesting a reorganization favoring lateralized unimodal networks. We also show that the structural integrity of the left inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF) plays a key role in shaping these functional dynamics. These findings reveal a previously overlooked aspect of neglect pathophysiology: the maladaptive dominance of the non-lesioned hemisphere's intrinsic architecture. By combining innovative gradient-based metrics with classical lesion approaches, our study offers a new framework for understanding neglect as an emergent property of large-scale network imbalance, with clinical implications for diagnosis and intervention, and theoretical consequences for models of hemispheric asymmetries and conscious access.

">A comprehensive, open-source battery of movement imagery ability tests: Development and psychometric properties</a></h4>

              
                Imagining actions is a covert and multidimensional skill difficult to quantify. Comprehensive assessments rarely combine measures of imagery generation, maintenance, and manipulation. We developed and validated a combination of tests to assess these processes of movement imagery, online. 180 healthy individuals completed the MIQ-RS questionnaire (generation), the Imagined Finger Sequence Task (iFST; maintenance), and the Hand Laterality Judgement Task (HLJT; manipulation). MIQ-RS showed a bifactorial structure (visual and kinesthetic modalities) according to confirmatory factor analysis, and its reliability (internal consistency) was good. In the iFST, internal validity analyses via generalized mixed models showed a clear effect of sequence complexity, stronger for execution than imagery. Reliability, estimated via signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) using hierarchical Bayesian models, was also adequate (SNR > 1.6). In the HLJT, expected effects of rotation angle, hand view, and their interaction, consistent with biomechanical constraints, were also found. Reliability was also adequate (SNR > 1.75). Criterion validity across tests, assessed using Bayesian Spearman correlations, showed that correlations were generally absent (BF01 > 3), and when present, of small magnitude (r < 0.27). Test-retest reliability (122 participants reassessed 6-8 days after), computed via Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICCs), was generally adequate (ICCs > 0.67). We conclude that the online versions of these tests showed adequate structural/internal validity and (test-retest) reliability. However, weak criterion validity suggests individuals with high ability to generate movement imagery may not necessarily have high ability to maintain and/or manipulate movement imagery, underscoring the need for comprehensive assessment of this capacity.

">Disentangling structure-function relationships between the human hippocampus and the whole brain using track-weighted dynamic functional connectivity.</a></h4>

              
                Understanding how structural and functional connectivity shape hippocampal interactions with the rest of the brain is critical for elucidating its role in cognition. Here, we combine high-resolution diffusion MRI, a novel fibre-tracking pipeline designed to specifically probe anatomical connectivity of the in vivo human hippocampus, and track-weighted dynamic functional connectivity (TW-dFC) to investigate how direct anatomical connections between the hippocampus and the rest of the brain relate to time-varying functional interactions. In Study 1, TW-dFC maps were computed for 10 participants from the Human Connectome Project and subjected to ICA and k-means clustering to derive a data-driven parcellation of the hippocampus based on its structure-function relationships. This revealed circumscribed clusters distributed along anterior-posterior and medial-lateral axes, which broadly aligned with hippocampal subfields. In Study 2, we examined the resting-state functional connectivity profiles of each TW-dFC derived cluster in an independent sample of 100 participants. Each hippocampal cluster displayed distinct patterns of functional connectivity with specific substructures within medial temporal, parietal, frontal and occipital cortices as well as subcortical and cerebellar regions. Our findings demonstrate that TW-dFC provides a powerful framework for anatomically informed functional parcellation of the hippocampus and offers new insights into the structural-functional organisation underlying hippocampal-(sub)cortical interactions. Our approach opens new avenues for probing memory systems in health and their disruption in aging and disease.

">Flexible Steering and Conflict Resolution: Pro-Goal/Anti-Goal Gating in Drosophila Lateral Accessory Lobes</a></h4>

              
                Navigation comprises multiple processes: sensory integration, position estimation, decision, and finally, motor command generation, which is the control problem. Previous studies discovered that PFL3 neurons compute a heading-goal error and directly project to the descending neurons that generate the steering commands. Yet, this direct pathway is necessary but not sufficient for the flexible control required to pursue goal while avoiding threats and resolving conflicts. Using the Drosophila connectome and circuit modeling, we uncover a layered control architecture in the lateral accessory lobes (LAL) that arbitrates between goal pursuit and stimulus-driving overrides. First, a dorsal pathway that forms a dominant indirect ''pro-goal'' push-pull circuit that amplifies left-right asymmetries. Second, a faster ventral pathway forms an ''anti-goal'' circuit that recruits and inverts the pro-goal circuit to redirect movement, and only engages when a goal is present. The architecture also resolves two symmetry challenges: Rear Stalemate (goal 180 behind) and Front Stalemate (threat dead ahead), by rapidly amplifying tiny perturbations into decisive turns. Together, these motifs instantiate comparator, override, and gating principles in a compact neural controller, yielding testable predictions for insect motor control and design rules for bio-inspired, embodied intelligence.

">MRI-based classifier to identify close-to-onset cases in C9orf72 genetic frontotemporal dementia</a></h4>

              
                Predicting symptom onset in genetic frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is crucial for advancing targeted interventions and clinical trial design. Brain changes begin years before clinical symptoms emerge, making neuroimaging a strong candidate for onset prediction. However, FTD is highly heterogeneous, encompassing diverse molecular pathologies, affected brain networks, and symptom trajectories. This variability limits the predictive power of any single imaging biomarker and underscores the need for an integrative, multimodal approach to improve prediction accuracy and generalizability. We used machine learning to integrate diverse neuroimaging features, identifying a robust signature for risk stratification. We analyzed T1-weighted and T2-weighted MRI scans from 71 symptomatic C9orf72 carriers, 90 presymptomatic carriers, and 69 healthy controls from the GENFI cohort. We used FreeSurfer to measure cortical thickness and subcortical volumes, and BISON to quantify white matter hyperintensities (WMH). We applied Principal Component Analysis for dimensionality reduction and trained a random forest classifier to distinguish symptomatic carriers from controls. The model was subsequently applied to the presymptomatic cohort to identify individuals whose brain patterns resembled those of symptomatic cases, under the hypothesis that greater similarity indicated a higher risk of conversion. We validated the model with neuropsychological data and a two-year longitudinal follow-up. The classifier distinguished symptomatic C9orf72 carriers from controls with 87.0% accuracy. When applied to presymptomatic carriers, the model identified 21.1% of the cohort as having brain features comparable to those of symptomatic cases. This <span>"high-risk group"</span> showed significant neuropsychological weaknesses in executive function, language and social cognition compared to the non high-risk group. The model accurately predicted clinical conversion within a two-year period with 84.5% accuracy, a 70% sensitivity and a 93.3% negative predictive value. Our findings demonstrate the utility of a machine learning approach using multi-modal MRI to identify presymptomatic C9orf72 carriers at high risk of disease onset within the next two years. By capturing subtle neuroanatomical patterns associated with disease processes, this approach offers a promising method for stratifying genetic FTD carriers prior to symptom onset. Such predictive models could optimize patient selection in future clinical trials.

">Variation of Myelin-associated Gene Expression and Ndrg1 within the Prefrontal Cortex as Determinants for Initial Level of Response to Alcohol</a></h4>

              
                Background: Studies in humans and animal models have documented relationships between initial sensitivity to alcohol and alcohol drinking behavior. Prior expression profiling studies of C57BL/6J and DBA/2J mice and rhesus macaques within the prefrontal cortex (PFC) have shown variation in myelin gene expression may be linked with alcohol sensitivity and consumption. Methods: Combining gene expression studies from human and mouse PFC, we identified a cross-species gene network enriched for myelin-associated genes. Since myelin expression is correlated to alcohol sensitivity and alcohol drinking behavior, we hypothesized basal levels of PFC myelin gene expression may be a genomic determinant for these behavioral responses. Using an animal model of CNS demyelination, and localized knock down of N-myc downstream regulated gene 1 (Ndrg1), we measured effects of cortical myelin reduction on initial alcohol sensitivity and drinking behavior. Results: Reducing myelin-related gene expression significantly altered sensitivity to alcohol and decreased alcohol consumption. Mouse genetic-based studies identified Ndrg1 as a putative quantitative trait gene for sedative-hypnotic responses to alcohol. Site-specific injections of shNdrg1 lentivirus into PFC led to a significant decrease in NDRG1 expression, causing increased alcohol behavioral sensitivity and reduced preference for high concentrations of alcohol. Conclusion: Myelin is an important biological component underlying CNS disorders. Our studies demonstrate the role of a novel candidate gene (Ndrg1), and myelin-associated gene expression, as an important factor modulating initial sensitivity to alcohol and alcohol consumption. Differences in the expression of myelin-related genes, including Ndrg1, may serve as future therapeutic targets for the treatment of alcohol use disorders.

">Simulated 5-HT2A receptor activation accounts for the high complexity of brain activity during psychedelic states</a></h4>

              
                Serotonergic psychedelics, such as LSD, psilocybin, and DMT, have strong effects on human brain activity, yet their mechanisms of action at the whole-brain level are only partially understood. Here, we present a biophysically-based meanfield model that integrates cellular and network-level details to simulate the effects of these compounds at different spatial scales. By incorporating the brain-wide distribution of 5-HT2A receptors, our model mechanistically links receptor activation to a reduction in leak membrane potassium conductance, consistent with electrophysiological data. Our simulations reveal that this microscopic perturbation leads to the emergence of a brain state characterized by asynchronous and irregular dynamics with increased firing rates, as well as significant alterations in spectral power. Specifically, we find a robust decrease in power within the delta, theta, and alpha frequency bands, a result consistent with empirical findings. This change in dynamics is accompanied by an increase in spontaneous complexity, as quantified by the Lempel-Ziv complexity index, as observed experimentally. Furthermore, our model accurately replicates experimental findings regarding the Perturbational Complexity Index (PCI), demonstrating that PCI does not increase significantly by psychedelic drug administration. This crucial dissociation, where spontaneous complexity and spectral power are increased while perturbational complexity is preserved, highlights the distinct neurophysiological substrates underlying different metrics in psychedelic states. Our multiscale model provides a robust, mechanistic framework for understanding how serotoninergic psychedelics modulate global brain activity, offering new insights consistent with empirical neuroimaging and electrophysiological data.

">Electrically Contrasting Periodic Polymer Interfaces Guide Neuronal Networks</a></h4>

              
                The nervous system constitutes a highly ordered, integrated network of cells. Understanding this neuroanatomical architecture in vitro is fundamental to elucidating the cellular computations underlying functional network formation. Neuronal connectivity orchestrated through axonal pathfinding, is an interplay of biochemical signals and electromechanical properties of the growth substrate. This study focusses on how neuronal morphology and networking are affected by the periodic, micrometer-scale patterned stripes of two electrically contrasting polymers - poly(vinylidenefluoride-trifluoroethylene) (PVDF-TrFE) and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) - poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS). This periodic confinement provides a length-scale driven cue which unfolds as a self-organized, frequency-modulated spatial phenomenon. Primary cortical cultures on these patterned substrates reveal significant differences with more elaborate network formation on PVDF-TrFE stripe. The features observed at the stripe boundaries, along with the dependence on stripe width, suggest that the neurons exhibit a preference to remain confined within the PVDF-TrFE region, with growth cones deflecting away from the PEDOT:PSS regions. These observations show a promising route for development of a functional template capable of directing axonal growth, synapse formation and neural rewiring in early models of connectivity disorders in vivo.

">Patterns of intersubject correlations parallel organizational gradients during naturalistic viewing</a></h4>

              
                Recent studies have robustly demonstrated that human cortical function can be described through sensory-transmodal gradients of cortical function, while naturalistic movie watching paradigms have been leveraged to index cortical synchronization. We leveraged two independent 7T movie fMRI acquisitions to assess correlations between these measures across movies, datasets, and spatial scales. At the whole-brain level, we observed robust relationships between intersubject correlations and a visual-transmodal connectivity gradient which was independent of movie content. Within functional networks, correlations were particularly pronounced for the visual, the dorsal attention, and default mode networks. Our results support the ability of naturalistic paradigms to offer targeted insight into multiscale processing hierarchies. Robust relationships across movies suggest that we might understand movie-watching as a brain state that is independent of movie-content. Overall, this work suggests an important confluence of within-subject functional organizational axes and inter-subject synchronization when the brain is engaged in the processing of naturalistic stimuli.

">Selective coupling and decoupling coordinate distributed brain networks for precise action</a></h4>

              
                The mammalian brain is fundamentally interconnected. Across species, a single neuron typically forms thousands of synapses spanning local and long-range connections. This architecture suggests that brain function is distributed, but it remains poorly understood how relevant networks are selectively engaged to produce appropriate behaviors. To address this, we recorded >40,000 neurons, simultaneously monitoring five cerebellar and cerebral brain areas as mice performed complex motor actions, capturing interactions of >5,000,000 cross-area neuron pairs. This revealed that complex pre-movement cross-area interactions coordinate distributed networks to produce precise and consistent actions. Prior to action production, action-informative neural populations across the brain become coupled, while non-informative populations decouple. This coupling and decoupling was mirrored by two distinct local field potential oscillations linking neuron-level to population-level dynamics. External modulation of these dynamics revealed their necessity for skilled action. Our work highlights that a complex pre-movement orchestration of coupling and decoupling ensures the selective engagement of relevant distributed networks to produce precise action.

">Corticosterone-linked microglial activity underpins sexually dimorphic neuroplasticity after ketamine anesthesia.</a></h4>

              
                Anesthesia recovery is critical for resuming normal physiological and neuronal functions; however, the mechanisms involved remain elusive. Here, we identify a female-selective corticosterone-mediated microglia-neuron interaction in vivo during ketamine anesthesia recovery, absent in males. This microglia-neuron interaction induces plastic and functional neuronal changes, as evidenced by increased spine density and mEPSC frequency, which is occluded upon microglia depletion. We show that this process is driven through upregulation of the stress-responsive co-chaperone Fkbp5 mRNA and its protein, FKBP51, in female microglia. Fkbp5/FKBP51 is a key intermediary in a corticosteroid-induced stress response, and its involvement points towards a critical interface between endocrine signaling and microglia. Thus, to counteract the observed KXA-mediated corticosterone increase in the blood, we remove the primary source of corticosterone through adrenalectomy. Close microglia-neuron interaction was absent, but was reinstated after corticosterone injection. Our findings offer a new mechanism of microglia-mediated neuronal plasticity during anesthesia recovery, which is mediated through corticosterone, enhancing our understanding of sex differences in brain function.

">Butyrate rescues chlorpyrifos-induced social deficits through inhibition of class I histone deacetylases</a></h4>

              
                Chlorpyrifos (CPF) is a widely used organophosphate pesticide effective through inhibiting acetylcholinesterase, which leads to the accumulation of acetylcholine and continuous nerve stimulation. In addition to its well-known acute toxicity, exposure to CPF has also been linked to chronic conditions such as an increasing risk of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and adverse effects on gut health, including disturbances to the gut microbiome and metabolism. However, the underlying mechanism of CPF's contribution to ASD remains unclear, and the roles of the gut microbiome and gut metabolites in CPF-induced neurodevelopmental toxicity remain elusive. Using a high-throughput social behavior assay, we found that embryonic exposure to CPF induced lasting social deficits in zebrafish. Through a small-scale screen of common health beneficial gut microbiome metabolites, we discovered that butyrate effectively rescued CPF-induced social deficits. RNA sequencing of zebrafish brain tissues revealed that early exposure to CPF induced a lasting suppression of neuronal genes, including many ASD risk genes, and elevated expression of circadian genes. Butyrate partially reversed the suppression of key neuronal genes. Butyrate is a non-selective inhibitor of histone deacetylases (HDACs). Through a series of loss-of-function experiments utilizing CRISPR-Cas9-induced knockouts and selective chemical inhibitors, we found that the class I HDAC, HDAC1, most likely mediates butyrate's rescue effect. Metabolomics analysis detected changes in several nitrogen metabolism-related pathways in the zebrafish gut following CPF exposure. Metagenomics analysis revealed an increase in abundance of the denitrifying bacteria Pseudomonas and a reduction in the nitric oxide-sensitive bacteria Aeromonas in the CPF-exposed zebrafish gut microbiome. Our results connect CPF-exposure with changes in the gut microbiome, metabolome, epigenetics, gene expression, and behavior, inspiring a novel hypothesis for the underlying molecular mechanisms of CPF-induced neurodevelopmental toxicity. In the long run, our findings may help elucidate how CPF exposure contributes to autism risk and inspire therapeutic developments.

">The development of the brain was revealed by brain entropy (BEN) during movie watching from the age of three to twelve years</a></h4>

              
                Mapping the developmental landscape of brain function is a key objective in modern neuroscience, greatly advanced by the public release of neuroimaging datasets. Here, we utilized movie-watching fMRI to study brain entropy (BEN) in 3-12-year-olds from OpenNeuro. The results of the analysis revealed that decreasing BEN within the action-mode network (AMN) serves as a key developmental marker in children. The AMN underpins goal-directed cognition, and its entropy reduction may signify a crucial shift from early, externally driven sensorimotor processing toward the emergence of more internalized, self-referential thought processes associated with the default-mode network. These findings highlight BEN as a powerful and sensitive tool for deciphering the principles of functional brain development.

">CASPR facilitates clearance of degenerating axons by Schwann cells and macrophages after peripheral nerve injury</a></h4>

              
                In the peripheral nervous system (PNS) debris of injured axons is efficiently removed by Schwann cells (SCs) and macrophages (Mphs) - a process which is vital for nerve regeneration. Molecular so-called eat-me signals, mediating axon-SC/axon-Mph crosstalk and debris clearance after injury are just at the beginning of being identified. Herein, we describe the axonal node protein contactin-associated protein (CASPR) as a potential novel signal for axonal debris removal in peripheral nerve injury. In healthy nerves, CASPR is restricted to Ranvier's nodes interacting with glia-derived partner proteins to assure saltatory action potential propagation. In injured murine and human nerves, we describe upregulation and re-localization of CASPR protein along the axons. Enhanced CASPR presence after injury appears to involve local axonal translation rather than transcriptional regulation. Of note, CASPR overexpression in murine central and peripheral neurons in vitro has a growth inhibitory effect. More importantly, axonal debris deriving from injured nerves - and hence having increased CASPR content - are phagocytosed more efficiently than debris of healthy nerves. Interfering with CASPR by function-blocking antibodies strongly reduces axonal debris uptake. This finding demonstrates a functional relevance of CASPR as a potential eat me signal in this process.

We tested for sex and age effects, lateralization, and associations with manual and orofacial motor functions. Manual skills were assessed with a tool-use task; orofacial communication was assessed by individual variation in attention-getting sound production. Chimpanzees showed population-level leftward asymmetries in fractional anisotropy in U-fibers connecting central and inferior cortices, especially in females. Age was inversely associated with radial, axial, and mean diffusivity in these bundles. Right-handed motor skill was linked to stronger leftward fractional anisotropy asymmetries in superior regions. In contrast, more frequent attention-getting sound production was associated with increased leftward asymmetries in inferior regions. These findings show that different motor functions in chimpanzees are linked to region-specific variation in U-fiber integrity along the dorsal–ventral axis, aligning with previous representations of the chimpanzee motor “homunculus.” The observed association between orofacial skill and leftward asymmetry in inferior sensorimotor regions suggests a potential preadaptation for the lateralized speech functions found in modern humans.</span>

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>This manuscript covers my personal history on the search for the neural circuits supporting early developing memory in primates. A series of developmental neuropsychological studies is presented to follow the successive knowledge we gained over several decades on the timing of development of the hippocampus and hippocampal-dependent recognition memory functions in primates. The borrowing of an incidental recognition memory task measuring novelty preference to infer subjects' memory was central to assessing memory in young infant monkeys of only a few weeks old. Data revealed that the emergence of adult-like proficiency in visual recognition and spatial memory tasks sensitive to hippocampal dysfunction is a stepwise process. This progressive development was associated with the gradual maturation of different hippocampal intrinsic circuits (Entorhinal-CA1 and Entorhinal-Dentate Gyrus-CA fields) and their connections with other cortical structures (the perirhinal, parahippocampal, parietal, and prefrontal cortices). We also showed that a similar postnatal maturation of hippocampal-dependent memory is observed in human infants, suggesting important changes in the role of the hippocampus and medial temporal cortical areas in human memory development as well.</p>

<p>We used tract tracing and in vivo physiology to investigate auditory processing in the brainstem of the Tokay gecko. We found conserved patterns of connection in higher-order auditory nuclei and an apparent lack of tonotopy at the level of the auditory midbrain.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>In reptiles, two taxa, lepidosaurs and archosaurs, have ears with thin tympanic membranes that permit sensitive hearing of high-frequency sounds in air. The organization of their central auditory systems may reflect this increased sensitivity to sound. To understand auditory processing in lepidosaurs further, we used tract tracing techniques to examine the organization and connections of the lemniscal and midbrain auditory nuclei in the Tokay gecko. The nuclei of the lateral lemniscus (LLD) consist of anterior (LLDa), medial (LLDm), and posterior (LLDp) subdivisions and receive ascending projections from the contralateral cochlear nuclei (nucleus angularis and nucleus laminaris) and the ipsilateral dorsal superior olive (SOd). LLD projects to the ventral division of the ipsilateral torus semicircularis (TS). In the Tokay gecko, the central nucleus of the torus (TSC) is large, with two major subdivisions, ventral and dorsal. Caudally, the TSC is fused at the midline, with the dorsal divisions adjoining their contralateral homolog. More rostrally, the TSC bifurcates to form two wings below the tectal ventricles. The ventral division of the TSC receives ascending input from NA/NL, SOd, and the lateral lemniscal complex, while both the dorsal and ventral divisions send descending projections to the lateral lemniscal complex. The TSC projects to the auditory thalamic nucleus medialis through the tractus opticus lateralis. Physiological recordings from TSCv injection sites revealed a patchy distribution of best frequencies, while recordings in TSCd were characterized by broad frequency tuning. The tract tracing results revealed conserved anatomical patterns of ascending auditory connections in lizards and archosaurs.</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The Gouldian finch exhibits a head color polymorphism, which is tightly coupled to distinct differences in aggression, stress responses, and parental care. In competitive environments, red-headed birds are more aggressive, are less parental, and exhibit a heightened stress response relative to black-headed birds. The head color polymorphism has been associated with genetic variation in a small noncoding region near the follistatin (<i>FST</i>) gene. Given the regulatory nature of this gene, we hypothesized that <i>FST</i> mRNA would be differentially expressed in association with morph- and sex-specific differences in the brains of red- and black-headed morphs. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed <i>FST</i> gene expression in the Gouldian finch brain using RNAscope in situ hybridization assay. Our results revealed significant differences in <i>FST</i> gene expression between morphs and sex. Specifically, black-headed morphs, regardless of sex, displayed higher <i>FST</i> mRNA levels across multiple brain regions associated with aggression, stress responses, and parental care compared to red-headed morphs. Furthermore, males consistently showed greater <i>FST</i> mRNA levels within the same morph type than females. These findings suggest that head color morph- and sex-specific differences in <i>FST</i> gene expression may underlie the observed morph- and sex-specific differences in aggression, stress responses, and parental care in Gouldian finches.</p>

                Optineurin (OPTN) is a multifunctional cytoplasmic adaptor protein implicated in maintaining neuronal homeostasis through its roles in selective autophagy, vesicle trafficking, and regulation of inflammatory signaling. Mutations in the OPTN gene are causally linked to several neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and primary open-angle glaucoma. Here we have eight optineurin commercial antibodies for western blot, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence using a standardized experimental protocol based on comparing read-outs in knockout cell lines and isogenic parental controls. These studies are part of a larger, collaborative initiative seeking to address antibody reproducibility issues by characterizing commercially available antibodies for human proteins and publishing the results openly as a resource for the scientific community. While the use of antibodies and protocols vary between laboratories, we encourage readers to use this report as a guide to select the most appropriate antibodies for their specific needs.

                Background Artificial intelligence (AI) offers significant opportunities to improve the field of implementation science by supporting key activities such as evidence synthesis, contextual analysis, and decision-making to promote the adoption and sustainability of evidence-based practices. This living scoping review aims to: (1) map applications of AI in implementation research and practice; (2) identify evaluation approaches, reported outcomes, and potential risks; and (3) synthesize reported research gaps and opportunities for advancing the use of AI in implementation science. Methods This scoping review will follow the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodology and the Cochrane guidance for living systematic reviews. A living scoping review is warranted to keep up with the rapid changes in AI and its growing use in implementation science. We will include empirical studies, systematic reviews, grey literature, and policy documents that describe or evaluate applications of AI to support implementation science across the steps of the Knowledge-to-Action (KTA) Model. AI methods and models of interest include machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, large language models, and related technologies and approaches. A search strategy will be applied to bibliographic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, IEEE Xplore, Web of Science), relevant journals, conference proceedings, and preprint servers. Two reviewers will independently screen studies and extract data on AI characteristics, specific implementation task according to the KTA Model, evaluation methods, outcome domains, risks, and research gaps. Extracted data will be analyzed descriptively and synthesized narratively using a mapping approach aligned with the KTA Model. Discussion This living review will consolidate the evidence base on how AI is applied across the spectrum of implementation science. It will inform researchers, policymakers, and practitioners seeking to harness AI to improve the adoption, scale-up, and sustainability of evidence-based interventions, while identifying areas for methodological advancement and risk mitigation.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1032/v2?src=rss">Between Protection and Destruction: The Legal Tension Between Military Necessity and Cultural Heritage Protection in International Humanitarian Law [version 2; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background The relationship between military necessity and the protection of cultural heritage under international humanitarian law has been and continues to be governed by a constant tension that has shaped both doctrine and practice. While the principle of military necessity, rooted in and derived from the 1863 Lieber Code and codified in later instruments such as the 1907 Hague Conventions, remains one of the most fundamental principles permitting the adoption of measures necessary to achieve legitimate military objectives, it has also been used to justify the destruction of cultural property. Conversely, cultural heritage, deserving special protection under instruments such as the 1954 Hague Convention and its Protocols, represents the collective memory and identity of societies. Methods To evaluate the role of military necessity in the prosecution of crimes against cultural heritage, this paper uses a critical doctrinal and analytical approach, looking at both treaty law and international jurisprudence. It asks whether military necessity is a valid practical safeguard or a legal pretext for destruction. Results The paper contends that the incorporation of “imperative military necessity” has engendered critical legal loopholes resulting from warring parties’ exploitation of the prioritization of military interests over the preservation of cultural heritage, rendering cultural heritage vulnerable in armed conflicts. International tribunals, such as the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and the International Criminal Court (ICC), have endeavoured to restrict these justifications by criminalizing deliberate attacks and applying standards of necessity and proportionality. Conclusions The paper concludes that, despite treaties and jurisprudence limiting the scope of military necessity, the ongoing recognition of the necessity exception reveals structural weaknesses in international humanitarian law, thereby rendering cultural heritage vulnerable in armed conflict. Accordingly, it advocates for the strict limitation of the ‘imperative military necessity’ exception to provide better protection for cultural heritage during armed conflict.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-833/v3?src=rss">The Influence of Demographic Characteristics on Academic Staff Performance in Private Chartered Universities in western Uganda [version 3; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Academic staff performance plays a critical role in the success of higher education institutions. In Uganda’s private university sector, understanding how demographic characteristics affect academic staff performance can inform more equitable and effective human resource practices. This study investigated the extent to which demographic factors influence academic performance among academic staff in private universities in Uganda. Methods A cross-sectional quantitative research design was used, involving 386 academic staff members from selected private universities. Data were collected through structured questionnaires and analyzed using Pearson product-moment correlation to assess the relationships between demographic characteristics (gender, age, education level, position, years of teaching experience, and field of specialty) and indicators of academic performance. Results The analysis revealed several statistically significant correlations. The highest level of education attained was positively associated with years of teaching experience (r = .504, p < .01) and academic position (r = .619, p < .01). Years of teaching experience also showed a positive correlation with academic performance (r = .230, p < .01). Gender exhibited a weak but significant negative relationship with education level (r = –.123, p < .05) and teaching experience (r = –.115, p < .05), suggesting gender-related disparities in academic progression. Additionally, age group correlated moderately with education level (r = .292, p < .01) and academic position (r = .295, p < .01), reflecting career advancement over time. Beyond these statistical associations, the findings show that demographic characteristics such as gender, qualifications, academic rank, and field of specialty actively shape academic staff performance through access to opportunities, research engagement, and teaching responsibilities. Conclusions The study demonstrates that demographic factors particularly education level, experience, and academic rank significantly influence academic staff performance in private universities in Uganda. These findings highlight the need for universities to develop staff management and development policies that account for demographic diversity. Tailored interventions in recruitment, promotion, and retention can enhance institutional effectiveness and equity in academic staff development.

[version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Erdheim-Chester disease (ECD) is an extremely rare histiocytic neoplasm with a highly variable and often unpredictable clinical course and prognosis. Multiple organs can be affected mimicking other systemic diseases both clinically and radiologically. This makes timely diagnosis more challenging. Case Presentation We report the case of a 39-year-old male presented with a 15-day history of fever and retrosternal chest pain. Ha has a long history of diabetes insipidus, hypogonadism of unknown aetiology. On exploration, computed tomography revealed retroperitoneal fibrosis and “hairy” kidney appearance. Subsequent multimodality imaging studies showed the extensive multisystemic involvement including the skeletal system, retroperitoneum, pituitary, retroperitoneum, kidneys, heart, central nervous system, myocardium, pleura, lymph nodes and GI tract. Histopathology confirmed CD68+/CD1a- histiocytosis. Molecular analysis for BRAF mutation is currently pending. Pegylated interferon α and corticosteroids induced rapid clinical and biochemical improvement. Therapeutic response using a follow-up 18F-FDG PET scan revealed subsequent improved systemic lesions. Conclusion A prolonged history of unexplained endocrine abnormalities in the context of fever of unknown origin should evoke the diagnosis of ECD. Multimodal imaging is essential for diagnosis and for monitoring treatment response. This case highlights the importance of the multidisciplinary approach that integrates clinical evaluation, histological analysis, and imaging studies for the optimal the management of this disease. Early initiation of immunomodulatory therapy can lead to better outcomes, even prior to confirmation of molecular findings.

                Background The photic sneeze reflex (PSR) is a common but underexplored phenomenon where bright light triggers sneezing, affecting ~30% of the population. This study aimed to characterise the light conditions inducing PSR. Methods One male PSR-affected participant logged sneezing events during a 30-day real-world light exposure study. An indoor setup using a multi-primary LED source and an integrating sphere delivered 30-second light stimuli while pupillometric data were collected. Results A total of 82 sneezing events were recorded, averaging 2.73 sneezes/day (range: 1–6 per event). Illuminance increased tenfold before sneezing, peaking 2 minutes prior, and returned to baseline within 10 minutes. Despite exposure to 150+ stimuli, artificial sneezing was not induced, though high illuminance consistently triggered tickling sensations. Conclusions Sudden increases in environmental lighting can provoke PSR. While artificial stimuli elicited only tickling, further refinement of the protocol could enable reliable PSR induction, thereby facilitating mechanistic research.

                Background Three-dimensional (3D) food printing is an emerging technology with potential applications in personalized nutrition and sustainable food production. However, its success hinges critically on consumer acceptance, which is predominantly determined by the sensory properties of the printed products. A comprehensive synthesis of the literature on the sensory evaluation of 3D-printed foods was needed. Objective This systematic review aimed to map and critically analyse the current state of knowledge on the sensory properties of 3D-printed foods, the methodologies used for their evaluation, and the relationship between printing parameters, material properties, and sensory perception. Methods A systematic literature search was conducted, resulting in the inclusion and analysis of 65 relevant scientific studies. Results The field is experiencing exponential growth, with research focused on chocolate, meat products, and purees, often printed as simple geometric shapes for controlled study. Sensory evaluation relies heavily on affective (hedonic) and descriptive methods (e.g., QDA). A strong link exists between the rheological and textural properties of the food inks ("printability") and the sensory attributes of the final product ("liking or acceptability"). Key challenges include the limited use of existing sensory methods and the need to explore sustainable ingredients. Conclusion The future of the field lies in integrating material science with sensory science to create customized, nutritious, and appealing foods. The application of different sensory methods according to the study objective and further research into the dynamics of oral processing are essential for progress.

                <p>by G.V.T. Swapna, Namita Dube, Monica J. Roth, Gaetano T. Montelione</p>

The Solute Carrier (SLC) superfamily of integral membrane proteins transport a wide array of small molecules across plasma and organelle membranes, and function as important drug transporters and as viral receptors. They populate different conformational states during the solute transport process, including outward-open, intermediate (occluded), and inward-open conformational states. For some SLC proteins this structural “flipping” corresponds to swapping between conformations of their N-terminal and C-terminal symmetry-related sub-structures. Conventional AlphaFold2, AlphaFold3, or Evolutionary Scale Modeling methods typically generate models for only one of these multiple conformational states of SLC proteins. While several AI-based protocols for modeling multiple conformational states of proteins have been described recently, these methods are often impacted by “memorization” of one of the alternative conformational states, and do not always provide both the inward- and outward-open conformations of SLC proteins. Here we assess the impact of memorization in modeling SLC proteins with AlphaFold2/3, and describe a combined ESM – template-based-modeling process, based on a previously described template-based modeling method that relies on the internal pseudo-symmetry of many SLC proteins, to consistently model the alternate conformational states of SLC proteins. We also demonstrate how the resulting multi-state models can be validated by comparison with sequence-based evolutionary co-variance data (ECs) that encode information about contacts present in the various conformational states adopted by the protein. This simple, rapid, and robust approach for modeling conformational landscapes of pseudo-symmetric SLC proteins is demonstrated for several integral membrane protein transporters, including SLC35F2 the receptor of a feline leukemia virus envelope protein required for viral entry into eukaryotic cells.

                <p>by Elena Lara-Simon, Juan Domingo Gispert, Jordi Garcia-Ojalvo, Pablo Villoslada, for the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative </p>

Alzheimer’s disease encompasses multiple biological scales, spanning molecular factors, cells, tissues, and behavioral manifestations. The interplay among these scales in shaping the clinical phenotype is not yet fully comprehended. In particular, there is great interest in understanding the heterogeneity of the clinical aspects of AD in order to improve treatment and prevention, by targeting those aspects most susceptible to the disease. Here we employed a systems biology approach to address this issue, utilizing multilayer network analysis and deep phenotyping. This integrative analysis incorporated genomics, cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, tau and amyloid beta (A<i>β</i>) PET imaging, brain MRI data, risk factors, and clinical information (cognitive tests scores, Clinical Dementia Rating and clinical diagnosis) obtained through the ADNI collaboration. Multilayer networks were built based on mutual information between the elements of each layer and between layers. Boolean simulations allowed us to identify paths that transmit dynamic information across layers. The most prominent path for predicting variables in the cognitive phenotype layer included the PET radiotracer fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) in the posterior cingulate. Combinations of different symptomatic variables, mainly related to mental health (depression, mood swings, drowsiness) and vascular features (hypertension, cardiovascular history), were also part of the paths explaining the average phenotype. Our results show that integrating the flow of information across biological scales reveals relevant paths for AD, which can be subsequently explored as potential biomarkers or therapeutic targets. In particular, our results point for paths related with brain hypometabolism as a key feature in AD.

                <p>by Sandesh Acharya, Pathum Kossinna, Qingrun Zhang, Jiami Guo</p>

With the rapid emergence of single-cell transcriptomics datasets, reproducible marker genes and functional annotation of cell type or state is becoming increasingly important. Conventional methods that rely on differential gene expression (DEG) analysis lack both consistency across datasets and functional annotations of selected markers. Here, we present scSCOPE, an R-based platform that utilizes stabilized LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) feature selection, bootstrapped co-expression networks, and pathway enrichments to identify reproducible and functionally relevant marker genes and associated pathways in scRNAseq datasets. Using 9 scRNAseq datasets from human and mouse immune cells generated by different sequencing technologies, we show that scSCOPE outperforms other conventional methods by automatically identifying cell type-specific marker genes and pathways with the highest consistency across all datasets. scSCOPE’s gene co-expression and pathway analyses also provide in-depth molecular insights into the functionality of identified marker genes. We anticipate that scSCOPE will greatly improve cell type annotation and accelerate the design of experimental validation and functional investigations on cell heterogeneity.

                <p>by Clara T. Friedman, Minqi Wang, Thomas Yerxa, Bryce A. Arseneau, Xin Huang, Emily A. Cooper</p>

Differentiating objects, people, and animals from their surroundings is a key visual function, referred to as figure-ground segregation. Psychological research has established that humans use diverse visual features such as shape, texture, motion, and distance to identify figures. However, our understanding of the neural computations supporting figure-ground segregation remains incomplete. Recent neurophysiological observations in cortical area MT of primates – a region important for motion and depth processing – suggest that neurons in this area <i>favor</i> visual features that intuitively map onto figures, such as faster motion and closer distances. Inspired by these new observations, here we test the hypothesis that figures in natural scenes contain statistical regularities in motion and distance detectable at the scale of neuronal receptive fields. We combined statistical measurements of motion and distance from natural scenes with figure-ground annotations and simulations of receptive field inputs. Within simulated receptive fields, inputs corresponding to figures tended to move faster and more coherently, and tended to be nearer in distance, than the nearby ground. Our simulation predicts that the statistical regularities associated with figure motion increase notably with retinal eccentricity, while the distance statistics do not. Lastly, we implemented a simple neural population model illustrating how MT response properties, in combination with these statistics, can prioritize the representation of visual features associated with figures. These results enrich our understanding of the computations supporting figure-ground segregation, provide a normative account for recent neurophysiological observations, and contribute to converging lines of evidence that the brain exploits natural statistics to prioritize behaviorally-relevant information.

Spatial transcriptomics is a rapidly developing field of single-cell genomics that quantitatively measures gene expression while providing spatial information within tissues. A key challenge in spatial transcriptomics is identifying spatially structured domains, which involves analyzing transcriptomic data to find clusters of cells with similar expression patterns and their spatial distribution. To address these challenges, we propose a novel deep-learning method called DMGCN for domain identification. The process begins with preprocessing that constructs two types of graphs: a spatial graph based on Euclidean distance and a feature graph based on Cosine distance. These graphs represent spatial positions and gene expressions, respectively. The embeddings of both graphs are generated using a multi-view graph convolutional encoder with an attention mechanism, enabling separate and co-convolution of the graphs, as well as corrupted feature convolution for contrastive learning. Finally, a fully connected network (FCN) decoder is employed to generate domain labels and reconstruct gene expressions for downstream analysis. Experimental results demonstrate that DMGCN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in various tasks, including spatial clustering, trajectory inference, and gene expression broadcasting.

                <p>by Ci Fu, Emily H. Xiong, Livia Kupczok, Linda S. Archambault, Timothy R. W. Wang, Caitlin Holleran, Duncan Carruthers-Lay, Ting Xuan Zhuang, Sofia Marcoccia, Haoyang Zhang, Kevin Chen, Daniel Anderson, Bonnie Yiu, Zhongle Liu, Lydia Herzel, Nicole Robbins, Leah E. Cowen</p>

A small percentage of species in the fungal kingdom can cause devastating infections in humans, with <i>Candida albicans</i> reigning as a leading cause of systemic disease. One of the key virulence phenotypes for pathogenic fungi is the ability to survive at host body temperature; however, a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms that orchestrate thermal adaptation in fungi remains incomplete. In this study, we expand the largest functional genomics resource in <i>C. albicans,</i> reaching 71.3% coverage of the entire genome, and perform screens under six different temperatures to identify genes important for temperature-dependent fitness. We describe the function of genes involved in translation (<i>GAR1</i>), splicing (<i>C1_11680C</i> or <i>YSF3</i>), and cell cycle progression (<i>C6_00110C</i> or <i>RHT1</i>) in enabling fungal survival at both low and high temperatures. Through experimental evolution, we also show that <i>C. albicans</i> can rapidly overcome deleterious mutations and adapt to extreme temperature environments. Overall, our study highlights the transformative potential of genome-wide functional genomics to uncover critical vulnerabilities in pathogenic fungi.

                Background Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is linked to cognitive dysfunction, and cognitive motor dual-task blindfold training (CMDBT) may enhance cognition by engaging procedural memory centers. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of CMDBT combined with aerobic and resistance exercises on cognitive function in individuals with T2DM. Methods A single-center, parallel-group randomized controlled trial with pre- and post-intervention assessments was conducted. Sixty two adults with T2DM were randomly allocated to an experimental group (CMDBT plus moderate-intensity aerobic and resistance training; n = 31) or a control group (aerobic and resistance training only; n = 31). Both groups trained three times per week for 12 weeks. Cognitive function was assessed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) at baseline and after the 12-week intervention. Results Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics were comparable between groups (all p > 0.05). After 12 weeks, the experimental group showed a mean MoCA increase of 3.32 ± 1.74 to 29.13 ± 0.76 (p < 0.0001), exceeding the minimal clinically important difference of 2.3 points, whereas the control group improved by 0.94 points (25.77 ± 1.45 to 26.71 ± 1.37; p = 0.0006). The adjusted between-group difference was 2.38 points (p = 0.0001), demonstrating a significantly greater cognitive benefit with CMDBT. Conclusion CMDBT combined with conventional exercises is more effective than CMDT or conventional therapy alone in enhancing cognition and in T2DM, supporting its integration into rehabilitation programs.

                Neuromarketing has emerged as a rigorous interdisciplinary paradigm for probing the latent dimensions of consumer behaviour. Through synthesizing insights from cognitive science with advanced neurophysiological methodologies, it elucidates the neural and psychological mechanisms underlying decision- making process, thereby offering a nuanced extension to contemporary marketing theory.Through non-invasive techniques such as Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), Electroencephalography (EEG), Positron Emission Tomography (PET), Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), Electromyography, biometric sensors, and implicit association tests, researchers can investigate how emotion, memory, and sensory inputs shape purchasing behaviour. As interest in the neural underpinnings of consumer choice continues to grow, neuromarketing has emerged as a dynamic and evolving field. These novel approaches navigate practical insights for tailoring marketing strategies to align with consumer preferences. Understanding consumer behaviour through these advanced, non-invasive techniques is becoming essential for organisations aiming to create impactful, evidence-based campaigns. This research reviews the most prominent non-invasive techniques and evaluates how neuromarketing frameworks can reinterpret two decades of existing literature to inform future marketing practices.

                Amplicon sequencing (AmpSeq) is a methodology that targets specific genomic regions of interest for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification so that they can be sequenced to a high depth of coverage. Amplicons are typically chosen to be highly polymorphic, usually with several highly informative, high frequency single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) segregating in an amplicon of 100–200 base pair (bp). This allows high sensitivity detection and quantification of the frequency of each sequence within each sample making it suitable for applications such as low frequency somatic mosaicism detection or minor clone detection in mixed samples. AmpSeq is being increasingly applied to both biological and medical studies, in applications such as cancer, infectious diseases and brain mosaicism studies. Current bioinformatics pipelines for AmpSeq data processing lack downstream analysis, have difficulty distinguishing between true sequences and PCR sequencing errors and artifacts, and often require bioinformatic expertise. We present a new R package: AmpSeqR, designed for the processing of deep short-read amplicon sequencing data, with a focus on infectious diseases. The pipeline integrates several existing R packages combining them with newly developed functions to perform optimal filtering of reads to remove noise and improve the accuracy of the detected sequences data, permitting detection of very low frequency clones in mixed samples. The package provides useful functions including data pre-processing, amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) estimation, data post-processing, data visualization, and automatically generates a comprehensive Rmarkdown report that contains all essential results facilitating easy inclusion into reports and publications. AmpSeqR is publicly available at https://github.com/bahlolab/AmpSeqR.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1131/v1?src=rss">Bringing Numbers to Life and Reducing Anxiety: An Augmented Reality and Haptic Feedback-Based Mathematics Game for Primary School Students [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Mathematics is a basic discipline which causes anxiety to primary school students, resulting in reduced motivation for learning and poor achievements. Traditional instruction heavily leans on abstract symbols, which can add to cognitive load and a feeling of emotional opposition. To address this issue, this study developed a learning model integrating augmented reality (AR) and haptic feedback to create an interactive and multisensory mathematics experience. A quasi-experimental design was conducted with 120 students divided into experimental and control groups. The experimental group used the AR–haptic mathematics game for six weeks, while the control group learned through textbooks and teacher explanations. Data was gathered by using the conceptual understanding tests, a mathematics anxiety scale, classroom observations and student interviews. The quantitative data were analyzed by t-test, ANCOVA and MANOVA analysis; qualitative data were analyzed positionally. The results indicated significant progress in experimental groups’ conceptual understanding and mathematics anxiety decrease when compared to the control group. The mean for the post-test experimental group was 82, and for the control group, it was 62 with a large effect size. The average level of maths anxiety decreased in the experimental group from 3.2 to 1.8 on a five-point scale. Qualitative feedback revealed that students found the game engaging, enjoyable, and less intimidating than traditional lessons. The integration of AR and haptic feedback effectively enhanced both cognitive and affective outcomes in mathematics learning. The multisensory environment enabled students to interact with abstract concepts in tangible ways, reducing anxiety and promoting positive attitudes toward mathematics. This provides a proof of concept for the effectiveness of immersive technologies as assistive tools in the enhancement of academic achievement and emotional health related to elementary level mathematics learning.

                Background Infertility has become a significant issue that requires attention as its prevalence has increased globally and nationally in Saudi Arabia over the past few decades. This study aimed to explore patients’ perceptions towards infertility and in vitro fertilization-related services. Additionally, this study examined the barriers that prevent couples from seeking infertility treatment and IVF in Khobar and Dammam, Saudi Arabia. Methods This study employed a qualitative, hybrid thematic analysis approach. Fifteen participants were included in the study. Participants were divided into three categories: infertility patients, infertility caregivers, and administrative staff working in infertility clinics. Results This study identified four main themes: patients’ experiences, infertility services in Eastern Province, and perceived barriers to receiving treatment. Participants reported that they believed infertility was on the rise, especially male infertility. The reported obstacles included financial burdens, lack of awareness, societal influences, and lengthy, complex treatment processes. Conclusions This study highlights the significant barriers that couples encounter in accessing infertility treatment. These findings emphasize the urgent need for improved public health policies, such as utilizing case management to support patients and incorporating insurance coverage for infertility treatments, along with enhanced support services.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1129/v1?src=rss">Integration of Break Dance and Computational Physics: An Interdisciplinary Approach to Contextualized Teaching [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background This study presents an interdisciplinary pedagogical approach aimed at contextualizing the teaching of classical mechanics through the computational analysis of Break Dance movements. Situated within a constructivist framework, the research explores how culturally embedded practices—specifically urban dance—can serve as a medium for fostering conceptual understanding of physics in non-formal educational settings. By leveraging the artistic and kinesthetic dimensions of Break Dance, the study seeks to bridge the gap between abstract scientific content and learners’ lived experiences. Method A mixed-method, exploratory design was employed with a purposive sample of ten dancers (aged 13–30) affiliated with a community-based urban dance school in Bogotá, Colombia. Over the course of six three-hour sessions, participants engaged in movement analysis using Tracker video software, supported by pre- and post-intervention semi-structured interviews. The research design incorporated thematic analysis to interpret qualitative data, complemented by the kinematic study of body movement parameters such as angular velocity and center of mass. Results Findings indicate a marked cognitive shift among participants from intuitive and superficial conceptions to a more technical and applied understanding of physics principles. The integration of computational tools allowed dancers to visualize and internalize biomechanical variables relevant to their performance. Participants reported enhanced bodily control, injury prevention, and aesthetic execution, alongside increased motivation and collaborative learning. Conclusions The study concludes that embedding scientific content within culturally relevant, embodied practices—mediated by educational technologies—can significantly enhance learning outcomes in physics. The use of Tracker software not only demystified abstract concepts but also redefined physics as accessible and contextually meaningful. These results underscore the pedagogical potential of transdisciplinary, arts-integrated methodologies to foster inclusive, situated, and cognitively rich science education in non-traditional environments.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1128/v1?src=rss">Gender equity in scientific production in Peru and Colombia: reality or utopia in public universities? [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Within the context of research, gender equity in public universities entails significant challenges that must be addressed, leading to the restructuring of processes related to philosophy, paradigm, and management policies. This restructuring enables the conceptualization of an educational paradigm in which both men and women can cultivate their potential in an equitable manner, thereby generating scientific, technological, social, and humanistic knowledge within the scientific realm. Methods The objective of this research was to analyze the challenges and opportunities associated with achieving gender equity in the scientific production of national universities in Peru and Colombia. A mixed-methods approach was employed to gain a global understanding of the phenomenon under study, allowing for the analysis of both quantitative and qualitative data depending on the research focus. The population and sample were defined by the national universities of Peru and Colombia, analyzing scientific production in both countries and establishing trends between male and female contributors. The technique used for quantitative data was documentary analysis of scientific production, utilizing the Scopus database for analysis. Qualitative data were collected through interviews with research managers. Instruments included a summary sheet and an interview protocol. Results The results indicate a pronounced tendency toward higher scientific production among men across various fields of knowledge. This phenomenon exacerbates the existing gender parity gap and effectively relegates women to a secondary role within the academic landscape. Conclusions It is concluded that national universities in Peru and Colombia must undergo restructuring processes in their organizational functions, with gender equity as a central component, in order to contribute to the co-construction of a fair and balanced society.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1127/v1?src=rss">Parents’ roles in young learners’ motivation and task engagement in Indonesian primary schools: Questionnaire development and validation [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Parental involvement in a child’s second language learning is important because it affects the process and outcomes. No research has been conducted in the Indonesian context on what roles parents play in their children’s motivation and task engagement. Methods This study aimed to develop and validate an instrument to measure how parents impact young learners’ motivation to learn English and to engage with tasks. Participants were 270 parents of fifth graders learning English at nine public and private schools in Padang. The instrument was developed by analysing the literature and existing tools and creating new items. After getting expert feedback and piloting the survey, we assessed its validity and reliability. Research questions examined factors affecting its effectiveness. Results The questionnaire was analysed through EFA and CFA via jamovi. EFA identified five dimensions: (1) parental involvement, (2) expectations, (3) access to resources, (4) enrichment and (5) extracurricular activities. The CFA fit indices (CFI = .945, TLI = .934, SRMR = .045, RMSEA = .059) confirmed the model’s suitability. The questionnaire showed strong validity and reliability, with measures exceeding.70, making it effective for gathering data on parental roles in Indonesian children’s learning of English. Conclusions This validation study offers an effective diagnostic tool for teachers, administrators, and policymakers to pinpoint the particular dimensions of parental involvement that affect children’s motivation and task engagement as they learn English. The findings highlight the critical role of recognising parents as active collaborators along the language learning journey. The study improves the theoretical understanding of the impact of parental behaviour in educational psychology and motivation studies. The findings are consistent with self-determination theory, providing a more nuanced perspective to explore how different forms of parental participation influence student motivation and task engagement in learning English.

                <img src="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/ab5c0a8c-0081-4ab3-970d-c40f5b4c5256/ana78050-toc-0001-m.png"
     alt="Recombinant Human Neuregulin1-β1 Significantly Reduces Schwannoma Growth in Mice"/>
<p>rhNRGβ1-Replacement-Therapy: Under physiological conditions, NRGβ1 is expressed on axons (in orange), where it activates ERBB2 receptors, facilitating successful nerve regeneration following injury. However, loss of NF2 leads to a reduction in NRGβ1-expression and increased ErbB2 levels on Schwann cells (in green), which contributes to schwannoma formation, particularly in conditions like NF2-related schwannomatosis. The replacement of NRGβ1-signaling using recombinant human Neuregulin1-β1 (rhNRGβ1) represents a new strategy for schwannoma treatment. This approach reduces schwannoma growth by promoting Schwann cell differentiation and maturation.
</p>
<br/>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Schwannomas are benign tumors that arise from Schwann cells of the nerve sheath, and their management presents a significant clinical challenge, particularly in genetic conditions like NF2-related schwannomatosis (NF2-SWN). Although current treatments, including surgery, radiation, and repurposed pharmacological agents, can be effective, they are often limited by issues such as tumor recurrence and the risk of nerve function impairment. This study aims to evaluate the potential of recombinant human Neuregulin1 beta 1 (rhNRGβ1) to inhibit schwannoma growth and promote Schwann cell differentiation in preclinical models.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We investigated the therapeutic potential of rhNRGβ1, a recombinant human epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain of Neuregulin1 beta 1, as a growth-inhibitory agent for schwannomas. Two distinct mouse models were used to assess its efficacy, with both histological and functional endpoints analyzed.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Both systemic and local administration of rhNRGβ1 resulted in a significant reduction in schwannoma tumor growth. Mechanistically, rhNRGβ1 not only inhibited tumor proliferation, but also promoted the differentiation of both proliferative and de-differentiated Schwann cells, suggesting a dual action of growth inhibition and cellular maturation.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These findings highlight the therapeutic potential of rhNRG1-β1 in managing schwannomas, not only by reducing tumor growth, but also by promoting the maturation and functional restoration of Schwann cells. This dual effect provides a promising avenue for novel therapeutic strategies aimed at addressing both the growth and cellular differentiation challenges associated with schwannomas in NF2-SWN and other related conditions.

     alt="Characterizing Evoked Movement Patterns and Connectivity in Sensorimotor Cortex After Sensory Loss in Squirrel Monkeys"/>
<p>Excitability to long-train intracortical microstimulation in the primary somatosensory cortex after recovery from long-term sensory loss tended to be altered but was not statistically different from that of normal and intact hemispheres. Cortical connection patterns of areas 3b and M1 were consistent with early findings, characterized by the presence of sparse but widespread connections after sensory loss. The results suggest that the sensorimotor system undergoes both anatomical and functional reorganization in response to compensating for sensory loss.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Sensory feedback is crucial for movement execution, especially in the highly specialized skilled hand use in humans and other primates. Extensive sensory loss of tactile and proprioceptive inputs from the hand initially results in severe motor deficits, but recovery occurs gradually over time. To determine how sensory loss from one hand affects evoked forelimb movements from sensorimotor cortical areas, lesions were selectively placed in the ascending somatosensory pathway in the dorsal column in the cervical spinal cord (C5, DCL) of three squirrel monkeys. After 1 year of postlesion recovery, we examined the long-term effects of DCL on motor response patterns evoked by long-train intracortical microstimulation (LT-ICMS) from the hand cortex in primary motor cortex (M1) and somatosensory areas 3a, 3b, and 1 in both control and DCL groups. Somatosensory receptive fields were mapped primarily to define the borders of area 3b, as well as to compare somatosensory responses with motor responses after DCL. Corticocortical connections were investigated by injecting neuroanatomical tracers into the sensory-deprived forelimb regions of 3b and M1. We found that after somatosensory loss and compensation, LT-ICMS-evoked movement maps for M1 and deprived somatosensory areas did not show statistically detectable effects of DCL. Results were consistent with our earlier findings of the effects of long-term recovery from DCL on somatosensory response maps and connections among somatosensory areas. We now show that the effects of long-term DCL on evoked motor responses in somatosensory cortex were limited, while the connections between M1 cortex and somatosensory cortical areas were more widespread.</p>

                Pilat et al. show that the Alzheimer’s disease (AD)-associated gain-of-function mutation, T96K, in the microglial receptor Trem2 reduces levels of soluble Trem2 and Aβ uptake in microglial cells and impairs microglial function, specifically in female 5xFAD mice. These findings should help guide the development of TREM2-targeted therapies for treating AD.
