	<p>Rationale: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of several sites, such as the thalamus, has been shown to reduce seizure frequency and interictal epileptiform activity in patients with refractory epilepsy. Recent findings have demonstrated that the insula is part of the &amp;amp;lsquo;rich club&amp;amp;rsquo; of highly connected brain regions. This pilot study investigated short-term effects of high-frequency (HF) insular DBS on interictal epileptiform discharge (IED) rate in patients with refractory epilepsy. Methods: Six patients with drug-resistant epilepsy undergoing an intracranial electroencephalographic study received two sets of 10 min continuous 150 Hz HF-DBS of the insula. For each patient, epileptiform activity was analyzed for a total of 80 min, starting 20 min prior to stimulation set 1 (S1), and ending 20 min after stimulation set 2 (S2). All IEDs were identified and classified according to their anatomic localization by a board-certified epileptologist. The IED rate during the 20 min preceding S1 served as a baseline for comparison with IED rate during S1, S2 and post-stimulation periods. Results: HF-DBS of the anterior insula (aINS) was performed in a patient with an aINS epileptic focus (patient 1). HF-DBS of the posterior insula (pINS) was performed in two patients with a pINS epileptic focus (patients 2 and 4), in one patient with an aINS focus (patient 3), and in two non-insular patients (patients 5 and 6). The total IED (irrespective of their location) rate significantly decreased (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01) in two patients (patients 1 and 2) during the stimulation period, whereas it significantly increased (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01) in one patient (patient 6); there was no change in the other three patients. Looking at subsets of spike localization, HF-DBS of the aINS significantly reduced aINS and orbitofrontal IEDs in patient 1 (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01), while HF-DBS of the pINS had an effect on pINS IEDs (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01) in both patients with a pINS focus; there was no significant effect of HF-DBS of the insula on IEDs in temporal or other frontal regions. Conclusion: Short-term HF-DBS of the insula had heterogeneous effects on the IED rate. Further work is required to examine factors underlying these heterogeneous effects, such as stimulation frequency, location of IEDs and subregions of the insula stimulated.</p>

	<p>Hyperacusis (decreased sound tolerance) is a prevalent complaint. Yet, to date, no research has qualitatively evaluated the types of problems experienced by adults with hyperacusis. Our service evaluation aims to determine the hyperacusis-related problem domains reported by patients and the degree to which these domains were reported together. Retrospective analysis was conducted on an anonymised clinical dataset from 306 patients who attended a UK tinnitus and hyperacusis treatment centre between 1994 and 2017. Conventional content analysis was used to categorise responses to the question &amp;amp;lsquo;Why is hyperacusis a problem?&amp;amp;rsquo; into domains which were then subjected to a cluster analysis. Twenty-five problem domains were identified, of which 12 were further classified into three overarching categories. &amp;amp;lsquo;Fear&amp;amp;rsquo;, &amp;amp;lsquo;Reduced quality of life&amp;amp;rsquo; and &amp;amp;lsquo;Physical reaction to sound&amp;amp;rsquo; were most frequently reported problems. Cluster analysis revealed that &amp;amp;lsquo;Sleep difficulties&amp;amp;rsquo; and &amp;amp;lsquo;Despondency&amp;amp;rsquo;, were commonly reported together. Adults with hyperacusis face many challenges in their everyday lives. The nature of these problems indicates the need to develop complex interventions and assessments to aid management of hyperacusis. Current hyperacusis questionnaires may be useful in identifying some problem domains, but further assessment thorough patient interviews is required to fully explore all potential problems and make informed decisions about treatment.</p>

	<p>Background: Nowadays, controversy exists regarding the stage of cognitive decline and/or dementia where voting capacity is diminished. Aim: To evaluate whether general cognitive status in advancing age predicts voting capacity in its specific aspects. Methods: The study sample comprised 391 people: 88 cognitively healthy older adults (CH), 150 people with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and 153 people with Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease dementia (ADD). The assessment included CAT-V for the voting capacity and Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) for general cognitive ability. ANOVAs and ROC curves were the tools of statistical analysis towards (a) indicating under which MMSE rate participants are incapable of voting and (b) whether the CAT-V total score can discriminate people with dementia (PwADD) from people without dementia (PwtD). Results: Out of the six CAT-V questions, one question was associated with a low MMSE cutoff score (19.50), having excellent sensitivity (92.5%) and specificity (77.20%), whilst the other five questions presented a higher MMSE cutoff score, with a good sensitivity (78.4% to 87.6%) and specificity (75.3% to 81.7%), indicating that voting difficulties are associated with cognitive status. Secondarily, the total CAT-V score discriminates PwADD from PwtD of 51&amp;amp;ndash;65 years (sensitivity 93.2%/specificity 100%&amp;amp;mdash;excellent), PwADD from PwtD of 66&amp;amp;ndash;75 years (sensitivity 73.3%/specificity 97.1%&amp;amp;mdash;good), PwADD from PwtD of 76&amp;amp;ndash;85 years (sensitivity 92.2%/specificity 64.7%&amp;amp;mdash;good), whilst for 86&amp;amp;ndash;95 years, a cutoff of 9.5 resulted in perfect sensitivity and specificity (100%). Conclusion: According to MMSE, PwADD have no full voting competence, whilst PwtD seem to have intact voting capacity. The calculated cut-off scores indicate that only people who score more than 28 points on the MMSE have voting capacity.</p>

                TBK1 is a serine-threonine protein kinase that has been linked to a number of diseases including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia. Reproducible research on TBK1 has been hampered by the lack of well characterized antibodies. In this study, we characterized 11 commercial antibodies for TBK1 for use in immunoblot, immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation, using an isogeneic knock-out cell line as a control. We identify antibodies that appear specific for all three applications but invite the readers to interpret the present findings based on their own scientific expertise and use this report as a guide to select the most appropriate antibody for their specific needs.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Factors influencing COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and hesitancy among pharmacy students in Bangladesh: a cross-sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: In the wake of COVID-19 prevention, a growing attention has been devoted to administering vaccines among various sub-group populations including community health care providers. As a community health worker pharmacists and pharmacy students played a crucial role in patient-centered services for managing COVID-19. Examining pharmacy students’ vaccine acceptance intent has great potential in understanding how pharmacists’ perception impacts community people. This study investigated COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among pharmacy students in Bangladesh and identified the potential factors associated with their vaccine acceptance and hesitancy. Methods: An anonymous questionnaire was deployed online using Google forms in English and conveniently sent to 1190 pharmacy students at different universities between 15th October 2021 and 15th December 2021. The convenience sampling consisted of 1034 student pharmacists (response rate 86.9%) who participated in this study. Binary logistic regressions and Chi-squared test were used for rationalizing the study objectives. Results: The pooled COVID-19 vaccine acceptance rate was 908 (87.8%; 95% CI 85.8─87.8) among student pharmacists while 29.6% (95% CI 25.4─33.9) admitted the willingness to pay (WTP) for a COVID-19 vaccine. Out of 12 vital predictive factors, “safety,” “efficacy,” and “trust” had the strongest significant and positive association with vaccine acceptance (p=0.000). The logistic analysis also revealed that “communication” and “information sufficiency” had a significant positive association with vaccine acceptance (p=0.035 and 0.038, respectively) among student pharmacists. Although the odds of accepting the COVID-19 vaccine were found to be 1.1; an insignificant association between gender and vaccine acceptance was observed in the Chi-squared test. Conclusions: The prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine apprehension will reduce if vaccine-related information becomes more publicly available. Ensuring easy access to scientific information with evidence-based and tailored communication would enhance vaccine acceptance among pharmacy students. Implementation of multidisciplinary educational intervention would support the health care students to achieve adequate knowledge on vaccination consequences.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Safety, quality, and nutritional aspect of smoked barracuda fish [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Barracuda fish has a superior nutritional content, so it can be utilized as raw material for smoked fish products. The smoking method most commonly applied in Indonesia is traditional smoking. The traditional smoking process implemented commercially in Indonesia still uses simple equipment and sanitation is typically not monitored. Traditional smoking used at high temperatures can cause contamination of the products, such as with chemicals and microbes. Liquid smoke can be used to overcome these disadvantages. The study aimed to evaluate the nutritional, chemical, and microbial content of fresh and smoked barracuda processed using different smoking methods, namely traditional and liquid smoke. Methods: Barracuda fish were smoked using different smoking methods, traditional and liquid smoke. The traditional method used a simple smoking furnace, while the liquid smoke method was carried out by immersing the fish in a 5% liquid smoke solution. Then, the smoked barracuda were analyzed with various methods, such as proximate, heavy metals, histamine, benzo[a]pyrene, and total microbes (TPC). Data was analyzed using ANOVA at significance level (p < 0.05) followed by Duncan’s test models using SPSS v.16. Results: Smoked fish treated with liquid smoke had a lower value of Arsenic heavy metal (As), at 0.73 mg/kg compared to the traditional method at 1.93 mg/kg; no histamine and carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) compounds were detected, namely benzo[a]pyrene; and liquid smoked fish can inhibit the growth of bacteria which can be seen from total bacteria value of 4.6 x 10 colonies/g Conclusions: Smoked fish processed using a liquid smoke was safer for consumption by the consumer.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: An unusual case of small bowel volvulus due to appendicitis associated with pneumatosis intestinalis: Review of the literature [version 2; peer review: 3 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Pneumatosis cystoid intestinalis is a rare disease reported in the literature affecting 0.03% of the population. It has a variety of causes and its manifestation may change widely. It usually presents as a marginal finding resulting from various gastrointestinal pathologies. In the acute complicated form of pneumatosis intestinalis, management is challenging for physicians and surgeons. We present a case of a 60-year-old patient who was admitted to our surgical department with a symptomatology suggestive of small bowel occlusion. Computed tomography demonstrated ileal volvulus associated with parietal signs suffering and pneumoperitoneum. An emergent exploratory laparoscopy followed by conversion was performed demonstrating segmental ileal pneumatosis intestinalis secondary to a small bowel volvulus due to an inflammatory appendix wrapping around the distal ileum. Further, detorsion, retrograde draining, and appendectomy were performed because there were no signs of necrosis and the appendix was pathological. The postoperative course was uneventful. This case is exceedingly rare in the literature, because it was featured by the ileal volvulus due to appendicitis.This case report emphasizes the importance of surgical procedures in the management of symptomatic pneumatosis intestinalis associated to an acute abdomen.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Towards achieving lightweight intrusion detection systems in Internet of Things, the role of incremental machine learning: A systematic literature review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                While the benefits of IoT cannot be overstated, its computational constraints make it challenging to deploy security methodologies that have been deployed in traditional computing systems. The benefits and computational constraints have made IoT systems attractive to cyber-attacks. One way to mitigate these attacks is to detect them. In this study, a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) has been conducted to analyze the role of incremental machine learning in achieving lightweight intrusion detection for IoT systems. The study analyzed existing incremental machine learning approaches used in designing intrusion detection systems for IoT ecosystems, emphasizing the incremental methods used in detecting intrusions, the datasets used to evaluate these methods, and how the method achieves lightweight status. The SLR outlined the contributions of each study, focusing on their strengths and gaps, the datasets used, and the incremental machine learning model used. This study revealed that incremental learning approaches in detecting intrusion in IoT systems are in their infant stage. Over 12 years, from 2010 to 2022, a total of twenty-one (21) studies were carried out in IDSs using incremental machine learning, with eight (8) studies carried out in IoT systems. In addition to reviewing the literature, we offer suggestions for improving existing solutions and achieving lightweight IDS for IoT systems. We also discussed some problems with making lightweight IDS for IoT systems and areas where more research could be done in the future.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Staining ability of herbal tea preparations on a nano-filled composite restorative material – an in-vitro study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Discoloration of tooth-colored restorations due to various factors is one of the principal causes behind the failure of aesthetics. There has been an surge in the consumption of herbal beverages in recent times and the dietary factors play a potential role in the discoloration tooth-coloured restorations. This study was done to juxtapose the staining ability of green tea (GT), moringa tea (MT), and hibiscus tea (HT) on a nano-filled composite restorative material. Methods: The study was conducted in-vitro on composite samples prepared using moulds. 112 discs were prepared from FiltekTM Z350XT composite using a brass mould lined with mylar strips. Samples were divided into GT, MT, HT, and artificial saliva (AS) groups and immersed in freshly prepared beverages for 15 minutes each day for 45 days. Digital reflectance spectrophotometer was utilized to record color at baseline, 30, and 45 days. Repeated-measures ANOVA with a post-hoc Bonferroni test was used to compare groups within each group. ANOVA with a post-hoc Games Howell test was used to compare mean differences in ΔE among the groups. Results: Maximum discoloration was observed in the GT, followed by HT and MT, with the least being in the AS group at the end of 30 and 45 days (P<0.001 and P<0.001) respectively. Conclusions: The universal nano-filled composite material showed clinically detectable discoloration when exposed to Green Tea, Hibiscus Tea, and Moringa Tea which increased with time. Herbal beverages have the potential to cause discoloration of the composite resin which is often the choice of material for anterior aesthetic restorations.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Effect of planting density on root biomass and distribution, and soil organic carbon stock of Acacia decurrens stands in Northwestern Ethiopia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The expanding Acacia decurrens woodlots in Northwestern Ethiopia is recognized for carbon storage via root biomass and soil organic carbon (SOC) enhancement but its planting densities have varied considerably. This study evaluated the effect of planting density on the root biomass, SOC stock, and vertical distributions in the stands. Methods: Five planting densities (0.5 m x 0.5 m, 0.75 m x 0.75 m, 1 m x 1 m, 1.25 m x 1.25 m, and 1.5 m x 1.5 m) were replicated four times with randomized complete block design. Soil core (6.67 cm diameter) and pit (900 cm2 area) methods were used to collect fine and coarse root samples within 0–50 cm soil depth (having five soil layers in 10 cm intervals), respectively. Fine root biomass samples were classified as live and dead (necromass) and further as tree and herbaceous root. All root biomass samples were washed, oven-dried, weighed, and standardized into gram per meter square (g m-2) for root biomass comparisons for each planting density and soil depth, then summed up for 0–50 cm depth as a total root biomass. The vertical distributions of fine and coarse root biomass at each depth were expressed as a percentage (in decimal) of the total root biomass (0–50 cm). Conclusions: Planting density had significant effects on root biomass, SOC stock, and root distributions (P < 0.05) but inconsistent for the percentage of SOC stock at all soil layers except at 40-50 cm. Planting A. decurrens with high density is recommended to increase root biomass, SOC, and percentage of roots in deep soil layers. Further study is suggested for the effects of stand age on root biomass dynamics and SOC stock with large scale.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Retinopathy of prematurity: Metabolic risk factors</a></h4>

              
                At preterm birth, the retina is incompletely vascularized. Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is initiated by the postnatal suppression of physiological retinal vascular development that would normally occur in utero. As the neural retina slowly matures, increasing metabolic demand including in the peripheral avascular retina, leads to signals for compensatory but pathological neovascularization. Currently, only late neovascular ROP is treated. ROP could be prevented by promoting normal vascular growth. Early perinatal metabolic dysregulation is a strong but understudied risk factor for ROP and other long-term sequelae of preterm birth. We will discuss the metabolic and oxygen needs of retina, current treatments, and potential interventions to promote normal vessel growth including control of postnatal hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia and hyperoxia-induced retinal metabolic alterations. Early supplementation of missing nutrients and growth factors and control of supplemental oxygen promotes physiological retinal development. We will discuss the current knowledge gap in retinal metabolism after preterm birth.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Comparative genomics reveals insight into the evolutionary origin of massively scrambled genomes</a></h4>

              
                Ciliates are microbial eukaryotes that undergo extensive programmed genome rearrangement, a natural genome editing process that converts long germline chromosomes into smaller gene-rich somatic chromosomes. Three well-studied ciliates include <i>Oxytricha trifallax</i>, <i>Tetrahymena thermophila</i> and <i>Paramecium tetraurelia</i>, but only the <i>Oxytricha</i> lineage has a massively scrambled genome, whose assembly during development requires hundreds of thousands of precise programmed DNA joining events, representing the most complex genome dynamics of any known organism. Here we study the emergence of such complex genomes by examining the origin and evolution of discontinuous and scrambled genes in the <i>Oxytricha</i> lineage. This study compares six genomes from three species, the germline and somatic genomes for <i>Euplotes woodruffi</i>, <i>Tetmemena sp.</i>, and the model ciliate <i>Oxytricha trifallax</i>. To complement existing data, we sequenced, assembled and annotated the germline and somatic genomes of <i>Euplotes woodruffi</i>, which provides an outgroup, and the germline genome of <i>Tetmemena sp..</i> We find that the germline genome of <i>Tetmemena</i> is as massively scrambled and interrupted as <i>Oxytricha's</i> : 13.6% of its gene loci require programmed translocations and/or inversions, with some genes requiring hundreds of precise gene editing events during development. This study revealed that the earlier-diverged spirotrich, <i>E. woodruffi</i>, also has a scrambled genome, but only roughly half as many loci (7.3%) are scrambled. Furthermore, its scrambled genes are less complex, together supporting the position of <i>Euplotes</i> as a possible evolutionary intermediate in this lineage, in the process of accumulating complex evolutionary genome rearrangements, all of which require extensive repair to assemble functional coding regions. Comparative analysis also reveals that scrambled loci are often associated with local duplications, supporting a gradual model for the origin of complex, scrambled genomes via many small events of DNA duplication and decay.

                The auto-inhibited, super-relaxed (SRX) state of cardiac myosin is thought to be crucial for regulating contraction, relaxation, and energy conservation in the heart. We used single ATP turnover experiments to demonstrate that a dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) mutation (E525K) in human beta-cardiac myosin increases the fraction of myosin heads in the SRX state (with slow ATP turnover), especially in physiological ionic strength conditions. We also utilized FRET between a C-terminal GFP tag on the myosin tail and Cy3ATP bound to the active site of the motor domain to estimate the fraction of heads in the closed, interacting-heads motif (IHM); we found a strong correlation between the IHM and SRX state. Negative stain electron microscopy and 2D class averaging of the construct demonstrated that the E525K mutation increased the fraction of molecules adopting the IHM. Overall, our results demonstrate that the E525K DCM mutation may reduce muscle force and power by stabilizing the auto-inhibited SRX state. Our studies also provide direct evidence for a correlation between the SRX biochemical state and the IHM structural state in cardiac muscle myosin. Furthermore, the E525 residue may be implicated in crucial electrostatic interactions that modulate this conserved, auto-inhibited conformation of myosin.

                <i>N6-</i>methyladenosine (m6A) RNA modification impacts mRNA fate primarily via reader proteins, which dictate processes in development, stress, and disease. Yet little is known about m6A function in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, which occurs solely during early meiosis. Here we perform a multifaceted analysis of the m6A reader protein Pho92/Mrb1. Cross-linking immunoprecipitation analysis reveals that Pho92 associates with the 3’end of meiotic mRNAs in both an m6A-dependent and independent manner. Within cells, Pho92 transitions from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, and associates with translating ribosomes. In the nucleus Pho92 associates with target loci through its interaction with transcriptional elongator Paf1C. Functionally, we show that Pho92 promotes and links protein synthesis to mRNA decay. As such, the Pho92-mediated m6A-mRNA decay is contingent on active translation and the CCR4-NOT complex. We propose that the m6A reader Pho92 is loaded co-transcriptionally to facilitate protein synthesis and subsequent decay of m6A modified transcripts, and thereby promotes meiosis.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">EROS is a selective chaperone regulating the phagocyte NADPH oxidase and purinergic signalling</a></h4>

              
                EROS (Essential for Reactive Oxygen Species) protein is indispensable for expression of gp91<i>phox</i>, the catalytic core of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase. EROS deficiency in humans is a novel cause of the severe immunodeficiency, chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), but its mechanism of action was unknown until now. We elucidate the role of EROS, showing it acts at the earliest stages of gp91<i>phox</i> maturation. It binds the immature 58kDa gp91<i>phox</i> directly, preventing gp91<i>phox</i> degradation and allowing glycosylation via the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) machinery and the incorporation of the heme prosthetic groups essential for catalysis. EROS also regulates the purine receptors P2X7 and P2X1 through direct interactions and P2X7 is almost absent in EROS deficient mouse and human primary cells. Accordingly, lack of murine EROS results in markedly abnormal P2X7 signalling, inflammasome activation and T cell responses. The loss of both ROS and P2X7 signalling leads to resistance to influenza infection in mice. Our work identifies EROS as a highly selective chaperone for key proteins in innate and adaptive immunity and a rheostat for immunity to infection. It has profound implications for our understanding of immune physiology, ROS dysregulation and possibly gene therapy.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Nucleotide-level linkage of transcriptional elongation and polyadenylation</a></h4>

              
                Alternative polyadenylation yields many mRNA isoforms whose 3' termini occur disproportionately in clusters within 3' UTRs. Previously, we showed that profiles of poly(A) site usage are regulated by the rate of transcriptional elongation by RNA polymerase (Pol) II (Geisberg et., 2020). Pol II derivatives with slow elongation rates confer an upstream-shifted poly(A) profile, whereas fast Pol II strains confer a downstream-shifted poly(A) profile. Within yeast isoform clusters, these shifts occur steadily from one isoform to the next across nucleotide distances. In contrast, the shift between clusters from the last isoform of one cluster to the first isoform of the next - is much less pronounced, even over large distances. GC content in a region 13-30 nt downstream from isoform clusters correlates with their sensitivity to Pol II elongation rate. In human cells, the upstream shift caused by a slow Pol II mutant also occurs continuously at the nucleotide level within clusters, but not between them. Pol II occupancy increases just downstream of the most speed-sensitive poly(A) sites, suggesting a linkage between reduced elongation rate and cluster formation. These observations suggest that 1) Pol II elongation speed affects the nucleotide-level dwell time allowing polyadenylation to occur, 2) poly(A) site clusters are linked to the local elongation rate and hence do not arise simply by intrinsically imprecise cleavage and polyadenylation of the RNA substrate, 3) DNA sequence elements can affect Pol II elongation and poly(A) profiles, and 4) the cleavage/polyadenylation and Pol II elongation complexes are spatially, and perhaps physically, coupled so that polyadenylation occurs rapidly upon emergence of the nascent RNA from the Pol II elongation complex.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">TDCS modulates working memory maintenance processes in healthy individuals</a></h4>

              
                Background: The effects of tDCS at the prefrontal cortex are often investigated using cognitive paradigms, particularly working memory tasks. However, the neural basis for the neuromodulatory cognitive effects of tDCS, including which subprocesses are affected by stimulation, is not completely understood. Aims: We investigated the effects of tDCS on working memory task-related spectral activity during and after tDCS to gain better insights into the neurophysiological changes associated with stimulation. Methods: We reanalysed data from 100 healthy participants grouped by allocation to receive either Sham (0 mA, 0.016 mA, and 0.034 mA) or Active (1 mA or 2 mA) stimulation during a 3-back task. Electroencephalography (EEG) data was used to analyse event-related spectral power in frequency bands associated with working memory performance. Results: Frontal theta event-related synchronisation (ERS) was significantly reduced post-tDCS in the active group. Participants receiving active tDCS had slower response times following tDCS compared to Sham, suggesting interference with practice effects associated with task repetition. Theta ERS was not significantly correlated with response times or accuracy. Conclusions: tDCS reduced frontal theta ERS post-stimulation, suggesting a selective disruption to working memory cognitive control and maintenance processes. These findings suggest that tDCS selectively affects specific subprocesses during working memory, which may explain heterogenous behavioural effects.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Model-free decision making resists improved instructions and is enhanced by stimulus-response associations</a></h4>

              
                Human behaviour is driven by two types of processes running in parallel: goal-directed and habitual, each supported by different computational-learning mechanisms, model-free and model-based respectively. In model-free strategies, stimulus-response associations are strengthened when actions are followed by a reward and weakened otherwise. In model-based learning, previous to selecting an action, the current values of the different possible actions are computed based on a detailed model of the environment. Previous research with the two-stage task suggests that participants' behavior usually shows a mixture of both strategies. But, interestingly, a recent study by da Silva and Hare (2020) found that participants deploy a purely model-based behavior when they are given detailed instructions about the structure of the task. In the present study, we reproduce this essential experiment using a larger sample size (N=59). However, our results do not suggest a sole model-based behaviour, but rather a hybrid one. Furthermore, an additional experiment shows that slight changes in the task, like a consistent stimulus-response mapping, can encourage reliance on model-free strategies, even if participants are presented with improved instructions. This suggests that the model-free marker, as measured by the two-stage task, is related to S-R learning.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Gamma-Protocadherins regulate filopodia self-recognition and dynamics to drivedendrite self-avoidance</a></h4>

              
                Neurons form cell type-specific morphologies that are shaped by molecular cues and their cellular events governing dendrite growth. One growth rule is distributing dendrites uniformly within a neuronal territory by avoiding sibling branches. In mammalian neurons, dendrite self-avoidance is regulated by the clustered Protocadherins (cPcdhs), a large family of recognition molecules. Genetic and molecular studies suggest that the cPcdhs mediate homophilic recognition and repulsion between self-dendrites but this model has not been tested through direct investigation of self-avoidance during development. Here we performed live imaging and 4D quantifications of dendrite morphogenesis to define the cPcdh-dependent mechanisms of self-avoidance. We focused on the mouse retinal starburst amacrine cell (SAC), which requires the gamma-Pcdhs (Pcdhgs) and self/non-self recognition to establish a stereotypic radial morphology while permitting dendritic interactions with neighboring SACs. Through morphogenesis, SACs extend a transient population of dynamic filopodia that fill the growing arbor and contact nearby self-dendrites. Compared to non-self-contacting filopodia, self-contacting events have longer lifetimes and a subset persists as filopodia bridges. In the absence of the Pcdhgs, non-self-contacting filopodia dynamics are unaffected but self-contact-induced retractions are significantly diminished. Filopodia bridges accumulate, leading to the bundling of dendritic processes and disruption to the arbor shape. By tracking dendrite self-avoidance in real-time, our findings demonstrate that the {gamma}-Pcdhs selectively mediate contact-induced retractions upon filopodia self-recognition. Our results also illustrate how self-avoidance shapes the stochastic and space-filling behaviors of filopodia for robust dendritic pattern formation in mammalian neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural correlates of probabilistic information processing in gesture-speech integration</a></h4>

              
                How information of different modalities (e.g., speech and gesture) frame into a unified one remains unclear in the neurobiology of language. Leveraging the information-theoretic complexity metrics of entropy and mutual information (MI) to quantify gestures and speech, the present event-related potentials and chronometric double-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) study investigated the neural processes during probabilistic gesture-speech integration. In the early processing stage, we found a positive correlation of P1 amplitude with speech entropy and a negative correlation of N1-P2 amplitude with gesture entropy, while the TMS disruption effect of posterior middle temporal gyrus (pMTG) was negatively correlated with speech entropy. In the lexico-semantic processing stage, we observed a negative correlation of N400 amplitude with both gesture entropy and gesture-speech MI, a negative correlation of late positive component amplitude with speech entropy, together with correlations of the TMS interruption effect of inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) with gesture entropy, speech entropy and their MI. Our findings suggest a probabilistically updated lexical representation that was dynamically framed by top-down gesture constrain, bottom-up speech encoding and their interplay. A 5-step process in the pMTG-IFG-pMTG neural circuit is hypothesized for probabilistic gesture-speech processing, which promises a better understanding of the predictive multisensory language processing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Structure-Function Dynamics of Engineered, Modular Neuronal Networks with Controllable Afferent-Efferent Connectivity</a></h4>

              
                Microfluidic devices interfaced with microelectrode arrays have in recent years emerged as powerful platforms for studying and manipulating in vitro neuronal networks at the micro- and mesoscale. By segregating neuronal populations using microchannels only permissible to axons, neuronal networks can be designed to mimic the highly organized and modular topology of neuronal assemblies in the brain. In vivo, the development of such neuronal assemblies is tightly orchestrated by reciprocal, dynamic structure-function relationships shaped by an interplay between intrinsic neuronal self-organizing properties and spatiotemporally regulated chemical and physical guidance cues. Engineered neuronal networks represent reductionist paradigms that can help recapitulate such dynamics in vitro. However, little is known about how the underlying topological features of such engineered neuronal networks contribute to their functional profile. To start addressing this question, a key parameter is control of afferent or efferent connectivity within the engineered network. In this study, we show that a microfluidic device featuring axon guiding channels with geometrical constraints inspired by a Tesla valve effectively promotes unidirectional axonal outgrowth between neuronal nodes, thereby enabling us to control afferent connectivity. We verified this by applying designer viruses to fluorescently label the neurons to visualise the structure of the networks, combined with extracellular electrophysiological recordings using embedded nanoporous microelectrodes to study the functional dynamics of these networks during maturation. We furthermore show that electrical stimulations of the networks induce signals selectively transmitted in a feedforward fashion between the neuronal populations. This model system has the potential to provide novel insights into the development, topological organization, and neuroplasticity mechanisms of neuronal assemblies at the micro- and mesoscale in healthy and perturbed conditions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Temporal characteristics of gamma rhythm constrain properties of noise in an inhibition-stabilized network model</a></h4>

              
                Gamma rhythm refers to oscillatory neural activity between 30-80 Hz, often induced in visual cortex by presentation of stimuli such as iso-luminant hues or gratings. Further, the power and peak frequency of gamma depend on the properties of the stimulus such as size and contrast. Gamma also has a typical arch shape, with a narrow trough and a broad peak, which can be replicated by a self-oscillating Wilson-Cowan (WC) model operating in an appropriate regime. However, oscillations in this model are infinitely long, unlike physiological gamma that occurs in short bursts. Further, unlike the model, gamma is faster after stimulus onset and slows down over time. Here, we first characterized gamma burst duration in LFP data recorded from two monkeys while they viewed full screen iso-luminant hues. We then added different types of noise in the inputs to the WC model and tested how that affected duration and temporal dynamics of gamma. While the model failed with the often-used Poisson noise, Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) noise applied to both the excitatory and inhibitory populations in the WC model replicated the duration and slowing of gamma, and also replicated the shape and stimulus dependencies. Therefore, temporal dynamics of gamma oscillations put constraints on the type and properties of underlying neural noise.

                Transsynaptic tracing methods are crucial tools in studying neural circuits. Although a couple of anterograde tracing methods and a targeted retrograde tool have been developed in Drosophila melanogaster, there is still need for an unbiased, user-friendly, and flexible retrograde tracing system. Here we describe retro-Tango, a method for transsynaptic, retrograde circuit tracing and manipulation in Drosophila. In this genetically encoded system, a ligand-receptor interaction at the synapse triggers an intracellular signaling cascade that results in reporter gene expression in presynaptic neurons. Importantly, panneuronal expression of the elements of the cascade renders this method versatile, enabling its use not only to test hypotheses but also to generate them. We validate retro-Tango in various circuits and benchmark it by comparing our findings with the electron microscopy reconstruction of the Drosophila hemibrain. Our experiments establish retro-Tango as a key method for circuit tracing in neuroscience research.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Quantifying the distribution of feature values over data represented in arbitrary dimensional spaces</a></h4>

              
                Background: Identifying the structured distribution (or lack thereof) of a given feature over a point cloud is a general research question. In the neuroscience field, this problem arises while investigating representations over neural manifolds (e.g., spatial coding), in the analysis of neurophysiological signals (e.g., auditory coding) or in anatomical image segmentation. New method: We introduce the Structure Index (SI) as a graph-based topological metric to quantify the distribution of feature values projected over data in arbitrary D-dimensional spaces (neurons, time stamps, pixels). The SI is defined from the overlapping distribution of data points sharing similar feature values in a given neighborhood. Results: Using model data clouds we show how the SI provides quantification of the degree of local versus global organization of feature distribution. SI can be applied to both scalar and vectorial features permitting quantification of the relative contribution of related variables. When applied to experimental studies of head-direction cells, it is able to retrieve consistent feature structure from both the high- and low-dimensional representations. Finally, we provide two general-purpose examples (sound and image categorization), to illustrate the potential application to arbitrary dimensional spaces. Comparison with existing methods: Most methods for quantifying structure depend on cluster analysis, which are suboptimal for continuous features and non-discrete data clouds. SI unbiasedly quantifies structure from continuous data in any dimensional space. Conclusions: The method provides versatile applications in the neuroscience and data science fields.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Large-scale signal and noise correlations configure multi-task coding in human brain networks</a></h4>

              
                The brain is a complex system with dynamic network changes. Prior studies in theoretical neuroscience have demonstrated that state-dependent neural correlations can be understood from a neural coding framework. These so-called noise correlations - the trial-to-trial or moment-to-moment co-variability - can be interpreted only if the underlying signal correlation - the similarity of task selectivity between pairs of neural units - is known. While the impact of these correlations on task coding have been widely investigated in local spiking circuits, it remains unclear how this coding framework applies to large-scale brain networks. Here we investigate the relationship between large-scale noise correlations and their underlying signal correlations in a multi-task human fMRI dataset. We found that state-dependent noise correlation changes do not typically align in the same direction as their underlying signal correlation, suggesting that 1) trial-by-trial noise is typically reduced between similarly tuned regions, and 2) stimulus-driven activity does not linearly superimpose atop the network's underlying background activity. Crucially, we discovered that noise correlations that changed in the opposite direction as their signal correlation (i.e., anti-aligned correlations) improved the information coding of these brain regions. In contrast, noise correlation changes that were aligned with their signal correlation did not. These aligned noise correlations were primarily correlation increases, which have been commonly (yet incorrectly) assumed to increase information communication between brain regions in human neuroimaging studies. These findings illustrate that state-dependent noise correlations contribute to the information coding of functional brain networks, but interpretation of these correlation changes requires knowledge of the underlying signal correlations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The RNA Binding proteome of axonal mRNAs in sympathetic neurons</a></h4>

              
                Background Neurons are morphologically complex cells that rely on the compartmentalization of protein expression to develop and maintain their cytoarchitecture. Targeting of RNA transcripts to axons is one of the mechanisms that allows rapid local translation of proteins in response to extracellular signals. 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNA are non-coding sequences that play a critical role in determining transcript localisation and translation by interacting with specific RNA binding proteins (RBPs). However, how 3'UTRs contribute to mRNA metabolism and the nature of RBP complexes responsible for these functions remain elusive. Results We performed 3' end sequencing of RNA isolated from axons and cell bodies of sympathetic neurons exposed to either Nerve Growth factor (NGF) or Neurotrophin 3 (NT3). NGF and NT3 are growth factors essential for sympathetic neuron development that act through distinct signalling mechanisms. Whereas NT3 is thought to act only locally, NGF signals back from axons to the cell bodies. We discovered that both NGF and NT3 affect transcription and alternative polyadenylation and induce the localisation of specific 3'UTR isoforms to axons. The finding that many transcripts with short 3'UTR were detected only in axons suggest that these may undergo local post-transcriptional remodelling. The integration of our data with CLIP-sequencing data revealed that long 3'UTR isoforms associate with RBP complexes in the nucleus, and once in axons, regulate cytoplasmic 3'UTR isoform cleavage into shorter isoform. Conclusions Our findings shed new light on the complex interplay between nuclear polyadenylation, mRNA localisation and local 3'UTR remodelling in developing neurons.

                Although the thalamus is supposed to be involved in reinforcement-based decision-making, there is no direct evidence regarding the involvement of this subcortical structure in humans. To fill this gap, we leveraged rare intra-thalamic electrophysiological recordings in patients and found that temporally structured thalamic oscillations encode key learning signals.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Interactions between circuit architecture and plasticity in a closed-loop system</a></h4>

              
                Determining the sites of plasticity underlying changes in neural activity and behavior is critical for understanding mechanisms of learning. Identifying such sites from neural recording data can be challenging due to feedback pathways that impede reasoning about cause and effect. We studied interactions between feedback, neural activity, and plasticity in the context of a closed-loop motor learning task for which there is disagreement about the loci and directions of plasticity. We constructed a set of models that differed in the strength of their recurrent feedback. Despite these differences, each model successfully fit a large set of neural and behavioral data. However, the patterns of plasticity predicted by the models fundamentally differed, with the sign of plasticity at a key site changing from depression to potentiation as feedback strength increased. Guided by our analysis, we suggest how such models can be experimentally disambiguated. Our results address a long-standing debate regarding cerebellum-dependent motor learning and demonstrate how learning-related changes in neural activity can appear to contradict the sign of the underlying plasticity when feedback is present.

                Stroke-related disruptions in functional connectivity (FC) often spread beyond lesioned areas and, given the localized nature of lesions, it is unclear how the recovery of FC is orchestrated on a global scale. Since recovery is accompanied by long-term changes in excitability, we propose excitatory-inhibitory (E-I) homeostasis as a driving mechanism. We present a large-scale model of the neocortex, with synaptic scaling of local inhibition, showing how E-I homeostasis can drive the post-lesion restoration of FC and linking it to changes in excitability. We show that functional networks could reorganize to recover disrupted modularity and small-worldness, but not network dynamics, suggesting the need to consider forms of plasticity beyond synaptic scaling of inhibition. On average, we observed widespread increases in excitability, with the emergence of complex lesion-dependent patterns related to biomarkers of relevant side effects of stroke, such as epilepsy, depression and chronic pain. In summary, our results show that the effects of E-I homeostasis extend beyond local E-I balance, driving the restoration of global properties of FC, and relating to post-stroke symptomatology. Therefore, we suggest the framework of E-I homeostasis as a relevant theoretical foundation for the study of stroke recovery and for understanding the emergence of meaningful features of FC from local dynamics.

The dataset can also be used for optimizing preprocessing methods for simultaneously collected imaging data. The dataset includes simultaneously collected recordings from 22 individuals (ages: 23-51) across various visual and naturalistic stimuli. In addition, physiological, eye tracking, electrocardiography, and cognitive and behavioral data were collected along with this neuroimaging data. Visual tasks include a flickering checkerboard that was collected outside and inside the MRI scanner (EEG-only) and simultaneous EEG-fMRI recordings. Simultaneous recordings also included rest, the visual paradigm Inscapes, and several short video movies representing naturalistic stimuli. We present this dataset as part of an effort to provide open-access data with the goal of increasing the opportunity for discoveries and understanding of the human brain and evaluating the correlation between electrical brain activity and blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals.

                The advent of three-dimensional histological methods has advanced studies of cellular-resolution anatomy of the brain. The use of whole-mount staining and tissue clearing has advanced systems-level identification of cells underlying brain functions in mouse models. However, application of these methods to studies of human brains has been difficult due to their structural variability and the lack of standardized quantitative metrics. Here we report a rapid and scalable staining/imaging technique, termed mFISH3D, that enables single-cell-resolution imaging of mRNAs of more than ten genes in a large mammalian brain. To apply mFISH3D to postmortem human cerebral cortex, we have reconstructed morphogenic tracks of cortical growth, and used the tracks to provide a framework for quantitative assessment of cytoarchitecture. The workflow enabled the objective quantification of biological heterogeneity among cortical regions. We propose these techniques for standardization of 3D histology of the human cortex to provide reproducible measurements of cell-type-specific neuroanatomy.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Integration of optic flow into the sky compass network in the brain of the desert locust</a></h4>

              
                Flexible orientation through any environment requires a sense of current relative heading that is updated based on self-motion. Global external cues originating from the sky or the earth's magnetic field and local cues provide a reference frame for the sense of direction. Locally, optic flow may inform about turning maneuvers, travel speed and covered distance. The central complex in the insect brain is associated with orientation behavior and largely acts as a navigation center. Visual information from global celestial cues and local landmarks are integrated in the central complex to form an internal representation of current heading. However, it is largely unclear which neurons integrate optic flow in the central-complex network. We recorded intracellularly from neurons in the locust central complex while presenting lateral grating patterns that simulated translational and rotational motion to identify these sites of integration. Certain types of central complex neurons were sensitive to visual self-motion independent of the type and direction of simulated motion. Columnar neurons innervating the noduli, paired central-complex substructures, were tuned to the direction of simulated horizontal turns. Modelling the connectivity of these neurons with a system of proposed compass neurons can account for rotation-direction specific shifts in the activity profile in the central complex corresponding to turn direction. Our model is similar but not identical to the mechanisms proposed for angular velocity integration in the navigation compass of the fly Drosophila.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Poly ADP-Ribose Signaling is Dysregulated in Huntington Disease Patients</a></h4>

              
                Huntington disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant genetic neurodegenerative disease caused by a CAG expansion in the Huntingtin (HTT) gene, translating to an expanded polyglutamine tract in the huntingtin (HTT) protein. Age at disease onset is correlated to CAG repeat length, but varies by decades between individuals with identical repeat lengths. Genome-wide association studies link HD modification to DNA repair and mitochondrial health pathways. Recent clinical studies show elevated DNA damage in HD, even at the premanifest stage of disease. One of the major DNA repair nodes influencing neurodegenerative disease is the PARP pathway. Accumulation of poly ADP-ribose (PAR), produced by PARP1 and PARP2, has been implicated in the pathology of Alzheimers and Parkinsons diseases, as well as autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia. We report that HD mutation carriers have lower cerebrospinal fluid PAR levels than healthy controls, starting at the premanifest stage. Patient-derived fibroblasts have reduced PARP1/2 activity and elevated DNA damage, while elevated PAR levels are only revealed upon inhibition of PAR degradation. These phenotypes are rescued by moderate huntingtin level reduction via the huntingtin-lowering splice modulator drug, LMI070 (Branaplam). As a direct mechanism, we have defined a PAR-binding motif in huntingtin, detected huntingtin complexed with PARylated proteins in human cells during stress, and localized huntingtin to mitotic chromosomes upon inhibition of PAR degradation. Direct huntingtin PAR binding was measured by fluorescence polarization and visualized by atomic force microscopy. These results provide insight into a very early molecular mechanism of HD, suggesting possible targets in HD to design early preventive therapies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">More than just axons: A positive relationship between an intracellular isotropic diffusion signal and pubertal development in white matter regions in a massive adolescent cohort</a></h4>

              
                Puberty is a key event in adolescent development that involves significant, hormone-driven changes to many aspects of physiology including the brain. Understanding how the brain responds during this time period is important for evaluating neuronal developments that affect mental health throughout adolescence and the adult lifespan. This study examines diffusion MRI scans from the cross-sectional ABCD Study baseline cohort, a large multi-site study containing thousands of participants, to describe the relationship between pubertal development and brain microstructure. Using advanced, 3-tissue constrained spherical deconvolution methods, this study is able to describe multiple tissue compartments beyond only white matter (WM) axonal qualities. After controlling for age, sex, brain volume, subject handedness, scanning site, and sibling relationships, we observe a positive relationship between an isotropic, intracellular diffusion signal fraction and pubertal development across a majority of regions of interest (ROIs) in the WM skeleton. We also observe regional effects from an intracellular anisotropic signal fraction compartment and extracellular isotropic free water-like compartment in several ROIs. This work suggests that changes during pubertal development elicit a complex response from brain tissue that cannot be completely described by traditional methods focusing only on WM axonal properties. This work brings in vivo human neuroimaging studies more into line with work performed on animal models, which describe an interaction between increased myelination, neurogenesis, angiogenesis, and glial cell proliferation in response to pubertal hormones.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Activity-regulated gene expression across cell types of the mouse hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                Activity-regulated gene (ARG) expression patterns in the hippocampus (HPC) regulate synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory, and are linked to both risk and treatment response for many neuropsychiatric disorders. The HPC contains discrete classes of neurons with specialized functions, but cell type-specific activity-regulated transcriptional programs are not well characterized. Here, we used single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) in a mouse model of acute electroconvulsive seizures (ECS) to identify cell type-specific molecular signatures associated with induced activity in HPC neurons. We used unsupervised clustering and a priori marker genes to computationally annotate 15,990 high-quality HPC neuronal nuclei from N=4 mice across all major HPC subregions and neuron types. Activity-induced transcriptomic responses were divergent across neuron populations, with dentate granule cells being particularly responsive to activity. Differential expression analysis identified both upregulated and downregulated cell type-specific gene sets in neurons following ECS. Within these gene sets, we identified enrichment of pathways associated with varying biological processes such as synapse organization, cellular signaling, and transcriptional regulation. Finally, we used matrix factorization to reveal continuous gene expression patterns differentially associated with cell type, ECS, and biological processes. This work provides a rich resource for interrogating activity-regulated transcriptional responses in HPC neurons at single-nuclei resolution in the context of ECS, which can provide biological insight into the roles of defined neuronal subtypes in HPC function.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Hierarchical Modular Structure of the Drosophila Connectome</a></h4>

              
                The structure of neural circuitry plays a crucial role in brain function. Previous studies of brain organization generally had to trade off between coarse descriptions at a large scale and fine descriptions on a small scale. Researchers have now reconstructed tens to hundreds of thousands of neurons at synaptic resolution, enabling investigations into the interplay between global, modular organization, and cell type-specific wiring. Analyzing data of this scale, however, presents unique challenges. To address this problem we applied novel community detection methods to analyze the synapse-level reconstruction of an adult fruit fly brain containing over 20 thousand neurons and 10 million synapses. Using a machine-learning algorithm, we find the most densely connected communities of neurons by maximizing a generalized modularity density measure. We resolve the community structure at a range of scales, from large (on the order of thousands of neurons) to small (on the order of tens of neurons). We find that the network is organized hierarchically and larger-scale communities are composed of smaller-scale structures. Our methods identify well-known features of the fly brain, including its sensory pathways. Moreover, focusing on specific brain regions, we are able to identify subnetworks with distinct connectivity types. For example, manual efforts have identified layered structures in the fan-shaped body. Our methods not only automatically recover this layered structure, but also resolve finer connectivity patterns to downstream and upstream areas. We also find a novel modular organization of the superior neuropil, with distinct clusters of upstream and downstream brain regions dividing the neuropil into several pathways. These methods show that the fine-scale, local network reconstruction made possible by modern experimental methods are sufficiently detailed to identify the organization of the brain across scales, and enable novel predictions about the structure and function of its parts.

                Arousal and awareness are two components of consciousness whose the neural mechanisms remain unclear. Spontaneous increases of global (brain-wide) blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) signal has been found to be sensitive to changes in arousal. By contrasting BOLD datasets with altered arousal levels, we found that the activation of ventral posterolateral nucleus (VPL) decreased during transient increase in the global signal (top 17% data) in low arousal and awareness states (non-rapid eye movement sleep and anesthesia) as compared to wakefulness, and even in eye-closed (compared with eyes-open) in healthy awake-states, while this activation remained unchanged in patients with unresponsive wakefulness syndrome characterized by high arousal without awareness. These results demonstrate that co-activation of the VPL and global activity is critical to arousal, but not to awareness.

                We present an analysis of the spatiotemporal dynamics of the oscillations in the electric potential that arises from neural activity. Depending on the frequency and phase of oscillations, these dynamics can be characterized as standing waves or as out-of-phase and modulated waves, which represent a combination of standing and moving waves. We characterize these dynamics as optical flow patterns, in terms of sources, sinks, spirals and saddles. Analytical and numerical solutions are compared with real EEG data acquired during a picture-naming task. Analytical approximation of standing waves allows us to establish some properties of pattern location and number. Namely, sources and sinks have mainly the same location, while saddles are located between them. The number of saddles correlates with the sum of all the other patterns. These properties are confirmed in both the simulated and real EEG data.

                Developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs) are a group of rare childhood disorders characterized by severe epilepsy and related cognitive deficits. Numerous DEE genes have been discovered thanks to advances in genomic diagnosis, yet putative molecular links between these disorders are not known. CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD, DEE2) is one of the most common forms of genetic epilepsy; it is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the brain-enriched kinase CDKL5. To elucidate CDKL5 function, we looked for CDKL5 substrates using a SILAC based phosphoproteomic screen. We identified the voltage-gated Ca2+ channel Cav2.3 (encoded by CACNA1E) as a novel physiological target of CDKL5 in mice and humans. Recombinant channel electrophysiology and interdisciplinary characterization of Cav2.3 phosphomutant mice revealed that the loss of Cav2.3 phosphorylation leads to channel gain-of-function via slower channel inactivation and enhanced acetylcholine-induced stimulation, resulting in increased neuronal excitability. These changes in Cav2.3 closely resemble those described for gain-of-function point-mutations in CACNA1E that cause DEE69, a disorder sharing clinical features with CDD. Our results show that these two single-gene disorders are mechanistically related. We suggest that CDD is partly a channelopathy with Cav2.3 gain-of-function, thus Cav2.3 inhibition could be therapeutic in these DEEs.

                Cognitive decline and hallucinations are common and debilitating non-motor symptoms, occurring during later phases of Parkinson's disease (PD). Minor hallucinations (MH), appear at early phases and have been suggested to predict cognitive impairment in PD, however, this has not been well-established by clinical research. Here, we investigated whether non-demented PD patients with MH show altered brain oscillations and whether such MH-related electrophysiological changes are associated with cognitive impairments that increase over time. Combining model-driven EEG analysis with neuropsychiatric and neuropsychological examinations in 75 PD patients, we reveal enhanced frontal theta oscillations in PD patients suffering from MH and link these oscillatory changes with lower cognitive frontal-subcortical functions. Neuropsychological follow-up examinations five years later confirmed MH-specific theta oscillations and revealed a stronger decline in frontal-subcortical functions in MH-patients with stronger frontal theta alterations, defining an MH and theta oscillation-based early marker of a cognitive decline in PD

                Moderate levels of synchronization of neuronal oscillations are essential for healthy brain dynamics. Synchronization levels exhibit large inter-individual variability the origins of which are unknown. Neuronal systems have been postulated to operate near a critical transition point or in an extended regime between disorder (subcritical) and order (supercritical phase) characterized by moderate synchronization and emergent power-law long-range temporal correlations (LRTCs). We investigated whether inter-individual variability in synchronization levels is explained by the individual position along the critical regime by analyzing magnetoencephalography (MEG) and intra-cerebral stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG) human resting-state data. Here we show that variability in synchronization levels exhibits a positive linear and quadratic relationships with LRTCs in healthy participants and brain areas. In the epileptogenic zone this correlation was negative. These results show that variability in synchronization levels is regulated by the individual position along an extended critical-like regime, with healthy brain areas tending to operate in its subcritical and epileptogenic areas in its supercritical side.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Using deep convolutional neural networks to test why human face recognition works the way it does</a></h4>

              
                Human face recognition is highly accurate, and exhibits a number of distinctive and well documented behavioral "signatures" such as the use of a characteristic representational space, the disproportionate performance cost when stimuli are presented upside down, and the drop in accuracy for faces from races the participant is less familiar with. These and other phenomena have long been taken as evidence that face recognition is "special". But why does human face perception exhibit these properties in the first place? Here we use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to test the hypothesis that all of these signatures of human face perception result from optimization for the task of face recognition. Indeed, as predicted by this hypothesis, these phenomena are all found in CNNs trained on face recognition, but not in CNNs trained on object recognition, even when the amount of face experience is matched. To test whether these signatures are in principle specific to faces, we optimized a CNN on car discrimination and tested it on upright and inverted car images. As for face perception, the car-trained network showed a drop in performance for inverted versus upright cars. Similarly, CNNs trained only on inverted faces produce an inverted inversion effect. These findings show that the behavioral signatures of human face perception reflect and are well explained as the result of optimization for the task of face recognition, and that the nature of the computations underlying this task may not be so "special" after all.

	<p>In neuropsychological evaluation, verbal fluency is a crucial measure of cognitive function, but this measure requires standardized and normative data for use. The present study aimed to obtain validation and normative data for the verbal fluency task in the Peruvian population, with participants ranging from 6 to 94 years and varying in age, educational level, and sex. We recruited 2602 healthy individuals and used linear regression analysis to determine the effect of age, sex, and educational level. We also evaluated internal consistency between categories and phonological tasks with Cronbach&amp;amp;rsquo;s alpha and Pearson&amp;amp;rsquo;s correlation analysis and calculated test-retest reliability after three months. We found significant effects of age, educational level, and sex on phonological and semantic fluency. Participants with more than 12 years of education had the highest scores overall. Regarding age, middle-aged participants (between 31 and 40 years old) had the highest scores; scores gradually decreased outside of this age range. Regarding sex, men performed better than women. These results will increase the ability of clinicians to precisely determine the degree to which verbal fluency is affected in patients of different ages and educational levels.</p>

	<p>Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) antagonists are a class of medications that act as antagonists of the CGRP receptor or ligand. They can be divided into monoclonal antibodies and non-peptide small molecules, also known as gepants. CGRP antagonists were the first oral agents specifically designed to prevent migraines. The second generation of gepants includes rimegepant (BHV-3000, BMS-927711), ubrogepant (MK-1602), and atogepant (AGN-241689, MK-8031). Zavegepant (BHV-3500, BMS-742413) belongs to the third generation of gepants characterized by different administration routes. The chemical and pharmacological properties of this new generation of gepants were calculated. The clinical trials showed that the new generation of CGRP antagonists is effective for the acute and/or preventive treatment of migraines. No increased mortality risks were observed to be associated with the second- and third-generation gepants. Moreover, the majority of the serious adverse events reported probably occurred unrelated to the medications. Interesting facts about gepants were highlighted, such as potency, hepatotoxicity, concomitant use with monoclonal antibodies targeting the CGRP, comparative analysis with triptans, and the &amp;amp;ldquo;acute and preventive&amp;amp;rdquo; treatment of migraine. Further studies should include an elderly population and compare the medications inside this class and with triptans. There are still concerns regarding the long-term side effects of these medications, such as chronic vascular hemodynamic impairment. Meanwhile, careful pharmacovigilance and safety monitoring should be performed in the clinical practice use of gepants.</p>

	<p>Glymphatic dysfunction has been linked to cognitive decline in several neurodegenerative diseases. In cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD), the mechanism of white matter hyperintensities (WMH)-related cognitive impairment (CI) is still under investigation. The diffusion tensor image (DTI) analysis along the perivascular space (ALPS) method has been considered to be a reliable parameter to evaluate glymphatic function. Therefore, we applied the ALPS-index to determine the influence of glymphatic function on CI in CSVD. In total, 137 CSVD patients (normal cognitive group, mild CI group, and dementia group) and 52 normal controls were included in this study. The ALPS-index was calculated based on the DTI. Correlation analyses and mediation analysis were conducted to examine the relationship between glymphatic function and cognition. Remarkable differences in the ALPS-index were observed between subjects with and without CI. The ALPS-index was negatively correlated with age, WMH volume, and general cognitive function in all CSVD patients. In the mild CI group, the ALPS-index was independently positively related to episodic memory, and mediated the relationship between WMH volume and episodic memory. In conclusion, the ALPS-index is a potential marker for early recognition of CI in CSVD. Glymphatic dysfunction mediates the relationship between WMH and CI in CSVD.</p>

	<p>Purpose: Neuroinflammation often initiates iron overload in the pathogenesis of neurological disorders. Chemokine-driven neuroinflammation is required for central sensitization and chronic allodynia following fractures, but specific molecular modulations are elusive. This present study explored whether hydrogen-rich saline, as one potent anti-inflammatory pharmaceutical, could alleviate fracture-caused allodynia by suppressing chemokine CXCL1 expression and iron overload. Methods: A mouse model of tibial fracture with intramedullary pinning was employed for establishing chronic allodynia. Three applications of hydrogen-rich saline (1, 5 or 10 mL/kg) were administrated intraperitoneally on a daily basis from days 4 to 6 following fractures. Spinal CXCL1 and its receptor CXCR2 levels, transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) expression and iron concentration were examined. Recombinant CXCL1, a selective CXCR2 antagonist and an iron chelator were used for verification of mechanisms. Results: Repetitive injections of hydrogen-rich saline (5 and 10 mL/kg but not 1 mL/kg) prevent fracture-caused mechanical allodynia and cold allodynia in a dose-dependent manner. Single exposure to hydrogen-rich saline (10 mL/kg) on day 14 after orthopedic surgeries controls the established persistent fracture allodynia. Furthermore, hydrogen-rich saline therapy reduces spinal CXCL1/CXCR2 over-expression and TfR1-mediated iron accumulation in fracture mice. Spinal CXCR2 antagonism impairs allodynia and iron overload following fracture surgery. Intrathecal delivery of recombinant CXCL1 induces acute allodynia and spinal iron overload, which is reversed by hydrogen-rich saline. Moreover, iron chelation alleviates exogenous CXCL1-induced acute pain behaviors. Conclusions: These findings identify that hydrogen-rich saline confers protection against fracture-caused chronic allodynia via spinal down-modulation of CXCL1-dependent TfR1-mediated iron accumulation in mice.</p>

	<p>Older adults exhibit deficits in episodic memory tasks, which have often been attributed to encoding or retrieval deficits, with little attention to consolidation mechanisms. More recently, researchers have attempted to measure consolidation in the context of a behavioral experiment using the wakeful rest paradigm (i.e., a brief, quiet period of minimal stimulation, which facilitates memory performance, compared to a distractor task). Critically, older adults might not produce this effect, given established age differences in other episodic memory processes and mind-wandering. In three experiments, we directly compared younger and older adults in modified versions of the wakeful rest paradigm. Critically, we utilized incidental encoding procedures (all experiments) and abstract shape stimuli (in Experiment 3) to limit the possibility of retrieval practice or maintenance rehearsal as potential confounding mechanisms in producing the wakeful rest effect. Wakeful rest reliably and equally benefited recall of incidentally encoded words in both younger and older adults. In contrast, wakeful rest had no benefit for standard accuracy measures of recognition performance in verbal stimuli, although there was an effect in response latencies for non-verbal stimuli. Overall, these results suggest that the benefits of wakeful rest on episodic retrieval are preserved across age groups, and hence support age-independence in potential consolidation mechanisms as measured by wakeful rest. Further, these benefits do not appear to be dependent on the intentionality of encoding or variations in distractor task types. Finally, the lack of wakeful rest benefits on recognition performance might be driven by theoretical constraints on the effect or methodological limitations of recognition memory testing in the current paradigm.</p>

	<p>The open-face design of the Leksell Vantage frame provides many advantages. However, its more rigid, contoured design offers less flexibility than other frames. This is especially true for posterior fossa approaches. This study explores whether these limitations can be overcome by tailored frame placement using a virtual planning approach. The posterior fossa was accessed in ten patients using the Leksell Vantage frame. Frame placement was planned with the Brainlab Elements software, including a phantom-based (virtual) pre-operative planning approach. A biopsy was performed in all patients; in four, additional laser ablation surgery was performed. The accuracy of virtual frame placement was compared to actual frame placement. The posterior approach was feasible in all patients. In one case, the trajectory had to be adjusted; in another, the trajectory was switched from a right- to a left-sided approach. Both cases showed large deviations from the initially planned frame placement. A histopathological diagnosis was achieved in all patients. The new Leksell Vantage frame can be used to safely target the posterior fossa with a high diagnostic success rate and accuracy. Frame placement needs to be well-planned and executed. This can be facilitated using specific software solutions as demonstrated.</p>

                Background: Endosseous zirconia implants have been established as an alternative to conventional titanium implants, especially in the aesthetic zone. This pilot study aimed to evaluate the outcome of rehabilitation with zirconia implants, in a subset of the Indian population, involving varying clinical scenarios. Methods: A total of 10 one-piece zirconia implants were placed in seven patients requiring rehabilitation of missing teeth. The survival rate and marginal bone levels were evaluated at six months and 12 months following implant placement. Results: Five implants were placed in the maxilla and five in the mandible, including well-healed sites, extraction sockets, a single cantilever in the lower anterior region, and a full-arch rehabilitation. During the observation period, two early implant failures were noted resulting in a survival rate of 80%. Mean marginal bone loss of 0.73mm was seen one year following implant placement, with maximum bone loss occurring in the first six months. Conclusion: The results of this study encourage the use of endosseous zirconia implants in diverse clinical scenarios with careful case selection. However, long-term studies are needed to further validate these findings.

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">The Readiness Potential Correlates with Action-Linked Modulation of Visual Accuracy</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Visual accuracy is consistently shown to be modulated around the time of the action execution. The neural underpinning of this motor-induced modulation of visual perception is still unclear. Here, we investigate with EEG whether it is related to the readiness potential, an event-related potential (ERP) linked to motor preparation. Across 18 human participants, the magnitude of visual modulation following a voluntary button press was found to correlate with the readiness potential amplitude measured during visual discrimination. Participants&rsquo; amplitude of the readiness potential in a purely motor-task was also found to correlate with the extent of the motor-induced modulation of visual perception in the visuomotor task. These results provide strong evidence that perceptual changes close to action execution are associated with motor preparation processes and that this mechanism is independent of task contingencies. Further, our findings suggest that the readiness potential provides a fingerprint of individual visuomotor interaction.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Hyperactivation of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) by p25, contributes to neuroinflammation causing neurodegeneration in Parkinson&rsquo;s disease (PD) and Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease. However, the mechanism by which Cdk5 induces neuroinflammation in the PD brain is largely unexplored. Here, we show that Cdk5 phosphorylates cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) at Thr-268 and Ser-505 sites lead to its activation and generation of eicosanoid products. Mutational studies using site-directed mutagenesis and molecular simulations show that the architecture of the protein changes on each single-point mutation. Interestingly, double mutations also led to a severe decline in the activity of cPLA2 and to the disruption of its translocation to the plasma membrane. Further, the brain lysates of transgenic PD mouse models show hyperactivation of Cdk5, resulting in enhanced phosphorylation of Thr-268 and Ser-505 of cPLA2 and its heightened activity, confirming the findings observed in the cell culture model of PD. These phosphorylation sites of cPLA2 and Cdk5 could be explored as the future therapeutic targets against neuroinflammation in PD. Further, conjoint transcriptomic analysis of the publicly available human PD datasets strengthens the hypothesis that genes of the arachidonic acid, prostaglandin synthesis, and inflammatory pathways are significantly upregulated in the case of PD patients compared with that of healthy control subjects.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>A significant proportion of the human neurotypical population exhibits some degree of sensory eye dominance (SED), referring to the brain&rsquo;s preferential processing of one eye&rsquo;s input versus another. The neural substrates underlying this functional imbalance are not well known. Here, we investigated the relationship between visual white matter tract properties and SED in the human neurotypical population. Observers&rsquo; performance on two commonly used dichoptic tasks were used to index SED, along with performance on a third task to address a functional implication of binocular imbalance: stereovision. We show that diffusivity metrics of the optic radiations (ORs) well predict behavioral SED metrics. We found no relationship between SED and stereosensitivity. Our data suggest that SED is not simply reflected by gray matter structural and functional alterations, as often suggested, but relates, at least in part to the microstructural properties of thalamocortical white matter.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Shisa7-Dependent Regulation of GABAA Receptor Single-Channel Gating Kinetics</a></h4>

              
                <p>GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptors (GABA<SUB>A</SUB>Rs) mediate the majority of fast inhibitory transmission throughout the brain. Although it is widely known that pore-forming subunits critically determine receptor function, it is unclear whether their single-channel properties are modulated by GABA<SUB>A</SUB>R-associated transmembrane proteins. We previously identified Shisa7 as a GABA<SUB>A</SUB>R auxiliary subunit that modulates the trafficking, pharmacology, and deactivation properties of these receptors. However, whether Shisa7 also regulates GABA<SUB>A</SUB>R single-channel properties has yet to be determined. Here, we performed single-channel recordings of &alpha;2&beta;32L GABA<SUB>A</SUB>Rs cotransfected with Shisa7 in HEK293T cells and found that while Shisa7 does not change channel slope conductance, it reduced the frequency of receptor openings. Importantly, Shisa7 modulates GABA<SUB>A</SUB>R gating by decreasing the duration and open probability within bursts. Through kinetic analysis of individual dwell time components, activation modeling, and macroscopic simulations, we demonstrate that Shisa7 accelerates GABA<SUB>A</SUB>R deactivation by governing the time spent between close and open states during gating. Together, our data provide a mechanistic basis for how Shisa7 controls GABA<SUB>A</SUB>R gating and reveal for the first time that GABA<SUB>A</SUB>R single-channel properties can be modulated by an auxiliary subunit. These findings shed light on processes that shape the temporal dynamics of GABAergic transmission.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Although GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptor (GABA<SUB>A</SUB>R) single-channel properties are largely determined by pore-forming subunits, it remains unknown whether they are also controlled by GABA<SUB>A</SUB>R-associated transmembrane proteins. Here, we show that Shisa7, a recently identified GABA<SUB>A</SUB>R auxiliary subunit, modulates GABA<SUB>A</SUB>R activation by altering single-channel burst kinetics. These results reveal that Shisa7 primarily decreases the duration and open probability of receptor burst activity during gating, leading to accelerated GABA<SUB>A</SUB>R deactivation. These experiments are the first to assess the gating properties of GABA<SUB>A</SUB>Rs in the presence of an auxiliary subunit and provides a kinetic basis for how Shisa7 modifies temporal attributes of GABAergic transmission at the single-channel level.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Preserved Motility after Neonatal Dopaminergic Lesion Relates to Hyperexcitability of Direct Pathway Medium Spiny Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>In Parkinson's disease patients and rodent models, dopaminergic neuron loss (DAN) results in severe motor disabilities. In contrast, general motility is preserved after early postnatal DAN loss in rodents. Here we used mice of both sexes to show that the preserved motility observed after early DAN loss depends on functional changes taking place in medium spiny neurons (MSN) of the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) that belong to the direct pathway (dMSN). Previous animal model studies showed that adult loss of dopaminergic input depresses dMSN response to cortical input, which likely contributes to Parkinson's disease motor impairments. However, the response of DMS-dMSN to their preferred medial PFC input is preserved after neonatal DAN loss as shown by <I>in vivo</I> studies. Moreover, their response to inputs from adjacent cortical areas is increased, resulting in reduced cortical inputs selectivity. Additional <I>ex vivo</I> studies show that membrane excitability increases in dMSN. Furthermore, chemogenetic inhibition of DMS-dMSN has a more marked inhibitory effect on general motility in lesioned mice than in their control littermates, indicating that expression of normal levels of locomotion and general motility depend on dMSN activity after early DAN loss. Contrastingly, DMS-dMSN inhibition did not ameliorate a characteristic phenotype of the DAN-lesioned animals in a marble burying task demanding higher behavioral control. Thus, increased dMSN excitability likely promoting changes in corticostriatal functional connectivity may contribute to the distinctive behavioral phenotype emerging after developmental DAN loss, with implications for our understanding of the age-dependent effects of forebrain dopamine depletion and neurodevelopment disorders.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The loss of striatal dopamine in the adult brain leads to life-threatening motor impairments. However, general motility remains largely unaffected after its early postnatal loss. Here, we show that the high responsiveness to cortical input of striatal neurons belonging to the direct basal ganglia pathway, crucial for proper motor functioning, is preserved after early dopamine neuron loss, in parallel with an increase in these cells' membrane excitability. Chemogenetic inhibition studies show that the preserved motility depends on this direct pathway hyperexcitability/hyperconnectivity, while other phenotypes characteristic of this condition remained unaltered despite the dMSN inhibition. This insight has implications for our understanding of the mechanism underlying the behavioral impairments observed in neuropsychiatric conditions linked to early dopaminergic hypofunction.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Single Nuclei Analyses Reveal Transcriptional Profiles and Marker Genes for Diverse Supraspinal Populations</a></h4>

              
                <p>The mammalian brain contains numerous neurons distributed across forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain that project axons to the lower spinal cord and work in concert to control movement and achieve homeostasis. Extensive work has mapped the anatomic location of supraspinal cell types and continues to establish specific physiological functions. The patterns of gene expression that typify and distinguish these disparate populations, however, are mostly unknown. Here, using adult mice of mixed sex, we combined retrograde labeling of supraspinal cell nuclei with fluorescence-activated nuclei sorting and single-nuclei RNA sequencing analyses to transcriptionally profile neurons that project axons from the brain to lumbar spinal cord. We identified 14 transcriptionally distinct cell types and used a combination of established and newly identified marker genes to assign an anatomic location to each. To validate the putative marker genes, we visualized selected transcripts and confirmed selective expression within lumbar-projecting neurons in discrete supraspinal regions. Finally, we illustrate the potential utility of these data by examining the expression of transcription factors that distinguish different supraspinal cell types and by surveying the expression of receptors for growth and guidance cues that may be present in the spinal cord. Collectively, these data establish transcriptional differences between anatomically defined supraspinal populations, identify a new set of marker genes of use in future experiments, and provide insight into potential differences in cellular and physiological activity across the supraspinal connectome.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The brain communicates with the body through a wide variety of neuronal populations with distinct functions and differential sensitivity to damage and disease. We have used single-nuclei RNA sequencing technology to distinguish patterns of gene expression within a diverse set of neurons that project axons from the mouse brain to the lumbar spinal cord. The results reveal transcriptional differences between populations previously defined on the basis of anatomy, provide new marker genes to facilitate rapid identification of cell type in future work, and suggest distinct responsiveness of different supraspinal populations to external growth and guidance cues.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Circadian Regulation of the Rod Contribution to Mesopic Vision in Mice</a></h4>

              
                <p>At intermediate (mesopic) light levels, rods and cones are both active and can contribute to vision. This presents a challenge to the retina because the visual responses originating with rods and cones are distinct, yet their visual responses must be seamlessly combined. The current study aimed to establish how the circadian clock regulates rod and/or cone vision in these conditions, given the strong time-of-day change in the reliance on each photoreceptor. Visual responses were recorded in the retina and visual thalamus of anaesthetized male mice at distinct circadian time points, and the method of receptor silent substitution was used to selectively stimulate different photoreceptor types. With stimuli designed to only activate rods, responses in the mesopic range were highly rhythmic and peaked in amplitude in the subjective night. This rhythm was abolished following intravitreal injection of the gap junction blocker meclofenamic acid, consistent with a circadian variation in the strength of electrical coupling of photoreceptors. In contrast, responses to stimuli designed to only activate cones were arrhythmic within the mesopic to photopic range when adapted to the background irradiance. The outcome was that combined rod-plus-cone responses showed a stable contrast-response relationship across mesopic-photopic backgrounds in the circadian day, whereas at night, responses were significantly amplified at lower light levels. These data support the idea that the circadian clock is a key regulator of vision, in this case defining the relative amplitude of rod/cone vision across the mesopic transition according to time of day.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Although the importance of circadian clocks in regulating vision has been long recognized, less is known about how the clock shapes vision in conditions where both rods and cones are active (mesopic conditions). Here, the novel approach of receptor silent substitution has been applied to trace rod and cone visual responses in mice across the circadian cycle and has identified pronounced rhythms in rod, but not cone, vision. This has the effect of boosting responses in dimmer backgrounds at night at the cost of impaired contrast&ndash;response stability across the mesopic to photopic range. Thus, the circadian clock drives anticipatory changes in the relative contribution of rods versus cones to vision, which match the prevailing visual environment.</p>

                <p>Two structurally connected brain regions are more likely to interact, with the lengths of the structural bundles, their widths, myelination, and the topology of the structural connectome influencing the timing of the interactions. We introduce an <I>in vivo</I> approach for measuring functional delays across the whole brain in humans (of either sex) using magneto/electroencephalography (MEG/EEG) and integrating them with the structural bundles. The resulting topochronic map of the functional delays/velocities shows that larger bundles have faster velocities. We estimated the topochronic map in multiple sclerosis patients, who have damaged myelin sheaths, and controls, demonstrating greater delays in patients across the network and that structurally lesioned tracts were slowed down more than unaffected ones. We provide a novel framework for estimating functional transmission delays <I>in vivo</I> at the single-subject and single-tract level.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> This article provides a straightforward way to estimate patient-specific delays and conduction velocities in the CNS, at the individual level, in healthy and diseased subjects. To do so, it uses a principled way to merge magnetoencephalography (MEG)/electroencephalography (EEG) and tractography.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Evidence of Serial Dependence from Decoding of Visual Evoked Potentials</a></h4>

              
                <p>It is well known that recent sensory experience influences perception, recently demonstrated by a phenomenon termed "serial dependence." However, its underlying neural mechanisms are poorly understood. We measured ERP responses to pairs of stimuli presented randomly to the left or right hemifield. Seventeen male and female adults judged whether the upper or lower half of the grating had higher spatial frequency, independent of the horizontal position of the grating. This design allowed us to trace the memory signal modulating task performance and also the implicit memory signal associated with hemispheric position. Using classification techniques, we decoded the position of the current and previous stimuli and the response from voltage scalp distributions of the current trial. Classification of previous responses reached full significance only 700 ms after presentation of the current stimulus, consistent with retrieval of an activity-silent memory trace. Cross-condition classification accuracy of past responses (trained on current responses) correlated with the strength of serial dependence effects of individual participants. Overall, our data provide evidence for a silent memory signal that can be decoded from the EEG potential, which interacts with the neural processing of the current stimulus. This silent memory signal could be the physiological substrate subserving at least one type of serial dependence.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The neurophysiological underpinnings of how past perceptual experience affects current perception are poorly understood. Here, we show that recent experience is reactivated when a new stimulus is presented and that the strength of this reactivation correlates with serial biases in individual participants, suggesting that serial dependence is established on the basis of a silent memory signal.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">How Does Literacy Affect Speech Processing? Not by Enhancing Cortical Responses to Speech, But by Promoting Connectivity of Acoustic-Phonetic and Graphomotor Cortices</a></h4>

              
                <p>Previous research suggests that literacy, specifically learning alphabetic letter-to-phoneme mappings, modifies online speech processing and enhances brain responses, as indexed by the BOLD, to speech in auditory areas associated with phonological processing (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B7">Dehaene et al., 2010</cross-ref>). However, alphabets are not the only orthographic systems in use in the world, and hundreds of millions of individuals speak languages that are not written using alphabets. In order to make claims that literacy per se has broad and general consequences for brain responses to speech, one must seek confirmatory evidence from nonalphabetic literacy. To this end, we conducted a longitudinal fMRI study in India probing the effect of literacy in Devanagari, an abubgida, on functional connectivity and cerebral responses to speech in 91 variously literate Hindi-speaking male and female human participants. Twenty-two completely illiterate participants underwent 6 months of reading and writing training. Devanagari literacy increases functional connectivity between acoustic-phonetic and graphomotor brain areas, but we find no evidence that literacy changes brain responses to speech, either in cross-sectional or longitudinal analyses. These findings shows that a dramatic reconfiguration of the neurofunctional substrates of online speech processing may not be a universal result of learning to read, and suggest that the influence of writing on speech processing should also be investigated.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> It is widely claimed that a consequence of being able to read is enhanced auditory processing of speech, reflected by increased cortical responses in areas associated with phonological processing. Here we find no relationship between literacy and the magnitude of brain response to speech stimuli in individuals who speak Hindi, which is written using a nonalphabetic script, Devanagari, an abugida. We propose that the exact nature of the script under examination must be considered before making sweeping claims about the consequences of literacy for the brain. Further, we find evidence that literacy enhances functional connectivity between auditory processing areas and graphomotor areas, suggesting a mechanism whereby learning to write might influence speech perception.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Distinct Roles of Dopamine Receptor Subtypes in the Nucleus Accumbens during Itch Signal Processing</a></h4>

              
                <p>Ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopaminergic neurons, which are well known for their central roles in reward and motivation-related behaviors, have been shown to participate in itch processing via their projection to the nucleus accumbens (NAc). However, the functional roles of different dopamine receptor subtypes in subregions of the NAc during itch processing remain unknown. With pharmacological approaches, we found that the blockade of dopamine D1 receptors (D1R), but not dopamine D2 receptors (D2R), in the lateral shell (LaSh) of the NAc impaired pruritogen-induced scratching behavior in male mice. In contrast, pharmacological activation of D2R in both the LaSh and medial shell (MeSh) of the NAc attenuated the scratching behavior induced by pruritogens. Consistently, we found that dopamine release, as detected by a dopamine sensor, was elevated in the LaSh rather than the MeSh of the NAc at the onset of scratching behavior. Furthermore, the elevation of dopamine release in the LaSh of the NAc persisted even though itch-relieving behavior was blocked, suggesting that the dopamine signal in the NAc LaSh represents a motivational component of itch processing. Our study revealed different dynamics of dopamine release that target neurons expressing two dopamine receptors subtypes within different subregions of the NAc, and emphasized that D1R in the LaSh of the NAc is important in itch signal processing.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Dopamine has been implicated in itch signal processing. However, the mechanism underlying the functional role of dopamine in itch processing remains largely unknown. Here, we examined the role of dopamine D1 receptor (D1R) and D2R in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell during pruritogen-induced scratching behavior. We demonstrated that D1R in the NAc lateral shell (LaSh) play an important role in motivating itch-induced scratching behavior, while activation of D2R would terminate scratching behavior. Our study revealed the diverse functional roles of dopamine signals in the NAc shell during itch processing.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Updating Contextual Sensory Expectations for Adaptive Behavior</a></h4>

              
                <p>The brain has the extraordinary capacity to construct predictive models of the environment by internalizing statistical regularities in the sensory inputs. The resulting sensory expectations shape how we perceive and react to the world; at the neural level, this relates to decreased neural responses to expected than unexpected stimuli ("expectation suppression"). Crucially, expectations may need revision as context changes. However, existing research has often neglected this issue. Further, it is unclear whether contextual revisions apply selectively to expectations relevant to the task at hand, hence serving adaptive behavior. The present fMRI study examined how contextual visual expectations spread throughout the cortical hierarchy as we update our beliefs. We created a volatile environment: two alternating contexts contained different sequences of object images, thereby producing context-dependent expectations that needed revision when the context changed. Human participants of both sexes attended a training session before scanning to learn the contextual sequences. The fMRI experiment then tested for the emergence of contextual expectation suppression in two separate tasks, respectively, with task-relevant and task-irrelevant expectations. Effects of contextual expectation emerged progressively across the cortical hierarchy as participants attuned themselves to the context: expectation suppression appeared first in the insula, inferior frontal gyrus, and posterior parietal cortex, followed by the ventral visual stream, up to early visual cortex. This applied selectively to task-relevant expectations. Together, the present results suggest that an insular and frontoparietal executive control network may guide the flexible deployment of contextual sensory expectations for adaptive behavior in our complex and dynamic world.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The world is structured by statistical regularities, which we use to predict the future. This is often accompanied by suppressed neural responses to expected compared with unexpected events ("expectation suppression"). Crucially, the world is also highly volatile and context-dependent: expected events may become unexpected when the context changes, thus raising the crucial need for belief updating. However, this issue has generally been neglected. By setting up a volatile environment, we show that expectation suppression emerges first in executive control regions, followed by relevant sensory areas, only when observers use their expectations to optimize behavior. This provides surprising yet clear evidence on how the brain controls the updating of sensory expectations for adaptive behavior in our ever-changing world.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Age-Related Learning and Working Memory Impairment in the Common Marmoset</a></h4>

              
                <p>Aging is the greatest risk factor for the development of neurodegenerative diseases, yet we still do not understand how the aging process leads to pathologic vulnerability. The research community has relied heavily on mouse models, but the considerable anatomic, physiological, and cognitive differences between mice and humans limit their translational relevance. Ultimately, these barriers necessitate the development of novel aging models. As a nonhuman primate (NHP), the common marmoset (<I>Callithrix jacchus</I>) shares many features in common with humans and yet has a significantly shorter lifespan (10 years) than other primates, making it ideally suited to longitudinal studies of aging. Our objective was to evaluate the marmoset as a model of age-related cognitive impairment. To do this, we used the Delayed Recognition Span Task (DRST) to characterize age-related changes in working memory capacity in a cohort of sixteen marmosets, of both sexes, varying in age from young adult to geriatric. These monkeys performed thousands of trials over periods of time ranging up to 50% of their adult lifespan. To our knowledge, this represents the most thorough cognitive profiling of any marmoset aging study conducted to date. By analyzing individual learning curves, we found that aged animals exhibited delayed onset of learning, slowed learning rate after onset, and decreased asymptotic working memory performance. These findings are not accounted for by age-related impairments in motor speed and motivation. This work firmly establishes the marmoset as a model of age-related cognitive impairment.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Understanding the normal aging process is fundamental to identifying therapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases for which aging is the biggest risk factor. Historically, the aging field has relied on animal models that differ markedly from humans, constraining translatability. Here, we firmly establish a short-lived nonhuman primate (NHP), the common marmoset, as a key model of age-related cognitive impairment. We demonstrate, through continuous testing over a substantial portion of the adult marmoset lifespan, that aging is associated with both impaired learning and working memory capacity, unaccounted for by age-related changes in motor speed and motivation. Characterizing individual cognitive aging trajectories reveals inherent heterogeneity, which could lead to earlier identification of the onset of impairment, and extended timelines during which therapeutics are effective.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The SYNGAP1 3'UTR Variant in ALS Patients Causes Aberrant SYNGAP1 Splicing and Dendritic Spine Loss by Recruiting HNRNPK</a></h4>

              
                <p>Fused in sarcoma (FUS) is a pathogenic RNA-binding protein in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We previously reported that FUS stabilizes Synaptic Ras-GTPase activating protein 1 (<I>Syngap1</I>) mRNA at its 3' untranslated region (UTR) and maintains spine maturation. To elucidate the pathologic roles of this mechanism in ALS patients, we identified the <I>SYNGAP1</I> 3'UTR variant rs149438267 in seven (four males and three females) out of 807 ALS patients at the FUS binding site from a multicenter cohort in Japan. Human-induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived motor neurons with the <I>SYNGAP1</I> variant showed aberrant splicing, increased isoform &alpha;1 levels, and decreased isoform  levels, which caused dendritic spine loss. Moreover, the <I>SYNGAP1</I> variant excessively recruited FUS and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (HNRNPK), and antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) blocking HNRNPK altered aberrant splicing and ameliorated dendritic spine loss. These data suggest that excessive recruitment of RNA-binding proteins, especially HNRNPK, as well as changes in <I>SYNGAP1</I> isoforms, are crucial for spine formation in motor neurons.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> It is not yet known which RNAs cause the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We previously reported that Fused in sarcoma (FUS), a pathogenic RNA-binding protein in ALS, stabilizes synaptic Ras-GTPase activating protein 1 (<I>Syngap1</I>) mRNA at its 3' untranslated region (UTR) and maintains dendritic spine maturation. To elucidate whether this mechanism is crucial for ALS, we identified the <I>SYNGAP1</I> 3'UTR variant rs149438267 at the FUS binding site. Human-induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived motor neurons with the <I>SYNGAP1</I> variant showed aberrant splicing, which caused dendritic spine loss along with excessive recruitment of FUS and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (HNRNPK). Our findings that dendritic spine loss is because of excess recruitment of RNA-binding proteins provide a basis for the future exploration of ALS-related RNA-binding proteins.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Modulation of Hippocampal Network Oscillation by PICK1-Dependent Cell Surface Expression of mGlu3 Receptors</a></h4>

              
                <p>Metabotropic glutamate receptor Type 3 (mGlu3) controls the sleep/wake architecture, which plays a role in the glutamatergic pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Interestingly, mGlu3 receptor expression is decreased in the brain of schizophrenic patients. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms regulating mGlu3 receptors at the cell membrane. Subcellular receptor localization is strongly dependent on protein&ndash;protein interactions. Here we show that mGlu3 interacts with PICK1 and that this scaffolding protein is important for mGlu3 surface expression and function in hippocampal primary cultures. Disruption of their interaction via an mGlu3 C-terminal mimicking peptide or an inhibitor of the PDZ domain of PICK1 altered the functional expression of mGlu3 receptors in neurons. We next investigated the impact of disrupting the mGlu3-PICK1 interaction on hippocampal theta oscillations <I>in vitro</I> and <I>in vivo</I> in WT male mice. We found a decreased frequency of theta oscillations in organotypic hippocampal slices, similar to what was previously observed in mGlu3 KO mice. In addition, hippocampal theta power was reduced during rapid eye movement sleep, non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, and wake states after intraventricular administration of the mGlu3 C-terminal mimicking peptide. Targeting the mGlu3-PICK1 complex could thus be relevant to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Dysregulation of the glutamatergic system might play a role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Metabotropic glutamate receptors Type 3 (mGlu3) have been proposed as potential targets for schizophrenia. Understanding the molecular mechanisms regulating mGlu3 receptor at the cell membrane is critical toward comprehending how their dysfunction contributes to the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. Here we describe that the binding of the signaling and scaffolding protein PICK1 to mGlu3 receptors is important for their localization and physiological functions. The identification of new proteins that associate specifically to mGlu3 receptors will advance our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms associated with their targeting and function and ultimately might provide new therapeutic strategies to counter these psychiatric conditions.</p>

                Background: Areca nut (Areca catechu Linn.) is the seed of the fruit of the oriental palm that is commonly used among Southeast Asian communities. Chrysanthemum (Dendrathema grandiflora) is a flowering plant originating from East Asia and dominantly grows in China. Both of these plants have strong antioxidant activities. To investigate the mechanism of their wound healing activities, we prepared areca nut and chrysanthemum polyethylene oral gel and performed several in vivo assays using Sprague–Dawley rats. Methods: Sprague–Dawley rats were divided into six groups: Negative control group (rats with base gel treatment), positive control group (rats treated with triamcinolone acetonide), F1 (treatment with 20% areca nut:80% chrysanthemum), F2 (treatment with 50% areca nut:50% chrysanthemum), F3 (treatment with 80% areca nut:20% chrysanthemum), and normal group (without ulcer and treatment). Traumatic ulcers were performed on the buccal mucosa of all experimental animals that received topical oral gel and triamcinolone acetonide twice a day for seven days. The clinical and histological characteristics were analyzed and scored. Results: During the six days, the ulcerated area receded linearly over time and was completely cicatrized in F2, F3, and the positive control group (Dependent t-test, p<0.05). There were significant increases in body weight in F2 and positive control groups. There were no significant differences between groups in histology examination (Kruskal Wallis test, p<0.05). The moderate score of TNF-α levels was seen in F2 and positive control groups (ANOVA/Tukey test, p<0.05). In the collagenases assay, a high concentration of areca nut (F3) induced the abundance of collagen during the ulcer healing process. Conclusions: The combination of areca nut and chrysanthemum extract in the oral gel can optimize the healing of traumatic oral ulcers in Sprague-Dawley rats through the increase of TNF-α and collagen deposition.

                Background: This paper presents a new software tool, Inglämnlagare, developed to be open-source, that restructures information about ancient remains in Sweden for analysis. The background is a new version of the ancient sites database, the Historic Environment Record, curated by the Swedish National Heritage Board, that was launched in 2018 with a new database model that structures the information differently compared to previous versions. Methods: The program, written in Python programming language, has multicore support in order to improve performance for large files and uses regular expressions to extract information about individual features of composite sites. Such features, together with their summed amount, are written as new individual fields to a comma-separated value file. The program is delivered as a source script file that can be executed in any Python environment. Use cases: As an example of use, a case study of exploring graves of rectangular shape found within Sweden is provided. The use case also describes the different steps involved in preparing the data in QGIS to run the program, as well as some methods to efficiently analyse and visualize the output. Conclusions: Inglämnlagare will make more information from the Swedish record of ancient sites accessible for research and can be used to explore different content of the record more efficiently than previously possible. While the tool is written specifically for this dataset it also provides an example of how open-source tools can be used for data wrangling making information designed for a specific purpose, such as online dissemination, appropriate for analysis.

                Background: Food and kitchen hygiene are necessary conditions for safe food and prevent foodborne illnesses. The objective of this study was to identify the factors associated with caregivers’ knowledge of kitchen hygiene in San Juan de Lurigancho (SJL). Methods: This was a cross-sectional study. We surveyed 250 mothers at comedores populares (a sort of community kitchens which are very popular in Lima) and who were part of mothers' clubs in the areas of Huascar V and San Pablo, in SJL in Lima. The sample was selected through non-probability convenience sampling. A questionnaire with three dimensions (cleanliness, storage and contamination of children) was administered. Results: On average, in Huascar and San Pablo, most caregivers were the children’s mothers (93.2%); most of the caregivers were between 21 and 30 years old (54%); they had secondary level of education (70.4%); they were living in free union with their partners (69.2%); they were mainly housewives (80.4%); their houses were constructed with materials different from brick and cement (68.4%); and their houses had a bare floor (70.0%). They did not have drinking water in the kitchen (88.4%); they did not use a gas stove (88.4%), a refrigerator (50.0%), a radio (82.0%), or a microwave (16.4%). A good level of knowledge of food hygiene was found in 63.2% of caregivers. No predictive capacity of the assessed sociodemographic characteristics on the level of knowledge of kitchen hygiene was identified. Conclusions: This study determined that the assessed sociodemographic variables were not significantly associated with the level of knowledge about kitchen hygiene. It is necessary to improve mothers' knowledge about the handling and consumption of spoiled food and their effect on children's health.

                This article uncovers the gothic tropes manifest in the “rotten” food, human bodies, landscapes, and rain in Ernest Hemingway’s A Farewell to Arms through an eco-gothic perspective. It demonstrates how the rotten food, the disjointed bodies, the broken landscapes, and the gothic rain can be viewed in the novel as counter-narratives against the narratives of war, the military, and modern medicine. The first part of this article suggests interpreting war as a form of cannibalism by exploring the representations of rotten food and the connection between eating and killing. Next, the author focuses on how the body is fragmented both metaphorically and literally by the discourse of war, the military, and medical science. The third part uncovers the non-anthropocentric consciousness embedded within the protagonist’s narrative, followed by the gothicizing and romanticization of nature in the fourth section. Here, the protagonist’s linking of the human body to the natural landscape, the descriptions of the gothic rain, and the romanticized snow—all these, as the author argues, can be interpreted as a collective resistance against industrial, anthropocentric warfare.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Micronutrients in Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                About 10 to 20% of reported pregnancies have complications like spontaneous abortion (SA), preeclampsia (PE), preterm birth (PTB), and fetal growth restriction (FGR);  60% are attributed to maternal nutritional alterations. Multiple micronutrients (MMN) are supplemented in the antenatal period, but no proper validation/guidelines are available regarding dosing/time, the need for initiation, and the duration of supplementation. Studies have reported adverse pregnancy complications related to the overuse/unwanted use of multiple micronutrient supplementations during pregnancy. Identifying the exact population requiring supplementation is necessary to prevent its abuse. This article attempts to review the impacts of micronutrient deficiency/supplementation in cases of SA, FGR, and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), preterm delivery and PE.  The study used a literature search using PubMed, Google Scholar, Mendeley, and Scopus Databases using search words pregnancy, spontaneous abortion, gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), fetal growth restriction (FGR), preterm delivery, preeclampsia (PE) or “adverse pregnancy” associated with minerals, micronutrients, or supplementation. The review also considered in-house literature databases, a single-window search at Kasturba Medical College (KMC) Health sciences library, MAHE (Manipal Academy of Higher Education). The figures included in the study were created by Biorender.com. Micronutrients play multiple roles during pregnancy and fetoplacental growth stimulating growth hormone secretion, Lysyl oxidase (LOX), involved in the crosslinking between collagen and elastin in the amniotic membrane, downregulation of interleukin (IL)-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-4, IL-6, Il-10, IL-12, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and several chemokines involved in hypertension, immune-inflammatory pathways, attenuate insulin resistance a structural development of neurons and glia. Over-supplementation has led to complications such as spontaneous abortion and gestational diabetes mellitus. Since there is a lack of standardization concerning micronutrient supplementation during pregnancy, there is a need for  systematic study related to the role of micronutrients during each trimester of pregnancy to optimize its supplementation and to prevent hazards associated with its abuse.

Background <p>Following rapidly rising COVID-19 case numbers, England entered a national lockdown on 6 January 2021, with staged relaxations of restrictions from 8 March 2021 onwards.</p> Aim <p>We characterise how the lockdown and subsequent easing of restrictions affected trends in SARS-CoV-2 infection prevalence.</p> Methods <p>On average, risk of infection is proportional to infection prevalence. The REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission-1 (REACT-1) study is a repeat cross-sectional study of over 98,000 people every round (rounds approximately monthly) that estimates infection prevalence in England. We used Bayesian P-splines to estimate prevalence and the time-varying reproduction number (<i>R</i><sub>t</sub>) nationally, regionally and by age group from round 8 (beginning 6 January 2021) to round 13 (ending 12 July 2021) of REACT-1. As a comparator, a separate segmented-exponential model was used to quantify the impact on <i>R</i><sub>t</sub> of each relaxation of restrictions.</p> Results <p>Following an initial plateau of 1.54% until mid-January, infection prevalence decreased until 13 May when it reached a minimum of 0.09%, before increasing until the end of the study to 0.76%. Following the first easing of restrictions, which included schools reopening, the reproduction number <i>R</i><sub>t</sub> increased by 82% (55%, 108%), but then decreased by 61% (82%, 53%) at the second easing of restrictions, which was timed to match the Easter school holidays. Following further relaxations of restrictions, the observed <i>R</i><sub>t</sub> increased steadily, though the increase due to these restrictions being relaxed was offset by the effects of vaccination and also affected by the rapid rise of Delta. There was a high degree of synchrony in the temporal patterns of prevalence between regions and age groups.</p> Conclusion <p>High-resolution prevalence data fitted to P-splines allowed us to show that the lockdown was effective at reducing risk of infection with school holidays/closures playing a significant part.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Humans combine value learning and hypothesis testing strategically in multi-dimensional probabilistic reward learning</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Mingyu Song, Persis A. Baah, Ming Bo Cai, Yael Niv</p>

Realistic and complex decision tasks often allow for many possible solutions. How do we find the correct one? Introspection suggests a process of trying out solutions one after the other until success. However, such methodical serial testing may be too slow, especially in environments with noisy feedback. Alternatively, the underlying learning process may involve implicit reinforcement learning that learns about many possibilities in parallel. Here we designed a multi-dimensional probabilistic active-learning task tailored to study how people learn to solve such complex problems. Participants configured three-dimensional stimuli by selecting features for each dimension and received probabilistic reward feedback. We manipulated task complexity by changing how many feature dimensions were relevant to maximizing reward, as well as whether this information was provided to the participants. To investigate how participants learn the task, we examined models of serial hypothesis testing, feature-based reinforcement learning, and combinations of the two strategies. Model comparison revealed evidence for hypothesis testing that relies on reinforcement-learning when selecting what hypothesis to test. The extent to which participants engaged in hypothesis testing depended on the instructed task complexity: people tended to serially test hypotheses when instructed that there were fewer relevant dimensions, and relied more on gradual and parallel learning of feature values when the task was more complex. This demonstrates a strategic use of task information to balance the costs and benefits of the two methods of learning.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Systematic assessment of the replicability and generalizability of preclinical findings: Impact of protocol harmonization across laboratory sites</a></h4>

              
                <p>by María Arroyo-Araujo, Bernhard Voelkl, Clément Laloux, Janja Novak, Bastijn Koopmans, Ann-Marie Waldron, Isabel Seiffert, Helen Stirling, Katharina Aulehner, Sanna K. Janhunen, Sylvie Ramboz, Heidrun Potschka, Johanna Holappa, Tania Fine, Maarten Loos, Bruno Boulanger, Hanno Würbel, Martien J. Kas</p>

The influence of protocol standardization between laboratories on their replicability of preclinical results has not been addressed in a systematic way. While standardization is considered good research practice as a means to control for undesired external noise (i.e., highly variable results), some reports suggest that standardized protocols may lead to idiosyncratic results, thus undermining replicability. Through the EQIPD consortium, a multi-lab collaboration between academic and industry partners, we aimed to elucidate parameters that impact the replicability of preclinical animal studies. To this end, 3 experimental protocols were implemented across 7 laboratories. The replicability of results was determined using the distance travelled in an open field after administration of pharmacological compounds known to modulate locomotor activity (MK-801, diazepam, and clozapine) in C57BL/6 mice as a worked example. The goal was to determine whether harmonization of study protocols across laboratories improves the replicability of the results and whether replicability can be further improved by systematic variation (heterogenization) of 2 environmental factors (time of testing and light intensity during testing) within laboratories. Protocols were tested in 3 consecutive stages and differed in the extent of harmonization across laboratories and standardization within laboratories: stage 1, minimally aligned across sites (local protocol); stage 2, fully aligned across sites (harmonized protocol) with and without systematic variation (standardized and heterogenized cohort); and stage 3, fully aligned across sites (standardized protocol) with a different compound. All protocols resulted in consistent treatment effects across laboratories, which were also replicated within laboratories across the different stages. Harmonization of protocols across laboratories reduced between-lab variability substantially compared to each lab using their local protocol. In contrast, the environmental factors chosen to introduce systematic variation within laboratories did not affect the behavioral outcome. Therefore, heterogenization did not reduce between-lab variability further compared to the harmonization of the standardized protocol. Altogether, these findings demonstrate that subtle variations between lab-specific study protocols may introduce variation across independent replicate studies even after protocol harmonization and that systematic heterogenization of environmental factors may not be sufficient to account for such between-lab variation. Differences in replicability of results within and between laboratories highlight the ubiquity of study-specific variation due to between-lab variability, the importance of transparent and fine-grained reporting of methodologies and research protocols, and the importance of independent study replication.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Prevalence of anemia and its associated factors among women of reproductive age group attending Gaur Provincial Hospital: A cross-sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Anemia is a principal public health concern. Worldwide one-third of women of reproductive age are affected. A 2016 survey showed that 41% of women in Nepal had anemia with the highest prevalence in Pradesh two. A complex interaction among socio-political, biological, and ecological elements determines anemia. Assessing the factors would help in minimizing anemia and its consequences. The study aimed to determine the prevalence of anemia in the reproductive age group and the factors affecting anemia.    Methods: A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted among women of the reproductive age group (15–45) from 15th April to 15th June 2022 after ethical clearance was obtained from the Nepal health research council (Ref. 2737/2022). Regarding data collection, 375 women participants were selected via a simple random sampling technique. Participants underwent an interview after informed written consent followed by blood sample collection. Through a semi-structured questionnaire, the data was obtained. Then data entry and its analysis were performed via Microsoft Excel 2019 and Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 22.0.    Results: The study showed that 229 (61.3%) females of the reproductive age group had anemia. Inadequate nutrition (OR 3.0, 1.9–5.0), breastfeeding (OR 7.3, 4.5–11.9), and rural place of residence (OR 4.2, 2.5–7.0) were significantly associated with anemia, with a corresponding odds ratio at 95% confidence each.    Conclusions: The prevalence of anemia was higher among women of the reproductive age group compared to provincial and national prevalence. The interventions should be focused on breastfeeding, nutrition, and rural women to combat anemia.

     alt="Aversive memory reactivation: A possible role for delta oscillations in the hippocampus–amygdala circuit"/>
<p>While rats were retrieving a fear memory, changes in oscillatory patterns were observed in dorsal hippocampus and basolateral amygdala, favoring delta oscillations and their interaction with gamma oscillations, associated with increase in plasticity markers levels. Few differences were observed between controls (non-handled) and maternal separation rats.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Memory labilization, the process by which memories become susceptible to update, is essential for memory reconsolidation and has been a target for novel therapies for traumatic memory-associated disorders. Maternal separation (MS) in male rats produced memories resistant to labilization in adulthood. Based on previous results, we hypothesized that temporal desynchronization between the dorsal hippocampus (DHc) and the basolateral amygdala (BLA), during memory retrieval, could be responsible for this impairment. Our goal was to investigate possible differences in oscillatory activity and synchrony between the DHc and BLA during fear memory reactivation, between MS and non-handled (NH) rats. We used male adult Wistar rats, NH or MS, with electrodes for local field potential (LFP) recordings implanted in the DHc and BLA. Animals were submitted to aversive memory reactivation by exposure to the conditioned context (Reat) or to <i>pseudo</i>-reactivation in a neutral context (pReat), and LFP was recorded. Plasticity markers linked to reconsolidation were evaluated one hour after reactivation. The power of delta oscillations and DHc-BLA synchrony in Reat animals was increased, during freezing. Besides, delta modulation of gamma oscillations amplitude in the BLA was associated with the increase in DHc Zif268 levels, an immediate early gene specifically associated with reconsolidation. Concerning early life stress, we found lower power of delta and strength of delta-gamma oscillations coupling in MS rats, compared to NH, which could explain the low Zif268 levels in a subgroup of MS animals. These results suggest a role for delta oscillations in memory reactivation that should be further investigated.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Besides the well-documented ophthalmic manifestations, thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy (TAO) is believed to be related to emotional and psychological abnormalities. Given the previous neuroimaging evidence, we hypothesized that TAO patients would have altered neurovascular coupling associated with clinical-psychiatric disturbances. This study was to investigate neurovascular coupling changes in TAO by combining resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and arterial spin labeling (ASL) techniques. Amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) was calculated from rs-fMRI, and cerebral blood flow (CBF) was computed from ASL in 37 TAO patients and 21 healthy controls (HCs). Global neurovascular coupling was assessed by across-voxel CBF-ALFF correlation, and regional neurovascular coupling was evaluated by CBF/ALFF ratio. Auxiliary analyses were performed using fractional ALFF (fALFF) and regional homogeneity (ReHo) as rs-fMRI measures. Compared with HCs, TAO patients showed significantly reduced global CBF-ALFF coupling. Moreover, TAO patients exhibited decreased CBF/ALFF ratio in the left lingual gyrus (LG)/fusiform gyrus (FFG), and increased CBF/ALFF ratio in the bilateral precuneus (PCu). In TAOs, CBF/ALFF ratio in the left LG/FFG was positively correlated with visual acuity, while CBF/ALFF ratio in the bilateral PCu was negatively correlated with Montreal Cognitive Assessment score. The auxiliary analyses showed trends of reduced global neurovascular coupling (i.e., CBF-fALFF correlation and CBF-ReHo correlation), as well as significant altered regional neurovascular coupling (i.e., CBF/fALFF ratio and CBF/ReHo ratio) in several brain regions. These findings indicated that TAO patients had altered neurovascular coupling in the visual and higher-order cognitive cortices. The neurovascular decoupling might be a possible neuropathological mechanism of TAO.</p>

     alt="Molecular examination of the endogenous opioid system in rhesus macaque monkeys with self-injurious behavior"/>
<p>The expression of genes related to endogenous opioid signaling was examined in Rhesus macaque (<i>Macaca mulatta</i>) monkeys that self-injure compared to control monkeys, in brain regions important for behavioral and emotional regulation including the amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex, caudate, nucleus accumbens, hippocampus, and hypothalamus. Reduced mRNA levels for the mu opioid receptor were measured in the amygdala, while reduced mRNA levels of dynorphin mRNA were observed in the hypothalamus in monkeys that self-injure compared to controls. This study confirms and extends our knowledge of endogenous opioid signaling in self-injurious behaviors.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Self-injurious behavior (SIB) can lead to serious injury and occurs in approximately 1%–4% of the adult population, with higher incidences in adolescent and institutionalized populations, as well as in children with developmental disorders such as Autism. SIB also spontaneously occurs in a low percentage of captive monkeys. Rhesus macaque (<i>Macaca mulatta</i>) monkeys are evolutionarily and physiologically similar to humans, share 93% genetic sequence similarity to humans, and have long been used as testing subjects for vaccine and clinical trials. Previous studies hypothesized that altered endogenous opioid expression occurs in the brains of individuals and animals that self-injure. We examined the regional mRNA expression of opioid signaling genes in sixteen rhesus macaques that exhibited SIB and eight sex- and age- matched controls. The brain regions examined are linked to reward reinforcement and stress adaptation including the hypothalamus, orbital frontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, hippocampus, caudate, and the amygdala. We found decreased μ-opioid receptor (<i>OPRM1</i>) in the amygdala of monkeys with SIB, and reduced prodynorphin (<i>PDYN</i>) in the hypothalamus. Our data suggest dysfunction in the regulation of opioid peptide precursors and calls for further investigation of the endogenous opioid system in SIB.</p>

<p>The idea, methods, and main conclusions of this study. Mutual transitions between sleep stages were not necessarily the opposite of each other. Sleep stage transitions during the sleep deepening process indicated more significant changes than the sleep awakening process.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Sleep state transitions are closely related to insomnia, drowsiness, and sleep maintenance. However, how the cortical network varies during such a transition process remains unclear. Changes in the cortical interaction during the short-term process of sleep stage transitions were investigated. In all, 40 healthy young participants underwent overnight polysomnography. The phase transfer entropy of six frequency bands was obtained from 16 electroencephalography channels to assess the strength and direction of information flow between the cortical regions. Differences in the cortical network between the first and the last 10 s in a 40-s transition period across wakefulness, N1, N2, N3, and rapid eye movement were, respectively, studied. Various frequency bands exhibited different patterns during the sleep stage transitions. It was found that the mutual transitions between the sleep stages were not necessarily the opposite. More significant changes were observed in the sleep deepening process than in the process of sleep awakening. During sleep stage transitions, changes in the inflow and outflow strength of various cortical regions led to regional differences, but for the entire sleep progress, such an imbalance did not intensify, and a dynamic balance was instead observed. The detailed findings of variations in cortical interactions during sleep stage transition promote understanding of sleep mechanism, sleep process, and sleep function. Additionally, it is expected to provide helpful clues for sleep improvement, like reducing the time required to fall asleep and maintaining sleep depth.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system (CNS), diagnosed at a mean age of 32 years. CNS glia are crucial players in the onset of MS, primarily involving astrocytes and microglia that can cause/allow massive oligodendroglial cells death, without immune cell infiltration. Current therapeutic approaches are aimed at modulating inflammatory reactions during relapsing episodes, but lack the ability to induce very significant repair mechanisms. In this review article, different experimental approaches based mainly on the application of different cell types as therapeutic strategies applied for the induction of myelin repair and/or the amelioration of the disease are discussed. Regarding this issue, different cell sources were applied in various experimental models of MS, with different results, both in significant improvements in remyelination and the reduction of neuroinflammation and glial activation, or in neuroprotection. All cell types tested have advantages and disadvantages, which makes it difficult to choose a better option for therapeutic application in MS. New strategies combining cell-based treatment with other applications would result in further improvements and would be good candidates for MS cell therapy and myelin repair.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Neurons and glia are the two main cell classes in the nervous systems of most animals. Although functionally distinct, neurons and glia are both characterized by multiple branching arbors stemming from the cell bodies. Glial processes are generally known to form smaller trees than neuronal dendrites. However, the full extent of morphological differences between neurons and glia in multiple species and brain regions has not yet been characterized, nor is it known whether these cells can be reliably distinguished based on geometric features alone. Here, we show that multiple supervised learning algorithms deployed on a large database of morphological reconstructions can systematically classify neuronal and glial arbors with nearly perfect accuracy and precision. Moreover, we report multiple morphometric properties, both size related and size independent, that differ substantially between these cell types. In particular, we newly identify an individual morphometric measurement, Average Branch Euclidean Length that can robustly separate neurons from glia across multiple animal models, a broad diversity of experimental conditions, and anatomical areas, with the notable exception of the cerebellum. We discuss the practical utility and physiological interpretation of this discovery.</p>

<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Chronic and excessive alcohol consumption can result in alcohol use disorder (AUD) without neurological complications and in Korsakoff's syndrome (KS) when combined with thiamine deficiency. These two clinical forms are accompanied by widespread structural brain damage in both the fronto-cerebellar (FCC) and Papez circuits (PC) as well as in the parietal cortex, resulting in cognitive and motor deficits. BEARNI is a screening tool especially designed to detect neuropsychological impairments in AUD. However, the sensitivity of this tool to the structural brain damage of AUD and KS patients remains unknown. Eighteen KS patients, 47 AUD patients and 27 healthy controls (HC) underwent the BEARNI test and a 3 T-MRI examination. Multiple regression analyses conducted between GM density and performance on each BEARNI subtest revealed correlations with regions included in the FCC, PC, thalamus and posterior cortex (precuneus and calcarine regions). All these brain regions were altered in KS compared to HC, in agreement with the cognitive deficits observed in the corresponding BEARNI subtests. The comparison between KS and AUD regarding the GM density in the several nodes of the FCC and calcarine regions revealed that they were atrophied to the same extent, suggesting that BEARNI is sensitive to the severity of alcohol-related GM abnormalities. Within the PC, the density of the cingulate cortex and thalamus, which correlated with the memory and fluency subscores, was smaller in KS than in AUD, suggesting that BEARNI is sensitive to specific brain abnormalities occurring in KS.</p>

<p>In vitro tissue engineering provides a novel approach to investigate the cellular and molecular effects of traumatic brain injury. Here, we describe a bioengineered 3D brain-like human tissue culture system to study primary blast-induced traumatic brain injury.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Primary blast injury is caused by the direct impact of an overpressurization wave on the body. Due to limitations of current models, we have developed a novel approach to study primary blast-induced traumatic brain injury. Specifically, we employ a bioengineered 3D brain-like human tissue culture system composed of collagen-infused silk protein donut-like hydrogels embedded with human IPSC-derived neurons, human astrocytes, and a human microglial cell line. We have utilized this system within an advanced blast simulator (ABS) to expose the 3D brain cultures to a blast wave that can be precisely controlled. These 3D cultures are enclosed in a 3D-printed surrogate skull-like material containing media which are then placed in a holder apparatus inside the ABS. This allows for exposure to the blast wave alone without any secondary injury occurring. We show that blast induces an increase in lactate dehydrogenase activity and glutamate release from the cultures, indicating cellular injury. Additionally, we observe a significant increase in axonal varicosities after blast. These varicosities can be stained with antibodies recognizing amyloid precursor protein. The presence of amyloid precursor protein deposits may indicate a blast-induced axonal transport deficit. After blast injury, we find a transient release of the known TBI biomarkers, UCHL1 and NF-H at 6 h and a delayed increase in S100B at 24 and 48 h. This in vitro model will enable us to gain a better understanding of clinically relevant pathological changes that occur following primary blast and can also be utilized for discovery and characterization of biomarkers.</p>

<p>Prenatal cannabis exposure (PCE) is associated with cognitive, motor, and social deficits among children. However, the neural mechanisms underlying these associations are unclear. This study examined the impact of PCE on organization of large-scale core neurocognitive networks in children.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Cannabis use among pregnant people has increased over the past decade. This is of concern as prenatal cannabis exposure (PCE) is associated with cognitive, motor, and social deficits among offspring. Here, we examined resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) of the salience network (SN)—a core neurocognitive network that integrates emotional and sensory information—in children with (vs. without) PCE. Using neuroimaging and developmental history data collected from 10,719 children (M ± SD = 9.92 ± 0.62 years; 47.9% female) from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study, we assessed the impact of parent-reported PCE (before or after knowledge of pregnancy) on rsFC within and between the SN and five other core neurocognitive networks. We also evaluated whether SN rsFC mediated the association between PCE and child psychopathology. Results showed that PCE before (but not after) knowledge of pregnancy was associated with lower SN-ventral attention network (VAN) rsFC. Furthermore, psychotic-like experiences mediated the association between PCE and SN-VAN rsFC, and reversal of the model was also significant, such that SN-VAN rsFC mediated the association between PCE and psychotic-like symptoms. However, these mediation effects were no longer significant after the inclusion of covariates. Taken together, these findings suggest that developmental alterations in SN-VAN interactions may explain the previously reported association between PCE and elevated risk of child psychopathology.</p>

<p>In this study, we propose that the resilience of structural hub disruption compensated by functional connectivity in the DMN underlies the stable disability compensating by the aging of RRMS.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory and demyelinating disease which leads to impairment in several functional systems including cognition. Alteration of brain networks is linked to disability and its progression. However, results are mostly cross-sectional and yet contradictory as putative adaptive and maladaptive mechanisms were found. Here, we aimed to explore longitudinal reorganization of brain networks over 2-years by combining diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), resting-state functional MRI (fMRI), magnetoencephalography (MEG), and a comprehensive neuropsychological-battery. In 37 relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) and 39 healthy-controls, cognition remained stable over-time. We reconstructed network models based on the three modalities and analyzed connectivity in relation to the hierarchical topology and functional subnetworks. Network models were compared across modalities and in their association with cognition using linear-mixed-effect-regression models. Loss of hub connectivity and global reduction was observed on a structural level over-years (<i>p</i> &lt; .010), which was similar for functional MEG-networks but not for fMRI-networks. Structural hub connectivity increased in controls (<i>p</i> = .044), suggesting a physiological mechanism of healthy aging. Despite a general loss in structural connectivity in RRMS, hub connectivity was preserved (<i>p</i> = .002) over-time in default-mode-network (DMN). MEG-networks were similar to DTI and weakly correlated with fMRI in MS (<i>p</i> &lt; .050). Lower structural (<i>β</i> between .23–.33) and both lower (<i>β</i> between .40–.59) and higher functional connectivity (<i>β</i> = −.54) in DMN was associated with poorer performance in attention and memory in RRMS (<i>p</i> &lt; .001). MEG-networks involved no association with cognition. Here, cognitive stability despite ongoing neurodegeneration might indicate a resilience mechanism of DMN hubs mimicking a physiological reorganization observed in healthy aging.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=10974547&type=etoc&feed=rss">Arithmetic in the signing brain: Differences and similarities in arithmetic processing between deaf signers and hearing non‐signers</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Deaf signers and hearing non-signers have previously been shown to recruit partially different brain regions during simple arithmetic. In light of the triple code model, the differences were interpreted as relating to stronger recruitment of the verbal system of numerical processing, that is, left angular and inferior frontal gyrus, in hearing non-signers, and of the quantity system of numerical processing, that is, right horizontal intraparietal sulcus, for deaf signers. The main aim of the present study was to better understand similarities and differences in the neural correlates supporting arithmetic in deaf compared to hearing individuals. Twenty-nine adult deaf signers and 29 hearing non-signers were enrolled in an functional magnetic resonance imaging study of simple and difficult subtraction and multiplication. Brain imaging data were analyzed using whole-brain analysis, region of interest analysis, and functional connectivity analysis. Although the groups were matched on age, gender, and nonverbal intelligence, the deaf group performed generally poorer than the hearing group in arithmetic. Nevertheless, we found generally similar networks to be involved for both groups, the only exception being the involvement of the left inferior frontal gyrus. This region was activated significantly stronger for the hearing compared to the deaf group but showed stronger functional connectivity with the left superior temporal gyrus in the deaf, compared to the hearing, group. These results lend no support to increased recruitment of the quantity system in deaf signers. Perhaps the reason for performance differences is to be found in other brain regions not included in the original triple code model.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The RAM signaling pathway links morphology, thermotolerance, and CO2 tolerance in the global fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans</a></h4>

              
                The environmental pathogen <i>Cryptococcus neoformans</i> claims over 180,000 lives each year. Survival of this basidiomycete at host CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations has only recently been considered an important virulence trait. Through screening gene knockout libraries constructed in a CO<sub>2</sub>-tolerant clinical strain, we found mutations leading to CO<sub>2</sub> sensitivity are enriched in pathways activated by heat stress, including calcineurin, Ras1-Cdc24, cell wall integrity, and Regulator of Ace2 and Morphogenesis (RAM). Overexpression of Cbk1, the conserved terminal kinase of the RAM pathway, partially restored defects of these mutants at host CO<sub>2</sub> or temperature levels. In ascomycetes such as <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> and <i>Candida albicans</i>, transcription factor Ace2 is an important target of Cbk1, activating genes responsible for cell separation. However, no Ace2 homolog or any downstream component of the RAM pathway has been identified in basidiomycetes. Through <i>in vitro</i> evolution and comparative genomics, we characterized mutations in suppressors of <i>cbk1</i>D in <i>C. neoformans</i> that partially rescued defects in CO<sub>2</sub> tolerance, thermotolerance, and morphology. One suppressor is the RNA translation repressor Ssd1, which is highly conserved in ascomycetes and basidiomycetes. The other is a novel ribonuclease domain-containing protein, here named <i>PSC1</i>, which is present in basidiomycetes and humans but surprisingly absent in most ascomycetes. Loss of Ssd1 in <i>cbk1</i>D partially restored cryptococcal ability to survive and amplify in the inhalation and intravenous murine models of cryptococcosis. Our discoveries highlight the overlapping regulation of CO<sub>2</sub> tolerance and thermotolerance, the essential role of the RAM pathway in cryptococcal adaptation to the host condition, and the potential importance of post-transcriptional control of virulence traits in this global pathogen.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Phenotyping single-cell motility in microfluidic confinement</a></h4>

              
                The movement trajectories of organisms serve as dynamic read-outs of their behaviour and physiology. For microorganisms this can be difficult to resolve due to their small size and fast movement. Here, we devise a novel droplet microfluidics assay to encapsulate single micron-sized algae inside closed arenas, enabling ultralong high-speed tracking of the same cell. Comparing two model species - <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> (freshwater, 2 cilia), and <i>Pyramimonas octopus</i> (marine, 8 cilia), we detail their highly-stereotyped yet contrasting swimming behaviours and environmental interactions. By measuring the rates and probabilities with which cells transition between a trio of motility states (smooth-forward swimming, quiescence, tumbling or excitable backward swimming), we reconstruct the control network that underlies this gait switching dynamics. A simplified model of cell-roaming in circular confinement reproduces the observed long-term behaviours and spatial fluxes, including novel boundary circulation behaviour. Finally, we establish an assay in which pairs of droplets are fused on demand, one containing a trapped cell with another containing a chemical that perturbs cellular excitability, to reveal how aneural microorganisms adapt their locomotor patterns in real-time.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Transcriptome-wide association study and eQTL colocalization identify potentially causal genes responsible for human bone mineral density GWAS associations</a></h4>

              
                Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) for bone mineral density (BMD) in humans have identified over 1100 associations to date. However, identifying causal genes implicated by such studies has been challenging. Recent advances in the development of transcriptome reference datasets and computational approaches such as transcriptome-wide association studies (TWASs) and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) colocalization have proven to be informative in identifying putatively causal genes underlying GWAS associations. Here, we used TWAS/eQTL colocalization in conjunction with transcriptomic data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project to identify potentially causal genes for the largest BMD GWAS performed to date. Using this approach, we identified 512 genes as significant using both TWAS and eQTL colocalization. This set of genes was enriched for regulators of BMD and members of bone relevant biological processes. To investigate the significance of our findings, we selected <i>PPP6R3</i>, the gene with the strongest support from our analysis which was not previously implicated in the regulation of BMD, for further investigation. We observed that <i>Ppp6r3</i> deletion in mice decreased BMD. In this work, we provide an updated resource of putatively causal BMD genes and demonstrate that <i>PPP6R3</i> is a putatively causal BMD GWAS gene. These data increase our understanding of the genetics of BMD and provide further evidence for the utility of combined TWAS/colocalization approaches in untangling the genetics of complex traits.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A general approach for stabilizing nanobodies for intracellular expression</a></h4>

              
                Conventional antibodies and their derived fragments are difficult to deploy against intracellular targets in live cells, due to their bulk and structural complexity. Nanobodies provide an alternative modality, with well-documented examples of intracellular expression. Despite their promise as intracellular reagents, there has not been a systematic study of nanobody intracellular expression. Here, we examined intracellular expression of 75 nanobodies from the Protein Data Bank. Surprisingly, a majority of these nanobodies were unstable in cells, illustrated by aggregation and clearance. Using comparative analysis and framework mutagenesis, we developed a general approach that stabilized a great majority of nanobodies that were originally unstable intracellularly, without significantly compromising target binding. This approach led to the identification of distinct sequence features that impacted the intracellular stability of tested nanobodies. Mutationally stabilized nanobody expression was found to extend to in vivo contexts, in the murine retina and in <i>E. coli</i>. These data provide for improvements in nanobody engineering for intracellular applications, potentiating a growing field of intracellular interrogation and intervention.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cortex-wide response mode of VIP-expressing inhibitory neurons by reward and punishment</a></h4>

              
                Neocortex is classically divided into distinct areas, each specializing in different function, but all could benefit from reinforcement feedback to inform and update local processing. Yet it remains elusive how global signals like reward and punishment are represented in local cortical computations. Previously, we identified a cortical neuron type, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP)-expressing interneurons, in auditory cortex that is recruited by behavioral reinforcers and mediates disinhibitory control by inhibiting other inhibitory neurons. As the same disinhibitory cortical circuit is present virtually throughout cortex, we wondered whether VIP neurons are likewise recruited by reinforcers throughout cortex. We monitored VIP neural activity in dozens of cortical regions using three-dimensional random access two-photon microscopy and fiber photometry while mice learned an auditory discrimination task. We found that reward and punishment during initial learning produce rapid, cortex-wide activation of most VIP interneurons. This global recruitment mode showed variations in temporal dynamics in individual neurons and across areas. Neither the weak sensory tuning of VIP interneurons in visual cortex nor their arousal state modulation was fully predictive of reinforcer responses. We suggest that the global response mode of cortical VIP interneurons supports a cell-type-specific circuit mechanism by which organism-level information about reinforcers regulates local circuit processing and plasticity.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Centrally expressed Cav3.2 T-type calcium channel is critical for the initiation and maintenance of neuropathic pain</a></h4>

              
                Cav3.2 T-type calcium channel is a major molecular actor of neuropathic pain in peripheral sensory neurons, but its involvement at the supra-spinal level is almost unknown. In the Anterior Pretectum (APT), a hub of connectivity of the somatosensory system involved in pain perception, we show that Cav3.2 channels are expressed in a sub-population of GABAergic neurons co-expressing parvalbumin (PV). In these PV-expressing neurons, Cav3.2 channels contribute to a high frequency bursting activity, which is increased in the spared nerve injury model of neuropathy. Specific deletion of Cav3.2 channels in APT neurons reduced both the initiation and maintenance of mechanical and cold allodynia. These data are a direct demonstration that centrally expressed Cav3.2 channels also play a fundamental role in pain pathophysiology.

                As the only major retrograde transporter along microtubules, cytoplasmic dynein plays crucial roles in the intracellular transport of organelles and other cargoes. Central to the function of this motor protein complex is dynein intermediate chain (IC), which binds the three dimeric dynein light chains at multivalent sites, and dynactin p150<sup>Glued</sup> and nuclear distribution protein (NudE) at overlapping sites of its intrinsically disordered N-terminal domain. The disorder in IC has hindered cryo-electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography studies of its structure and interactions. Here we use a suite of biophysical methods to reveal how multivalent binding of the three light chains regulate IC interactions with p150<sup>Glued</sup> and NudE. Using IC from <i>Chaetomium thermophilum</i>, a tractable species to interrogate IC interactions, we identify a significant reduction in binding affinity of IC to p150<sup>Glued</sup> and a loss of binding to NudE for constructs containing the entire N-terminal domain as well as for full-length constructs when compared to the tight binding observed with short IC constructs. We attribute this difference to autoinhibition caused by long-range intramolecular interactions between the N-terminal single α-helix of IC, the common site for p150<sup>Glued</sup> and NudE binding, and residues closer to the end of the N-terminal domain. Reconstitution of IC subcomplexes demonstrate that autoinhibition is differentially regulated by light chains binding, underscoring their importance both in assembly and organization of IC, and in selection between multiple binding partners at the same site.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Variation in the ACE2 receptor has limited utility for SARS-CoV-2 host prediction</a></h4>

              
                Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from humans to other species threatens wildlife conservation and may create novel sources of viral diversity for future zoonotic transmission. A variety of computational heuristics have been developed to pre-emptively identify susceptible host species based on variation in the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor used for viral entry. However, the predictive performance of these heuristics remains unknown. Using a newly compiled database of 96 species, we show that, while variation in ACE2 can be used by machine learning models to accurately predict animal susceptibility to sarbecoviruses (accuracy = 80.2%, binomial confidence interval [CI]: 70.8–87.6%), the sites informing predictions have no known involvement in virus binding and instead recapitulate host phylogeny. Models trained on host phylogeny alone performed equally well (accuracy = 84.4%, CI: 75.5–91.0%) and at a level equivalent to retrospective assessments of accuracy for previously published models. These results suggest that the predictive power of ACE2-based models derives from strong correlations with host phylogeny rather than processes which can be mechanistically linked to infection biology. Further, biased availability of ACE2 sequences misleads projections of the number and geographic distribution of at-risk species. Models based on host phylogeny reduce this bias, but identify a very large number of susceptible species, implying that model predictions must be combined with local knowledge of exposure risk to practically guide surveillance. Identifying barriers to viral infection or onward transmission beyond receptor binding and incorporating data which are independent of host phylogeny will be necessary to manage the ongoing risk of establishment of novel animal reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2.

                Infection with the etiological agent of COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, appears capable of impacting cognition, which some patients with Post-acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC). To evaluate neuro-pathophysiological consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we examine transcriptional and cellular signatures in the Broadman area 9 (BA9) of the frontal cortex and the hippocampal formation (HF) in SARS-CoV-2, Alzheimers disease (AD) and SARS-CoV-2 infected AD individuals, compared to age- and gender-matched neurological cases. Here we show similar alterations of neuroinflammation and blood-brain barrier integrity in SARS-CoV-2, AD, and SARS-CoV-2 infected AD individuals. Distribution of microglial changes reflected by the increase of Iba-1 reveal nodular morphological alterations in SARS-CoV-2 infected AD individuals. Similarly, HIF-1 is significantly upregulated in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the same brain regions regardless of AD status. The finding may help to inform decision-making regarding therapeutic treatments in patients with neuro-PASC, especially those at increased risk of developing AD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Deficits in integrative NMDA receptors caused by Grin1 disruption can be rescued in adulthood</a></h4>

              
                Glutamatergic NMDA receptors (NMDAR) are critical for cognitive function, and their reduced expression leads to intellectual disability. Since subpopulations of NMDARs exist in distinct subcellular environments, their functioning may be unevenly vulnerable to genetic disruption. Here, we investigate synaptic and extrasynaptic NMDARs on the major output neurons of the prefrontal cortex in mice deficient for the obligate NMDAR subunit encoded by Grin1 and wild-type littermates. With whole-cell recording in brain slices, we find that single, low-intensity stimuli elicit surprisingly-similar glutamatergic synaptic currents in both genotypes. By contrast, clear genotype differences emerge with manipulations that recruit extrasynaptic NMDARs, including stronger, repetitive, or pharmacological stimulation. These results reveal a disproportionate functional deficit of extrasynaptic NMDARs compared to their synaptic counterparts. To probe the repercussions of this deficit, we examine an NMDAR-dependent phenomenon considered a building block of cognitive integration, basal dendrite plateau potentials. Since we find this phenomenon is readily evoked in wild-type but not in Grin1-deficient mice, we ask whether plateau potentials can be restored by an adult intervention to increase Grin1 expression. This genetic manipulation, previously shown to restore cognitive performance in adulthood, successfully rescues electrically-evoked basal dendrite plateau potentials after a lifetime of NMDAR compromise. Taken together, our work demonstrates NMDAR subpopulations are not uniformly vulnerable to the genetic disruption of their obligate subunit. Furthermore, the window for functional rescue of the more-sensitive integrative NMDARs remains open into adulthood.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Modulatory effect of non-invasive prefrontal brain stimulation on risk-taking behaviours in humans: preliminary insight on the influence of personality traits</a></h4>

              
                We investigated the modulatory effects of cathodal High-Definition transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (HD-tDCS) on the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) on risk-taking. Methods: Thirty-four healthy adults underwent 3 independent cathodal HD-tDCS interventions (DLPFC, VLPFC, sham) delivered in counterbalanced order during the performance of the balloon analogue risk task (autoBART). Participants were clustered post-hoc in 3 separate personality profiles according to the HEXACO-60 and the Dark Triad dirty dozen and we reanalysed the data. Results: Dorsal prefrontal cathodal HD-tDCS significantly modulated autoBART performance rendering participants less prone to risk-taking (i.e., more conservative) under left DLPFC HD-tDCS compared to left VLPFC or sham stimulation. The re-analysis of the same dataset, taking into consideration personality traits, suggested specific effects in impulsive-disinhibited and normative participants for DLPFC and VLPFC stimulation, respectively. Specifically, we saw that participants classified as impulsive-disinhibited were more affected by HD-tDCS left DLPFC stimulation than other profiles. Conclusions: Both, dorsal and ventral prefrontal active HD-tDCS decrease risk-taking behaviour compared to sham stimulation. Importantly, such effects are likely influenced by personality traits (impulsive disinhibited vs normative) exhibited by the participants.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Differential reach vector computations in mIPS and PMd as revealed through HD-tDCS</a></h4>

              
                Recent neural and behavioural findings provide support that the medial intraparietal sulcus (mIPS) and dorsal premotor (PMd) activity reflect aspects of a kinematic plan for reaching movements. However, it is unclear how these two regions differentially contribute to reach planning. Here, we used high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS; 4 x 1 electrode placement; 2 mA for 20 min; 3 cm radius) to investigate the functional roles of mIPS and PMd in the left hemisphere of humans. We examined the changes in endpoint error in reaching task with different initial hand positions and different target locations spanning both visual hemi-fields. Participants completed the task with (stimulation, post-stimulation) and without stimulation (pre-stimulation) of individually fMRI-localized cortical areas mIPS and PMd. We found a significant interaction effect between initial hand position (IHP) and target position on the difference in horizontal endpoint error after cathodal left mIPS stimulation and significant IHP and target position main effects after cathodal left PMd stimulation, suggesting that IHP and target position are not yet integrated into a movement vector at the input of the mIPS, but are integrated in the input of PMd. Hence, these findings reveal a distinction between mIPS and PMd in the stages of movement vector formation for reaching movements and indicate that HD-tDCS is a viable method for perturbing localized cortical activity to elucidate localized cortical function.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">IFNγ drives neuroinflammation and demyelination in a mouse model of multiple system atrophy</a></h4>

              
                Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a rare and fatal synucleinopathy characterized by insoluble alpha-synuclein (-syn) cytoplasmic inclusions located within oligodendroglia. Neuroinflammation, demyelination, and neurodegeneration are correlated with areas of GCI pathology, however it is not known what specifically drives disease pathogenesis. Recently in a mouse model of MSA, CD4+ T cells have been shown to drive neuroinflammation and demyelination, however the mechanism by which this occurs also remains unclear. In this study we use genetic and pharmacological approaches in a novel model of MSA to show that the pro-inflammatory cytokine interferon gamma (IFN{gamma}) drives neuroinflammation and demyelination. Furthermore, using an IFN{gamma} reporter mouse, we found that infiltrating CD4+ T cells were the primary producers of IFN{gamma} in response to -syn overexpression in oligodendrocytes. Results from these studies indicate that IFN{gamma} expression in CD4 T cells drives -syn-mediated neuroinflammation and demyelination, and strategies to target IFN{gamma} expression may be a potential disease modifying therapeutic strategy for MSA.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Tau pathology in the dorsal raphe may be a prodromal indicator of Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                Protein aggregation in brainstem nuclei is thought to occur in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but its specific role in driving prodromal symptoms and disease progression is largely unknown. The dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) contains a large population of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) neurons that regulate mood, reward-related behavior, and sleep, all of which are disrupted in AD. We report here that tau pathology is present in the DRN of cognitively intact individuals 54-80 years of age, whereas synuclein and TDP-43 are relatively absent. Almost all AD cases had tau pathology in the DRN, whereas only a subset contained TDP-43 or synuclein, but not both. Mice overexpressing human P301L-tau in the DRN also exhibited depressive-like behaviors and hyperactivity without any deficits in spatial memory. There was a negative correlation between the density of Tph2-expressing neurons and phospho-tau (ptau) optical density in P301L-tauDRN mice, although mean Tph2 expression did not differ significantly from the controls. 5-HT neurons were hyperexcitable in P301L-tauDRN mice, and there was an increase in the amplitude of excitatory post-synaptic currents (EPSCs) which is suggestive of increased glutamatergic transmission. Astrocytic density was also elevated in the DRN and accompanied by an increase in GFAP expression, as well as changes in Htr2a, Htr2c, and Htr3a gene expression. Additionally, tau pathology was detected in axonal processes in the thalamus, hypothalamus, amygdala, and caudate putamen, suggesting that tau may spread in an anterograde manner to regions outside the DRN. Together, these results suggest that tau pathology accumulates in the DRN in a subset of individuals over 50 years and may lead to prodromal AD symptoms, 5-HT neuronal dysfunction, and activation of local astrocytes. The presence of tau pathology in the DRN combined with psychiatric assessments for depression may be a useful screening tool for individuals at risk for AD.

                It has long been known that human breathing is altered during listening and speaking compared to rest. Theoretical models of human communication suggest two distinct phenomena during speaking and listening: During speaking, inhalation depth is adjusted to the air volume required for the upcoming utterance. During listening, inhalation is temporally aligned to inhalation of the speaker. While evidence for the former is relatively strong, it is virtually absent for the latter. We address both questions using recordings of speech envelope and respiration in 30 participants during 14 minutes of speaking and listening. We extend existing evidence for the first phenomenon by using the speech envelope to show that inhalation depth is positively correlated with the total power of the speech envelope in the following utterance. Pertaining to the second phenomenon, we provide first evidence that inhalation during listening to your own speech is significantly more likely at time points of inhalation during speaking. These findings are compatible with models that postulate alignment of internal forward models of interlocutors with the aim to facilitate communication.

                Early-life adversity impacts on anxiety-related behaviors in adulthood. The effects of such adversity not only affects the animal itself, but can be passed on transgenerationally. Pervasive effects of experimentally-induced early-life stress (ELS) have been documented in adult zebrafish but it is not clear if this can be passed on via the germline. Here, we investigated the effects of ELS across three generations, by analyzing the responses of adult animals exposed to ELS in two different anxiety-related tasks, as well as in social behavior, memory, and cognition. Animals exposed to ELS (at 7 days-post-fertilization) showed a marked attenuation of specific anxiety-related behaviors (F0) when adults, and these alterations were maintained across two subsequent generations (F1 and F2). These findings suggest that zebrafish may be a useful model organism to study the transgenerational effects of ELS, and how this pertains to (for example) neuropsychiatric disorders. In addition, our data may naturally provoke questions regarding the consideration of the environment of laboratory-housed zebrafish at early developmental stages. In particular, more work may be necessary to determine how different environmental stressors could affect data variability across laboratories.

                The retina, behind the transparent optics of the eye, is the only neural tissue whose physiology and pathology can be non-invasively probed by optical microscopy. The aberrations intrinsic to the mouse eye, however, prevent high-resolution investigation of retinal structure and function in vivo. Optimizing the design of a two-photon fluorescence microscope (2PFM) and sample preparation procedure, we found that adaptive optics (AO), by measuring and correcting ocular aberrations, is essential for resolving synapses and achieving three-dimensional cellular resolution in the mouse retina in vivo. Applying AO-2PFM to longitudinal retinal imaging in transgenic models of retinal pathology, we characterized microvascular lesions and observed microglial migration in a proliferative vascular retinopathy model, and found Lidocaine to effectively suppress retinal ganglion cell hyperactivity in a retinal degeneration model. Tracking structural and functional changes at high resolution longitudinally, AO-2PFM enables microscopic investigations of retinal pathology and pharmacology for disease diagnosis and treatment in vivo.
