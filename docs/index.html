<p>Publication date: December 2019</p><p><b>Source:</b> Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 59</p><p>Author(s): Vijay Swahari, Anne E West</p><div><p>For more than 40 years after its discovery, histone methylation was thought to be largely irreversible. However, the first histone demethylase (HDM) was identified in 2004, challenging this notion. Since that time, more than 20 HDMs have been identified and characterized, and many have been shown to have critical roles in organismal development, cell fate, and disease. Here, we highlight some of the recent advances in our understanding of the function of HDMs in the context of neuronal development, plasticity, and disease. We focus, in particular, on molecular genetic studies of LSD1, Kdm6b, and Kdm5c that have elucidated both enzymatic and non-enzymatic gene regulatory functions of these HDMs in neurons.</p></div>

<p>While it is still not possible to describe the neural-level connections of
the human brain, we can map the human connectome with several hundred vertices,
by the application of diffusion-MRI based techniques. In these graphs, the
nodes correspond to anatomically identified gray matter areas of the brain,
while the edges correspond to the axonal fibers, connecting these areas. In our
previous contributions, we have described numerous graph-theoretical phenomena
of the human connectomes. Here we map the frequent complete subgraphs of the
human brain networks: in these subgraphs, every pair of vertices is connected
by an edge. We also examine sex differences in the results. The mapping of the
frequent subgraphs gives robust substructures in the graph: if a subgraph is
present in the 80\% of the graphs, then, most probably, it could not be an
artifact of the measurement or the data processing workflow. We list here the
frequent complete subgraphs of the female and the male braingraphs of 414
subjects, each with 463 nodes, with a frequency threshold of 80\%, and identify
complete subgraphs, which are more frequent in male and female connectomes,
respectively.

<p>The visual system is an intricate network of brain regions that enables us to
recognize the world around us. Despite its abundant lateral and feedback
connections, human object processing is commonly viewed and studied as a
feedforward process. Here, we measure and model the rapid representational
dynamics across multiple stages of the human ventral stream using time-resolved
brain imaging and deep learning. We observe substantial representational
transformations during the first 300 ms of processing within and across
ventral-stream regions. Categorical divisions emerge in sequence, cascading
forward and in reverse across regions, and Granger causality analysis suggests
bidirectional information flow between regions. Finally, recurrent deep neural
network models clearly outperform feedforward models in terms of their ability
to jointly capture the multi-region cortical dynamics. These results establish
that recurrent models are required to understand information processing in the
human ventral stream.

<p>This chapter takes as its departure point a neural level theory of insight
that arose from studies of the sparse, distributed, content-addressable
architecture of associative memory. It is argued that convergent thought is
most fruitfully characterized in terms of, not the generation of a single
correct solution (as it is conventionally construed), but using concepts in
their most compact form by activating neural cell assemblies that respond to
their most typical properties. This allows them to be deployed in a
conventional manner such that effort is reserved for exploring causal
relationships. Conversely, it is argued that divergent thought is most
fruitfully characterized in terms of, not the generation of multiple solutions
(as it is conventionally construed), but using concepts in a form that is,
albeit expanded, constrained by the situation, by activating neural cell
assemblies that respond to context-specific atypical properties. This allows
them to be deployed in a manner that is conducive to exploring unconventional
yet potentially relevant associations, and unearthing potentially useful
relationships of correlation. Thus, divergent thought can involve as few as one
idea. This proposal is compatible with widespread beliefs that (1) most
creative tasks require not many solutions but one, yet entail both divergent
and convergent thinking, and (2) not all problems with multiple solutions
require creative thinking, and conversely, some problems with single solution
do require creative thought. The chapter discusses how the ability to shift
between convergent and divergent modes of thought may have evolved, and it
concludes with educational and vocational implications.

<p>by Andrey V. Dmitriev, Alexander A. Dmitriev, Robert A. Linsenmeier</p>

Neuronal activity is associated with transmembrane ionic redistribution, which can lead to an osmotic imbalance. Accordingly, activity-dependent changes of the membrane potential are sometimes accompanied by changes in intracellular or extracellular volume. Experimental data that include distributions of ions and volume during neuronal activity are rare and rather inconsistent partly due to the technical difficulty of performing such measurements. However, progress in understanding the interrelations among ions, voltage and volume has been achieved recently by computational modelling, particularly “charge-difference” modelling. In this work a charge-difference computational model was used for further understanding of the specific roles for cations and anions. Our simulations show that without anion conductances the transmembrane movements of cations are always osmotically balanced, regardless of the stoichiometry of the pump or the ratio of Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> conductances. Yet any changes in cation conductance or pump activity are associated with changes of the membrane potential, even when a hypothetically electroneutral pump is used in calculations and K<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> conductances are equal. On the other hand, when a Cl<sup>-</sup> conductance is present, the only way to keep the Cl<sup>-</sup>equilibrium potential in accordance with the changed membrane potential is to adjust cell volume. Importantly, this voltage-evoked Cl<sup>—</sup>dependent volume change does not affect intracellular cation concentrations or the amount of energy that is necessary to support the system. Taking other factors into consideration (i.e. the presence of internal impermeant poly-anions, the activity of cation-Cl<sup>-</sup> cotransporters, and the buildup of intra- and extracellular osmolytes, both charged and electroneutral) adds complexity, but does not change the main principles.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/VHCTEZgTAC4" width="1" />

<p>by Manh Cuong Ngô, Mads Peter Heide-Jørgensen, Susanne Ditlevsen</p>

Diving behaviour of narwhals is still largely unknown. We use Hidden Markov models (HMMs) to describe the diving behaviour of a narwhal and fit the models to a three-dimensional response vector of maximum dive depth, duration of dives and post-dive surface time of 8,609 dives measured in East Greenland over 83 days, an extraordinarily long and rich data set. Narwhal diving patterns have not been analysed like this before, but in studies of other whale species, response variables have been assumed independent. We extend the existing models to allow for dependence between state distributions, and show that the dependence has an impact on the conclusions drawn about the diving behaviour. We try several HMMs with 2, 3 or 4 states, and with independent and dependent log-normal and gamma distributions, respectively, and different covariates to characterize dive patterns. In particular, diurnal patterns in diving behaviour is inferred, by using periodic B-splines with boundary knots in 0 and 24 hours.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/8xzQ9ROcIkY" width="1" />

Abstract<p>The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) processes contextual information from the hippocampus to generate appropriate fear responses. In rodents, one path for sending contextual information to the mPFC is via the direct projections from the ventral hippocampus (vHC) to the infralimbic cortex (IL). Plasticity in the synaptic communication from the vHC to the IL could contribute to the behavioral changes produced by the acquisition and extinction of conditioned fear. To examine this possibility, we used optogenetic stimulation of vHC synapses in brain slices from trained rats. We found that fear acquisition reduced NMDA receptor (NMDAR) currents at vHC synapses onto IL pyramidal neurons. The depression of NMDAR currents reversed more efficiently after extinction in the conditioning context than extinction in a novel context. Moreover, a cohort of animals that exhibited poor extinction retrieval failed to reverse the plasticity induced by fear conditioning. In addition, ex vivo application of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, which is known to simulate extinction in IL, reversed this conditioning-induced plasticity mimicking extinction. Therefore, we have identified a novel mechanism that modulates conditioned fear via changes in NMDAR current at vHC synapses onto IL pyramidal neurons. Disruption of this mechanism could contribute to the abnormal contextual modulation of fear seen in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Contextual information processing by the medial prefrontal cortex is critical for appropriate behavioral responses. Using optogenetics in brain slices, we found that acquisition of conditioned fear depressed NMDA receptor currents at ventral hippocampal synapses in the infralimbic cortex (IL) and extinction reversed the depression. BDNF could also reverse the conditioning-induced depression mimicking extinction. In contrast, animals with impaired fear extinction recall, a PTSD-like phenotype, failed to reverse the conditioning-induced changes. Our findings suggest that conditioned fear responses are modulated by changes in NMDAR current at ventral hippocampal synapses in IL and suggest a novel mechanism that could contribute to impaired contextual modulation of fear seen in patients with PTSD.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Phosphomannomutase deficiency (PMM2‐CDG) causes cerebellar syndrome and stroke‐like episodes (SLEs). SLEs are also described in patients with gain‐of‐function mutations in the CaV2.1 channel, for which acetazolamide therapy is suggested. Impairment in N‐glycosylation of CaV2.1 promotes gain‐of‐function effects and may participate in cerebellar syndrome in PMM2‐CDG. AZATAX was designed to establish whether acetazolamide is safe and improves cerebellar syndrome in PMM2‐CDG.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A clinical trial included PMM2‐CDG patients with a 6‐month first‐phase single acetazolamide therapy group, followed by a randomized 5‐week withdrawal phase. Safety was assessed. The primary outcome measure was improvement in the International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (ICARS). Other measures were the Nijmegen Pediatric CDG Rating Scale (NPCRS), a syllable repetition test (PATA test), and cognitive scores.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Twenty‐four patients (mean age 12.3±4.5 years) were included, showing no serious adverse events. Thirteen patients required dose adjustment due to low bicarbonate or asthenia. There were improvements in ICARS (34.9±23.2 vs 40.7±24.8, effect size 1.48, [95%CI 4.0‐7.6]; <i>P</i>&lt;0.001), detected at 6 weeks in 18 patients among the 20 responders, in NPCRS ([95%CI 0.3‐1.6]; <i>P</i>=0.013) and in PATA test ([95%CI 0.5‐3.0]; <i>P</i>=0.006). Acetazolamide improved prothrombin time, factor X, and antithrombin. Clinical severity, epilepsy, and lipodystrophy predicted greater response. The randomized withdrawal phase showed an ICARS worsening in the withdrawal group (effect size 1.46, [95%CI 2.65‐7.52]; <i>P</i>=0.001).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>AZATAX is the first clinical trial of PMM2‐CDG. Acetazolamide is well tolerated and effective for motor cerebellar syndrome. Its ability to prevent SLEs and its long‐term effects on kidney function should be addressed in future studies.</p>

Abstract
<p>Increased expression of the FK506-binding protein 5 (<i>FKBP5</i>) gene has been associated with a number of diseases, but most prominently in connection to psychiatric illnesses. Many of these psychiatric disorders present with dementia and other cognitive deficits, but a direct connection between these issues and alterations in <i>FKBP5</i> remains unclear. We generated a novel transgenic mouse to selectively overexpress <i>FKBP5,</i> which encodes the FKBP51 protein, in the corticolimbic system, which had no overt effects on gross body weight, motor ability, or general anxiety. Instead, we found that overexpression of FKBP51 impaired long-term depression (LTD) as well as spatial reversal learning and memory, suggesting a role in glutamate receptor regulation. Indeed, FKBP51 altered the association of heat-shock protein 90 (Hsp90) with AMPA receptors, which was accompanied by an accelerated rate of AMPA recycling. In this way, the chaperone system is critical in triage decisions for AMPA receptor trafficking. Imbalance in the chaperone system may manifest in impairments in both inhibitory learning and cognitive function. These findings uncover an unexpected and essential mechanism for learning and memory that is controlled by the psychiatric risk factor <i>FKBP5</i>.</p>

Abstract
<p>Seizures are characterized by hypersynchronization of neuronal networks. Understanding these networks could provide a critical window for therapeutic control of recurrent seizure activity, i.e., epilepsy. However, imaging seizure networks has largely been limited to microcircuits <i>in vitro</i> or small "windows" <i>in vivo</i>. Here, we combine fast confocal imaging of genetically encoded calcium indicator (GCaMP)-expressing larval zebrafish with local field potential (LFP) recordings to study epileptiform events at whole-brain and single-neuron levels <i>in vivo</i>. Using an acute seizure model (pentylenetetrazole, PTZ), we reliably observed recurrent electrographic ictal-like events associated with generalized activation of all major brain regions and uncovered a well-preserved anterior-to-posterior seizure propagation pattern. We also examined brain-wide network synchronization and spatiotemporal patterns of neuronal activity in the optic tectum microcircuit. Brain-wide and single-neuronal level analysis of PTZ-exposed and 4-aminopyridine (4-AP)-exposed zebrafish revealed distinct network dynamics associated with seizure and non-seizure hyperexcitable states, respectively. Neuronal ensembles, comprised of coactive neurons, were also uncovered during interictal-like periods. Taken together, these results demonstrate that macro- and micro-network calcium motifs in zebrafish may provide a greater understanding of epilepsy.</p>

<p>With memory encoding reliant on persistent changes in the properties of
synapses, a key question is how can memories be maintained from days to months
or a lifetime given molecular turnover? It is likely that positive feedback
loops are necessary to persistently maintain the strength of synapses that
participate in encoding. Such feedback may occur within signal-transduction
cascades and/or the regulation of translation, and it may occur within specific
subcellular compartments or within neuronal networks. Not surprisingly,
numerous positive feedback loops have been proposed. Some posited loops operate
at the level of biochemical signal transduction cascades, such as persistent
activation of Ca2+/calmodulin kinase II or protein kinase M zeta. Another level
consists of feedback loops involving transcriptional, epigenetic and
translational pathways, and autocrine actions of growth factors such as BDNF.
Finally, at the neuronal network level, recurrent reactivation of cell
assemblies encoding memories is likely to be essential for late maintenance of
memory. These levels are not isolated, but linked by shared components of
feedback loops. Here, we review characteristics of some commonly discussed
feedback loops proposed to underlie the maintenance of memory and long-term
synaptic plasticity, assess evidence for and against their necessity, and
suggest experiments that could further delineate the dynamics of these feedback
loops. We also discuss crosstalk between proposed loops, and ways in which such
interaction can facilitate the rapidity and robustness of memory formation and
storage.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.05590">Noisy network attractor models for transitions between EEG microstates. (arXiv:1903.05590v1 [q-bio.NC])</a></h4>

<p>The brain is intrinsically organized into large-scale networks that
constantly re-organize on multiple timescales, even when the brain is at rest.
The timing of these dynamics is crucial for sensation, perception, cognition
and ultimately consciousness, but the underlying dynamics governing the
constant reorganization and switching between networks are not yet well
understood. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and
electroencephalography (EEG) provide anatomical and temporal information about
the resting-state networks (RSNs), respectively. EEG microstates are brief
periods of stable scalp topography, and four distinct configurations with
characteristic switching patterns between them are reliably identified at rest.
Microstates have been identified as the electrophysiological correlate of
fMRI-defined RSNs, this link could be established because EEG microstate
sequences are scale-free and have long-range temporal correlations. This
property is crucial for any approach to model EEG microstates. This paper
proposes a novel modeling approach for microstates: we consider nonlinear
stochastic differential equations (SDEs) that exhibit a noisy network attractor
between nodes that represent the microstates. Using a single layer network
between four states, we can reproduce the transition probabilities between
microstates but not the heavy tailed residence time distributions. Introducing
a two layer network with a hidden layer gives the flexibility to capture these
heavy tails and their long-range temporal correlations. We fit these models to
capture the statistical properties of microstate sequences from EEG data

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.05288">Effect of Interpopulation Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity on Synchronized Rhythms in Neuronal Networks with Inhibitory and Excitatory Populations. (arXiv:1903.05288v1 [q-bio.NC])</a></h4>

<p>We consider clustered small-world networks (SWNs) with two inhibitory (I) and
excitatory (E) populations. This I-E neuronal network has adaptive dynamic I to
E and E to I interpopulation synaptic strengths, governed by interpopulation
spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). In previous works without STDPs, fast
sparsely synchronized rhythms were found to appear in a range of noise
intensity $D$. Here, by varying $D$, we investigate the effect of
interpopulation STDPs on population states in the I- and the E-populations.
Depending on values of $D$, long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term
depression (LTD) for population-averaged values of saturated interpopulation
synaptic strengths are found to occur, and they make effects on the degree of
population synchronization. In a broad region of intermediate $D$, the degree
of good synchronization (with higher spiking measure) becomes decreased, while
in a region of large $D$, the degree of bad synchronization (with lower spiking
measure) gets increased. Consequently, in each I- or E-population, the
synchronization degree becomes nearly the same in a wide range of $D$. This
kind of "equalization effect" is found to occur via cooperative interplay
between the average occupation and pacing degrees of synchronized rhythms. Such
equalization effect is much more enhanced in the presence of combined I to E
and E to I STDPs when compared with the case of individual I to E or E to I
STDP. We note that the equalization effect in interpopulation synaptic
plasticity is in contrast to the Matthew (bipolarization) effect in
intrapopulation (I to I and E to E) synaptic plasticity where good (bad)
synchronization gets better (worse). Moreover, emergences of LTP and LTD of
interpopulation synaptic strengths are intensively investigated via a
microscopic method based on the distributions of time delays between the pre-
and the post-synaptic spike times.

<p>Twenty-five years ago, Dunkelmann and Radons (1994) proposed that neural
networks should self-organize to a critical state. In models, criticality
offers a number of computational advantages. Thus this hypothesis, and in
particular the experimental work by Beggs and Plenz (2003), has triggered an
avalanche of research, with thousands of studies referring to it. Nonetheless,
experimental results are still contradictory. How is it possible, that a
hypothesis has attracted active research for decades, but nonetheless remains
controversial? We discuss the experimental and conceptual controversy, and then
present a parsimonious solution that (i) unifies the contradictory experimental
results, (ii) avoids disadvantages of a critical state, and (iii) enables
rapid, adaptive tuning of network properties to task requirements.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/42413">Quantitative regulation of the dynamic steady state of actin networks</a></h4>

Principles of regulation of actin network dimensions are fundamentally important for cell functions, yet remain unclear. Using both in vitro and in silico approaches, we studied the effect of key parameters, such as actin density, ADF/Cofilin concentration and network width on the network length. In the presence of ADF/Cofilin, networks reached equilibrium and became treadmilling. At the trailing edge, the network disintegrated into large fragments. A mathematical model predicts the network length as a function of width, actin and ADF/Cofilin concentrations. Local depletion of ADF/Cofilin by binding to actin is significant, leading to wider networks growing longer. A single rate of breaking network nodes, proportional to ADF/Cofilin density and inversely proportional to the square of the actin density, can account for the disassembly dynamics. Selective disassembly of heterogeneous networks by ADF/Cofilin controls steering during motility. Our results establish general principles on how the dynamic steady state of actin network emerges from biochemical and structural feedbacks.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/41168">Inadequate BiP availability defines endoplasmic reticulum stress</a></h4>

How endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress leads to cytotoxicity is ill-defined. Previously we showed that HeLa cells readjust homeostasis upon proteostatically driven ER stress, triggered by inducible bulk expression of secretory immunoglobulin M heavy chain (μ<sub>s</sub>) thanks to the unfolded protein response (UPR; Bakunts et al., 2017). Here we show that conditions that prevent that an excess of the ER resident chaperone (and UPR target gene) BiP over µ<sub>s</sub> is restored lead to µ<sub>s</sub>-driven proteotoxicity, i.e. abrogation of HRD1-mediated ER-associated degradation (ERAD), or of the UPR, in particular the ATF6α branch. Such conditions are tolerated instead upon removal of the BiP-sequestering first constant domain (C<sub>H</sub>1) from µ<sub>s</sub>. Thus, our data define proteostatic ER stress to be a specific consequence of inadequate BiP availability, which both the UPR and ERAD redeem.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/40448">H3K9me3 is required for inheritance of small RNAs that target a unique subset of newly evolved genes</a></h4>

In <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>, RNA interference (RNAi) responses can transmit across generations via small RNAs. RNAi inheritance is associated with Histone-3-Lysine-9 tri-methylation (H3K9me3) of the targeted genes. In other organisms, maintenance of silencing requires a feed-forward loop between H3K9me3 and small RNAs. Here, we show that in <i>C. elegans</i> not only is H3K9me3 unnecessary for inheritance, the modification’s function depends on the identity of the RNAi-targeted gene. We found an asymmetry in the requirement for H3K9me3 and the main worm H3K9me3 methyltransferases, SET-25 and SET-32. Both methyltransferases promote heritable silencing of the foreign gene <i>gfp</i>, but are dispensable for silencing of the endogenous gene <i>oma-1</i>. Genome-wide examination of heritable endogenous small interfering RNAs (endo-siRNAs) revealed that endo-siRNAs that depend on SET-25 and SET-32 target newly acquired and highly H3K9me3 marked genes. Thus, ‘repressive’ chromatin marks could be important specifically for heritable silencing of genes which are flagged as ‘foreign’, such as <i>gfp</i>.

Li et al. discover that PVHPDYN neurons, additively with PVHMC4R neurons, are responsible for PVH-mediated satiety. Both PVH neurons are distinct, are equipotent, and use parallel projections to different aspects of the parabrachial complex to cause satiety and prevent obesity.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/578542v1?rss=1">The \"sewing machine\" for minimally invasive neural recording</a></h4>

We present a system for scalable and customizable recording and stimulation of neural activity. In large animals and humans, the current benchmark for high spatial and temporal resolution neural interfaces are fixed arrays of wire or silicon electrodes inserted into the parenchyma of the brain. However, probes that are large and stiff enough to penetrate the brain have been shown to cause acute and chronic damage and inflammation, which limits their longevity, stability, and yield. One approach to this problem is to separate the requirements of the insertion device, which should to be as stiff as possible, with the implanted device, which should be as small and flexible as possible. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility and scalability of this approach with a system incorporating fine and flexible thin-film polymer probes, a fine and stiff insertion needle, and a robotic insertion machine. Together the system permits rapid and precise implantation of probes, each individually targeted to avoid observable vasculature and to attain diverse anatomical targets. As an initial demonstration of this system, we implanted arrays of electrodes in rat somatosensory cortex, recorded extracellular action potentials from them, and obtained histological images of the tissue response. This approach points the way toward a new generation of scaleable, stable, and safe neural interfaces, both for the basic scientific study of brain function and for clinical applications.

We often perform actions where we must break through some resistive force, but want to remain in control during this unpredictable transition; for example, when an object we are pushing on transitions from static to dynamic friction and begins to move. We designed a laboratory task to replicate this situation in which participants actively pushed against a robotic manipulandum until they exceeded an unpredictable threshold, at which point the manipulandum moved freely. Human participants were instructed to either stop the movement of the handle following this unloading perturbation, or to continue pushing. We found that participants were able to modulate their reflexes in response to this unpredictable and self-triggered unloading perturbation according to the instruction they were following, and that this reflex modulation could not be explained by pre-perturbation muscle state. However, in a second task, where participants reactively produced force during the pre-unloading phase in response to the robotic manipulandum to maintain a set hand position, they were unable to modulate their reflexes in the same task-dependent way. This occurred even though the forces they produced were matched to the first task and they had more time to prepare for the unloading event. We suggest this disparity occurs because of different neural circuits involved in posture and movement, meaning that participants in the first task did not require additional time to switch from postural to movement control.

Purpose: To evaluate the ultra-widefield fluorescein angiography (UWFA) findings in patients with multiple retinal holes. Methods: Seventy-five eyes, each with more than two retinal holes, underwent a comprehensive ophthalmologic examination, including UWFA, along with 77 age-matched control eyes with no retinal holes. The UWFA was scored according to a system suggested by the Angiography Scoring for Uveitis Working Group (ASUWG). UWFA findings from the patients with retinal holes were compared with those of the control group without retinal holes. Factors associated with a high ASUWG score were also evaluated. Results: Patients with multiple retinal holes showed a significantly higher prevalence of retinal vascular staining/leakage, capillary leakage at the posterior pole, and capillary leakage at the periphery when compared to the control group (p&lt;0.001, for each of them). Univariate analysis revealed that logMAR BCVA (r=0.271, p=0.027), spherical equivalent (r= -0.275, p=0.021), and number of retinal holes (r=0.271, p=0.027) were associated with a higher ASUWG score. After adjustments for age, gender, and logMAR BCVA, multivariate regression analysis revealed that the spherical equivalent was independently associated with a higher ASUWG score (r2=0.161, p=0.001). Conclusions: Patients with multiple retinal holes showed profound peripheral vascular leakages on UWFA findings, suggesting the presence of chronic retinal traction induced by equatorial scleral elongation.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/577627v1?rss=1">Transcriptomic analysis of the BDNF-induced JAK/STAT pathway in neurons: a window into epilepsy-associated gene expression</a></h4>

Background: Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a major signaling molecule that the brain uses to control a vast network of intracellular cascades fundamental to properties of learning and memory, and cognition. While much is known about BDNF signaling in the healthy nervous system where it controls the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) and cyclic-AMP pathways, less is known about its role in multiple brain disorders where it contributes to the dysregulated neuroplasticity seen in epilepsy and traumatic brain injury (TBI). We previously found that neurons respond to prolonged BDNF exposure (both in vivo (in models of epilepsy and TBI) and in vitro (in BDNF treated primary neuronal cultures)) by activating the Janus Kinase/Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling pathway. This pathway is best known for its association with inflammatory cytokines in non-neuronal cells. Results: Here, using deep RNA-sequencing of neurons exposed to BDNF in the presence and absence of well characterized JAK/STAT inhibitors, and without non-neuronal cells, we determine the BDNF transcriptome that is specifically reliant on JAK/STAT signaling. Surprisingly, the transcriptome contains ion channels and neurotransmitter receptors coming from all the major classes expressed in the brain, along with key modulators of synaptic plasticity, neurogenesis, and axonal remodeling. Analysis of this dataset has also provided a window on the unique mechanism of JAK/STATs in neurons as differential gene expression mediated by STAT3 does not appear to be dependent upon phosphorylation at residue 705. Conclusions: Our findings strengthen and expand the role that BDNF plays in the regulation of brain excitability at the transcriptional level. They also suggest that a majority of such signaling in neurons is tied to the activation of the JAK/STAT pathway which may be non-canonical, not based on phosphorylation of STAT3 proteins at Tyrosine 705.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/577379v1?rss=1">Identifying the most influential features of neural population responses for information encoding and behavior</a></h4>

Identifying the features of population responses that are relevant to the amount of information encoded by neuronal populations is a crucial step toward understanding the neural code. Statistical features such as tuning properties, individual and shared response variability, and global activity modulations could all affect the amount of information encoded and modulate behavioral performance. We show that two features in particular affect information: the modulation of population responses across conditions and the projection of the inverse population variability along the modulation axis. We demonstrate that fluctuations of these two quantities are correlated with fluctuations of behavioral performance in various tasks and brain regions. In contrast, fluctuations in mean correlations among neurons and global activity have negligible or inconsistent effects on the amount of information encoded and behavioral performance. Our results are consistent with predictions of a model that optimally decodes population responses, which suggests that in our behavioral tasks the readout of information is near-optimal.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/577361v1?rss=1">Age-related alterations in functional connectivity along the longitudinal axis of the hippocampus and its subfields</a></h4>

Aging causes hippocampal circuit alterations that differentially affect hippocampal subfields and are associated with age-related memory decline. Additionally, functional organization along the longitudinal axis of the hippocampus has revealed distinctions between anterior and posterior (A-P) connectivity. Here, we examined the functional connectivity (FC) differences between young and older adults at high-resolution within the medial temporal lobe network (entorhinal, perirhinal, and parahippocampal cortices), allowing us to explore how hippocampal subfield connectivity across the longitudinal axis of the hippocampus changes with age. Overall, we found reliably greater connectivity for younger adults than older adults between the hippocampus and PHC and PRC. This drop in functional connectivity was more pronounced in the anterior regions of the hippocampus than the posterior ones, consistent for each of the hippocampal subfields. Further, intra-hippocampal connectivity also reflected an age-related decrease in functional connectivity within the anterior hippocampus in older adults that was offset by an increase in posterior hippocampal functional connectivity. Interestingly, the anterior-posterior shift in older adults between hippocampus and PHC was predictive of lure discrimination performance on the MST, suggesting that this shift may reflect a compensation mechanism that preserves memory performance. While age-related dysfunction within the hippocampal subfields has been well-documented, these results suggest that the age-related A-P shift in hippocampal connectivity may also contribute significantly to memory decline in older adults.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/577288v1?rss=1">Nonlinear mixed selectivity supports reliable neural computation</a></h4>

Neuronal activity in the brain is variable, yet both perception and behavior are generally reliable. How does the brain achieve this? Here, we show that the conjunctive coding of multiple stimulus features, commonly known as nonlinear mixed selectivity, may be used by the brain to support reliable information transmission using unreliable neurons. Nonlinear mixed selectivity (NMS) has been observed widely across the brain, from primary sensory to decision-making to motor areas. Representations of stimulus features are nearly always mixed together, rather than represented separately or with only additive (linear) mixing, as in pure selectivity. NMS has been previously shown to support flexible linear decoding for complex behavioral tasks. Here, we show that NMS has another important benefit: it requires as little as half the metabolic energy required by pure selectivity to achieve the same level of transmission reliability. This benefit holds for sensory, motor, and more abstract, cognitive representations. Further, we show experimental evidence that NMS exists in the brain even when it does not enable behaviorally useful linear decoding. This suggests that NMS may be a general coding scheme exploited by the brain for reliable and efficient neural computation.

Background: The underlying pathophysiology of swallowing and chewing difficulties is multifactorial and evidence clarifying the precise mechanisms are scarce. Dysfunction in dopamine-related and non-dopamine-related pathways, changes in cortical networks related with swallowing and peripheral mechanisms have been implicated in the pathogenesis of swallowing difficulties. We aimed at investigating whether swallowing and chewing difficulties are associated with presynaptic dopaminergic deficits, faster motor symptom progression and cognitive decline in a population of early drug-naive patients with Parkinson's disease. Methods: By exploring the database of Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative we identified forty-nine early drug-naive Parkinson's disease patients with swallowing difficulties. Swallowing and chewing impairment was identified with SCOPA-AUT question 1 (answer regularly) and was assessed with MDS-UPDRS Part-II, Item 2.3 (Chewing and Swallowing). We compared Parkinson's disease patients with swallowing and chewing difficulties to Parkinson's disease patients without difficulties, and investigated differences in striatal [123I]FP-CIT single photon emission computed tomography levels. Using Cox proportional hazards analyses, we also evaluated whether swallowing impairment can predict motor deterioration and cognitive dysfunction. Results: Patients with Parkinson's disease, harbored a greater deterioration regarding motor and non-motor symptoms and decreased [123I]FP-CIT binding when compared with patients without swallowing and chewing impairment. Higher burden of swallowing and chewing dysfunction (MDS-UPDRS-II, item 2.3) was correlated with lower [123I]FP-CIT uptakes within the striatum (rs=-0.157; P=0.002) and the caudate (rs=-0.156; P=0.002). The presence of swallowing and chewing difficulties was not a predictor of motor progression (Hazard ratio [HR]: 1.143, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.848-1.541; P=0.379) or cognitive decline (HR: 1.294, 95% CI: 0.616-2.719; P=0.496). Conclusions: Swallowing and chewing impairment is associated with decreased presynaptic dopaminergic integrity within caudate and greater motor and non-motor symptoms burden in early drug-naive PD.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/577064v1?rss=1">Rapid invariant encoding of scene layout in human OPA</a></h4>

Successful visual navigation requires a sense of the geometry of the local environment. How do our brains extract this information from retinal images? Here we visually presented scenes with all possible combinations of five scene-bounding elements (left, right and back wall, ceiling, floor) to human subjects during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and magnetoencephalography (MEG). The fMRI response patterns in the scene-responsive occipital place area (OPA) reflected scene layout with invariance to changes in surface texture. This result contrasted sharply with the primary visual cortex (V1), which reflected low-level image features of the stimuli, and parahippocampal place area (PPA), which showed better texture than layout decoding. MEG indicated that the texture-invariant scene-layout representation is computed from visual input within ~100 ms, suggesting a rapid computational mechanism. Taken together, these results suggest that the cortical representation underlying our instant sense of the environmental geometry is located in OPA.

Magnetic resonance imaging studies typically use standard anatomical atlases for identification and analyses of (patho-)physiological effects on specific brain areas; these atlases often fail to incorporate neuroanatomical alterations that may occur with both age and disease. The present study utilizes Parkinson's disease and age-specific anatomical atlases of the subthalamic nucleus for diffusion tractography, assessing tracts that run between the subthalamic nucleus and a-priori defined cortical areas known to be affected by Parkinson's disease. The results show that the strength of white matter fiber tracts appear to remain structurally unaffected by disease. Contrary to that, Fractional Anisotropy values were shown to decrease in Parkinson's disease patients for connections between the subthalamic nucleus and the pars opercularis of the inferior frontal gyrus, anterior cingulate cortex, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the pre-supplementary motor, collectively involved in preparatory motor control, decision making and task monitoring. While the biological underpinnings of fractional anisotropy alterations remain elusive, they may nonetheless be used as an index of Parkinson's disease. Moreover, we find that failing to account for structural changes occurring in the subthalamic nucleus with age and disease reduce the accuracy and influence the results of tractography, highlighting the importance of using appropriate atlases for tractography.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/576850v1?rss=1">Spatially modulated alpha-band activity does not mediate tactile remapping and fast overt orienting behavior</a></h4>

Posterior oscillatory alpha-band activity is commonly associated with spatial-attentional orienting and prioritization across sensory modalities. It has also been suggested to mediate the automatic transformation of tactile stimuli from a skin-based, somatotopic reference frame into an external one. Previous research has not convincingly separated these two possible roles of alpha-band activity. In particular, the use of delay paradigms, implemented to allow temporal evolution of segregable oscillatory brain responses to stimulus, motor planning, and response, have prohibited strong conclusions about a causal role of oscillatory activity in tactile-spatial transformations. Here, we assessed alpha-band modulation with massive univariate deconvolution, an analysis approach that disentangles brain signals overlapping in time and space. Thirty-one participants performed a delay-free, visual serial- search task in which saccade behavior was unrestricted. A tactile cue to uncrossed or crossed hands was either informative or uninformative about visual target location. Alpha-band suppression following tactile stimulation was lateralized relative to the stimulated hand over centro-parietal sensors, but relative to its external location over parieto-occipital sensors. Alpha-band suppression reflected external touch location only after informative cues, challenging the proposition that posterior alpha-band lateralization indexes automatic tactile transformation. Moreover, alpha- band suppression occurred ~200 ms later than externally directed saccade responses after tactile stimulation. These findings suggest that alpha-band activity does not play a causal role in tactile-spatial transformation but, instead, reflects delayed, supramodal processes of attentional re-orienting.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/576785v1?rss=1">Dynamic network properties of the interictal brain determine whether seizures appear focal or generalised</a></h4>

Objective: Current explanatory concepts suggest seizures emerge from ongoing dynamics of brain networks. It is unclear how brain network properties determine focal or generalised seizure onset, or how network properties can be described in a clinically-useful manner. Understanding network properties would cast light on seizure-generating mechanisms and allow to quantify in the clinic the extent to which a seizure is focal or generalised. Methods: 68 people with epilepsy and 38 healthy controls underwent 19 channel scalp EEG recording. Functional brain networks were estimated in each subject using phase-locking between EEG channels in the 6-9Hz band from segments of 20s without interictal discharges. Simplified brain dynamics were simulated using a computer model. We introduce three concepts: Critical Coupling (Cc), the ability of a network to generate seizures; Onset Index (OI), the tendency of a region to generate seizures; and Participation Index (PI), the tendency of a region to become involved in seizures. Results: Cc was lower in both patient groups compared with controls. OI and PI were more variable in focal-onset than generalised-onset cases. No regions showed higher OI and PI in generalised-onset cases than in healthy controls; in focal cases, the regions with highest OI and PI corresponded to the side of seizure onset. Conclusions: Properties of interictal functional networks from scalp EEG can be estimated using a computer model and used to predict seizure likelihood and onset patterns. Our framework, consisting of three clinically-meaningful measures, could be implemented in the clinic to quantify the diagnosis and seizure onset pattern.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/576769v1?rss=1">Supramodal sentence processing in the human brain: fMRI evidence for the influence of syntactic complexity in more than 200 participants</a></h4>

This study investigated two questions. One is to which degree sentence processing beyond single words is independent of the input modality (speech vs. reading). The second question is which parts of the network recruited by both modalities is sensitive to syntactic complexity. These questions were investigated by having more than 200 participants read or listen to well-formed sentences or series of unconnected words. A largely left-hemisphere fronto-temporoparietal network was found to be supramodal in nature, i.e. independent of input modality. In addition, the left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG) and the left posterior middle temporal gyrus (LpMTG) were most clearly associated with left-branching complexity. The left anterior middle temporal gyrus (LaMTG) showed the greatest sensitivity to sentences that differed in right-branching complexity. Moreover, activity in LIFG and LpMTG increased from sentence onset to end, in parallel with an increase of the left-branching complexity. While LIFG, bilateral anterior and posterior MTG and left inferior parietal lobe (LIPL) all contribute to the supramodal unification processes, the results suggest that these regions differ in their respective contributions to syntactic complexity related processing. The consequences of these findings for neurobiological models of language processing are discussed.

Background: The vestibular system has been shown to contribute to multisensory integration by balancing conflictual sensory information. It remains unclear whether such modulation of exteroceptive (e.g. vision), proprioceptive and interoceptive (e.g. affective touch) sensory sources is influenced by epistemically different aspects of tactile stimulation (i.e. felt from within vs seen, vicarious touch). Objective: We aimed to i) replicate previous findings regarding the effects of galvanic stimulation of the right vestibular network (i.e. LGVS) in multisensory integration and ii) examine vestibular contributions to multisensory integration when touch is felt but not seen (and vice-versa). Method: During artificial vestibular stimulation (LGVS, RGVS and Sham), healthy participants (N=36, Experiment 1; N=37, Experiment 2) looked at a rubber hand while either their own unseen hand or the rubber hand were touched by affective or neutral touch. Results: We found that i) LGVS led to enhancement of vision over proprioception during visual only conditions (replicating our previous findings), and ii) LGVS (vs Sham) favoured proprioception over vision when touch was felt (Experiment 1), with the opposite results when touch was vicariously perceived via vision (Experiment 2), and with no difference between affective and neutral touch. Conclusions: We showed how vestibular signals modulate the weight of each sensory modality according to the context in which they are perceived and that such modulation extends to different aspects of tactile stimulation: felt and seen touch are differentially balanced in multisensory integration according to their epistemic relevance.

Alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are promising novel targets for the treatment of neurocognitive disorders. Although the cognitive enhancer potential of alpha7 nAChR agonists and positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) has been confirmed in several preclinical animal models, there are only sparse in vivo electrophysiological data on their effects on the firing activity and excitability of neurons. The present study investigated and compared local effects of alpha7 nAChR agonist PHA-543613 and PAMs PNU-120596 and NS-1738 on the spontaneous and N-methyl-D-aspartate-evoked (NMDA-evoked) firing rate of rat CA1 hippocampal pyramidal cells, in vivo. Furthermore, effects of alpha7 nAChR antagonist methyllycaconitine (MLA) and GABA were also tested. Results showed substantially different effects of the alpha7 nAChR agonist and PAMs. While PNU-120596 and NS-1738 predominantly and significantly increased both spontaneous and NMDA-evoked firing rate of the neurons, application of PHA-543613 resulted in almost equal distribution of facilitatory and inhibitory effects. The increase of the NMDA-evoked firing rate exerted by NS-1738 was superadditive over the sum of the single effects of NMDA and NS-1738. The simultaneous application of alpha7 nAChR agonist PHA-543613 and PAM NS-1738 resulted in additive increase of both spontaneous and NMDA-evoked firing rate. However, NS-1738 counteracted inhibitory effects of PHA-543613 in 5 out of 6 neurons, resulting in a synergistic potentiation of their firing responses to NMDA. Our results suggest that alpha7 nAChR PAMs more potently increase neuronal excitability than agonists. However, the remarkable occurence of inhibitory effects of PHA-543613 (possibly originating from receptor desensitization) implies for the neuroprotective effects of agonists.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/576298v1?rss=1">Brain meta-state transitions demarcate spontaneous thoughts in movie-viewing and resting cognition</a></h4>

Using new methods to identify transitions in brain network meta-state, we characterize a neurocognitive landmark of conceptual transitions. Drawing on a large fMRI dataset, we found meta-state transitions robustly predicted the onset of new concepts during movie-viewing, and were more organized under the control of movie stimuli with more conceptual transitions. Meta-state transitions held common characteristics across movie-viewing and rest data, including a spatial pattern that involved brain regions associated with mind-wandering, as well as a stable transition rate. We also found meta-state transitions coincided with posterior hippocampus activation, whereas a lower transition rate was predicted by anterior hippocampus volume, consistent with a mnemonic segmentation role for the posterior and mnemonic attractor role for the anterior. On the basis of our findings, and because new thoughts begin with the same conceptual transitions and recruitment of brain regions associated with meta-state transitions, we suggest that meta-state transitions could serve as an objective biological landmark to delineate the temporal boundaries of spontaneous thoughts. In so doing, they may contribute new implicit insights to emerging research on thought dynamics.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/558205v1?rss=1">An open-source and low-cost feeding system for zebrafish facilities</a></h4>

Zebrafish is an established animal model used in the fields of developmental biology and genetics for more than 60 years, and among the first models to become genetically tractable. More recently, zebrafish has also become a model of reference for human diseases and systems neuroscience. The current extensive use of zebrafish in research and pharmaceutical companies promoted the development of several commercial husbandry systems specially designed for zebrafish. However, feeding is still a challenging and arduous task that can result in occupational disorders of the personnel working at the zebrafish facilities (e.g. tendinitis, back pain, etc.). To palliate these risks, a commercial robotic approach has been developed, yet its expensive cost makes this solution accessible only to very large fish facilities. Most mid-size and small facilities with limited resources still use manual feeding methods. Here, we propose two custom-made open-source semi-automatic feeding systems for dry and live food, capable of preventing and/or alleviating occupational disorders, improve feeding accuracy and decrease feeding time. Both systems are designed for mid-size or small fish facilities. They are cheap and can be easily and rapidly built using 3D printing and standard electronic and lab components.

<p>by Sifat A. Moon, Lee W. Cohnstaedt, D. Scott McVey, Caterina M. Scoglio</p>

West Nile virus (WNV)—a mosquito-borne arbovirus—entered the USA through New York City in 1999 and spread to the contiguous USA within three years while transitioning from epidemic outbreaks to endemic transmission. The virus is transmitted by vector competent mosquitoes and maintained in the avian populations. WNV spatial distribution is mainly determined by the movement of residential and migratory avian populations. We developed an individual-level heterogeneous network framework across the USA with the goal of understanding the long-range spatial distribution of WNV. To this end, we proposed three distance dispersal kernels model: 1) exponential—short-range dispersal, 2) power-law—long-range dispersal in all directions, and 3) power-law biased by flyway direction —long-range dispersal only along established migratory routes. To select the appropriate dispersal kernel we used the human case data and adopted a model selection framework based on approximate Bayesian computation with sequential Monte Carlo sampling (ABC-SMC). From estimated parameters, we find that the power-law biased by flyway direction kernel is the best kernel to fit WNV human case data, supporting the hypothesis of long-range WNV transmission is mainly along the migratory bird flyways. Through extensive simulation from 2014 to 2016, we proposed and tested hypothetical mitigation strategies and found that mosquito population reduction in the infected states and neighboring states is potentially cost-effective.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9rfZ0tOoEtc" width="1" />

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25430?af=R">Cholinergic system changes of falls and freezing of gait in Parkinson's disease</a></h4>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Postural instability and gait difficulties (PIGDs) represent debilitating disturbances in Parkinson's disease (PD). Past acetylcholinesterase positron emission tomography (PET) imaging studies implicate cholinergic changes as significant contributors to PIGD features. These studies were limited in quantification of striatal cholinergic synapse integrity. Vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) PET ligands are better suited for evaluation of high binding areas. We examined associations between regional VAChT expression and freezing of gait (FoG) and falls.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Ninety‐four PD subjects underwent clinical assessment and VAChT ([<sup>18</sup>F]FEOBV) PET.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Thirty‐five subjects (37.2%) reported a history of falls, and 15 (16%) had observed FoG. Univariate volume‐of‐interest analyses demonstrated significantly reduced thalamic (<i>p</i> = 0.0016) VAChT expression in fallers compared to nonfallers. VAChT expression was significantly reduced in the striatum (<i>p</i> = 0.0012) and limbic archicortex (<i>p</i> = 0.004) in freezers compared to nonfreezers. Whole‐brain voxel‐based analyses of FEOBV PET complemented these findings and showed more granular changes associated with falling history, including the right visual thalamus (especially the right lateral geniculate nucleus [LGN]), right caudate nucleus, and bilateral prefrontal regions. Freezers had prominent VAChT expression reductions in the bilateral striatum, temporal, and mesiofrontal limbic regions.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings confirm and extend on previous PET findings of thalamic cholinergic deficits associated with falling history and now emphasize right visual thalamus complex changes, including the right LGN. FoG status is associated with reduced VAChT expression in striatal cholinergic interneurons and the limbic archicortex. These observations suggest different cholinergic systems changes underlying falls and FoG in PD. Ann Neurol, 2019</p>

Abstract<p>The auditory system relies on binaural differences and spectral pinna cues to localize sounds in azimuth and elevation. However, the acoustic input can be unreliable, due to uncertainty about the environment, and neural noise. A possible strategy to reduce sound-location uncertainty is to integrate the sensory observations with sensorimotor information from previous experience, to infer where sounds are more likely to occur. We investigated whether and how human sound localization performance is affected by the spatial distribution of target sounds, and changes thereof. We tested three different open-loop paradigms, in which we varied the spatial range of sounds in different ways. For the narrowest ranges, target-response gains were highly idiosyncratic and deviated from an optimal gain predicted by error-minimization; in the horizontal plane the deviation typically consisted of a response overshoot. Moreover, participants adjusted their behavior by rapidly adapting their gain to the target range, both in elevation and in azimuth, yielding behavior closer to optimal for larger target ranges. Notably, gain changes occurred without any exogenous feedback about performance. We discuss how the findings can be explained by a sub-optimal model in which the motor-control system reduces its response error across trials to within an acceptable range – rather than strictly minimizing the error.</p><p><b>Significance statement</b> Sensory observations can be noisy, leading to uncertainty in perceptual inferences and variable estimation errors. Theoretically, to reduce uncertainty, sensory information could be integrated with knowledge from prior experience, and with feedback about one’s own response behavior. Here we show, that for a basic and accurate sensorimotor task such as sound localization, humans indeed rely on perceived experience in the absence of exogenous feedback, as they rapidly changed their response sensitivity to experimental variations in the spatial distribution of targets. We argue that the auditory system reduces its estimated localization error close to its expected minimum across trials, allowing for idiosyncratic sub-optimal target response gains.</p>

Abstract
<p>LIM domain binding protein 1 (LDB1) is a protein cofactor that participates in several multiprotein complexes with transcription factors that regulate mouse forebrain development. Since <i>Ldb1</i> null mutants display early embryonic lethality, we used a conditional knockout strategy to examine the role of LDB1 in early forebrain development using multiple Cre lines. Loss of <i>Ldb1</i> from E8.75 using Foxg1Cre caused a disruption of midline boundary structures in the dorsal telencephalon. While this Cre line gave the expected pattern of recombination of the floxed <i>Ldb1</i> locus, unexpectedly, standard Cre lines that act from embryonic day (E)10.5 (Emx1Cre) and E11.5 (NesCre) did not show efficient or complete recombination in the dorsal telencephalon by E12.5. Intriguingly, this effect was specific to the <i>Ldb1</i> floxed allele, since three other lines including floxed Ai9 and mTmG reporters, and a floxed <i>Lhx2</i> line, each displayed the expected spatial patterns of recombination. Furthermore, the incomplete recombination of the floxed <i>Ldb1</i> locus using NesCre was limited to the dorsal telencephalon, while the ventral telencephalon and the diencephalon displayed the expected loss of <i>Ldb1</i>. This permitted us to examine the requirement for LDB1 in the development of the thalamus in a context wherein the cortex continued to express <i>Ldb1</i>. We report that the somatosensory VB nucleus is profoundly shrunken upon loss of LDB1. Our findings highlight the unusual nature of the <i>Ldb1</i> locus in terms of recombination efficiency, and also report a novel role for LDB1 during the development of the thalamus.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/11/2144?rss=1">Long-Term, Targeted Delivery of GDNF from Encapsulated Cells Is Neuroprotective and Reduces Seizures in the Pilocarpine Model of Epilepsy</a></h4>

<p>Neurotrophic factors are candidates for treating epilepsy, but their development has been hampered by difficulties in achieving stable and targeted delivery of efficacious concentrations within the desired brain region. We have developed an encapsulated cell technology that overcomes these obstacles by providing a targeted, continuous, <i>de novo</i> synthesized source of high levels of neurotrophic molecules from human clonal ARPE-19 cells encapsulated into hollow fiber membranes. Here we illustrate the potential of this approach for delivering glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) directly to the hippocampus of epileptic rats. <i>In vivo</i> studies demonstrated that bilateral intrahippocampal implants continued to secrete GDNF that produced high hippocampal GDNF tissue levels in a long-term manner. Identical implants robustly reduced seizure frequency in the pilocarpine model. Seizures were reduced rapidly, and this effect increased in magnitude over 3 months, ultimately leading to a reduction of seizures by 93%. This effect persisted even after device removal, suggesting potential disease-modifying benefits. Importantly, seizure reduction was associated with normalized changes in anxiety and improved cognitive performance. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that the neurological benefits of GDNF were associated with the normalization of anatomical alterations accompanying chronic epilepsy, including hippocampal atrophy, cell degeneration, loss of parvalbumin-positive interneurons, and abnormal neurogenesis. These effects were associated with the activation of GDNF receptors. All in all, these results support the concept that the implantation of encapsulated GDNF-secreting cells can deliver GDNF in a sustained, targeted, and efficacious manner, paving the way for continuing preclinical evaluation and eventual clinical translation of this approach for epilepsy.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological conditions, affecting millions of individuals of all ages. These patients experience debilitating seizures that frequently increase over time and can associate with significant cognitive decline and psychiatric disorders that are generally poorly controlled by pharmacotherapy. We have developed a clinically validated, implantable cell encapsulation system that delivers high and consistent levels of GDNF directly to the brain. In epileptic animals, this system produced a progressive and permanent reduction (&gt;90%) in seizure frequency. These benefits were accompanied by improvements in cognitive and anxiolytic behavior and the normalization of changes in CNS anatomy that underlie chronic epilepsy. Together, these data suggest a novel means of tackling the frequently intractable neurological consequences of this devastating disorder.</p>

<p>Dysfunctions of gene transcription and translation in the nociceptive pathways play the critical role in development and maintenance of chronic pain. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are emerging as new players in regulation of gene expression, but whether and how circRNAs are involved in chronic pain remain elusive. We showed here that complete Freund's adjuvant-induced chronic inflammation pain significantly increased circRNA-Filip1l (filamin A interacting protein 1-like) expression in spinal neurons of mice. Blockage of this increase attenuated complete Freund's adjuvant-induced nociceptive behaviors, and overexpression of spinal circRNA-Filip1l in naive mice mimicked the nociceptive behaviors as evidenced by decreased thermal and mechanical nociceptive threshold. Furthermore, we found that mature circRNA-Filip1l expression was negatively regulated by miRNA-1224 via binding and splicing of precursor of circRNA-Filip1l (pre-circRNA-Filip1l) in the Argonaute-2 (<i>Ago2</i>)-dependent manner. Increase of spinal circRNA-Filip1l expression resulted from the decrease of miRNA-1224 expression under chronic inflammation pain state. miRNA-1224 knockdown or <i>Ago2</i> overexpression induced nociceptive behaviors in naive mice, which was prevented by the knockdown of spinal circRNA-Filip1l. Finally, we demonstrated that a ubiquitin protein ligase E3 component <i>n</i>-recognin 5 (<i>Ubr5</i>), validated as a target of circRNA-Filip1l, plays a pivotal role in regulation of nociception by spinal circRNA-Filip1l. These data suggest that miRNA-1224-mediated and Ago2-dependent modulation of spinal circRNA-Filip1l expression regulates nociception via targeting <i>Ubr5</i>, revealing a novel epigenetic mechanism of interaction between miRNA and circRNA in chronic inflammation pain.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> circRNAs are emerging as new players in regulation of gene expression. Here, we found that the increase of circRNA-Filip1l mediated by miRNA-1224 in an Ago2-dependent way in the spinal cord is involved in regulation of nociception via targeting <i>Ubr5</i>.

<p>When searching a visual scene for a target, we tend not to look at items or locations we have already searched. It is thought that this behavior is driven by an inhibitory tagging mechanism that inhibits responses on priority maps to the relevant items. We hypothesized that this inhibitory tagging signal should be represented as an elevated response in neurons that keep track of stimuli that have been fixated. We recorded from 231 neurons in the frontal eye field (FEF) of 2 male animals performing a visual foraging task, in which they had to find a reward linked to one of five identical targets (Ts) among five distractors. We identified 38 neurons with activity that was significantly greater when the stimulus in the receptive field had been fixated previously in the trial than when it had not been fixated. The response to a fixated object began before the saccade ended, suggesting that this information is remapped. Unlike most FEF neurons, the activity in these cells was not suppressed during active fixation, had minimal motor responses, and did not change through the trial. Yet using traditional classifications from a memory-guided saccade, they were indistinguishable from the rest of the FEF population. We propose that these neurons keep track of any items that have been fixated within the trial and this signal is propagated by remapping. These neurons could be the source of the inhibitory tagging signal to parietal cortex, where a neuronal instantiation of inhibitory tagging is seen.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> When we search a scene for an item, we rarely examine the same location twice. It is thought that this is due to a neural mechanism that keeps track of the items at which we have looked. Here we identified a subset of neurons in the frontal eye field that preferentially responded to items that had been fixated earlier in the trial. These responses were remapped, appearing before the saccade even ended, and were not suppressed during maintained fixation. We propose that these neurons keep track of which items have been examined in search and could be the source of feedback that creates the inhibitory tagging seen in parietal cortex.</p>

<p>By predicting sensory consequences of actions, humans can distinguish self-generated sensory inputs from those that are elicited externally. This is one mechanism by which we achieve a subjective sense of agency over our actions. Corollary discharge (CD) signals—"copies" of motor signals sent to sensory areas—permit such predictions, and CD abnormalities are a hypothesized mechanism for the agency disruptions in schizophrenia that characterize a subset of symptoms. Indeed, behavioral evidence of altered CD, including in the oculomotor system, has been observed in schizophrenia patients. A pathway projecting from the superior colliculus to the frontal eye fields (FEFs) via the mediodorsal thalamus (MD) conveys oculomotor CD associated with saccadic eye movements in nonhuman primates. This animal work provides a promising translational framework in which to investigate CD abnormalities in clinical populations. In the current study, we examined whether structural connectivity of this MD–FEF pathway relates to oculomotor CD functioning in schizophrenia. Twenty-two schizophrenia patients and 24 healthy control participants of both sexes underwent diffusion tensor imaging, and a large subset performed a trans-saccadic perceptual task that yields measures of CD. Using probabilistic tractography, we identified anatomical connections between FEF and MD and extracted indices of microstructural integrity. Patients exhibited compromised microstructural integrity in the MD–FEF pathway, which was correlated with greater oculomotor CD abnormalities and more severe psychotic symptoms. These data reinforce the role of the MD–FEF pathway in transmitting oculomotor CD signals and suggest that disturbances in this pathway may relate to psychotic symptom manifestation in patients.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> People with schizophrenia sometimes experience abnormalities in a sense of agency, which may stem from abnormal sensory predictions about their own actions. Consistent with this notion, the current study found reduced structural connectivity in patients with schizophrenia in a specific brain pathway found to transmit such sensorimotor prediction signals in nonhuman primates. Reduced structural connectivity was correlated with behavioral evidence for impaired sensorimotor predictions and psychotic symptoms.</p>

<p>Central output of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons controls fertility and is sculpted by sex-steroid feedback. A switch of estradiol action from negative to positive feedback initiates a surge of GnRH release, culminating in ovulation. In ovariectomized mice bearing constant-release estradiol implants (OVX+E), GnRH neuron firing is suppressed in the morning (AM) by negative feedback and activated in the afternoon (PM) by positive feedback; no time-of-day-dependent changes occur in OVX mice. In this daily surge model, GnRH neuron intrinsic properties are shifted to favor increased firing during positive feedback. It is unclear whether this shift and the observed concomitant increase in GABAergic transmission, which typically excites GnRH neurons, are independently sufficient for increasing GnRH neuron firing rate during positive feedback or whether both are needed. To test this, we used dynamic clamp to inject selected previously recorded trains of GABAergic postsynaptic conductances (PSgs) collected during the different feedback states of the daily surge model into GnRH neurons from OVX, OVX+E AM, and OVX+E PM mice. PSg trains mimicking positive feedback initiated more action potentials in cells from OVX+E PM mice than negative feedback or OVX (open feedback loop) trains in all three animal models, but the positive-feedback train was most effective when applied to cells during positive feedback. <i>In silico</i> studies of model GnRH neurons in which &gt;1000 PSg trains were tested exhibited the same results. These observations support the hypothesis that GnRH neurons integrate fast-synaptic and intrinsic changes to increase firing rates during positive feedback.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Infertility affects 15%–20% of couples; failure to ovulate is a common cause. Understanding how the brain controls ovulation is critical for new developments in both infertility treatment and contraception. Ovarian estradiol alters both the intrinsic properties of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons and synaptic inputs to these cells coincident with production of sustained GnRH release that ultimately triggers ovulation. We demonstrate here using dynamic clamp and mathematical modeling that estradiol-induced shifts in synaptic transmission alone can increase firing output, but that the intrinsic properties of GnRH neurons during positive feedback further poise these cells for increased response to higher frequency synaptic transmission. These data suggest that GnRH neurons integrate fast-synaptic and intrinsic changes to increase firing rates during the preovulatory GnRH surge.</p>

<p>The PFC and extended frontostriatal circuitry support higher cognitive processes that guide goal-directed behavior. PFC-dependent cognitive dysfunction is a core feature of multiple psychiatric disorders. Unfortunately, a major limiting factor in the development of treatments for PFC cognitive dysfunction is our limited understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying PFC-dependent cognition. We recently demonstrated that activation of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) receptors in the caudal dorsomedial PFC (dmPFC) impairs higher cognitive function, as measured in a working memory task. Currently, there remains much unknown about CRF-dependent regulation of cognition, including the source of CRF for cognition-modulating receptors and the output pathways modulated by these receptors. To address these issues, the current studies used a viral vector-based approach to chemogenetically activate or inhibit PFC CRF neurons in working memory-tested male rats. Chemogenetic activation of caudal, but not rostral, dmPFC CRF neurons potently impaired working memory, whereas inhibition of these neurons improved working memory. Importantly, the cognition-impairing actions of PFC CRF neurons were dependent on local CRF receptors coupled to protein kinase A. Additional electrophysiological recordings demonstrated that chemogenetic activation of caudal dmPFC CRF neurons elicits a robust degradation of task-related coding properties of dmPFC pyramidal neurons and, to a lesser extent, medium spiny neurons in the dorsomedial striatum. Collectively, these results demonstrate that local CRF release within the caudal dmPFC impairs frontostriatal cognitive and circuit function and suggest that CRF may represent a potential target for treating frontostriatal cognitive dysfunction.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The dorsomedial PFC and its striatal targets play a critical role in higher cognitive function. PFC-dependent cognitive dysfunction is associated with many psychiatric disorders. Although it has long-been known that corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) neurons are prominent within the PFC, their role in cognition has remained unclear. Using a novel chemogenetic viral vector system, the present studies demonstrate that PFC CRF neurons impair working memory via activation of local PKA-coupled CRF receptors, an action associated with robust degradation in task-related frontostriatal neuronal coding. Conversely, suppression of constitutive PFC CRF activity improved working memory. Collectively, these studies provide novel insight into the neurobiology of cognition and suggest that CRF may represent a novel target for the treatment of cognitive dysfunction.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/11/2065?rss=1">Plasticity in the Link between Pain-Transmitting and Pain-Modulating Systems in Acute and Persistent Inflammation</a></h4>

<p>There is strong evidence that spinoparabrachial neurons in the superficial dorsal horn contribute to persistent pain states, and that the lateral parabrachial complex (PB) conveys relevant nociceptive information to higher structures. The role of PB itself in hyperalgesia and how it recruits descending facilitation has nevertheless received significantly less attention. The current study is a first step toward delineating the functional dynamics of PB and its link to descending control in acute and persistent inflammatory pain. In lightly anesthetized rats, we recorded behavioral withdrawal evoked by mechanical stimulation of the hindpaw and, simultaneously, the activity of identified pain-modulating neurons, "ON-cells" and "OFF-cells," in the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM). This was done before and after the inactivation of PB, contralateral or ipsilateral to an inflamed paw [1 h, 1 d, or 5–6 d after intraplantar injection of Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA)]. The inactivation of contralateral, but not ipsilateral, PB interfered with nociceptive input to RVM under basal conditions, as well as in acute inflammation. By contrast, blocking ipsilateral, but not contralateral, PB in established inflammation interfered with behavioral hyperalgesia and ON-cell and OFF-cell responses. The lesioning of contralateral PB before CFA injection prevented this recruitment of ipsilateral PB in persistent inflammation. These experiments show that contralateral PB is required to initiate hyperalgesia, which is then maintained by ipsilateral PB, most likely in both cases via the engagement of pain-modulating neurons of the RVM.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The lateral parabrachial complex (PB) relays nociceptive information to brain circuits that are important for the transmission and modulation of pain, but its specific role in persistent pain and engagement of descending control mechanisms has received relatively little attention. We show here that PB contralateral and ipsilateral to an inflammatory insult demonstrate different functions as inflammation persists, likely by engaging pain-facilitating neurons of the rostral ventromedial medulla. While the contralateral PB, the target of the major spinoparabrachial pathway, relays acute nociceptive information, the ipsilateral PB is recruited or unmasked in persistent inflammation to maintain hyperalgesia. These data point to plasticity in the PB itself or its direct and indirect connections with pain-modulating systems as central to the development and maintenance of persistent pain.</p>

<p>The descending microcircuit from layer 2/3 (L2/3) to layer 5 (L5) is one of the strongest excitatory pathways in the cortex, presumably forming a core component of its feedforward hierarchy. To date, however, no experiments have selectively tested the impact of L2/3 activity on L5 during active sensation. We used optogenetic, cell-type-specific manipulation of L2/3 neurons in the barrel cortex of actively sensing mice (of either sex) to elucidate the significance of this pathway to sensory coding in L5. Contrary to standard models, activating L2/3 predominantly suppressed spontaneous activity in L5, whereas deactivating L2/3 mainly facilitated touch responses in L5. Somatostatin interneurons are likely important to this suppression because their optogenetic deactivation significantly altered the functional impact of L2/3 onto L5. The net effect of L2/3 was to enhance the stimulus selectivity and expand the range of L5 output. These data imply that the core cortical pathway increases the selectivity and expands the range of cortical output through feedforward inhibition.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The primary sensory cortex contains six distinct layers that interact to form the basis of our perception. While rudimentary patterns of connectivity between the layers have been outlined quite extensively <i>in vitro</i>, functional relationships <i>in vivo</i>, particularly during active sensation, remain poorly understood. We used cell-type-specific optogenetics to test the functional relationship between layer 2/3 and layer 5. Surprisingly, we discovered that L2/3 primarily suppresses cortical output from L5. The recruitment of somatostatin-positive interneurons is likely fundamental to this relationship. The net effect of this translaminar suppression is to enhance the selectivity and expand the range of receptive fields, therefore potentially sharpening the perception of space.</p>

<p>Outputs from the nucleus accumbens (NAc) include projections to the ventral pallidum and the ventral tegmental area and subtantia nigra in the ventral mesencephalon. The medium spiny neurons (MSN) that give rise to these pathways are GABAergic and consist of two populations of equal number that are segregated by differentially expressed proteins, including D1- and D2-dopamine receptors. Afferents to the ventral pallidum arise from both D1- and D2-MSNs, whereas the ventral mesencephalon is selectively innervated by D1-MSN. To determine the extent of collateralization of D1-MSN to these axon terminal fields we used retrograde labeling in transgenic mice expressing tdTomato selectively in D1-MSN, and found that a large majority of D1-MSN in either the shell or core subcompartments of the accumbens collateralized to both output structures. Approximately 70% of D1-MSNs projecting to the ventral pallidum collateralized to the ventral mesencephalon, whereas &gt;90% of mesencephalic D1-MSN afferents collateralized to the ventral pallidum. In contrast, &lt;10% of dorsal striatal D1-MSNs collateralized to both the globus pallidus and ventral mesencephalon. D1-MSN activation is required for conditioned cues to induce cocaine seeking. To determine which D1-MSN projection mediates cued cocaine seeking, we selectively transfected D1-MSNs in transgenic rats with an inhibitory Gi-coupled DREADD. Activation of the transfected Gi-DREADD with clozapine-N-oxide administered into the ventral pallidum, but not into the ventral mesencephalon, blocked cue-induced cocaine seeking. These data show that, although accumbens D1-MSNs largely collateralize to both the ventral pallidum and ventral mesencephalon, only D1-MSN innervation of the ventral pallidum is necessary for cue-induced cocaine seeking.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Activity in D1 dopamine receptor-expressing neurons in the NAc is required for rodents to respond to cocaine-conditioned cues and relapse to drug seeking behaviors. The D1-expressing neurons project to both the ventral pallidum and ventral mesencephalon, and we found that a majority of the neurons that innervate the ventral pallidum also collateralize to the ventral mesencephalon. However, despite innervating both structures, only D1 innervation of the ventral pallidum mediates cue-induced cocaine seeking.</p>

<p>Microglia play important roles in shaping the developing CNS, and at early stages they have been proposed to regulate progenitor proliferation, differentiation, and neuronal survival. However, these studies reveal contradictory outcomes, highlighting the complexity of these cell–cell interactions. Here, we investigate microglia function during embryonic mouse retina development, where only microglia, progenitors, and neurons are present. In both sexes, we determine that microglia primarily interact with retinal neurons and find that depletion of microglia via conditional KO of the <i>Csf1</i> receptor results in increased density of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Pharmacological inhibition of microglia also results in an increase in RGCs, with no effect on retinal progenitor proliferation, RGC genesis, or apoptosis. We show that microglia in the embryonic retina are enriched for phagocytic markers and observe engulfment of nonapoptotic Brn3-labeled RGCs. We investigate the molecular pathways that can mediate cell engulfment by microglia and find selective downregulation of complement pathway components with microglia inhibition, and further show that C1q protein marks a subset of RGCs in the embryonic retina. KO of complement receptor 3 (<i>CR3; Itgam</i>), which is only expressed by microglia, results in increased RGC density, similar to what we observed after depletion or inhibition of microglia. Thus, our data suggest that microglia regulate neuron elimination in the embryonic mouse retina by complement-mediated phagocytosis of non-apoptotic newborn RGCs.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Microglia are emerging as active and important participants in regulating neuron number in development, during adult neurogenesis, and following stem cell therapies. However, their role in these contexts and the mechanisms involved are not fully defined. Using a well-characterized <i>in vivo</i> system, we provide evidence that microglia regulate neuronal elimination by complement-mediated engulfment of nonapoptotic neurons. This work provides a significant advancement of the field by defining <i>in vivo</i> molecular mechanisms for microglia-mediated cell elimination. Our data add to a growing body of evidence that microglia are essential for proper nervous system development. In addition, we elucidate microglia function in the developing retina, which may shed light on microglia involvement in the context of retinal injury and disease.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/11/2011?rss=1">Knockdown of Fidgetin Improves Regeneration of Injured Axons by a Microtubule-Based Mechanism</a></h4>

<p>Fidgetin is a microtubule-severing protein that pares back the labile domains of microtubules in the axon. Experimental depletion of fidgetin results in elongation of the labile domains of microtubules and faster axonal growth. To test whether <i>fidgetin</i> knockdown assists axonal regeneration, we plated dissociated adult rat DRGs transduced using AAV5-shRNA-<i>fidgetin</i> on a laminin substrate with spots of aggrecan, a growth-inhibitory chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan. This cell culture assay mimics the glial scar formed after CNS injury. Aggrecan is more concentrated at the edge of the spot, such that axons growing from within the spot toward the edge encounter a concentration gradient that causes growth cones to become dystrophic and axons to retract or curve back on themselves. <i>Fidgetin</i> knockdown resulted in faster-growing axons on both laminin and aggrecan and enhanced crossing of axons from laminin onto aggrecan. Strikingly, axons from within the spot grew more avidly against the inhibitory aggrecan concentration gradient to cross onto laminin, without retracting or curving back. We also tested whether depleting fidgetin improves axonal regeneration <i>in vivo</i> after a dorsal root crush in adult female rats. Whereas control DRG neurons failed to extend axons across the dorsal root entry zone after injury, DRG neurons in which <i>fidgetin</i> was knocked down displayed enhanced regeneration of axons across the dorsal root entry zone into the spinal cord. Collectively, these results establish fidgetin as a novel therapeutic target to augment nerve regeneration and provide a workflow template by which microtubule-related targets can be compared in the future.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Here we establish a workflow template from cell culture to animals in which microtubule-based treatments can be tested and compared with one another for their effectiveness in augmenting regeneration of injured axons relevant to spinal cord injury. The present work uses a viral transduction approach to knock down <i>fidgetin</i> from rat neurons, which coaxes nerve regeneration by elevating microtubule mass in their axons. Unlike previous strategies using microtubule-stabilizing drugs, <i>fidgetin</i> knockdown adds microtubule mass that is labile (rather than stable), thereby better recapitulating the growth status of a developing axon.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/11/1994?rss=1">Cenpj Regulates Cilia Disassembly and Neurogenesis in the Developing Mouse Cortex</a></h4>

<p>Primary cilia are microtubule-based protuberances that project from the eukaryotic cell body to sense the extracellular environment. Ciliogenesis is closely correlated to the cell cycle and defects of cilia are related to human systemic diseases such as primary ciliary dyskinesia. However, the role of ciliogenesis in cortical development remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that Cenpj, a protein that is required for centriole biogenesis, plays a role in regulating cilium disassembly <i>in vivo</i>. Depletion of Cenpj in neural progenitor cells results in long cilia and abnormal cilia disassembly. Radial glial cells Cenpj depletion exhibit uncompleted cell division, reduced cell proliferation, and increased cell apoptosis in the developing mouse cerebrum cortex, leading to microcephaly. In addition, Cenpj depletion causes long and thin primary cilia and motile cilia in adult neural stem cells and reduced cell proliferation in the subventricular zone. Furthermore, we show that Cenpj regulates cilia disassembly and neurogenesis through Kif2a, a plus-end-directed motor protein. These data collected from mice of both sexes provide insights into how ciliogenesis plays roles in cortical development and how primary microcephaly is induced by <i>Cenpj</i> mutations in humans.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Autosomal recessive primary microcephaly is a neurodevelopmental disorder with the major symptoms of reduction of circumference of the head, brain volume, and cortex thickness with normal brain architecture in birth. We used conditional Cenpj deletion mice and found that neural progenitor cells (NPCs) exhibited long primary cilia and abnormal cilium appendages. The defective cilium disassembly caused by Cenpj depletion might correlate to reduced cell proliferation, uncompleted cell division, cell apoptosis, and microcephaly in mice. Cenpj also regulates the cilium structure of adult neural stem cells and adult neurogenesis in mice. Additionally, our results illustrate that Cenpj regulates cilia disassembly and neurogenesis through Kif2a, indicating that primary cilia dynamics play a crucial role in NPC mitosis and adult neurogenesis.</p>

<p>Glioblastoma (GBM) is one of the most aggressive and lethal tumor types. Evidence continues to accrue indicating that the complex relationship between GBM and the brain microenvironment contributes to this malignant phenotype. However, the interaction between GBM and neurotransmitters, signaling molecules involved in neuronal communication, remains incompletely understood. Here we examined, using human patient-derived xenograft lines, how the monoamine dopamine influences GBM cells. We demonstrate that GBM cells express dopamine receptor 2 (DRD2), with elevated expression in the glioma-initiating cell (GIC) population. Stimulation of DRD2 caused a neuron-like hyperpolarization exclusively in GICs. In addition, long-term activation of DRD2 heightened the sphere-forming capacity of GBM cells, as well as tumor engraftment efficiency in both male and female mice. Mechanistic investigation revealed that DRD2 signaling activates the hypoxia response and functionally alters metabolism. Finally, we found that GBM cells synthesize and secrete dopamine themselves, suggesting a potential autocrine mechanism. These results identify dopamine signaling as a potential therapeutic target in GBM and further highlight neurotransmitters as a key feature of the pro-tumor microenvironment.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> This work offers critical insight into the role of the neurotransmitter dopamine in the progression of GBM. We show that dopamine induces specific changes in the state of tumor cells, augmenting their growth and shifting them to a more stem-cell like state. Further, our data illustrate that dopamine can alter the metabolic behavior of GBM cells, increasing glycolysis. Finally, this work demonstrates that GBM cells, including tumor samples from patients, can synthesize and secrete dopamine, suggesting an autocrine signaling process underlying these results. These results describe a novel connection between neurotransmitters and brain cancer, further highlighting the critical influence of the brain milieu on GBM.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/11/1969?rss=1">Two Distinct Sets of Ca2+ and K+ Channels Are Activated at Different Membrane Potentials by the Climbing Fiber Synaptic Potential in Purkinje Neuron Dendrites</a></h4>

<p>In cerebellar Purkinje neuron dendrites, the transient depolarization associated with a climbing fiber (CF) EPSP activates voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (VGCCs), voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channels (VGKCs), and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated SK and BK K<sup>+</sup> channels. The resulting membrane potential (<i>V</i><sub>m</sub>) and Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients play a fundamental role in dendritic integration and synaptic plasticity of parallel fiber inputs. Here we report a detailed investigation of the kinetics of dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> channels activated by CF-EPSPs, based on optical measurements of <i>V</i><sub>m</sub> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients and on a single-compartment NEURON model reproducing experimental data. We first measured <i>V</i><sub>m</sub> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients associated with CF-EPSPs at different initial <i>V</i><sub>m</sub>, and we analyzed the changes in the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients produced by the block of each individual VGCCs, of A-type VGKCs and of SK and BK channels. Then, we constructed a model that includes six active ion channels to accurately match experimental signals and extract the physiological kinetics of each channel. We found that two different sets of channels are selectively activated. When the dendrite is hyperpolarized, CF-EPSPs mainly activate T-type VGCCs, SK channels, and A-type VGKCs that limit the transient <i>V</i><sub>m</sub> ~ &lt;0 mV. In contrast, when the dendrite is depolarized, T-type VGCCs and A-type VGKCs are inactivated and CF-EPSPs activate P/Q-type VGCCs, high-voltage activated VGKCs, and BK channels, leading to Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes. Thus, the potentially activity-dependent regulation of A-type VGKCs, controlling the activation of this second set of channels, is likely to play a crucial role in signal integration and plasticity in Purkinje neuron dendrites.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The climbing fiber synaptic input transiently depolarizes the dendrite of cerebellar Purkinje neurons generating a signal that plays a fundamental role in dendritic integration. This signal is mediated by two types of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and four types of K<sup>+</sup> channels. Thus, understanding the kinetics of all of these channels is crucial for understanding PN function. To obtain this information, we used an innovative strategy that merges ultrafast optical membrane potential and Ca<sup>2+</sup> measurements, pharmacological analysis, and computational modeling. We found that, according to the initial membrane potential, the climbing fiber depolarizing transient activates two distinct sets of channels. Moreover, A-type K<sup>+</sup> channels limit the activation of P/Q-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and associated K<sup>+</sup> channels, thus preventing the generation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To identify shared polygenic risk and causal associations in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Linkage disequilibrium score regression and Mendelian randomization were applied in a large‐scale, data‐driven manner to explore genetic correlations and causal relationships between &gt;700 phenotypic traits and ALS. Exposures consisted of publicly available genome‐wide association studies (GWASes) summary statistics from <i>MR Base</i> and <i>LD‐hub</i>. The outcome data came from the recently published ALS GWAS involving 20,806 cases and 59,804 controls. Multivariate analyses, genetic risk profiling, and Bayesian colocalization analyses were also performed.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We have shown, by linkage disequilibrium score regression, that ALS shares polygenic risk genetic factors with a number of traits and conditions, including positive correlations with smoking status and moderate levels of physical activity, and negative correlations with higher cognitive performance, higher educational attainment, and light levels of physical activity. Using Mendelian randomization, we found evidence that hyperlipidemia is a causal risk factor for ALS and localized putative functional signals within loci of interest.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Here, we have developed a public resource (<a href="https://lng-nia.shinyapps.io/mrshiny" target="_blank" title="Link to external resource">https://lng-nia.shinyapps.io/mrshiny</a>) which we hope will become a valuable tool for the ALS community, and that will be expanded and updated as new data become available. Shared polygenic risk exists between ALS and educational attainment, physical activity, smoking, and tenseness/restlessness. We also found evidence that elevated low‐desnity lipoprotein cholesterol is a causal risk factor for ALS. Future randomized controlled trials should be considered as a proof of causality.

<p>In this study, we examined the potential causal effect of smoking on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) using the Project MinE data involving 12,577 patients with ALS and 23,475 controls in a Mendelian randomization (MR) framework. The MR approach has the potential to investigate a causal relationship between a risk factor and a disease, avoiding confounding and information bias that often present in conventional epidemiological studies. We found that smokers had a higher risk of ALS compared to never smokers. Our study thus provides evidence for a causal relationship between smoking and ALS. Ann Neurol, 2019</p>

<p>Electroencephalography (EEG) monitors ---by either intrusive or noninvasive
electrodes--- time and frequency variations and spectral content of voltage
fluctuations or waves, known as brain rhythms, which in some way uncover
activity during both rest periods and specific events in which the subject is
under stimulus. This is a useful tool to explore brain behavior, as it
complements imaging techniques that have a poorer temporal resolution. We here
approach the understanding of EEG data from first principles by studying a
networked model of excitatory and inhibitory neurons which generates a variety
of comparable waves. In fact, we thus reproduce $\alpha$, $\beta,$ $\gamma$ and
other rhythms as observed by EEG, and identify the details of the respectively
involved complex phenomena, including a precise relationship between an input
and the collective response to it. It ensues the potentiality of our model to
better understand actual mind mechanisms and its possible disorders, and we
also describe kind of stochastic resonance phenomena which locate main
qualitative changes of mental behavior in (e.g.) humans. We also discuss the
plausible use of these findings to design deep learning algorithms to detect
the occurence of phase transitions in the brain and to analyse its
consequences.

Regeneration occurs at many different levels in nature, from individual organisms (notably earthworms and hydra), through communities of microbes, to ecosystems such as forests. Researchers in the life sciences and the history and philosophy of science are collaborating to explore how the processes of repair and recovery observed at these different scales are related.

The characteristic properties of stem cells – notably their ability to self-renew and to differentiate – have meant that they have traditionally been viewed as distinct from most other types of cells. However, recent research has blurred the line between stem cells and other cells by showing that the former display a range of behaviors in different tissues and at different stages of development. Here, we use the tools of metaphysics to describe a classification scheme for stem cells, and to highlight what their inherent diversity means for cancer treatment.

Synthetic cells spark intriguing questions about the nature of life. Projects such as BaSyC (Building a Synthetic Cell) aim to build an entity that mimics how living cells work. But what kind of entity would a synthetic cell really be? I assess this question from a philosophical perspective, and show how early fictional narratives of artificial life – such as the laboratory scene in Goethe’s <i>Faust</i> – can help us to understand the challenges faced by synthetic biology researchers.

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a progressive disease of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and the retina leading to loss of central vision. Polymorphisms in genes involved in lipid metabolism, including the ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (<i>ABCA1</i>), have been associated with AMD risk. However, the significance of retinal lipid handling for AMD pathogenesis remains elusive. Here, we study the contribution of lipid efflux in the RPE by generating a mouse model lacking ABCA1 and its partner ABCG1 specifically in this layer. Mutant mice show lipid accumulation in the RPE, reduced RPE and retinal function, retinal inflammation and RPE/photoreceptor degeneration. Data from human cell lines indicate that the <i>ABCA1</i> AMD risk-conferring allele decreases <i>ABCA1</i> expression, identifying the potential molecular cause that underlies the genetic risk for AMD. Our results highlight the essential homeostatic role for lipid efflux in the RPE and suggest a pathogenic contribution of reduced ABCA1 function to AMD.

Scientists seek to eliminate all forms of bias from their research. However, all scientists also make assumptions of a non-empirical nature about topics such as causality, determinism and reductionism when conducting research. Here, we argue that since these 'philosophical biases' cannot be avoided, they need to be debated critically by scientists and philosophers of science.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/43464">Empirical examination of the replicability of associations between brain structure and psychological variables</a></h4>

Linking interindividual differences in psychological phenotype to variations in brain structure is an old dream for psychology and a crucial question for cognitive neurosciences. Yet, replicability of the previously-reported 'structural brain behavior' (SBB)-associations has been questioned, recently. Here, we conducted an empirical investigation, assessing replicability of SBB among heathy adults. For a wide range of psychological measures, the replicability of associations with gray matter volume was assessed. Our results revealed that among healthy individuals 1) finding an association between performance at standard psychological tests and brain morphology is relatively unlikely 2) significant associations, found using an exploratory approach, have overestimated effect sizes and 3) can hardly be replicated in an independent sample. After considering factors such as sample size and comparing our findings with more replicable SBB-associations in a clinical cohort and replicable associations between brain structure and non-psychological phenotype, we discuss the potential causes and consequences of these findings.

Additional pathways respond to ER stress, but how they help counteract protein misfolding is incompletely understood. Here, we develop a titratable system for the induction of ER stress in yeast to enable a genetic screen for factors that augment stress resistance independently of the UPR. We identify the proteasome biogenesis regulator Rpn4 and show that it cooperates with the UPR. Rpn4 abundance increases during ER stress, first by a post-transcriptional, then by a transcriptional mechanism. Induction of <i>RPN4</i> transcription is triggered by cytosolic mislocalization of secretory proteins, is mediated by multiple signaling pathways and accelerates clearance of misfolded proteins from the cytosol. Thus, Rpn4 and the UPR are complementary elements of a modular cross-compartment response to ER stress.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/41299">Intramolecular domain dynamics regulate synaptic MAGUK protein interactions</a></h4>

PSD-95 MAGUK family scaffold proteins are multi-domain organisers of synaptic transmission that contain three PDZ domains followed by an SH3-GK domain tandem. This domain architecture allows coordinated assembly of protein complexes composed of neurotransmitter receptors, synaptic adhesion molecules and downstream signalling effectors. Here we show that binding of monomeric CRIPT-derived PDZ<sub>3</sub> ligands to the third PDZ domain of PSD-95 induces functional changes in the intramolecular SH3-GK domain assembly that influence subsequent homotypic and heterotypic complex formation. We identify PSD-95 interactors that differentially bind to the SH3-GK domain tandem depending on its conformational state. Among these interactors we further establish the heterotrimeric G protein subunit Gnb5 as a PSD-95 complex partner at dendritic spines of rat hippocampal neurons. The PSD-95 GK domain binds to Gnb5 and this interaction is triggered by CRIPT-derived PDZ<sub>3</sub> ligands binding to the third PDZ domain of PSD-95, unraveling a hierarchical binding mechanism of PSD-95 complex formation.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/38114">Neurocalcin regulates nighttime sleep and arousal in <i>Drosophila</i></a></h4>

Sleep-like states in diverse organisms can be separated into distinct stages, each with a characteristic arousal threshold. However, the molecular pathways underlying different sleep stages remain unclear. The fruit fly, <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, exhibits consolidated sleep during both day and night, with night sleep associated with higher arousal thresholds compared to day sleep. Here we identify a role for the neuronal calcium sensor protein Neurocalcin (NCA) in promoting sleep during the night but not the day by suppressing nocturnal arousal and hyperactivity. We show that both circadian and light-sensing pathways define the temporal window in which NCA promotes sleep. Furthermore, we find that NCA promotes sleep by suppressing synaptic release from a dispersed wake-promoting neural network and demonstrate that the mushroom bodies, a sleep-regulatory center, are a module within this network. Our results advance the understanding of how sleep stages are genetically defined.

To understand subjective evaluation of an option, various disciplines have quantified the interaction between reward and effort during decision making, producing an estimate of economic utility, namely the subjective ‘goodness’ of an option. However, variables that affect utility of an option also influence the vigor of movements toward that option. For example, expectation of reward increases speed of saccadic eye movements, whereas expectation of effort decreases this speed. These results imply that vigor may serve as a new, real-time metric with which to quantify subjective utility, and that the control of movements may be an implicit reflection of the brain’s economic evaluation of the expected outcome.

Background: High epilepsy prevalence and incidence were observed in onchocerciasis-endemic villages in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). We sought to investigate the clinical characteristics of onchocerciasis-associated epilepsy (OAE), and the relationship with microfilarial density. Methods: In October 2017, ivermectin-naive persons with epilepsy (PWE) were recruited from onchocerciasis-endemic areas in the Logo health zone in the DRC. Additional PWE were enrolled in the Aketi health zone, where ivermectin had been distributed annually for 14 years. Past medical history, clinical characteristics and skin snips for Onchocerca volvulus detection were obtained from participants. Bivariate and multivariable analyses were used to investigate associations with microfilarial density. Results: Of the 420 PWE in the Logo health zone, 392 were skin snipped (36.5% positive). Generalized motor seizures were most frequent (392 PWE, 93.3%), and nodding seizures were reported in 32 (7.6%) participants. Twelve PWE (3.1%) presented Nakalanga features. More skin snip-positive participants reported a family history of epilepsy (p=0.027). Eighty-one onchocerciasis-infected PWE were recruited in the Aketi health zone. Positive correlations between seizure frequency and microfilarial density were observed in Logo (Spearman-rho=0.181; p=0.0003) and Aketi (Spearman-rho=0.228; p=0.046). In the multivariable analysis which adjusted for age, gender and previous anti-epileptic drug use, factors associated with high seizure frequency included: high microfilarial density (RR=1.004, 95% CI: 1.002-1.007; p&lt;0.001), history of nodding seizures (RR=3.852, 95% CI: 2.926-5.082; p&lt;0.001) and shorter duration of epilepsy (RR=0.948, 95% CI: 0.928-0.968; p&lt;0.001). In Aketi, previous ivermectin use was associated with reduced seizures (RR=0.69, 95% CI: 0.58-0.83; p&lt;0.001). Conclusion: In onchocerciasis-endemic regions in the DRC, a wide spectrum of seizures was observed. Nodding seizures, Nakalanga features, and a positive association between microfilarial density and seizures suggest a high OAE prevalence in the study villages, requiring a double management strategy: treatment with anti-epileptic drugs and stronger onchocerciasis elimination programs.

OBJECTIVE Erythropoietin (EPO) is a clinically available hematopoietic cytokine. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of EPO on a rat model of cervical cord compression myelopathy and to explore the possibility of its use as a pharmacological treatment. METHODS To produce the chronic cervical cord compression model, thin polyurethane sheets were implanted under the C5-C6 laminae of rats and gradually expanded due to water absorption. In this model, motor functions significantly declined from 7 weeks after surgery. Based on the result, EPO administration was started 8 weeks after surgery. Motor function as seen with rotarod performance and grip strength was measured 16 weeks after surgery, and then motor neurons were stained with H-E and NeuN staining, and counted. Apoptotic cell death was assessed with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining. To assess transfer of EPO into spinal cord tissue, the EPO level in spinal cord tissue was measured with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for each group after subcutaneous injection of EPO. RESULTS High-dose EPO (5000 IU/kg) administered from 8 weeks after surgery markedly restored and maintained motor function in the Compression groups (P &lt; 0.01). EPO significantly prevented loss of motor neurons in the anterior horn (P &lt; 0.05) and significantly decreased the number of TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells (P &lt; 0.05). The EPO level in spinal cord tissue was significantly higher in the High-dose EPO group than other groups. CONCLUSIONS EPO improves motor function in rats with progressive chronic compression myelopathy. EPO protects anterior horn motor neurons and inhibits neuronal cell apoptosis in spinal cord compression. The neuroprotective effects can be produced through transfer of EPO into spinal cord tissue. These findings suggest that EPO has high potential as a treatment for developing compression myelopathy.

Brain decoding --- the process of inferring a person's momentary cognitive state from their brain activity --- has enormous potential in the field of human-computer interaction. In this study we propose a zero-shot EEG-to-image brain decoding approach which makes use of state-of-the-art EEG preprocessing and feature selection methods, and which maps EEG activity to biologically inspired computer vision and linguistic models. We apply this approach to solve the problem of identifying viewed images from recorded brain activity in a reliable and scalable way. We demonstrate competitive decoding accuracies across two EEG datasets, using a zero-shot learning framework more applicable to real-world image retrieval than traditional classification techniques.

<p>by Jacopo Bono, Claudia Clopath</p>

Ocular dominance plasticity is a well-documented phenomenon allowing us to study properties of cortical maturation. Understanding this maturation might be an important step towards unravelling how cortical circuits function. However, it is still not fully understood which mechanisms are responsible for the opening and closing of the critical period for ocular dominance and how changes in cortical responsiveness arise after visual deprivation. In this article, we present a theory of ocular dominance plasticity. Following recent experimental work, we propose a framework where a reduction in inhibition is necessary for ocular dominance plasticity in both juvenile and adult animals. In this framework, two ingredients are crucial to observe ocular dominance shifts: a sufficient level of inhibition as well as excitatory-to-inhibitory synaptic plasticity. In our model, the former is responsible for the opening of the critical period, while the latter limits the plasticity in adult animals. Finally, we also provide a possible explanation for the variability in ocular dominance shifts observed in individual neurons and for the counter-intuitive shifts towards the closed eye.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2HjERBCZGPc" width="1" />

<p>by Can Eren Sezener, Amir Dezfouli, Mehdi Keramati</p>

Evaluating the future consequences of actions is achievable by simulating a mental search tree into the future. Expanding deep trees, however, is computationally taxing. Therefore, machines and humans use a plan-until-habit scheme that simulates the environment up to a limited depth and then exploits habitual values as proxies for consequences that may arise in the future. Two outstanding questions in this scheme are “in which directions the search tree should be expanded?”, and “when should the expansion stop?”. Here we propose a principled solution to these questions based on a speed/accuracy tradeoff: deeper expansion in the appropriate directions leads to more accurate planning, but at the cost of slower decision-making. Our simulation results show how this algorithm expands the search tree effectively and efficiently in a grid-world environment. We further show that our algorithm can explain several behavioral patterns in animals and humans, namely the effect of time-pressure on the depth of planning, the effect of reward magnitudes on the direction of planning, and the gradual shift from goal-directed to habitual behavior over the course of training. The algorithm also provides several predictions testable in animal/human experiments.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/CETQ5A5g_oA" width="1" />

<p>by Niceto R. Luque, Francisco Naveros, Richard R. Carrillo, Eduardo Ros, Angelo Arleo</p>

Cerebellar Purkinje cells mediate accurate eye movement coordination. However, it remains unclear how oculomotor adaptation depends on the interplay between the characteristic Purkinje cell response patterns, namely tonic, bursting, and spike pauses. Here, a spiking cerebellar model assesses the role of Purkinje cell firing patterns in vestibular ocular reflex (VOR) adaptation. The model captures the cerebellar microcircuit properties and it incorporates spike-based synaptic plasticity at multiple cerebellar sites. A detailed Purkinje cell model reproduces the three spike-firing patterns that are shown to regulate the cerebellar output. Our results suggest that pauses following Purkinje complex spikes (bursts) encode transient disinhibition of targeted medial vestibular nuclei, critically gating the vestibular signals conveyed by mossy fibres. This gating mechanism accounts for early and coarse VOR acquisition, prior to the late reflex consolidation. In addition, properly timed and sized Purkinje cell bursts allow the ratio between long-term depression and potentiation (LTD/LTP) to be finely shaped at mossy fibre-medial vestibular nuclei synapses, which optimises VOR consolidation. Tonic Purkinje cell firing maintains the consolidated VOR through time. Importantly, pauses are crucial to facilitate VOR phase-reversal learning, by reshaping previously learnt synaptic weight distributions. Altogether, these results predict that Purkinje spike burst-pause dynamics are instrumental to VOR learning and reversal adaptation.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/yPKm5tnZcuc" width="1" />

Abstract
<p>While recent work has revealed how different inhibitory interneurons influence responses of cortical neurons to sensory stimuli, little is known about their distinct contributions to sensory perception. Here, we optogenetically activated different genetically defined interneurons [parvalbumin (PV), somatostatin (SST), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)] in visual cortex (V1) of mice working at threshold in a contrast increment detection task. The visual stimulus was paired with optogenetic stimulation to assess how enhancing V1 inhibitory neuron activity during visual processing altered task performance. PV or SST activation impaired, while VIP stimulation improved, contrast increment detection. The impairment produced by PV or SST activation persisted over several weeks of testing. In contrast, mice learned to reliably detect VIP activation in the absence of any natural visual stimulus. Thus, different inhibitory signals make distinct contributions to visual contrast perception.</p>

Abstract
<p>GABAergic inhibitory neurons in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) play crucial roles in higher cognitive functions. Despite the link between aberrant development of PFC interneurons and a number of psychiatric disorders, mechanisms underlying the development of these neurons are poorly understood. Here we show that the retinoic acid (RA)-degrading enzyme CYP26B1 (cytochrome P450 family 26, subfamily B, member 1) is transiently expressed in the mouse frontal cortex during postnatal development, and that medial ganglionic eminence (MGE)-derived interneurons, particularly in parvalbumin (PV)-expressing neurons, are the main cell type that has active RA signaling during this period. We found that frontal cortex-specific <i>Cyp26b1</i> knock-out mice had an increased density of PV-expressing, but not somatostatin-expressing, interneurons in medial PFC, indicating a novel role of RA signaling in controlling PV neuron development. The initiation of <i>Cyp26b1</i> expression in neonatal PFC coincides with the establishment of connections between the thalamus and the PFC. We found that these connections are required for the postnatal expression of <i>Cyp26b1</i> in medial PFC. In addition to this region-specific role in postnatal PFC that regulates RA signaling and PV neuron development, the thalamocortical connectivity had an earlier role in controlling radial dispersion of MGE-derived interneurons throughout embryonic neocortex. In summary, our results suggest that the thalamus plays multiple, temporally separate roles in interneuron development in the PFC.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Children with aromatic <span class="smallCaps">l</span>‐amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) deficiency suffer from severe motor dysfunction. Restoration of dopamine levels in the putamen by gene therapy has led to significant improvement in motor function. This study explored brain structure changes in patients.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Brain diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) were performed before and 12 months after gene therapy. Whole‐brain tract‐specific analysis was performed to assess white matter microstructural integrity.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In the eight patients (1.67 to 8.42 years of age) enrolled in the study, gene therapy did not affect macroscopic structure. DTI prior to gene therapy revealed lower total mean fractional anisotropy (FA) values in the patients than in the age‐matched pretreatment controls (<i>p</i> = 0.017, median difference = −0.0136, 95% confidence interval [CI] [−0.0319, −0.0126]). After gene therapy, total mean FA increased (<i>p</i> = 0.012, median difference = 0.0211, 95% CI [0.0094, 0.0456]) and the values in the patients were not different from the age‐matched posttreatment controls. The increase in total mean FA after gene therapy in the patients was correlated with their increase in motor score (R = 0.846; <i>p</i> = 0.008), but was inversely correlated with their ages at the time of gene therapy (R = −0.754; <i>p</i> = 0.031). The corticospinal tracts, and the thalamic radiation and callosal fibers involving motor function, improved after gene therapy.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Improvement in the microstructural integrity of white matter tracts is associated with the improvement in motor function following gene therapy.</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>We investigated whether CT perfusion can identify intracerebral hemorrhage patients at high risk of hematoma growth (HG). A total of 155 subjects underwent CT perfusion on admission. Variables associated with log‐transformed absolute HG were explored with multivariable linear regression. Perihematomal cerebral blood volume (CBV) was inversely associated with HG (B=‐0.20,p&lt;0.001), independently from blood pressure, ICH volume and other confounders. This association was not dose‐dependent and only very low CBV (&lt;1.4 mL/100g) was significantly associated with HG (B=0.25,p&lt;0.001).</p>
<p>In conclusion, reduced perihematomal CBV is associated with HG, suggesting a potential role of the perihematomal region in the pathophysiology of hematoma enlargement.</p>

<p>We introduce Continual Learning via Neural Pruning (CLNP), a new method aimed
at lifelong learning in fixed capacity models based on neuronal model
sparsification. In this method, subsequent tasks are trained using the inactive
neurons and filters of the sparsified network and cause zero deterioration to
the performance of previous tasks. In order to deal with the possible
compromise between model sparsity and performance, we formalize and incorporate
the concept of graceful forgetting: the idea that it is preferable to suffer a
small amount of forgetting in a controlled manner if it helps regain network
capacity and prevents uncontrolled loss of performance during the training of
future tasks. CLNP also provides simple continual learning diagnostic tools in
terms of the number of free neurons left for the training of future tasks as
well as the number of neurons that are being reused. In particular, we see in
experiments that CLNP verifies and automatically takes advantage of the fact
that the features of earlier layers are more transferable. We show empirically
that CLNP leads to significantly improved results over current weight
elasticity based methods.

<p>Preventing early progression of epilepsy and so the severity of seizures
requires effective diagnosis. Epileptic transients indicate the ability to
develop seizures but humans easily overlook such brief events in an
electroencephalogram (EEG) what compromises patient treatment. Traditionally,
training of the EEG event detection algorithms has relied on ground truth
labels, obtained from the consensus of the majority of labelers. In this work,
we go beyond labeler consensus on EEG data. Our event descriptor integrates EEG
signal features with one-hot encoded labeler category that is a key to improved
generalization performance. Notably, boosted decision trees take advantage of
singly-labeled but more varied training sets. Our quantitative experiments show
the proposed labeler-hot epileptic event detector consistently outperforms a
consensus-trained detector and maintains confidence bounds of the detection.
The results on our infant EEG recordings suggest datasets can gain higher event
variety faster and thus better performance by shifting available human effort
from consensus-oriented to separate labeling when labels include both, the
event and the labeler category.

<p>Despite a rise in the use of "learning by doing" pedagogical methods in
praxis, little is known as to why these methods may improve learning outcomes.
This is surprising given that an increased mechanistic knowledge of learning by
doing-based improvements has the potential to speed up the development of
evidence-based teaching practices. Here we use neuroscience methods and a
gesture-enriched foreign language (L2) vocabulary learning paradigm to
adjudicate between opposing predictions of two neuroscientific learning
theories. We demonstrate that sensory brain regions associated with the
processing of gesture-related stimulus information causally contribute to
performance benefits following gesture-enriched L2 vocabulary learning. Sensory
brain responses benefitted both short- and long-term learning outcomes, as well
as the learning of both concrete and abstract words. These findings suggest
that responses within specialized visual sensory cortices precipitate
sensorimotor-based learning benefits. Such a mechanism could play a role in
comparatively effortless native language learning and may be key for
accelerating L2 proficiency in adults.

<p>Based on the behavior coordinate system, ideal individual model and quantum
probability, the state of an ideal individual is assumed to be described by the
behavior state function. Then we present a conjecture that the ideal
individuals can be identical. A consequence of the identical individual
conjecture is that the existence of the personal space and the behavior
differentiation under high population density condition receive a possible
theoretical explanation.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/45222">Structural mechanisms of phospholipid activation of the human TPC2 channel</a></h4>

Mammalian two-pore channels (TPCs) regulate the physiological functions of the endolysosome. Here we present cryo-EM structures of human TPC2 (HsTPC2), a phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub>)-activated, Na<sup>+ </sup>selective channel, in the ligand-bound and apo states. The apo structure captures the closed conformation, while the ligand-bound form features the channel in both open and closed conformations. Combined with functional analysis, these structures provide insights into the mechanism of PI(3,5)P<sub>2</sub>-regulated gating of TPC2, which is distinct from that of TPC1. Specifically, the endolysosome-specific PI(3,5)P<sub>2 </sub>binds at the first 6-TM and activates the channel - independently of the membrane potential - by inducing a structural change at the pore-lining inner helix (IS6), which forms a continuous helix in the open state but breaks into two segments at Gly317 in the closed state. Additionally, structural comparison to the voltage-dependent TPC1 structure allowed us to identify Ile551 as being responsible for the loss of voltage dependence in TPC2.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/44771">The complete structure of the human TFIIH core complex</a></h4>

Transcription factor IIH (TFIIH) is a heterodecameric protein complex critical for transcription initiation by RNA polymerase II and nucleotide excision DNA repair. The TFIIH core complex is sufficient for its repair functions and harbors the XPB and XPD DNA-dependent ATPase/helicase subunits, which are affected by human disease mutations. Transcription initiation additionally requires the CdK activating kinase subcomplex. Previous structural work has provided only partial insight into the architecture of TFIIH and its interactions within transcription pre-initiation complexes. Here, we present the complete structure of the human TFIIH core complex, determined by phase-plate cryo-electron microscopy at 3.7 Å resolution. The structure uncovers the molecular basis of TFIIH assembly, revealing how the recruitment of XPB by p52 depends on a pseudo-symmetric dimer of homologous domains in these two proteins. The structure also suggests a function for p62 in the regulation of XPD, and allows the mapping of previously unresolved human disease mutations.

Renal medullary carcinoma (RMC) is a rare and deadly kidney cancer in patients of African descent with sickle cell trait. We have developed faithful patient-derived RMC models and using whole-genome sequencing, we identified loss-of-function intronic fusion events in one <i>SMARCB1</i> allele with concurrent loss of the other allele. Biochemical and functional characterization of these models revealed that RMC requires the loss of <i>SMARCB1</i> for survival. Through integration of RNAi and CRISPR-Cas9 loss-of-function genetic screens and a small-molecule screen, we found that the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) was essential in RMC. Inhibition of the UPS caused a G2/M arrest due to constitutive accumulation of cyclin B1. These observations extend across cancers that harbor <i>SMARCB1</i> loss, which also require expression of the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, <i>UBE2C</i>. Our studies identify a synthetic lethal relationship between <i>SMARCB1</i>-deficient cancers and reliance on the UPS which provides the foundation for a mechanism-informed clinical trial with proteasome inhibitors.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/44032">Generalization of learned responses in the mormyrid electrosensory lobe</a></h4>

Appropriate generalization of learned responses to new situations is vital for adaptive behavior. We provide a circuit-level account of generalization in the electrosensory lobe (ELL) of weakly electric mormyrid fish. Much is already known in this system about a form of learning in which motor corollary discharge signals cancel responses to the uninformative input evoked by the fish's own electric pulses. However, for this cancellation to be useful under natural circumstances, it must generalize accurately across behavioral regimes, specifically different electric pulse rates. We show that such generalization indeed occurs in ELL neurons, and develop a circuit-level model explaining how this may be achieved. The mechanism involves regularized synaptic plasticity and an approximate matching of the temporal dynamics of motor corollary discharge and electrosensory inputs. Recordings of motor corollary discharge signals in mossy fibers and granule cells provide direct evidence for such matching.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/43808">Dual control of NAD<sup>+</sup> synthesis by purine metabolites in yeast</a></h4>

Metabolism is a highly integrated process resulting in energy and biomass production. While individual metabolic routes are well characterized, the mechanisms ensuring crosstalk between pathways are poorly described though they are crucial for homeostasis. Here, we establish a co-regulation of purine and pyridine metabolism in response to external adenine through two separable mechanisms. First, adenine depletion promotes transcriptional up-regulation of the <i>de novo</i> NAD<sup>+</sup> biosynthesis genes by a mechanism requiring the key-purine intermediates ZMP/SZMP and the Bas1/Pho2 transcription factors. Second, adenine supplementation favors the pyridine salvage route resulting in an ATP-dependent increase of intracellular NAD<sup>+</sup>. This control operates at the level of the nicotinic acid mononucleotide adenylyl-transferase Nma1 and can be bypassed by overexpressing this enzyme. Therefore, in yeast, pyridine metabolism is under the dual control of ZMP/SZMP and ATP, revealing a much wider regulatory role for these intermediate metabolites in an integrated biosynthesis network.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/43599">A multicellular way of life for a multipartite virus</a></h4>

A founding paradigm in virology is that the spatial unit of the viral replication cycle is an individual cell. Multipartite viruses have a segmented genome where each segment is encapsidated separately. In this situation the viral genome is not recapitulated in a single virus particle but in the viral population. How multipartite viruses manage to efficiently infect individual cells with all segments, thus with the whole genome information, is a long-standing but perhaps deceptive mystery. By localizing and quantifying the genome segments of a nanovirus in host plant tissues we show that they rarely co-occur within individual cells. We further demonstrate that distinct segments accumulate independently in different cells and that the viral system is functional through complementation across cells. Our observation deviates from the classical conceptual framework in virology and opens an alternative possibility (at least for nanoviruses) where the infection can operate at a level above the individual cell level, defining a viral multicellular way of life.

As part of the <a href="https://osf.io/e81xl/wiki/home/">Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology</a>, we published a Registered Report (Li et al., 2015), that described how we intended to replicate selected experiments from the paper ‘The microRNA miR-34a inhibits prostate cancer stem cells and metastasis by directly repressing CD44’ (Liu et al., 2011). Here we report the results. We found the microRNA, miR-34a, was expressed at twice the level in CD44<sup>+</sup> prostate cancer cells purified from xenograft tumors (LAPC4 cells) compared to CD44<sup>-</sup> LAPC4 cells, whereas the original study reported miR-34a was underexpressed in CD44<sup>+</sup> LAPC4 cells (Figure 1B; Liu et al., 2011). When LAPC4 cells engineered to express miR-34a were injected into mice, we did not observe changes in tumor growth or CD44 expression; however, unexpectedly miR-34a expression was lost <i>in vivo</i>. In the original study, LAPC4 cells expressing miR-34a had a statistically significant reduction in tumor regeneration and reduced CD44 expression compared to control (Figure 4A and Supplemental Figures 4A,B and 5C; Liu et al., 2011). Furthermore, when we tested if miR-34a regulated CD44 through binding sites in the 3’UTR we did not find a statistically significant difference, whereas the original study reported miR-34a decreased CD44 expression that was partially abrogated by mutation of the binding sites in the <i>CD44</i> 3’UTR (Figure 4D; Liu et al., 2011). Finally, where possible, we report meta-analyses for each result.

<p>by Shariq N. Iqbal, Lun Yin, Caroline B. Drucker, Qian Kuang, Jean-François Gariépy, Michael L. Platt, John M. Pearson</p>

Understanding the principles by which agents interact with both complex environments and each other is a key goal of decision neuroscience. However, most previous studies have used experimental paradigms in which choices are discrete (and few), play is static, and optimal solutions are known. Yet in natural environments, interactions between agents typically involve continuous action spaces, ongoing dynamics, and no known optimal solution. Here, we seek to bridge this divide by using a “penalty shot” task in which pairs of monkeys competed against each other in a competitive, real-time video game. We modeled monkeys’ strategies as driven by stochastically evolving goals, onscreen positions that served as set points for a control model that produced observed joystick movements. We fit this goal-based dynamical system model using approximate Bayesian inference methods, using neural networks to parameterize players’ goals as a dynamic mixture of Gaussian components. Our model is conceptually simple, constructed of interpretable components, and capable of generating synthetic data that capture the complexity of real player dynamics. We further characterized players’ strategies using the number of change points on each trial. We found that this complexity varied more across sessions than within sessions, and that more complex strategies benefited offensive players but not defensive players. Together, our experimental paradigm and model offer a powerful combination of tools for the study of realistic social dynamics in the laboratory setting.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/8EQny46_S5o" width="1" />

<p>by Daan H. de Groot, Coco van Boxtel, Robert Planqué, Frank J. Bruggeman, Bas Teusink</p>

Growth rate is a near-universal selective pressure across microbial species. High growth rates require hundreds of metabolic enzymes, each with different nonlinear kinetics, to be precisely tuned within the bounds set by physicochemical constraints. Yet, the metabolic behaviour of many species is characterized by simple relations between growth rate, enzyme expression levels and metabolic rates. We asked if this simplicity could be the outcome of optimisation by evolution. Indeed, when the growth rate is maximized—in a static environment under mass-conservation and enzyme expression constraints—we prove mathematically that the resulting optimal metabolic flux distribution is described by a limited number of subnetworks, known as Elementary Flux Modes (EFMs). We show that, because EFMs are the minimal subnetworks leading to growth, a small active number automatically leads to the simple relations that are measured. We find that the maximal number of flux-carrying EFMs is determined only by the number of imposed constraints on enzyme expression, not by the size, kinetics or topology of the network. This minimal-EFM extremum principle is illustrated in a graphical framework, which explains qualitative changes in microbial behaviours, such as overflow metabolism and co-consumption, and provides a method for identification of the enzyme expression constraints that limit growth under the prevalent conditions. The extremum principle applies to all microorganisms that are selected for maximal growth rates under protein concentration constraints, for example the solvent capacities of cytosol, membrane or periplasmic space.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/DEY-lhs5fHw" width="1" />

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/6oinXWRforY/article">Myopic control of neural dynamics</a></h4>

<p>by David Hocker, Il Memming Park</p>

Manipulating the dynamics of neural systems through targeted stimulation is a frontier of research and clinical neuroscience; however, the control schemes considered for neural systems are mismatched for the unique needs of manipulating neural dynamics. An appropriate control method should respect the variability in neural systems, incorporating moment to moment “input” to the neural dynamics and behaving based on the current neural state, irrespective of the past trajectory. We propose such a controller under a nonlinear state-space feedback framework that steers one dynamical system to function as through it were another dynamical system entirely. This “myopic” controller is formulated through a novel variant of a model reference control cost that manipulates dynamics in a short-sighted manner that only sets a target trajectory of a single time step into the future (hence its myopic nature), which omits the need to pre-calculate a rigid and computationally costly neural feedback control solution. To demonstrate the breadth of this control’s utility, two examples with distinctly different applications in neuroscience are studied. First, we show the myopic control’s utility to probe the causal link between dynamics and behavior for cognitive processes by transforming a winner-take-all decision-making system to operate as a robust neural integrator of evidence. Second, an unhealthy motor-like system containing an unwanted beta-oscillation spiral attractor is controlled to function as a healthy motor system, a relevant clinical example for neurological disorders.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6oinXWRforY" width="1" />

<p>by Margaret P. Chapman, Tyler Risom, Anil J. Aswani, Ellen M. Langer, Rosalie C. Sears, Claire J. Tomlin</p>

Drug resistance in breast cancer cell populations has been shown to arise through phenotypic transition of cancer cells to a drug-tolerant state, for example through epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition or transition to a cancer stem cell state. However, many breast tumors are a heterogeneous mixture of cell types with numerous epigenetic states in addition to stem-like and mesenchymal phenotypes, and the dynamic behavior of this heterogeneous mixture in response to drug treatment is not well-understood. Recently, we showed that plasticity between differentiation states, as identified with intracellular markers such as cytokeratins, is linked to resistance to specific targeted therapeutics. Understanding the dynamics of differentiation-state transitions in this context could facilitate the development of more effective treatments for cancers that exhibit phenotypic heterogeneity and plasticity. In this work, we develop computational models of a drug-treated, phenotypically heterogeneous triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell line to elucidate the feasibility of differentiation-state transition as a mechanism for therapeutic escape in this tumor subtype. Specifically, we use modeling to predict the changes in differentiation-state transitions that underlie specific therapy-induced changes in differentiation-state marker expression that we recently observed in the HCC1143 cell line. We report several statistically significant therapy-induced changes in transition rates between basal, luminal, mesenchymal, and non-basal/non-luminal/non-mesenchymal differentiation states in HCC1143 cell populations. Moreover, we validate model predictions on cell division and cell death empirically, and we test our models on an independent data set. Overall, we demonstrate that changes in differentiation-state transition rates induced by targeted therapy can provoke distinct differentiation-state aggregations of drug-resistant cells, which may be fundamental to the design of improved therapeutic regimens for cancers with phenotypic heterogeneity.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/DT3PsYmnYd0" width="1" />

<p>by Bernardo P. de Almeida, André F. Vieira, Joana Paredes, Mónica Bettencourt-Dias, Nuno L. Barbosa-Morais</p>

Centrosome amplification (CA) is a common feature of human tumours and a promising target for cancer therapy. However, CA’s pan-cancer prevalence, molecular role in tumourigenesis and therapeutic value in the clinical setting are still largely unexplored. Here, we used a transcriptomic signature (CA20) to characterise the landscape of CA-associated gene expression in 9,721 tumours from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). CA20 is upregulated in cancer and associated with distinct clinical and molecular features of breast cancer, consistently with our experimental CA quantification in patient samples. Moreover, we show that CA20 upregulation is positively associated with genomic instability, alteration of specific chromosomal arms and C&gt;T mutations, and we propose novel molecular players associated with CA in cancer. Finally, high CA20 is associated with poor prognosis and, by integrating drug sensitivity with drug perturbation profiles in cell lines, we identify candidate compounds for selectively targeting cancer cells exhibiting transcriptomic evidence for CA.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-C_Yq4jH6sA" width="1" />

<p>by Rodoniki Athanasiadou, Benjamin Neymotin, Nathan Brandt, Wei Wang, Lionel Christiaen, David Gresham, Daniel Tranchina</p>

A fundamental assumption, common to the vast majority of high-throughput transcriptome analyses, is that the expression of most genes is unchanged among samples and that total cellular RNA remains constant. As the number of analyzed experimental systems increases however, different independent studies demonstrate that this assumption is often violated. We present a calibration method using RNA spike-ins that allows for the measurement of absolute cellular abundance of RNA molecules. We apply the method to pooled RNA from cell populations of known sizes. For each transcript, we compute a nominal abundance that can be converted to absolute by dividing by a scale factor determined in separate experiments: the yield coefficient of the transcript relative to that of a reference spike-in measured with the same protocol. The method is derived by maximum likelihood theory in the context is a complete statistical model for sequencing counts contributed by cellular RNA and spike-ins. The counts are based on a sample from a fixed number of cells to which a fixed population of spike-in molecules has been added. We illustrate and evaluate the method with applications to two global expression data sets, one from the model eukaryote <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, proliferating at different growth rates, and differentiating cardiopharyngeal cell lineages in the chordate <i>Ciona robusta</i>. We tested the method in a technical replicate dilution study, and in a <i>k</i>-fold validation study.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/tQHAuYv6IDY" width="1" />

<p>Disease‐associated proteins are thought to propagate along neuronal processes in neurodegenerative diseases. To detect disease‐associated prion protein (PrP<sup>Sc</sup>) in the vagus nerve in different forms and molecular subtypes of Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (CJD), we applied 3 different anti‐PrP antibodies. We screened the vagus nerve in 162 sporadic and 30 genetic CJD cases. Four of 31 VV‐2 type sporadic CJD and 7 of 30 genetic CJD cases showed vagal PrP<sup>Sc</sup> immunodeposits with distinct morphology. Thus, PrP<sup>Sc</sup> in CJD affects the vagus nerve analogously to α‐synuclein in Parkinson disease. The morphologically diverse deposition of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> in genetic and sporadic CJD argues against uniform mechanisms of propagation of PrP<sup>Sc</sup>. Ann Neurol, 2019</p>

<p>During the 1990s, we estimated the genetic contribution to Parkinson's disease risk in a large, population‐based twin registry. Because many unaffected twins were still alive, previous concordance estimates were based on incomplete information. Ninety‐five percent of twins are now deceased. Here, we update concordance and heritability through 2015 using National Death Index data. In total, we identified 30 concordant and 193 discordant pairs. Proband‐wise concordance was 0.20 in monozygotic and 0.13 in dizygotic pairs. Heritability was 0.27 overall, 0.83 in pairs diagnosed ≤50, and 0.19 in pairs diagnosed &gt;50. High concordance in dizygotic twins suggests shared effects of early childhood environment. Ann Neurol, 2019</p>

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25440?af=R">Homocysteine and small vessel stroke: A mendelian randomization analysis</a></h4>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Trials of B vitamin therapy to lower blood total homocysteine (tHcy) levels for prevention of stroke are inconclusive. Secondary analyses of trial data and epidemiological studies suggest that tHcy levels may be particularly associated with small vessel stroke (SVS). We assessed whether circulating tHcy and B vitamin levels are selectively associated with SVS, but not other stroke subtypes, using Mendelian randomization.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used summary statistics data for single‐nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with tHcy (n = 18), folate (n = 3), vitamin B<sub>6</sub> (n = 1), and vitamin B<sub>12</sub> (n = 14) levels, and the corresponding data for stroke from the MEGASTROKE consortium (n = 16,952 subtyped ischemic stroke cases and 404,630 noncases).</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Genetically predicted tHcy was associated with SVS, with an odds ratio of 1.34 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.13–1.58; <i>p</i> = 6.7 × 10<sup>–4</sup>) per 1 standard deviation (SD) increase in genetically predicted tHcy levels, but was not associated with large artery or cardioembolic stroke. The association was mainly driven by SNPs at or near the <i>MTHFR</i> and <i>MUT</i> genes. The odds ratios of SVS per 1 SD increase in genetically predicted folate and vitamin B<sub>6</sub> levels were 0.49 (95% CI, 0.34–0.71; <i>p</i> = 1.3 × 10<sup>–4</sup>) and 0.70 (95% CI, 0.52–0.94; <i>p</i> = 0.02), respectively. Genetically higher vitamin B<sub>12</sub> levels were not associated with any stroke subtype.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These findings suggest that any effect of homocysteine‐lowering treatment in preventing stroke will be confined to the SVS subtype. Whether genetic variants at or near the <i>MTHFR</i> and <i>MUT</i> genes influence SVS risk through pathways other than homocysteine levels and downstream effects require further investigation.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.03418">The meta-problem and the transfer of knowledge between theories of consciousness: a software engineer's take. (arXiv:1903.03418v1 [q-bio.NC])</a></h4>

<p>This contribution examines two radically different explanations of our
phenomenal intuitions, one reductive and one strongly non-reductive, and
identifies two germane ideas that could benefit many other theories of
consciousness. Firstly, the ability of sophisticated agent architectures with a
purely physical implementation to support certain functional forms of qualia or
proto-qualia appears to entail the possibility of machine consciousness with
qualia, not only for reductive theories but also for the nonreductive ones that
regard consciousness as ubiquitous in Nature. Secondly, analysis of
introspective psychological material seems to hint that, under the threshold of
our ordinary waking awareness, there exist further 'submerged' or 'subliminal'
layers of consciousness which constitute a hidden foundation and support and
another source of our phenomenal intuitions. These 'submerged' layers might
help explain certain puzzling phenomena concerning subliminal perception, such
as the apparently 'unconscious' multisensory integration and learning of
subliminal stimuli.

<p>Automatic epileptic seizure analysis is important because the differentiation
of neural patterns among different patients can be used to classify people with
specific types of epilepsy. This could enable more efficient management of the
disease. Automatic seizure type classification using clinical
electroencephalograms (EEGs) is challenging due to factors such as low signal
to noise ratios, signal artefacts, high variance in the seizure semiology among
individual epileptic patients, and limited clinical data constraints. To
overcome these challenges, in this paper, we present a deep learning based
framework which uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with dense
connections and learns highly robust features at different spatial and temporal
resolutions of the EEG data spectrum for accurate cross-patient seizure type
classification. We evaluate our framework for seizure type classification and
seizure detection on the recently released TUH EEG Seizure Corpus, where our
framework achieves overall weighted f 1 scores of up to 0.90 and 0.88, thereby
setting new benchmarks on the dataset.

Rhythmical brain activity around 5Hz can be observed in the prefrontal cortex under conditions requiring high levels of cognitive control. However, its temporal dynamics are still elusive. A recent research paper (Cooper et al. Neuroimage 2019;189:130–140) provides evidence that the temporal evolution of this frontal-midline theta activity reflects the style of cognitive control being implemented.

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Degenerative cerebellar ataxias (DCAs) affect up to 1 in 5,000 people worldwide, leading to incoordination, tremor, and falls. Loss of Purkinje cells, nearly universal across DCAs, dysregulates the dentatothalamocortical network. To address the paucity of treatment strategies, we developed an electrical stimulation‐based therapy for DCAs targeting the dorsal dentate nucleus.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We tested this therapeutic strategy in the Wistar Furth <i>shaker</i> rat model of Purkinje cell loss resulting in tremor and ataxia. We implanted <i>shaker</i> rats with stimulating electrodes targeted to the dorsal dentate nucleus and tested a spectrum of frequencies ranging from 4 to 180 Hz.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Stimulation at 30 Hz most effectively reduced motor symptoms. Stimulation frequencies over 100 Hz, commonly used for Parkinsonism and essential tremor, worsened incoordination, while frequencies within the tremor physiologic range may worsen tremor.</p>


<h2>Interpretations</h2>
<p>Low‐frequency deep cerebellar stimulation may provide a novel strategy for treating motor symptoms of degenerative cerebellar ataxias.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To measure <i>postmortem</i> burden of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) with TDP‐43 (FTLD‐TDP) or tau (FTLD‐Tau) proteinopathy across hemispheres in primary progressive aphasia (PPA) using digital histopathology, and identify clinicopathological correlates of these distinct proteinopathies.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In an autopsy cohort of PPA (FTLD‐TDP=13, FTLD‐Tau=14), we analyzed laterality and regional distribution of <i>postmortem</i> pathology, quantified using a validated digital histopathological approach, in available brain tissue from up to eight cortical regions bilaterally. We related digital pathology to <i>antemortem</i> structural neuroimaging and specific clinical language features.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p><i>Postmortem</i> cortical pathology was left‐lateralized in both FTLD‐TDP (beta=‐0.15,SE=0.05,p=0.007) and FTLD‐Tau (beta=‐0.09,SE=0.04,p=0.015), but the degree of lateralization decreased with greater overall dementia severity before death (beta=‐8.18,SE=3.22,p=0.015). Among five core pathology regions sampled, we found greatest pathology in left orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) in FTLD‐TDP, which was greater than in FTLD‐Tau (F=47.07,df=1,17,p&lt;0.001), and in left mid‐frontal cortex (MFC) in FTLD‐Tau, which was greater than in FTLD‐TDP (F=19.34,df=1,16,p&lt;0.001). <i>Postmortem</i> pathology was inversely associated with <i>antemortem</i> MRI cortical thickness (beta=‐0.04,SE=0.01,p=0.007) in regions matching autopsy sampling. Irrespective of PPA syndromic variant, single‐word comprehension impairment was associated with greater left OFC pathology (t=‐3.72,df=10.72,p=0.004), while nonfluent speech with greater left MFC pathology (t=‐3.62,df=12.00,p=0.004) among the five core pathology regions.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In PPA, FTLD‐TDP and FTLD‐Tau have divergent anatomic distributions of left‐lateralized <i>postmortem</i> pathology that relate to <i>antemortem</i> structural imaging and distinct language deficits. While other brain regions may be implicated in neural networks supporting these complex language measures, our observations may eventually help to improve <i>antemortem</i> diagnosis of neuropathology in PPA.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Rates of worsening and evolution to secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (MS) may be substantially lower in actively treated patients compared to natural history studies from the pre‐treatment era. Nonetheless, in our recently reported prospective cohort more than half of patients with relapsing MS accumulated significant new disability by the 10<sup>th</sup> year of follow‐up. Notably, “no evidence of disease activity” at 2‐years did not predict long‐term stability. Here, we determined to what extent clinical relapses and radiographic evidence of disease activity contribute to long‐term disability accumulation.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Disability progression was defined as an increase in Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) of 1.5, 1.0 or 0.5 (or greater) from baseline EDSS = 0; 1.0‐5.0; and 5.5 or higher, respectively, assessed from baseline to year 5 (± 1 year) and sustained to year 10 (± 1 year). Longitudinal analysis of relative brain volume loss used a linear mixed model with sex, age, disease duration, and <i>HLA‐DRB1*15:01</i> as covariates.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Relapses were associated with a transient increase in disability over one‐year intervals (<i>p</i> = 0.012) but not with confirmed disability progression (<i>p</i> = 0.551). Relative brain volume declined at a greater rate among individuals with disability progression compared to those who remained stable (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Long term worsening is common in relapsing MS patients, is independent of relapse activity, and is associated with accelerated brain atrophy. We propose the term <i>silent progression</i> to describe the insidious disability that accrues in many patients who satisfy traditional criteria for relapsing remitting MS.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To determine the optimal thresholds for inter‐eye differences in retinal nerve fiber and ganglion cell+inner plexiform layer thicknesses for identifying unilateral optic nerve lesions in multiple sclerosis.</p>


<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Current international diagnostic criteria for multiple sclerosis do not include the optic nerve as a lesion site despite frequent involvement. Optical coherence tomography detects retinal thinning associated with optic nerve lesions.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In this multi‐center international study at 11 sites, optical coherence tomography was measured for patients and healthy controls as part of the International Multiple Sclerosis Visual System Consortium. High‐ and low‐contrast acuity were also collected in a subset of participants. Presence of an optic nerve lesion for this study was defined as history of acute unilateral optic neuritis.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Among patients (n=1,530), receiver operating characteristic curve analysis demonstrated an optimal peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer inter‐eye difference threshold of 5 microns and ganglion cell+inner plexiform layer threshold of 4 microns for identifying unilateral optic neuritis (n=477). Greater inter‐eye differences in acuities were associated with greater inter‐eye retinal layer thickness differences (<i>p</i>≤0.001).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Inter‐eye differences of 5 microns for retinal nerve fiber layer and 4 microns for macular ganglion cell+inner plexiform layer are robust thresholds for identifying unilateral optic nerve lesions. These thresholds may be useful to establish the presence of asymptomatic and symptomatic optic nerve lesions in multiple sclerosis and could be useful in a new version of the diagnostic criteria. Our findings lend further validation for utilizing the visual system in a multiple sclerosis clinical trial setting.</p>

Multi-scale computational modeling is a major branch of computational biology as evidenced by the US federal interagency Multi-Scale Modeling Consortium and major international projects. It invariably involves specific and detailed sequences of data analysis and simulation, often with multiple tools and datasets, and the community recognizes improved modularity, reuse, reproducibility, portability and scalability as critical unmet needs in this area. Scientific workflows are a well-recognized strategy for addressing these needs in scientific computing. While there are good examples if the use of scientific workflows in bioinformatics, medical informatics, biomedical imaging and data analysis, there are fewer examples in multi-scale computational modeling in general and cardiac electrophysiology in particular. Cardiac electrophysiology simulation is a mature area of multi-scale computational biology that serves as an excellent use case for developing and testing new scientific workflows. In this article, we develop, describe and test a computational workflow that serves as a proof of concept of a platform for the robust integration and implementation of a reusable and reproducible multi-scale cardiac cell and tissue model that is expandable, modular and portable. The workflow described leverages Python and Kepler-Python actor for plotting and pre/post-processing. During all stages of the workflow design, we rely on freely available open-source tools, to make our workflow freely usable by scientists.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/iVBpJTia4EY" width="1" />

The ultimate goal of metabolic engineering is to produce desired compounds on an industrial scale in a cost effective manner. To address challenges in metabolic engineering, computational strain optimization algorithms based on genome-scale metabolic models have increasingly been used to aid in overproducing products of interest. However, most of these strain optimization algorithms utilize a metabolic network alone, with few approaches providing strategies that also include transcriptional regulation. Moreover previous integrated approaches generally require a pre-existing regulatory network. In this study, we developed a novel strain design algorithm, named OptRAM (Optimization of Regulatory And Metabolic Networks), which can identify combinatorial optimization strategies including overexpression, knockdown or knockout of both metabolic genes and transcription factors. OptRAM is based on our previous IDREAM integrated network framework, which makes it able to deduce a regulatory network from data. OptRAM uses simulated annealing with a novel objective function, which can ensure a favorable coupling between desired chemical and cell growth. The other advance we propose is a systematic evaluation metric of multiple solutions, by considering the essential genes, flux variation, and engineering manipulation cost. We applied OptRAM to generate strain designs for succinate, 2,3-butanediol, and ethanol overproduction in yeast, which predicted high minimum predicted target production rate compared with other methods and previous literature values. Moreover, most of the genes and TFs proposed to be altered by OptRAM in these scenarios have been validated by modification of the exact genes or the target genes regulated by the TFs, for overproduction of these desired compounds by <i>in vivo</i> experiments cataloged in the LASER database. Particularly, we successfully validated the predicted strain optimization strategy for ethanol production by fermentation experiment. In conclusion, OptRAM can provide a useful approach that leverages an integrated transcriptional regulatory network and metabolic network to guide metabolic engineering applications.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/qYemLAl00uo" width="1" />

<p>by Andrea Avena-Koenigsberger, Xiaoran Yan, Artemy Kolchinsky, Martijn van den Heuvel, Patric Hagmann, Olaf Sporns</p>

Communication of signals among nodes in a complex network poses fundamental problems of efficiency and cost. Routing of messages along shortest paths requires global information about the topology, while spreading by diffusion, which operates according to local topological features, is informationally “cheap” but inefficient. We introduce a stochastic model for network communication that combines local and global information about the network topology to generate biased random walks on the network. The model generates a continuous spectrum of dynamics that converge onto shortest-path and random-walk (diffusion) communication processes at the limiting extremes. We implement the model on two cohorts of human connectome networks and investigate the effects of varying the global information bias on the network’s communication cost. We identify routing strategies that approach a (highly efficient) shortest-path communication process with a relatively small global information bias on the system’s dynamics. Moreover, we show that the cost of routing messages from and to hub nodes varies as a function of the global information bias driving the system’s dynamics. Finally, we implement the model to identify individual subject differences from a communication dynamics point of view. The present framework departs from the classical shortest paths vs. diffusion dichotomy, unifying both models under a single family of dynamical processes that differ by the extent to which global information about the network topology influences the routing patterns of neural signals traversing the network.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Ow07hxgdlFY" width="1" />

Management of vector population is a commonly used method for mitigating transmission of mosquito-borne infections, but quantitative information on its practical public health impact is scarce. We study the effectiveness of Ultra-Low Volume (ULV) insecticide spraying in public spaces for preventing secondary dengue virus (DENV) cases in Porto Alegre, a non-endemic metropolitan area in Brazil. We developed a stochastic transmission model based on detailed entomological, epidemiological and population data, accounting for the geographical distribution of mosquitoes and humans in the study area and spatial transmission dynamics. The model was calibrated against the distribution of DENV cluster sizes previously estimated from the same geographical setting. We estimated a ULV-induced mortality of 40% for mosquitoes and found that the implemented control protocol avoided about 24% of symptomatic cases occurred in the area throughout the 2015–2016 epidemic season. Increasing the radius of treatment or the mortality of mosquitoes by treating gardens and/or indoor premises would greatly improve the result of control, but trade-offs with respect to increased efforts need to be carefully analyzed. We found a moderate effectiveness for ULV-spraying in public areas, mainly due to the limited ability of this strategy in effectively controlling the vector population. These results can be used to support the design of control strategies in low-incidence, non-endemic settings.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/CKNKwFuw4ko" width="1" />

<p>by Lilith K. Whittles, Peter J. White, Xavier Didelot</p>

Human networks of sexual contacts are dynamic by nature, with partnerships forming and breaking continuously over time. Sexual behaviours are also highly heterogeneous, so that the number of partners reported by individuals over a given period of time is typically distributed as a power-law. Both the dynamism and heterogeneity of sexual partnerships are likely to have an effect in the patterns of spread of sexually transmitted diseases. To represent these two fundamental properties of sexual networks, we developed a stochastic process of dynamic partnership formation and dissolution, which results in power-law numbers of partners over time. Model parameters can be set to produce realistic conditions in terms of the exponent of the power-law distribution, of the number of individuals without relationships and of the average duration of relationships. Using an outbreak of antibiotic resistant gonorrhoea amongst men have sex with men as a case study, we show that our realistic dynamic network exhibits different properties compared to the frequently used static networks or homogeneous mixing models. We also consider an approximation to our dynamic network model in terms of a much simpler branching process. We estimate the parameters of the generation time distribution and offspring distribution which can be used for example in the context of outbreak reconstruction based on genomic data. Finally, we investigate the impact of a range of interventions against gonorrhoea, including increased condom use, more frequent screening and immunisation, concluding that the latter shows great promise to reduce the burden of gonorrhoea, even if the vaccine was only partially effective or applied to only a random subset of the population.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/GeqSrTgTJqU" width="1" />

<p>by Agustin Lage-Castellanos, Giancarlo Valente, Elia Formisano, Federico De Martino</p>

Computational neuroimaging methods aim to predict brain responses (measured e.g. with functional magnetic resonance imaging [fMRI]) on the basis of stimulus features obtained through computational models. The accuracy of such prediction is used as an indicator of how well the model describes the computations underlying the brain function that is being considered. However, the prediction accuracy is bounded by the proportion of the variance of the brain response which is related to the measurement noise and not to the stimuli (or cognitive functions). This bound to the performance of a computational model has been referred to as the noise ceiling. In previous fMRI applications two methods have been proposed to estimate the noise ceiling based on either a split-half procedure or Monte Carlo simulations. These methods make different assumptions over the nature of the effects underlying the data, and, importantly, their relation has not been clarified yet. Here, we derive an analytical form for the noise ceiling that does not require computationally expensive simulations or a splitting procedure that reduce the amount of data. The validity of this analytical definition is proved in simulations, we show that the analytical solution results in the same estimate of the noise ceiling as the Monte Carlo method. Considering different simulated noise structure, we evaluate different estimators of the variance of the responses and their impact on the estimation of the noise ceiling. We furthermore evaluate the effect the interplay between regularization (often used to estimate model fits to the data when the number of computational features in the model is large) and model complexity on the performance with respect to the noise ceiling. Our results indicate that when considering the variance of the responses across runs, the computing the noise ceiling analytically results in similar estimates as the split half estimator and approaches the true noise ceiling under a variety of simulated noise scenarios. Finally, the methods are tested on real fMRI data acquired at 7 Tesla.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/EvcjzeEKdD4" width="1" />

<p>by Paul Van Liedekerke, Johannes Neitsch, Tim Johann, Kevin Alessandri, Pierre Nassoy, Dirk Drasdo</p>

Model simulations indicate that the response of growing cell populations on mechanical stress follows the same functional relationship and is predictable over different cell lines and growth conditions despite the response curves look largely different. We develop a hybrid model strategy in which cells are represented by coarse-grained individual units calibrated with a high resolution cell model and parameterized measurable biophysical and cell-biological parameters. Cell cycle progression in our model is controlled by volumetric strain, the latter being derived from a bio-mechanical relation between applied pressure and cell compressibility. After parameter calibration from experiments with mouse colon carcinoma cells growing against the resistance of an elastic alginate capsule, the model adequately predicts the growth curve in i) soft and rigid capsules, ii) in different experimental conditions where the mechanical stress is generated by osmosis via a high molecular weight dextran solution, and iii) for other cell types with different growth kinetics. Our model simulation results suggest that the growth response of cell population upon externally applied mechanical stress is the same, as it can be quantitatively predicted using the same growth progression function.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/IDBZAvqfb9o" width="1" />

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/ocIV_rplJgY/article">How adaptive plasticity evolves when selected against</a></h4>

<p>by Alfredo Rago, Kostas Kouvaris, Tobias Uller, Richard Watson</p>

Adaptive plasticity allows organisms to cope with environmental change, thereby increasing the population’s long-term fitness. However, individual selection can only compare the fitness of individuals within each generation: if the environment changes more slowly than the generation time (i.e., a coarse-grained environment) a population will not experience selection for plasticity even if it is adaptive in the long-term. How does adaptive plasticity then evolve? One explanation is that, if competing alleles conferring different degrees of plasticity persist across multiple environments, natural selection between genetic lineages could select for adaptive plasticity (lineage selection). We show that adaptive plasticity can evolve even in the absence of such lineage selection. Instead, we propose that adaptive plasticity in coarse-grained environments evolves as a by-product of inefficient short-term natural selection: populations that rapidly evolve their phenotypes in response to selective pressures follow short-term optima, with the result that they have reduced long-term fitness across environments. Conversely, populations that accumulate limited genetic change within each environment evolve long-term adaptive plasticity even when plasticity incurs short-term costs. These results remain qualitatively similar regardless of whether we decrease the efficiency of natural selection by increasing the rate of environmental change or decreasing mutation rate, demonstrating that both factors act via the same mechanism. We demonstrate how this mechanism can be understood through the concept of learning rate. Our work shows how plastic responses that are costly in the short term, yet adaptive in the long term, can evolve as a by-product of inefficient short-term selection, without selection for plasticity at either the individual or lineage level.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ocIV_rplJgY" width="1" />

Abstract
<p>CRISPR-based technology has provided new avenues to interrogate gene function, but difficulties in transgene expression in post-mitotic neurons has delayed incorporation of these tools in the central nervous system (CNS). Here, we demonstrate a highly efficient, neuron-optimized dual lentiviral CRISPR-based transcriptional activation (CRISPRa) system capable of robust, modular, and tunable gene induction and multiplexed gene regulation across several primary rodent neuron culture systems. CRISPRa targeting unique promoters in the complex multi-transcript gene brain-derived neurotrophic factor (<i>Bdnf</i>) revealed both transcript- and genome-level selectivity of this approach, in addition to highlighting downstream transcriptional and physiological consequences of <i>Bdnf</i> regulation. Finally, we illustrate that CRISPRa is highly efficient <i>in vivo</i>, resulting in increased protein levels of a target gene in diverse brain structures. Taken together, these results demonstrate that CRISPRa is an efficient and selective method to study gene expression programs in brain health and disease.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25439?af=R">Functional deficiency in endogenous interleukin‐1 receptor antagonist in patients with febrile infection‐related epilepsy syndrome</a></h4>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We recently reported successful treatment of a child with febrile infection‐related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES), a subtype of new onset refractory status epilepticus, with the recombinant interleukin‐1 (IL1) receptor antagonist (IL1RA) anakinra. On this basis, we tested whether endogenous IL1RA production or function is deficient in FIRES patients.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Levels of IL1β and IL1RA were measured in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The inhibitory activity of endogenous IL1RA was assessed using a cell‐based reporter assay. <i>IL1RN</i> gene variants were identified by sequencing. Expression levels for the secreted and intracellular isoforms of IL1RA were measured in patient and control cells by real‐time polymerase chain reaction.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Levels of endogenous IL1RA and IL1β were elevated in the serum and CSF of patients with FIRES (n = 7) relative to healthy controls (n = 10). Serum from FIRES patients drove IL1R signaling activity and potentiated IL1R signaling in response to exogenous IL1β in a cell‐based reporter assay. Functional assessment of endogenous IL1RA activity in 3 FIRES patients revealed attenuated inhibition of IL1R signaling. Sequencing of <i>IL1RN</i> in our index patient revealed multiple variants. This was accompanied by reduced expression of intracellular but not secreted isoforms of IL1RA in the patient's peripheral blood mononuclear cells.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings suggest that FIRES is associated with reduced expression of intracellular IL1RA isoforms and a functional deficiency in IL1RA inhibitory activity. These observations may provide insight into disease pathogenesis for FIRES and other inflammatory seizure disorders and may provide a valuable biomarker for therapeutic decision‐making.

<p>As put forward by neuroscientists, the mechanisms of consciousness can be
elucidated by revealing correlations between neural dynamics and specific
conscious percepts. Recently, I have elaborated on the mathematical formulation
for a system of processes that are mutually connected to be isomorphic to a
conscious percept of a point in space. Importantly, in such a system, any
process can be derived through all other processes that form its complement, or
interpretation. To generate such a solution, I am proposing a dynamical system
of oscillators coupled in a manner to preserve the properties of a percept.
Specifically, I crafted a dynamical system that retains the mutual
relationships among processes, forming an operational map isomorphic to a
distance matrix that mimics a percept of space-like properties. The study and
results pave a novel way to analyze the dynamics of neural-like (oscillatory)
processes with a purpose of extracting the information relevant to specific
conscious percepts, which will facilitate the search for neural correlates of
consciousness.

<p>The olfactory system uses the responses of a small number of broadly
sensitive receptors to combinatorially encode a vast number of odors. Here, we
propose a method for decoding such a distributed representation. Our main idea
is that a receptor that does not respond to an odor carries more information
than a receptor that does, because a typical receptor binds to many odorants.
So a response below threshold signals the absence of all such odorants. As a
result, it is easier to identify what the odor is not, rather than what the
odor is. We demonstrate that, for biologically realistic numbers of receptors,
response functions, and odor mixture complexity, this remarkably simple method
of elimination turns an underdetermined decoding problem into an overdetermined
one, allowing accurate determination of the odorants in a mixture and their
concentrations. We give a simple neural network realization of our algorithm
which resembles the known circuit architecture of the piriform cortex.

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To elucidate the biophysical basis underlying the distinct and severe clinical presentation in patients with the recurrent missense <i>SCN1A</i> variant, p.Thr226Met. Patients with this variant show a well‐defined genotype–phenotype correlation and present with developmental and early infantile epileptic encephalopathy that is far more severe than typical <i>SCN1A</i> Dravet syndrome.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Whole cell patch clamp and dynamic action potential clamp were used to study T226M Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 channels expressed in mammalian cells. Computational modeling was used to explore the neuronal scale mechanisms that account for altered action potential firing.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>T226M channels exhibited hyperpolarizing shifts of the activation and inactivation curves and enhanced fast inactivation. Dynamic action potential clamp hybrid simulation showed that model neurons containing T226M conductance displayed a left shift in rheobase relative to control. At current stimulation levels that produced repetitive action potential firing in control model neurons, depolarization block and cessation of action potential firing occurred in T226M model neurons. Fully computationally simulated neuron models recapitulated the findings from dynamic action potential clamp and showed that heterozygous T226M models were also more susceptible to depolarization block.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>From a biophysical perspective, the T226M mutation produces gain of function. Somewhat paradoxically, our data suggest that this gain of function would cause interneurons to more readily develop depolarization block. This “functional dominant negative” interaction would produce a more profound disinhibition than seen with haploinsufficiency that is typical of Dravet syndrome and could readily explain the more severe phenotype of patients with T226M mutation.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Accumulating evidence corroborates the role of the “central vein sign” in the radiological diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS). Here, we report human MRI‐pathological data that inflammation‐dependent intracerebral remodeling of the vessel wall is directly associated with the prominence of intralesional veins on susceptibility‐based MRI. In adult marmosets with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), vessel‐wall fibrosis was detected early in the demyelinating process, even in lesions less than two weeks old, though fibrosis was more evident after 6 weeks. Vascular remodeling consisted of both luminal enlargement and eccentric thickening of the perivascular space (fibrillar collagen type I deposition) and affected almost exclusively white matter, but not subpial cortical, lesions. The long‐term effect of vessel remodeling in MS lesions is currently unknown, but it might potentially affect tissue repair.</p>

Abstract<p>The median preoptic nucleus (MnPO) is a putative integrative region that contributes to body fluid balance. Activation of the MnPO can influence thirst but it is not clear how these responses are linked to body fluid homeostasis. We used Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs) to determine the role of the MnPO in drinking behavior and vasopressin release in response to peripheral angiotensin II (ANG II) or 3% hypertonic saline in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (250-300g). Rats were anesthetized with isoflurane and stereotaxically injected with an inhibitory DREADD (rAAV5-CaMKIIa-hM4D(G<sub>i</sub>)-mCherry) or control (rAAV5-CaMKIIa-mCherry) virus in the MnPO. After 2 weeks’ recovery, a subset of rats were used for extracellular recordings to verify functional effects of ANG II or hyperosmotic challenges in MnPO slice preparations. Remaining rats were used in drinking behavior studies. Each rat was administered either 10mg/kg of exogenous clozapine-N-oxide (CNO) to inhibit DREADD-expressing cells or vehicle ip followed by a test treatment with either 2mg/kg ANG II or 3% hypertonic saline (1mL/100g bw) sc, twice per week for two separate treatment weeks. CNO-induced inhibition during either test treatment significantly attenuated drinking responses compared to vehicle treatments and controls. Brain tissue processed for cFos immunohistochemistry showed decreased expression with CNO-induced inhibition during either test treatment in the MnPO and downstream nuclei compared to controls. CNO-mediated inhibition significantly attenuated treatment-induced increases in plasma vasopressin compared to controls. The results indicate inhibition of CaMKIIa-expressing MnPO neurons significantly reduces drinking and vasopressin release in response to ANG II or hyperosmotic challenge.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> The MnPO is an important regulatory center that influences thirst, cardiovascular and neuroendocrine function. Activation of different MnPO neuronal populations can inhibit or stimulate water intake. However, the role of the MnPO and its pathway-specific projections during ANG II and hyperosmotic challenges still have not yet been fully elucidated. These studies directly address this by using DREADDs to acutely and selectively inhibit pathway-specific MnPO neurons, and uses techniques that measure changes at the protein, neuronal, and overall physiological and behavioral level. More importantly, we have been able to demonstrate that physiological challenges related to extracellular (ANG II) or cellular (hypertonic saline) dehydration activate MnPO neurons that may project to different parts of the hypothalamus.</p>

Abstract<p>Fibroblast growth factor receptor and α-Klotho transduce fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23) signaling in renal tubules to maintain systemic phosphate/Vitamin D homeostasis. Mice deficient for either the ligand, FGF-23, or the co-receptor, Klotho, are phenocopies with both showing rapid and premature development of multiple aging-like abnormalities. Such similarity in phenotype, suggests that FGF-23 and Klotho have co-dependent systemic functions. Recent reports revealed inverse central nervous system effects of Klotho deficiency or Klotho overexpression on hippocampal synaptic, neurogenic, and cognitive functions. However, it is unknown whether FGF-23 deficiency effects function of the hippocampus. We report that, similar to Klotho-deficient mice, FGF-23-deficient mice develop dose-dependent, hippocampal-dependent cognitive impairment. However, FGF-23-deficient brains had no gross structural or developmental defects, no change in hippocampal synaptic plasticity, and only minor impairment to postnatal hippocampal neurogenesis. Together these data provide evidence that FGF-23 deficiency impairs hippocampal-dependent cognition but otherwise results in a brain phenotype that is distinct from the KL-deficient mouse.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Although FGF-23 is reportedly expressed by the brain, it has no known brain function. In the periphery, kidney transduction of FGF-23 signaling is required for proper phosphate, calcium and Vitamin D homeostasis. Recent reports show that Klotho, the obligate FGF-23 co-receptor, is required for multiple hippocampal activities. If Klotho-deficient brain effects are the result of disrupted FGF-23 signaling, similar phenotypes may occur under conditions of FGF-23 deficiency. Herein, studies were undertaken to determine whether FGF-23-deficient mice show impairment of the same hippocampal functions, as a first step toward investigating whether FGF-23 is the mechanism by which Klotho effects brain function. Our data show that FGF-23 is only required for normal hippocampal-dependent cognition suggesting that FGF-23 may effect the brain uniquely.</p>

Abstract<p>In the epileptic brain, phase amplitude cross frequency coupling (CFC) features have been used to objectively classify seizure-related states, and the inter-seizure state has been demonstrated as being random, in contrast to the seizure state being predictable; however, the excitatory and inhibitory networks underlying their dynamics remain unclear. Therefore, the objectives of this study are to classify the dynamics of seizure sub-states labeling seizure-like event (SLE) onset and termination intervals using CFC features and to obtain their underlying excitatory/inhibitory cellular correlates. SLEs were induced in mouse neocortical brain slices using a low-magnesium perfusate, and were recorded in layer II/III using simultaneous local field potential and whole cell voltage clamp electrodes. Classification of onset and termination of SLE transitions was investigated using CFC features in conjunction with an unsupervised 2-state hidden Markov model (HMM). Gamma distributions of their durations indicated that both are predictable. Furthermore, omitting 4Hz from the HMM classifier switched both SLE sub-states from statistically deterministic to random without changing the dynamics of the SLE state. These results were generalized to 4-AP induced SLEs and human seizure traces. Only during these sub-states, both excitatory and inhibitory currents coupled with the field. Where excitatory currents phase locked to a broad range of frequencies between 1 and 12Hz, inhibitory currents dominantly phase locked at 4Hz. We conclude that inhibition underlies the predictability of neocortical CFC-defined SLE transition sub-states.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> To date, the underlying excitatory and inhibitory bases of objectively identified seizure sub-states have not been determined. Here we identify these sub-states using phase amplitude cross frequency coupling features. This is tested in both human and rodent seizure models. Then, using simultaneous field and whole cell recordings in a mouse model, we investigate the potential for explaining seizure sub-state dynamics from interactions of the excitatory and inhibitory currents with local field network activity. We found that the frequency ranges at which these currents are coherent with field oscillations have a dramatic effect on the predictability of seizure state sub-states. Such information is critical for identifying the mechanisms underlying the dynamics of epileptic seizures.</p>

Abstract<p>Hilar mossy cells in the dentate gyrus (DG) shape the firing and function of the hippocampal circuit. However, the neural circuitry providing afferent input to mossy cells is incompletely understood, and little is known about the development of these inputs. Thus, we used whole-cell recording and laser scanning photostimulation (LSPS) to characterize the developmental trajectory of local excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs to mossy cells in the mouse hippocampus. Hilar mossy cells were targeted by visualizing non-red fluorescent cells in the dentate hilus of GAD2-Cre; Ai9 mice, which expressed tdTomato in GAD+ neurons, and were confirmed by post hoc morphological characterization. Our results show that at postnatal days 6-7 (P6-7), mossy cells received more excitatory input from neurons in the proximal CA3 versus those in the DG. In contrast, at P13-14 and P21-28, the largest source of excitatory input originated in DG cells, while the strength of CA3 and hilar inputs declined. A developmental trend was also evident for inhibitory inputs. Overall inhibitory input at P6-7 was weak, while inhibitory inputs from the DG cell layer and the hilus predominated at P13-14 and P21-28. The strength of local DG excitation and inhibition to mossy cells peaked at P13-14 and decreased slightly in older P21-28 mice. Together, these data provide new detailed information on the development of local synaptic connectivity of mossy cells, and suggests mechanisms through which developmental changes in local circuit inputs to hilar mossy cells shape their physiology and vulnerability to injury during postnatal periods.</p><p><b>Significance statement</b> Mossy cells of the dentate gyrus (DG) have been implicated in hippocampal circuits regulating pattern separation, an important function attributed to the DG. However, physiological inputs regulating mossy cell activity are incompletely understood. Here, we show that sources of both excitatory and inhibitory inputs arise developmentally. Our results suggest that excitatory inputs from the DG and local inhibitory inputs are well-positioned to powerfully sculpt receptive fields in mature mossy cells.</p>

Abstract<p>Currently, there are no effective treatments for glioma or for neurodegenerative diseases due, in part, to our limited understanding of the pathophysiology and cellular heterogeneity of these diseases. Mounting evidence suggests that astrocytes play an active role in the pathogenesis of these diseases by contributing to a diverse range of pathophysiological states. In a previous study, five molecularly distinct astrocyte subpopulations from three different brain regions were identified. To further delineate the underlying diversity of these populations, we obtained mouse brain region-specific gene signatures for both protein-coding and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) and found that these astrocyte subpopulations are endowed with unique molecular signatures across diverse brain regions. Additional gene set and single-sample enrichment analyses revealed that gene signatures of different subpopulations are differentially correlated with glioma tumors that harbor distinct genomic alterations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that links transcriptional profiles of astrocyte subpopulations with glioma genomic mutations. Furthermore, our results demonstrated that subpopulations of astrocytes in select brain regions are associated with specific neurodegenerative diseases. Overall, the present study provides a new perspective for understanding the pathophysiology of glioma and neurodegenerative diseases and highlights the potential contributions of diverse astrocyte populations to normal, malignant, and degenerative brain functions.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Mounting evidence suggests that astrocytes play an active role in disease pathogenesis by contributing to a diverse range of pathophysiological states.

Abstract<p>Creating three-dimensional (3D) representations of the world from two-dimensional retinal images is fundamental to visually guided behaviors including reaching and grasping. A critical component of this process is determining the 3D orientation of objects. Previous studies have shown that neurons in the caudal intraparietal area (CIP) of the macaque monkey represent 3D planar surface orientation (i.e., slant and tilt). Here we compare the responses of neurons in areas V3A (which is implicated in 3D visual processing and which precedes CIP in the visual hierarchy) and CIP to 3D oriented planar surfaces. We then examine whether activity in these areas correlates with perception during a fine slant discrimination task in which monkeys report if the top of a surface is slanted towards or away from them. Although we find that V3A and CIP neurons show similar sensitivity to planar surface orientation, significant choice-related activity during the slant discrimination task is rare in V3A but prominent in CIP. These results implicate both V3A and CIP in the representation of 3D surface orientation, and suggest a functional dissociation between the areas based on slant-related choice signals.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Surface orientation perception is fundamental to visually guided behaviors such as reaching, grasping, and navigation.

Here we show that responses to 3D oriented planar surfaces are similar in CIP and V3A, which precedes CIP in the cortical hierarchy. However, we also find a qualitative distinction between the two areas: only CIP neurons show robust choice-related activity during a fine visual orientation discrimination task.</p>

Abstract<p>The caudate-putamen is a striatal brain region essential for sensorimotor behaviors, habit learning, and other cognitive and premotor functions. The output and predominant neuron of the caudate-putamen is the medium spiny neuron (MSN). MSNs present discrete cellular subtypes that show differences in neurochemistry, dopamine receptor expression, efferent targets, gene expression, functional roles, and most importantly for this study, electrophysiological properties. MSN subtypes include the striatonigral and the striatopallidal groups. Most studies identify the striatopallidal MSN subtype as being more excitable than the striatonigral MSN subtype. However, there is some divergence between studies regarding the exact differences in electrophysiological properties. Furthermore, MSN subtype electrophysiological properties have not been reported disaggregated by biological sex. We addressed these questions using prepubertal male and female Drd1a-tdTomato line 6 BAC transgenic mice, an important transgenic line that has not yet received extensive electrophysiological analysis. We made acute caudate-putamen brain slices and assessed a robust battery of 16 relevant electrophysiological properties using whole-cell patch clamp recording, including intrinsic membrane, action potential, and miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (mEPSC) properties. We found that: (1) MSN subtypes exhibited multiple differential electrophysiological properties in both sexes, including rheobase, action potential threshold and width, input resistance in both the linear and rectified ranges, and mEPSC amplitude; (2) select electrophysiological properties showed interactions between MSN subtype and sex. These findings provide a comprehensive evaluation of mouse caudate-putamen MSN subtype electrophysiological properties across females and males, both confirming and extending previous studies.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> The findings presented here provide the most comprehensive evaluation of the electrophysiological properties of caudate-putamen medium spiny neuron (MSN) subtypes ever performed in a single study, both in terms of electrophysiological metrics and animal sex. These data selectively confirm, diverge from, and extend the findings of previous studies, providing a firm foundation upon which to pursue future studies of caudate-putamen MSNs.</p>

<p>Application of deep convolutional spiking neural networks (SNNs) to
artificial intelligence (AI) tasks has recently gained a lot of interest since
SNNs are hardware-friendly and energy-efficient. Unlike the non-spiking
counterparts, most of the existing SNN simulation frameworks are not
practically efficient enough for large-scale AI tasks. In this paper, we
introduce SpykeTorch, an open-source high-speed simulation framework based on
PyTorch. This framework simulates convolutional SNNs with at most one spike per
neuron and the rank-order encoding scheme. In terms of learning rules, both
spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) and reward-modulated STDP (R-STDP) are
implemented, but other rules could be implemented easily. Apart from the
aforementioned properties, SpykeTorch is highly generic and capable of
reproducing the results of various studies. Computations in the proposed
framework are tensor-based and totally done by PyTorch functions, which in turn
brings the ability of just-in-time optimization for running on CPUs, GPUs, or
Multi-GPU platforms.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>There is growing evidence that psychosis is characterized by brain network abnormalities. Analyzing morphological abnormalities with T1-weighted structural MRI may be limited in discovering the extent of deviations in cortical associations. We assess whether structural associations of either cortical white–gray contrast (WGC) or cortical thickness (CT) allow for a better understanding of brain structural relationships in first episode of psychosis (FEP) patients. Principal component and structural covariance analyses were applied to WGC and CT derived from T1-weighted MRI for 116 patients and 88 controls, to explore sets of brain regions that showed group differences, and associations with symptom severity and cognitive ability in patients. We focused on 2 principal components: one encompassed primary somatomotor regions, which showed trend-like group differences in WGC, and the second included heteromodal cortices. Patients’ component scores were related to general psychopathology for WGC, but not CT. Structural covariance analyses with WGC revealed group differences in pairwise correlations across widespread brain regions, mirroring areas derived from PCA. More group differences were uncovered with WGC compared with CT. WGC holds potential as a proxy measure of myelin from commonly acquired T1-weighted MRI and may be sensitive in detecting systems-level aberrations in early psychosis, and relationships with clinical/cognitive profiles.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>How pain emerges in the human brain remains an unresolved question. Neuroimaging studies have suggested that several brain areas subserve pain perception because their activation correlates with perceived pain intensity. However, painful stimuli are often intense and highly salient; therefore, using both intensity- and saliency-matched control stimuli is crucial to isolate pain-selective brain responses. Here, we used these intensity/saliency-matched painful and non-painful stimuli to test whether pain-selective information can be isolated in the functional magnetic resonance imaging responses elicited by painful stimuli. Using two independent datasets, multivariate pattern analysis was able to isolate features distinguishing the responses triggered by (1) intensity/saliency-matched painful versus non-painful stimuli, and (2) high versus low-intensity/saliency stimuli regardless of whether they elicit pain. This indicates that neural activity in the so-called “pain matrix” is functionally heterogeneous, and part of it carries information related to both painfulness and intensity/saliency. The response features distinguishing these aspects are spatially distributed and cannot be ascribed to specific brain structures.</span>

TDP-43 aggregation is the major hallmark of multiple neurodegenerative diseases, including ALS and FTD. Gasset-Rosa et al. demonstrate that transient stress induces long-lasting cytoplasmic TDP-43 de-mixing independent of stress granules, driving nuclear import defects, nuclear TDP-43 clearance, and cell death.

Sakellaridi, Christopoulos, et al. studied the learning mechanism in human AIP using brain-machine interface paradigms. They found that changes in neural activity during learning reflect cognitive re-adaptation mechanisms. When cognitive strategies were not adequate for compensation, AIP failed to learn.

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25434?af=R">Blood pressure variability and hemorrhagic transformation in patients with successful recanalization after endovascular recanalization therapy: A retrospective observational study</a></h4>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Although blood pressure (BP) variability has been regarded as a risk factor for hemorrhagic transformation (HTF) after intravenous thrombolysis, its effect on HTF after endovascular recanalization therapy (ERT) remains to be elucidated. We aimed to study the relationship between BP variability and symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH) after successful recanalization with ERT.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A total of 211 patients with acute ischemic stroke and successful recanalization (thrombolysis in cerebral infarction 2b or 3) after ERT were included between January 2013 and May 2017. The BP data following ERT was obtained over the first 24 hours using parameters including mean, maximum, minimum, difference between maximum and minimum, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, successive variations, and time rate (TR) of BP variation for systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP. sICH was defined as parenchymal hemorrhage type 2 with neurological deterioration of 4 points of more on the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Among the included patients, 20 (9.5%) developed sICH after successful ERT. The parameters linked with BP fluctuation over time were significantly related to sICH. After adjusting for confounders, the TR of SBP (per 0.1 mmHg/min increase) variation was independently associated with sICH (odds ratio = 1.71, 95% confidence interval = 1.013–2.886).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Time‐related BP variability in the first 24 hours following successful ERT was more correlated with sICH than other absolute BP levels. This suggests that maintaining a stable BP may be an important factor in preventing sICH after successful ERT. Ann Neurol 2019</p>

<p>Focal traumatic brain injury (TBI) induces astrogliosis, a process essential to protecting uninjured brain areas from secondary damage. However, astrogliosis can cause loss of astrocyte homeostatic functions and possibly contributes to comorbidities such as posttraumatic epilepsy (PTE). Scar-forming astrocytes seal focal injuries off from healthy brain tissue. It is these glial scars that are associated with epilepsy originating in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. However, the vast majority of human TBIs also present with diffuse brain injury caused by acceleration-deceleration forces leading to tissue shearing. The resulting diffuse tissue damage may be intrinsically different from focal lesions that would trigger glial scar formation. Here, we used mice of both sexes in a model of repetitive mild/concussive closed-head TBI, which only induced diffuse injury, to test the hypothesis that astrocytes respond uniquely to diffuse TBI and that diffuse TBI is sufficient to cause PTE. Astrocytes did not form scars and classic astrogliosis characterized by upregulation of glial fibrillary acidic protein was limited. Surprisingly, an unrelated population of atypical reactive astrocytes was characterized by the lack of glial fibrillary acidic protein expression, rapid and sustained downregulation of homeostatic proteins and impaired astrocyte coupling. After a latency period, a subset of mice developed spontaneous recurrent seizures reminiscent of PTE in human TBI patients. Seizing mice had larger areas of atypical astrocytes compared with nonseizing mice, suggesting that these atypical astrocytes might contribute to epileptogenesis after diffuse TBI.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of acquired epilepsies. Reactive astrocytes have long been associated with seizures and epilepsy in patients, particularly after focal/lesional brain injury. However, most TBIs also include nonfocal, diffuse injuries. Here, we showed that repetitive diffuse TBI is sufficient for the development of spontaneous recurrent seizures in a subset of mice. We identified an atypical response of astrocytes induced by diffuse TBI characterized by the rapid loss of homeostatic proteins and lack of astrocyte coupling while reactive astrocyte markers or glial scar formation was absent. Areas with atypical astrocytes were larger in animals that later developed seizures suggesting that this response may be one root cause of epileptogenesis after diffuse TBI.</p>

The simplicity and efficiency of the technique have led to an ever-expanding TaDa toolbox.

The occurrence of wake-like electroencephalography (EEG) traces during rapid-eye movement sleep (REM) has intrigued scientists for decades. A recent study by Bergel et al. (Nat. Commun. 2018;9;5364) imaged brain-wide hemodynamics in rats during wakefulness and sleep. The findings suggest that brain energy expenditure is highest during REM because of heightened theta and gamma activity.

Sodium channel NaV1.7 is a major target in pain research, largely because of genetic validation. In this issue of Neuron, McDermott et al. (2019) now present a comprehensive assessment of congenital pain insensitivity due to NaV1.7 loss of function. This work and studies on NaV1.7 gain of function raise important questions about how channelopathies produce disease.

Abstract
<p>While the primary role of vesicular transporters is to load neurotransmitters into synaptic vesicles (SVs), accumulating evidence suggests that these proteins also contribute to additional aspects of synaptic function, including vesicle release. In this study, we extend the role of the VAChT to include regulating the transmitter content of SVs. We report that manipulation of a C-terminal poly-glutamine (polyQ) region in the <i>Drosophila</i> VAChT is sufficient to influence transmitter content, and release frequency, of cholinergic vesicles from the terminals of premotor interneurons. Specifically, we find that reduction of the polyQ region, by one glutamine residue (<i>13Q</i> to <i>12Q</i>), results in a significant increase in both amplitude and frequency of spontaneous cholinergic miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs) recorded in the aCC and RP2 motoneurons. Moreover, this truncation also results in evoked synaptic currents that show increased duration: consistent with increased ACh release. By contrast, extension of the polyQ region by one glutamine (<i>13Q</i> to <i>14Q</i>) is sufficient to reduce mEPSC amplitude and frequency and, moreover, prevents evoked SV release. Finally, a complete deletion of the polyQ region (13Q to 0Q) has no obvious effects to mEPSCs, but again evoked synaptic currents show increased duration. The mechanisms that ensure SVs are filled to physiologically-appropriate levels remain unknown. Our study identifies the polyQ region of the insect VAChT to be required for correct vesicle transmitter loading and, thus, provides opportunity to increase understanding of this critical aspect of neurotransmission.</p>

Abstract
<p>Hyperthermia-induced febrile seizures (FSs) are the most common seizures during childhood, and prolonged complex FSs can result in the development of epilepsy. Currently, GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor modulators such as benzodiazepines and barbiturates are used as medications for FSs with the aim of enhancing GABA-mediated inhibition of neuronal activity. However, it is still up for debate whether these enhancers of GABAergic neurotransmission could depolarize immature neurons with relatively higher levels of the intracellular Cl<sup>–</sup> in the developing brain during FSs. Here, we performed simultaneous video-local field potential monitoring to determine whether benzodiazepines and barbiturates affect the phenotypes of FSs in postnatal day (P)11 and P14 mice. We found that low-dose administration of diazepam decreased the incidence of clonic seizures at P11. We also found that high-dose administration of diazepam and pentobarbital exacerbated the behavioral and electrophysiological phenotypes of the induction phase of experimental FSs at P11 but not at P14. We further found that the deteriorated phenotypes at P11 were suppressed when Na<sup>+</sup>K<sup>+</sup>2Cl<sup>–</sup> cotransporter isoform 1 (NKCC1), which mediates Cl<sup>–</sup> influx, was blocked by treatment with the diuretic bumetanide. Though our findings do not exclude the involvement of sedation effect of high-dose GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor modulators in worsening experimental FSs at P11, pharmacological enhancement of GABAergic signaling could aggravate seizure activity in the early phase of FSs.</p>

Abstract
<p>Methylphenidate (MPH), commonly known as Ritalin, is the most widely prescribed drug worldwide to treat patients with attention deficit disorders. Although MPH is thought to modulate catecholamine neurotransmission in the brain, it remains unclear how these neurochemical effects influence neuronal activity and lead to attentional enhancements. Studies in rodents overwhelmingly point to the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) as a main site of action of MPH. To understand the mechanism of action of MPH in a primate brain, we recorded the responses of neuronal populations using chronic multielectrode arrays implanted in the caudal LPFC of two macaque monkeys while the animals performed an attention task (<i>N</i> = 2811 neuronal recordings). Over different recording sessions (<i>N</i> = 55), we orally administered either various doses of MPH or a placebo to the animals. Behavioral analyses revealed positive effects of MPH on task performance at specific doses. However, analyses of individual neurons activity, noise correlations, and neuronal ensemble activity using machine learning algorithms revealed no effects of MPH. Our results suggest that the positive behavioral effects of MPH observed in primates (including humans) may not be mediated by changes in the activity of caudal LPFC neurons. MPH may enhance cognitive performance by modulating neuronal activity in other regions of the attentional network in the primate brain.</p>

Abstract
<p>Processing of memory is supported by coordinated activity in a network of sensory, association, and motor brain regions. It remains a major challenge to determine where memory is encoded for later retrieval. Here, we used direct intracranial brain recordings from epilepsy patients performing free recall tasks to determine the temporal pattern and anatomical distribution of verbal memory encoding across the entire human cortex. High  frequency activity (65–115 Hz) showed consistent power responses during encoding of subsequently recalled and forgotten words on a subset of electrodes localized in 16 distinct cortical areas activated in the tasks. More of the high  power during word encoding, and less power before and after the word presentation, was characteristic of successful recall and observed across multiple brain regions. Latencies of the induced power changes and this subsequent memory effect (SME) between the recalled and forgotten words followed an anatomical sequence from visual to prefrontal cortical areas. Finally, the magnitude of the memory effect was unexpectedly found to be the largest in selected brain regions both at the top and at the bottom of the processing stream. These included the language processing areas of the prefrontal cortex and the early visual areas at the junction of the occipital and temporal lobes. Our results provide evidence for distributed encoding of verbal memory organized along a hierarchical posterior-to-anterior processing stream.</p>

Abstract<p>Language difficulties have been reported in children and adolescents who were born very preterm (&lt; 32 weeks’ gestation) and associated with an atypical lateralisation of language processing, i.e. increased right-hemispheric engagement. This study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and spherical deconvolution tractography to study the hemodynamic responses associated with verbal fluency processing (easy and hard letter trials) and verbal fluency-related white matter fibre tracts in 64 very preterm born adults and 36 adult controls (mean age: 30 years). Tractography of the arcuate fasciculus (AF) and frontal aslant tract (FAT) was performed. Tracts were quantified in terms of mean volume, hindrance modulated orientational anisotropy, and lateralisation, assessed using a laterality index to indicate hemispheric dominance. During verbal fluency fMRI, very preterm participants displayed decreased hemodynamic response suppression in both the <i>Easy &gt; Rest</i> and <i>Hard &gt; Rest</i> conditions, compared to controls, in superior temporal gyrus, insula, thalamus and sensorimotor cortex, particularly in the right hemisphere. At the whole-group level, decreased hemodynamic response suppression in the right sensorimotor cortex was associated with worse on-line performance on the hard letter trials. Increased left-laterality in the AF was present alongside increased right hemispheric hemodynamic response suppression in controls. When only right-handed participants were considered, decreased hemodynamic response suppression in the right superior temporal gyrus during hard letter trials was related to weaker left and right FAT white matter integrity in the preterm group only. These results show that verbal fluency is affected by altered functional lateralisation in adults who were born very preterm.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> This is the first study to use both functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging to assess the neuro-anatomy of verbal fluency in very preterm born adults. Less suppression of brain activation was observed in very preterm adults compared to controls in several brain regions during completion of both easy and hard verbal fluency trials. Furthermore, across all subjects, decreased brain activity suppression in the right sensorimotor cortex was associated with worse on-line performance on the hard letter trials. Increased left-laterality in the arcuate fasciculus, a language-related white matter tract, was present alongside increased right hemispheric brain activity suppression in controls. These findings suggest that alterations in the typical development of left-lateralisation in very preterm individuals are still present in adulthood.</p>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>During early development, signaling centers, such as the cortical hem and the preoptic area (POA), are critical for telencephalic patterning. However, the mechanisms underlying the maintenance of signal centers are poorly understood. Here, we report that the transcription factor <span style="font-style: italic;">Foxg1</span> is required to confine the POA, a resource of <span style="font-style: italic;">Sonic Hedgehog</span> (<span style="font-style: italic;">Shh)</span> that is pivotal for ventral telencephalic development. Cell-specific deletion of <span style="font-style: italic;">Foxg1</span> achieved by crossing <span style="font-style: italic;">Foxg1</span><sup><span style="font-style: italic;">fl/fl</span></sup> with <span style="font-style: italic;">Dbx1-cre</span> or <span style="font-style: italic;">Nestin-CreER</span> combined with tamoxifen induction results in a dramatic expansion of the POA accompanied by the significantly increased activity of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Shh</span> signaling pathway. Ventral pattern formation was severely impaired. Moreover, we demonstrated that <span style="font-style: italic;">Foxg1</span> directly represses <span style="font-style: italic;">Dbx1</span> to restrict the POA. Furthermore, we found that the ventral pallium was expanded, which might also contribute to the observed patterning defects. These findings will improve our understanding of the maintenance of signal centers and help to elucidate the mechanisms underlying ventral telencephalic patterning.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Chronic stress has been observed to increase the risk of developing depression and induce neuronal alterations of synaptic plasticity, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we found that the ubiquitously expressed RNA-binding protein HuR was up-regulated in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of mice following chronic stress. In adult mice, AAV-Cre-mediated knockout of HuR in the mPFC prevented anxiety-like and depression-like behaviors induced by chronic stress. HuR was also required for the stress-induced dendritic spine loss and synaptic transmission deficits. Moreover, <span style="font-style: italic;">HuR</span><sup><span style="font-style: italic;">flox/flox</span></sup>;<span style="font-style: italic;">Nex-Cre</span> mice, which induce HuR loss of function from embryonic development, exhibited enhanced synaptic functions. Notably, we ascertained RhoA signaling to be regulated by HuR and involved in the modulation of structural synaptic plasticity in response to chronic stress. Our results demonstrate HuR is a critical modulator for the regulation of stress-induced synaptic plasticity alterations and depression, providing a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of depressive disorders.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Neuropsychiatric disorders share susceptibility genes, suggesting a common origin. One such gene is <span style="font-style: italic;">CNTNAP2</span> encoding contactin-associated protein 2 (CASPR2), which harbours mutations associated to autism, schizophrenia, and intellectual disability. Antibodies targeting CASPR2 have also been recently described in patients with several neurological disorders, such as neuromyotonia, Morvan’s syndrome, and limbic encephalitis. Despite the clear implication of <span style="font-style: italic;">CNTNAP2</span> and CASPR2 in neuropsychiatric disorders, the pathogenic mechanisms associated with alterations in CASPR2 function are unknown. Here, we show that Caspr2 is expressed in excitatory synapses in the cortex, and that silencing its expression <span style="font-style: italic;">in vitro</span> or <span style="font-style: italic;">in vivo</span> decreases the synaptic expression of α‐amino‐3‐hydroxy‐5‐methylisoxazole‐4‐propionic acid (AMPA) receptors and the amplitude of AMPA receptor-mediated currents. Furthermore, Caspr2 loss of function blocks synaptic scaling <span style="font-style: italic;">in vitro</span> and experience-dependent homoeostatic synaptic plasticity in the visual cortex. Patient CASPR2 antibodies decrease the dendritic levels of Caspr2 and synaptic AMPA receptor trafficking, and perturb excitatory transmission in the visual cortex. These results suggest that mutations in <span style="font-style: italic;">CNTNAP2</span> may contribute to alterations in AMPA receptor function and homoeostatic plasticity, and indicate that antibodies from anti-CASPR2 encephalitis patients affect cortical excitatory transmission.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The somatosensory system has a hierarchical organization. Information processing increases in complexity from the contralateral primary sensory cortex to bilateral association cortices and this is represented by a sequence of somatosensory-evoked potentials recorded with scalp electroencephalographies. The mammalian somatosensory system matures over the early postnatal period in a rostro-caudal progression, but little is known about the development of hierarchical information processing in the human infant brain. To investigate the normal human development of the somatosensory hierarchy, we recorded potentials evoked by mechanical stimulation of hands and feet in 34 infants between 34 and 42 weeks corrected gestational age, with median postnatal age of 3 days. We show that the shortest latency potential was evoked for both hands and feet at all ages with a contralateral somatotopic source in the primary somatosensory cortex (SI). However, the longer latency responses, localized in SI and beyond, matured with age. They gradually emerged for the foot and, although always present for the hand, showed a shift from purely contralateral to bilateral hemispheric activation. These results demonstrate the rostro-caudal development of human somatosensory hierarchy and suggest that the development of its higher tiers is complete only just before the time of normal birth.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>In the present combined DTI/fMRI study we investigated adaptive plasticity of neural networks involved in controlling spatial and nonspatial auditory working memory in the early blind (EB). In both EB and sighted controls (SC), fractional anisotropy (FA) within the right inferior longitudinal fasciculus correlated positively with accuracy in a one-back sound localization but not sound identification task. The neural tracts passing through the cluster of significant correlation connected auditory and “visual” areas in the right hemisphere. Activity in these areas during both sound localization and identification correlated with FA within the anterior corpus callosum, anterior thalamic radiation, and inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus. In EB, FA in these structures correlated positively with activity in both auditory and “visual” areas, whereas FA in SC correlated positively with activity in auditory and negatively with activity in visual areas. The results indicate that frontal white matter conveys cross-modal suppression of occipital areas in SC, while it mediates coactivation of auditory and reorganized “visual” cortex in EB.</span>

Here, we review recent conceptual progress toward an evolutionary definition of cell types, and how it facilitates the identification and large-scale comparison of neuronal types and neuron type families from single-cell data — with the family of GABAergic neurons in distinct parts of the vertebrate forebrain as prime example. We also highlight strategies to infer cell type-specific innovation, so-called apomeres, from single-cell data.</p></div>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Neocortical astrogenesis follows neuronogenesis and precedes oligogenesis. Among key factors dictating its temporal articulation, there are progression rates of pallial stem cells (SCs) towards astroglial lineages as well as activation rates of astrocyte differentiation programs in response to extrinsic gliogenic cues. In this study, we showed that high Foxg1 SC expression antagonizes astrocyte generation, while stimulating SC self-renewal and committing SCs to neuronogenesis. We found that mechanisms underlying this activity are mainly cell autonomous and highly pleiotropic. They include a concerted downregulation of 4 key effectors channeling neural SCs to astroglial fates, as well as defective activation of core molecular machineries implementing astroglial differentiation programs. Next, we found that SC Foxg1 levels specifically decline during the neuronogenic-to-gliogenic transition, pointing to a pivotal Foxg1 role in temporal modulation of astrogenesis. Finally, we showed that Foxg1 inhibits astrogenesis from human neocortical precursors, suggesting that this is an evolutionarily ancient trait.</span>

The revolutionary discovery of the rapid antidepressant ketamine has been a milestone in psychiatry field in the last half century. Unlike conventional antidepressants that often take weeks to months to show efficacy, ketamine causes rapid antidepressant effects, emerging as early as within 1h after administration. However, how ketamine improves mood symptoms so quickly has remained elusive. Here, we first introduce the historical background of ketamine as a rapid antidepressant. We then discuss current hypotheses underlying ketamine’s rapid antidepressant effects, with a focus on our latest discovery that ketamine silences NMDAR-dependent burst firing in the ‘anti-reward center’, the lateral habenula.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Structural and functional differences in brain hemispheric asymmetry have been well documented between female and male adults. However, potential differences in the connectivity patterns of the rich-club organization of hemispheric structural networks in females and males remain to be determined. In this study, diffusion tensor imaging was used to construct hemispheric structural networks in healthy subjects, and graph theoretical analysis approaches were applied to quantify hemisphere and gender differences in rich-club organization. The results showed that rich-club organization was consistently observed in both hemispheres of female and male adults. Moreover, a reduced level of connectivity was found in the left hemisphere. Notably, rightward asymmetries were mainly observed in feeder and local connections among one hub region and peripheral regions, many of which are implicated in visual processing and spatial attention functions. Additionally, significant gender differences were revealed in the rich-club, feeder, and local connections in rich-club organization. These gender-related hub and peripheral regions are involved in emotional, sensory, and cognitive control functions. The topological changes in rich-club organization provide novel insight into the hemisphere and gender effects on white matter connections and underlie a potential network mechanism of hemisphere- and gender-based differences in visual processing, spatial attention and cognitive control.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>In the stop-signal task, an electrophysiological signature of action-stopping is increased early right frontal beta band power for successful vs. failed stop trials. Here we tested whether the requirement to stop an unwanted thought from coming to mind also elicits this signature. We recorded scalp EEG during a Think/No-Think task and a subsequent stop signal task in 42 participants. In the Think/No-Think task, participants first learned word pairs. In a second phase, they received the left-hand word as a reminder and were cued either to retrieve the associated right-hand word (“Think”) or to stop retrieval (“No-Think”). At the end of each trial, participants reported whether they had experienced an intrusion of the associated memory. Finally, they received the left-hand reminder word and were asked to recall its associated target. Behaviorally, there was worse final recall for items in the No-Think condition, and decreased intrusions with practice for No-Think trials. For EEG, we reproduced increased early right frontal beta power for successful vs. failed action stopping. Critically, No-Think trials also elicited increased early right frontal beta power and this was stronger for trials without intrusion. These results suggest that preventing a thought from coming to mind also recruits fast prefrontal stopping.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Cortical activity is organized across multiple spatial and temporal scales. Most research on the dynamics of neuronal spiking is concerned with timescales of 1 ms–1 s, and little is known about spiking dynamics on timescales of tens of seconds and minutes. Here, we used frequency domain analyses to study the structure of individual neurons’ spiking activity and its coupling to local population rate and to arousal level across 0.01–100 Hz frequency range. In mouse medial prefrontal cortex, the spiking dynamics of individual neurons could be quantitatively captured by a combination of interspike interval and firing rate power spectrum distributions. The relative strength of coherence with local population often differed across timescales: a neuron strongly coupled to population rate on fast timescales could be weakly coupled on slow timescales, and vice versa. On slow but not fast timescales, a substantial proportion of neurons showed firing anticorrelated with the population. Infraslow firing rate changes were largely determined by arousal rather than by local factors, which could explain the timescale dependence of individual neurons’ population coupling strength. These observations demonstrate how neurons simultaneously partake in fast local dynamics, and slow brain-wide dynamics, extending our understanding of infraslow cortical activity beyond the mesoscale resolution of fMRI.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The hippocampus is functionally heterogeneous between the dorsal and ventral subfields with left–right asymmetry. To determine the possible location of contextual memory, we performed an inhibitory avoidance task to analyze synaptic plasticity using slice patch-clamp technique. The training bilaterally increased the AMPA/NMDA ratio at dorsal CA3–CA1 synapses, whereas the training did not affect the ratio at ventral CA3–CA1 synapses regardless of the hemisphere. Moreover, sequential recording of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents and miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents from the same CA1 neuron clearly showed learning-induced synaptic plasticity. In dorsal CA1 neurons, the training dramatically strengthened both excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic responses in both hemispheres, whereas the training did not promote the plasticity in either hemisphere in ventral CA1 neurons. Nonstationary fluctuation analysis further revealed that the training bilaterally increased the number of AMPA or GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor channels at dorsal CA1 synapses, but not at ventral CA1 synapses, suggesting functional heterogeneity of learning-induced receptor mobility. Finally, the performance clearly impaired by the bilateral microinjection of plasticity blockers in dorsal, but not ventral CA1 subfields, suggesting a crucial role for contextual learning. The quantification of synaptic diversity in specified CA1 subfields may help us to diagnose and evaluate cognitive disorders at the information level.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Affective disorders are associated with increased sensitivity to negative feedback that influences approach–avoidance decision making. Although neuroimaging studies of these disorders reveal dysregulation in primate cingulate areas 25 and 32 and the anterior hippocampus (aHipp), the causal involvement of these structures and their interaction in the primate brain is unknown. We therefore investigated the effects of localized pharmacological manipulations of areas 25 and 32 and/or the aHipp of the marmoset monkey on performance of an anxiolytic-sensitive instrumental decision-making task in which an approach–avoidance conflict is created by pairing a response with reward and punishment. During control infusions animals avoided punishment, but this bias was reduced by increasing glutamate release within the aHipp or area 32, and inactivation or 5-HT1a antagonism within area 25. Conversely, increasing glutamate release in area 25 enhanced punishment avoidance but, in contrast to previous reports, area 32 and aHipp inactivations had no effect. Simultaneous inactivation or 5-HT1a antagonism within area 25, but not area 32, abolished the reduced punishment avoidance seen after increasing aHipp glutamate. Besides providing causal evidence that these primate areas differentially regulate negative feedback sensitivity, this study links the decision-making deficits in affective disorders to aberrant aHipp–area 25 circuit activity.</span>

Recent decades have seen dramatic progress in brain research. These advances were often buttressed by probing single variables to make circumscribed discoveries, typically through null hypothesis significance testing. New ways for generating massive data fueled tension between the traditional methodology that is used to infer statistically relevant effects in carefully chosen variables, and pattern-learning algorithms that are used to identify predictive signatures by searching through abundant information.

Two new genome-wide association studies leverage this approach to provide broad, population-level perspectives on the genetic basis for major depressive disorder and the shared genetic risk that underlies multiple disorders.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/neuro/rss/current/~4/n4K1C7pZOmw" width="1" />
