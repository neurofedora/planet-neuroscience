<p>by Rahul Gupta</p>

AMPA receptors (AMPARs) and their associations with auxiliary transmembrane proteins are bulky structures with large steric-exclusion volumes. Hence, self-crowding of AMPARs, depending on the local density, may affect their lateral diffusion in the postsynaptic membrane as well as in the highly crowded postsynaptic density (PSD) at excitatory synapses. Earlier theoretical studies considered only the roles of transmembrane obstacles and the AMPAR-binding submembranous scaffold proteins in shaping receptor diffusion within PSD. Using lattice model of diffusion, the present study investigates the additional impacts of self-crowding on the anomalousity and effective diffusion coefficient (<i>D</i><sub>eff</sub>) of AMPAR diffusion. A recursive algorithm for avoiding false self-blocking during diffusion simulation is also proposed. The findings suggest that high density of AMPARs in the obstacle-free membrane itself engenders strongly anomalous diffusion and severe decline in <i>D</i><sub>eff</sub>. Adding transmembrane obstacles to the membrane accentuates the anomalousity arising from self-crowding due to the reduced free diffusion space. Contrarily, enhanced AMPAR-scaffold binding, either through increase in binding strength or scaffold density or both, ameliorates the anomalousity resulting from self-crowding. However, binding has differential impacts on <i>D</i><sub>eff</sub> depending on the receptor density. Increase in binding causes consistent decrease in <i>D</i><sub>eff</sub> for low and moderate receptor density. For high density, binding increases <i>D</i><sub>eff</sub> as long as it reduces anomalousity associated with intense self-crowding. Given a sufficiently strong binding condition when diffusion acquires normal behavior, further increase in binding causes decrease in <i>D</i><sub>eff</sub>. Supporting earlier experimental observations are mentioned and implications of present findings to the experimental observations on AMPAR diffusion are also drawn.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/8SAtqcqg8xg" width="1" />

Publication date: February 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 48<br />     Author(s): Zilong   Qiu<br />  MECP2 is a critical gene for neural development, mutations or duplication of which led to severe neurodevelopmental disorders, such as Rett syndrome (RTT) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Extensive works during the past decade yield ample insights into the molecular and cellular functions of MeCP2 in neural development. Furthermore, genetic manipulations in Mecp2 mouse models strongly suggested that deficiency in synaptic plasticity and various behaviors of Mecp2 null or transgenic mice could be rescued in adulthood. Further studies elucidating neural circuits responsible for symptoms in MECP2-associated disorders in rodent and non-human primate models will shed light on the development of potential therapeutic interventions. <br /><br />

Publication date: February 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 48<br />     Author(s): Aaron   Katzman, Cristina M   Alberini<br /> The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is critical for memory formation, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. Clinical and animal model studies have shown that changes in PFC excitation and inhibition are important for cognitive functions as well as related disorders. Here, we discuss recent findings revealing the roles of the excitatory and inhibitory synaptic proteins neuroligin 1 (NLGN1) and NLGN2 in the PFC in memory formation and modulation of memory strength. We propose that shifts in NLGN1 and NLGN2 expression in specific excitatory and inhibitory neuronal subpopulations in response to experience regulate the dynamic processes of memory consolidation and strengthening. Because excitatory/inhibitory imbalances accompany neuropsychiatric disorders in which strength and flexibility of representations play important roles, understanding these mechanisms may suggest novel therapies. <br /><br />

Publication date: June 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 50<br />     Author(s): Guosong   Hong, Xiao   Yang, Tao   Zhou, Charles M   Lieber<br /> Existing implantable neurotechnologies for understanding the brain and treating neurological diseases have intrinsic properties that have limited their capability to achieve chronically-stable brain interfaces with single-neuron spatiotemporal resolution. These limitations reflect what has been dichotomy between the structure and mechanical properties of living brain tissue and non-living neural probes. To bridge the gap between neural and electronic networks, we have introduced the new concept of mesh electronics probes designed with structural and mechanical properties such that the implant begins to ‘look and behave’ like neural tissue. Syringe-implanted mesh electronics have led to the realization of probes that are neuro-attractive and free of the chronic immune response, as well as capable of stable long-term mapping and modulation of brain activity at the single-neuron level. This review provides a historical overview of a 10-year development of mesh electronics by highlighting the tissue-like design, syringe-assisted delivery, seamless neural tissue integration, and single-neuron level chronic recording stability of mesh electronics. We also offer insights on unique near-term opportunities and future directions for neuroscience and neurology that now are available or expected for mesh electronics neurotechnologies. <br /><br />

Human neuroimaging studies consistently show a hunger-dependent, selective enhancement of responses to images of food in association cortex and amygdala. More recently, cellular-resolution imaging combined with circuit mapping experiments in behaving mice have revealed underlying neuronal population dynamics and enabled tracing of pathways by which hunger circuits influence the assignment of value to visual objects in visual association cortex, insular cortex, and amygdala. These experiments begin to provide a mechanistic understanding of motivation-specific neural processing of need-relevant cues in healthy humans and in disease states such as obesity and other eating disorders. <br /><br />

Since the earliest days of embryology, lineage questions have been addressed with methods of increasing specificity, capacity, and resolution. Yet, a full realization of individual cell lineages remains challenging for complex systems. A recent explosion of technical advances in genome-editing and single-cell sequencing has enabled lineage analysis in an unprecedented scale, speed, and depth across different species. In this review, we discuss the application of available as well as future genetic labeling techniques for tracking neural lineages in vivo in the mammalian nervous system. <br /><br />

Publication date: February 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 48<br />     Author(s): Alexandra   Krol, Guoping   Feng<br /> Developmental processes disrupted in neurodevelopmental disorders occur rapidly and with temporal precision. During development, individual gene activity can dynamically engage different signaling networks; thus genetic mutations can lead to different functional changes at different times. Interpretation of phenotypes can be further complicated if initial functional changes trigger compensatory mechanisms. Examining genetic mouse models of neurodevelopmental disorders reveals cellular phenotypes that change over the course of development and exist long before behavioral deficits are assessed. Correspondingly, earlier genetic interventions in these disorder models have often been more effective at improving behavioral deficits than late interventions. The restricted period of effective intervention demonstrates that identifying a target window is an essential component of treatment. <br /><br />

Publication date: April 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 49<br />     Author(s): Steffen BE   Wolff, Bence P   Ölveczky<br /> The development of increasingly sophisticated methods for recording and manipulating neural activity is revolutionizing neuroscience. By probing how activity patterns in different types of neurons and circuits contribute to behavior, these tools can help inform mechanistic models of brain function and explain the roles of distinct circuit elements. However, in systems where functions are distributed over large networks, interpreting causality experiments can be challenging. Here we review common assumptions underlying circuit manipulations in behaving animals and discuss the strengths and limitations of different approaches. <br /><br />

Publication date: February 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 48<br />     Author(s): Francesco   Petrelli, Paola   Bezzi<br /> Astrocytes, the largest glial population in human and murine brains, are crucial to the regulation of synaptic connectivity. During the first three weeks of postnatal development, immature astrocytes express mGlu5 and expands several fold while undergoing a transition towards their mature phase. Although mGlu5-mediated signalling in astrocyte functions has been extensively studied in the last decades, whether this signalling is implicated in the mechanisms governing their development, as well as the effects of dysregulated astrocytic development on neurodevelopmental disorders, are still unclear. The aim of this review is to examine what is known about the mGlu5-mediated signalling in the developing astrocytes and its possible contribution to the pathophysiology of autism spectrum disorders. <br /><br />

Publication date: April 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 49<br />     Author(s): Karel   Svoboda, Nuo   Li<br /> Neurons in motor cortex and connected brain regions fire in anticipation of specific movements, long before movement occurs. This neural activity reflects internal processes by which the brain plans and executes volitional movements. The study of motor planning offers an opportunity to understand how the structure and dynamics of neural circuits support persistent internal states and how these states influence behavior. Recent advances in large-scale neural recordings are beginning to decipher the relationship of the dynamics of populations of neurons during motor planning and movements. New behavioral tasks in rodents, together with quantified perturbations, link dynamics in specific nodes of neural circuits to behavior. These studies reveal a neural network distributed across multiple brain regions that collectively supports motor planning. We review recent advances and highlight areas where further work is needed to achieve a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying motor planning and related cognitive processes. <br /><br />

Publication date: February 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 48<br />     Author(s): Le   Xiao, Peter   Scheiffele<br /> The view of cerebellar functions has been extended from controlling sensorimotor processes to processing ‘contextual’ information and generating predictions for a diverse range of behaviors. These functions rely on the computation of the local cerebellar microcircuits and long-range connectivity that relays cerebellar output to various brain areas. In this review, we discuss recent work on two of the circuit elements, which are thought to be fundamental for a wide range of non-sensorimotor behaviors: The role for cerebellar granule cells in multimodal integration in the cerebellar cortex and the long-range connectivity between the deep cerebellar nuclei and the basal ganglia. Lastly, we discuss how studies on synapses and circuits of the cerebellum in rodent models of autism-spectrum disorders might contribute to our understanding of the pathophysiology of this class of neurodevelopmental disorders. <br /><br />

Microelectrode arrays based on complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology, such as Neuropixels probes, look set to transform these methods. Neuropixels probes provide ∼1000 recording sites on an extremely narrow shank, with on-board amplification, digitization, and multiplexing. They deliver low-noise recordings from hundreds of neurons, providing a step change in the type of data available to neuroscientists. Here we discuss the opportunities afforded by these probes for large-scale electrophysiology, the challenges associated with data processing and anatomical localization, and avenues for further improvements of the technology. <br /><br />

Publication date: February 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 48<br />     Author(s): Carla EM   Golden, Joseph D   Buxbaum, Silvia   De Rubeis<br /> Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disability (ID) are caused by a wide range of genetic mutations, a significant fraction of which reside in genes important for synaptic function. Studies have found that sensory, prefrontal, hippocampal, cerebellar, and striatal regions, as well as the circuits that connect them, are perturbed in mouse models of ASD and ID. Dissecting the disruptions in morphology and activity in these neural circuits might help us to understand the shared risk between the two disorders as well as their clinical heterogeneity. Treatments that target the balance between excitation and inhibition in these regions are able to reverse pathological phenotypes, elucidating this deficit as a commonality across models and opening new avenues for intervention. <br /><br />

Publication date: February 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 48<br />     Author(s): Yishi   Jin, Yingchuan B   Qi<br /> The ability of neurons to modify or remodel their synaptic connectivity is critical for the function of neural circuitry throughout the life of an animal. Understanding the mechanisms underlying neuronal structural changes is central to our knowledge of how the nervous system is shaped for complex behaviors and how it further adapts to developmental and environmental demands. Caenorhabditis elegans provides a powerful model for examining developmental processes and for discovering mechanisms controlling neural plasticity. Recent findings have identified conserved themes underlying neural plasticity in development and under environmental stress. <br /><br />

Publication date: April 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 49<br />     Author(s): Ashley L   Juavinett, Jeffrey C   Erlich, Anne K   Churchland<br /> Rodent decision-making research aims to uncover the neural circuitry underlying the ability to evaluate alternatives and select appropriate actions. Designing behavioral paradigms that provide a solid foundation to ask questions about decision-making computations and mechanisms is a difficult and often underestimated challenge. Here, we propose three dimensions on which we can consider rodent decision-making tasks: ethological validity, task complexity, and stimulus-response compatibility. We review recent research through this lens, and provide practical guidance for researchers in the decision-making field. <br /><br />

Publication date: June 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 50<br />     Author(s): Philipp   Gutruf, John A   Rogers<br /> Recently developed classes of ultraminiaturized wireless devices provide powerful capabilities in neuroscience research, as implantable light sources for simulation/inhibition via optogenetics, as integrated microfluidic systems for programmed pharmacological delivery and as multimodal sensors for physiological measurements. These platforms leverage basic advances in biocompatible materials, semiconductor device designs and systems engineering concepts to afford modes of operation that are qualitatively distinct from those of conventional approaches that tether animals to external hardware by means of optical fibers, electrical cables and/or fluidic tubing. Neuroscience studies that exploit the unique features of these technologies enable insights into neural function through targeted stimulation, inhibition and recording, with spatially and genetically precise manipulation of neural circuit activity. Experimental possibilities include studies in naturalistic, three dimensional environments, investigations of pair-wise or group related social interactions and many other scenarios of interest that cannot be addressed using traditional hardware. <br /><br />

Publication date: April 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 49<br />     Author(s): Paola   Cognigni, Johannes   Felsenberg, Scott   Waddell<br /> When animals learn, plasticity in brain networks that respond to specific cues results in a change in the behavior that these cues elicit. Individual network components in the mushroom bodies of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster represent cues, learning signals and behavioral outcomes of learned experience. Recent findings have highlighted the importance of dopamine-driven plasticity and activity in feedback and feedforward connections, between various elements of the mushroom body neural network. These computational motifs have been shown to be crucial for long term olfactory memory consolidation, integration of internal states, re-evaluation and updating of learned information. The often recurrent circuit anatomy and a prolonged requirement for activity in parts of these underlying networks, suggest that self-sustained and precisely timed activity is a fundamental feature of network computations in the insect brain. Together these processes allow flies to continuously adjust the content of their learned knowledge and direct their behavior in a way that best represents learned expectations and serves their most pressing current needs. <br /><br />

Numerous genes in the endo-lysosomal pathways have been found to associate with neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Mutations of these genes lead to dysfunction in multiple steps of the endo-lysosomal network: autophagy, endocytic trafficking and lysosomal degradation, resulting in accumulation of pathogenic proteins. Although the exact pathogenic mechanism varies for different disease-associated genes, dysfunction of the endo-lysosomal pathways represents a converging mechanism shared by these diseases. Therefore, strategies that correct or compensate for endo-lysosomal dysfunction may be promising therapeutic approaches to treat neurodegenerative diseases. <br /><br />

Publication date: June 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 50<br />     Author(s): Denis   Scaini, Laura   Ballerini<br /> Interfacing the nervous system with devices able to efficiently record or modulate the electrical activity of neuronal cells represents the underlying foundation of future theranostic applications in neurology and of current openings in neuroscience research. These devices, usually sensing cell activity via microelectrodes, should be characterized by safe working conditions in the biological milieu together with a well-controlled operation-life. The stable device/neuronal electrical coupling at the interface requires tight interactions between the electrode surface and the cell membrane. This neuro-electrode hybrid represents the hyphen between the soft nature of neural tissue, generating electrical signals via ion motions, and the rigid realm of microelectronics and medical devices, dealing with electrons in motion. Efficient integration of these entities is essential for monitoring, analyzing and controlling neuronal signaling but poses significant technological challenges. Improving the cell/electrode interaction and thus the interface performance requires novel engineering of (nano)materials: tuning at the nanoscale electrode's properties may lead to engineer interfacing probes that better camouflaged with their biological target. In this brief review, we highlight the most recent concepts in nanotechnologies and nanomaterials that might help reducing the mismatch between tissue and electrode, focusing on the device's mechanical properties and its biological integration with the tissue. <br /><br />

Publication date: February 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 48<br />     Author(s): Elena   Marcello, Monica   Di Luca, Fabrizio   Gardoni<br /> In the last decade several synaptonuclear protein messengers including Jacob, CRTC1, AIDA-1, ProSaP2/Shank3 and RNF10 have been identified and characterized as key players for modulation of synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity. Activation of excitatory glutamatergic synapses leads to their shuttling from the synapse to the nucleus, mostly importin-mediated, and subsequent regulation of gene transcription needed for long lasting modifications of synaptic function. Accordingly, increasing evidences show that alterations of the activity of synaptonuclear messengers are correlated to synaptic failure as observed in different synaptopathies. Specifically, recent studies demonstrate that the modulation of the activity of synaptonuclear messengers could represent a novel molecular target in the pathogenesis of both neurodevelopmental disorders and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. <br /><br />

Publication date: June 2018<br /> <b>Source:</b>Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 50<br />     Author(s): Mümine   Şentürk, Hugo J   Bellen<br />  Drosophila melanogaster is a genetic model organism that has contributed to the discovery of numerous genes whose human homologues are associated with diseases. The development of sophisticated genetic tools to manipulate its genome accelerates the discovery of the genetic basis of undiagnosed human diseases and the elucidation of molecular pathogenic events of known and novel diseases. Here, we discuss various approaches used in flies to assess the function of the fly homologues of disease-associated genes. We highlight how systematic and combinatorial approaches based on recently established methods provide us with integrated tool sets that can be applied to the study of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. <br /><br />

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div class="para"><p><b>Objective</b>: To visualize and quantify differences of microstructural nerve damage in distal symmetric diabetic neuropathy (DPN) between type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D), and to detect correlations between neuropathic symptoms and serological risk factors.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Methods</b>: 3T magnetic resonance neurography of the sciatic nerve was performed in 120 patients (T1D n=35; T2D n=85) with either DPN (n=84) or no DPN (NDPN; n=36). Results were subsequently correlated with clinical, serological, and electrophysiological patient data.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Results</b>: T2-weighted (T2w) hyperintense lesions correlated negatively with tibial compound motor action potential (r=-0.58; p&lt;0.0001) and peroneal nerve conduction (r=0.51; p=0.0002), and positively with neuropathy disability (NDS; r=-0.54; p&lt;0.0001) and severity score (NSS; r=0.52; p&lt;0.0001), and HbA1c levels (r=0.23; p=0.014). T2w-hypointense lesions correlated positively with NDS, NSS (r=0.28; p=0.002; r=0.36; p&lt;0.0001), and serum triglycerides (r=0.34; p=0.0003), and negatively with serum HDL (r=-0.48; p&lt;0.0001). For DPN in T1D, elevated values of T2w-hyperintense lesions (19.67%<em>±</em>4.13 vs. 12.49%<em>±</em>1.23; p=0.027) and HbA1c (8.74%±0.29 vs. 7.11%±0.16; p&lt;0.0001) were found when compared to T2D. For DPN in T2D, elevated T2w-hypointense lesions (23.41mm<sup>3</sup><em>±</em>2.69 vs. 11.43mm<sup>3</sup><em>±</em>1.74; p=0.046), triglycerides (220.70mg/dl±23.70 vs. 106.60mg/dl±14.51; p&lt;0.0001), and lower serum HDL (51.29mg/dl±3.02 vs. 70.79mg/dl±4.65; p&lt;0.0001) were found when compared to T1D.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Interpretation</b>: The predominant type of nerve lesions in DPN differs between T1D and T2D. Correlations found between lesion type and serological parameters indicate that predominant nerve lesions in T1D are associated with poor glycemic control and loss of nerve conduction, whereas predominant lesions in T2D are associated with changes in lipid metabolism. These findings may be helpful for future studies on the underlying pathophysiological pathways and possible treatments for DPN in T1D and T2D. This article is protected by copyright.

<p>Genetic defects in protein O-mannosyltransferase 1 (POMT1) and POMT2 underlie severe muscular dystrophies. <i>POMT</i> genes are evolutionarily conserved in metazoan organisms. In <i>Drosophila</i>, both male and female <i>POMT</i> mutants show a clockwise rotation of adult abdominal segments, suggesting a chirality of underlying pathogenic mechanisms. Here we described and analyzed a similar phenotype in <i>POMT</i> mutant embryos that shows left-handed body torsion. Our experiments demonstrated that coordinated muscle contraction waves are associated with asymmetric embryo rolling, unveiling a new chirality marker in <i>Drosophila</i> development. Using genetic and live-imaging approaches, we revealed that the torsion phenotype results from differential rolling and aberrant patterning of peristaltic waves of muscle contractions. Our results demonstrated that peripheral sensory neurons are required for normal contractions that prevent the accumulation of torsion. We found that <i>POMT</i> mutants show abnormal axonal connections of sensory neurons. <i>POMT</i> transgenic expression limited to sensory neurons significantly rescued the torsion phenotype, axonal connectivity defects, and abnormal contractions in <i>POMT</i> mutant embryos. Together, our data suggested that protein O-mannosylation is required for normal sensory feedback to control coordinated muscle contractions and body posture. This mechanism may shed light on analogous functions of <i>POMT</i> genes in mammals and help to elucidate the etiology of neurological defects in muscular dystrophies.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Protein O-mannosyltransferases (POMTs) are evolutionarily conserved in metazoans. Mutations in <i>POMTs</i> cause severe muscular dystrophies associated with pronounced neurological defects. However, neurological functions of POMTs remain poorly understood. We demonstrated that <i>POMT</i> mutations in <i>Drosophila</i> result in abnormal muscle contractions and cause embryo torsion. Our experiments uncovered a chirality of embryo movements and a unique <i>POMT</i>-dependent mechanism that maintains symmetry of a developing system affected by chiral forces. Furthermore, <i>POMTs</i> were found to be required for proper axon connectivity of sensory neurons, suggesting that O-mannosylation regulates the sensory feedback controlling muscle contractions. This novel POMT function in the peripheral nervous system may shed light on analogous functions in mammals and help to elucidate pathomechanisms of neurological abnormalities in muscular dystrophies.</p>

<p>Audiovisual (AV) integration is essential for speech comprehension, especially in adverse listening situations. Divergent, but not mutually exclusive, theories have been proposed to explain the neural mechanisms underlying AV integration. One theory advocates that this process occurs via interactions between the auditory and visual cortices, as opposed to fusion of AV percepts in a multisensory integrator. Building upon this idea, we proposed that AV integration in spoken language reflects visually induced weighting of phonetic representations at the auditory cortex. EEG was recorded while male and female human subjects watched and listened to videos of a speaker uttering consonant vowel (CV) syllables /ba/ and /fa/, presented in Auditory-only, AV congruent or incongruent contexts. Subjects reported whether they heard /ba/ or /fa/. We hypothesized that vision alters phonetic encoding by dynamically weighting which phonetic representation in the auditory cortex is strengthened or weakened. That is, when subjects are presented with visual /fa/ and acoustic /ba/ and hear /fa/ (<i>illusion-fa</i>), the visual input strengthens the weighting of the phone /f/ representation. When subjects are presented with visual /ba/ and acoustic /fa/ and hear /ba/ (<i>illusion-ba</i>), the visual input weakens the weighting of the phone /f/ representation. Indeed, we found an enlarged N1 auditory evoked potential when subjects perceived <i>illusion-ba</i>, and a reduced N1 when they perceived <i>illusion-fa</i>, mirroring the N1 behavior for /ba/ and /fa/ in Auditory-only settings. These effects were especially pronounced in individuals with more robust illusory perception. These findings provide evidence that visual speech modifies phonetic encoding at the auditory cortex.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The current study presents evidence that audiovisual integration in spoken language occurs when one modality (vision) acts on representations of a second modality (audition). Using the McGurk illusion, we show that visual context primes phonetic representations at the auditory cortex, altering the auditory percept, evidenced by changes in the N1 auditory evoked potential. This finding reinforces the theory that audiovisual integration occurs via visual networks influencing phonetic representations in the auditory cortex. We believe that this will lead to the generation of new hypotheses regarding cross-modal mapping, particularly whether it occurs via direct or indirect routes (e.g., via a multisensory mediator).</p>

<p>Repeated sequences of neural activity are a pervasive feature of neural networks <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i>. In the hippocampus, sequential firing of many neurons over periods of 100–300 ms reoccurs during behavior and during periods of quiescence. However, it is not known whether the hippocampus produces longer sequences of activity or whether such sequences are restricted to specific network states. Furthermore, whether long repeated patterns of activity are transmitted to single cells downstream is unclear. To answer these questions, we recorded intracellularly from hippocampal CA1 of awake, behaving male mice to examine both subthreshold activity and spiking output in single neurons. In eight of nine recordings, we discovered long (900 ms) reoccurring subthreshold fluctuations or "repeats." Repeats generally were high-amplitude, nonoscillatory events reoccurring with 10 ms precision. Using statistical controls, we determined that repeats occurred more often than would be expected from unstructured network activity (e.g., by chance). Most spikes occurred during a repeat, and when a repeat contained a spike, the spike reoccurred with precision on the order of ≤20 ms, showing that long repeated patterns of subthreshold activity are strongly connected to spike output. Unexpectedly, we found that repeats occurred independently of classic hippocampal network states like theta oscillations or sharp-wave ripples. Together, these results reveal surprisingly long patterns of repeated activity in the hippocampal network that occur nonstochastically, are transmitted to single downstream neurons, and strongly shape their output. This suggests that the timescale of information transmission in the hippocampal network is much longer than previously thought.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We found long (≥900 ms), repeated, subthreshold patterns of activity in CA1 of awake, behaving mice. These repeated patterns ("repeats") occurred more often than expected by chance and with 10 ms precision. Most spikes occurred within repeats and reoccurred with a precision on the order of 20 ms. Surprisingly, there was no correlation between repeat occurrence and classical network states such as theta oscillations and sharp-wave ripples. These results provide strong evidence that long patterns of activity are repeated and transmitted to downstream neurons, suggesting that the hippocampus can generate longer sequences of repeated activity than previously thought.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/7/1802?rss=1">Sox2 Is Essential for Oligodendroglial Proliferation and Differentiation during Postnatal Brain Myelination and CNS Remyelination</a></h4>

<p>In the CNS, myelination and remyelination depend on the successful progression and maturation of oligodendroglial lineage cells, including proliferation and differentiation of oligodendroglial progenitor cells (OPCs). Previous studies have reported that Sox2 transiently regulates oligodendrocyte (OL) differentiation in the embryonic and perinatal spinal cord and appears dispensable for myelination in the postnatal spinal cord. However, the role of Sox2 in OL development in the brain has yet to be defined. We now report that Sox2 is an essential positive regulator of developmental myelination in the postnatal murine brain of both sexes. Stage-specific paradigms of genetic disruption demonstrated that Sox2 regulated brain myelination by coordinating upstream OPC population supply and downstream OL differentiation. Transcriptomic analyses further supported a crucial role of Sox2 in brain developmental myelination. Consistently, oligodendroglial Sox2-deficient mice developed severe tremors and ataxia, typical phenotypes indicative of hypomyelination, and displayed severe impairment of motor function and prominent deficits of brain OL differentiation and myelination persisting into the later CNS developmental stages. We also found that Sox2 was required for efficient OPC proliferation and expansion and OL regeneration during remyelination in the adult brain and spinal cord. Together, our genetic evidence reveals an essential role of Sox2 in brain myelination and CNS remyelination, and suggests that manipulation of Sox2 and/or Sox2-mediated downstream pathways may be therapeutic in promoting CNS myelin repair.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Promoting myelin formation and repair has translational significance in treating myelin-related neurological disorders, such as periventricular leukomalacia and multiple sclerosis in which brain developmental myelin formation and myelin repair are severely affected, respectively. In this report, analyses of a series of genetic conditional knock-out systems targeting different oligodendrocyte stages reveal a previously unappreciated role of Sox2 in coordinating upstream proliferation and downstream differentiation of oligodendroglial lineage cells in the mouse brain during developmental myelination and CNS remyelination. Our study points to the potential of manipulating Sox2 and its downstream pathways to promote oligodendrocyte regeneration and CNS myelin repair.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/7/1788?rss=1">Nonlinear Relationship Between Spike-Dependent Calcium Influx and TRPC Channel Activation Enables Robust Persistent Spiking in Neurons of the Anterior Cingulate Cortex</a></h4>

<p>Continuation of spiking after a stimulus ends (i.e. persistent spiking) is thought to support working memory. Muscarinic receptor activation enables persistent spiking among synaptically isolated pyramidal neurons in anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), but a detailed characterization of that spiking is lacking and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we show that the rate of persistent spiking in ACC neurons is insensitive to the intensity and number of triggers, but can be modulated by injected current, and that persistent spiking can resume after several seconds of hyperpolarization-imposed quiescence. Using electrophysiology and calcium imaging in brain slices from male rats, we determined that canonical transient receptor potential (TRPC) channels are necessary for persistent spiking and that TRPC-activating calcium enters in a spike-dependent manner via voltage-gated calcium channels. Constrained by these biophysical details, we built a computational model that reproduced the observed pattern of persistent spiking. Nonlinear dynamical analysis of that model revealed that TRPC channels become fully activated by the small rise in intracellular calcium caused by evoked spikes. Calcium continues to rise during persistent spiking, but because TRPC channel activation saturates, firing rate stabilizes. By calcium rising higher than required for maximal TRPC channel activation, TRPC channels are able to remain active during periods of hyperpolarization-imposed quiescence (until calcium drops below saturating levels) such that persistent spiking can resume when hyperpolarization is discontinued. Our results thus reveal that the robust intrinsic bistability exhibited by ACC neurons emerges from the nonlinear positive feedback relationship between spike-dependent calcium influx and TRPC channel activation.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Neurons use action potentials, or spikes, to encode information. Some neurons can store information for short periods (seconds to minutes) by continuing to spike after a stimulus ends, thus enabling working memory. This so-called "persistent" spiking occurs in many brain areas and has been linked to activation of canonical transient receptor potential (TRPC) channels. However, TRPC activation alone is insufficient to explain many aspects of persistent spiking such as resumption of spiking after periods of imposed quiescence. Using experiments and simulations, we show that calcium influx caused by spiking is necessary and sufficient to activate TRPC channels and that the ensuing positive feedback interaction between intracellular calcium and TRPC channel activation can account for many hitherto unexplained aspects of persistent spiking.</p>

<p>This study addresses one long-standing question of whether functional separations are preserved for somatosensory modalities of touch, heat, and cold nociception within primate primary somatosensory (S1) cortex. This information is critical for understanding how the nature of pain is represented in the primate brain. Using a combination of submillimeter-resolution fMRI and microelectrode local field potential (LFP) and spike recordings, we identified spatially segregated cortical zones for processing touch and nociceptive heat and cold stimuli in somatotopically appropriate areas 3a, 3b, 1, and 2 of S1 in male monkeys. The distances between zones were comparable (~3.4 mm) across stimulus modalities (heat, cold, and tactile), indicating the existence of uniform, modality-specific modules. Stimulus-evoked LFP maps validated the fMRI maps in areas 3b and 1. Isolation of heat and cold nociceptive neurons from the fMRI zones confirmed the validity of using fMRI to probe nociceptive regions and circuits. Resting-state fMRI analysis revealed distinct intrinsic functional circuits among functionally related zones. We discovered distinct modular structures and networks for thermal nociception within S1 cortex, a finding that has significant implications for studying chronic pain syndromes and guiding the selection of neuromodulation targets for chronic pain management.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Primate S1 subregions contain discrete heat and cold nociceptive modules. Modules with the same properties exhibit strong functional connection. Nociceptive fMRI response coincides with LFP and spike activities of nociceptive neurons. Functional separation of heat and cold pain is retained within primate S1 cortex.</p>

<p>Potassium voltage-gated channel interacting protein 3 (KChIP3), also termed downstream regulatory element antagonist modulator (DREAM) and calsenilin, is a multifunctional protein belonging to the neuronal calcium sensor (NCS) family. Recent studies revealed the expression of KChIP3 in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, suggesting the potential role of KChIP3 in peripheral sensory processing. Herein, we show that KChIP3 colocalizes with transient receptor potential ion channel V1 (TRPV1), a critical molecule involved in peripheral sensitization during inflammatory pain. Furthermore, the N-terminal 31-50 fragment of KChIP3 is capable of binding both the intracellular N and C termini of TRPV1, which substantially decreases the surface localization of TRPV1 and the subsequent Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through the channel. Importantly, intrathecal administration of the transmembrane peptide transactivator of transcription (TAT)-31-50 remarkably reduces Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx via TRPV1 in DRG neurons and alleviates thermal hyperalgesia and gait alterations in a complete Freund's adjuvant-induced inflammatory pain model in male rats. Moreover, intraplantar injection of TAT-31-50 attenuated the capsaicin-evoked spontaneous pain behavior and thermal hyperalgesia, which further strengthened the regulatory role of TAT-31-50 on TRPV1 channel. In addition, TAT-31-50 could also alleviate inflammatory thermal hyperalgesia in <i>kcnip3</i><sup>–/–</sup> rats generated in our study, suggesting that the analgesic effect mediated by TAT-31-50 is independent of endogenous KChIP3. Our study reveals a novel peripheral mechanism for the analgesic function of KChIP3 and provides a potential analgesic agent, TAT-31-50, for the treatment of inflammatory pain.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Inflammatory pain arising from inflamed or injured tissues significantly compromises the quality of life in patients. This study aims to elucidate the role of peripheral potassium channel interacting protein 3 (KChIP3) in inflammatory pain. Direct interaction of the KChIP3 N-terminal 31-50 fragment with transient receptor potential ion channel V1 (TRPV1) was demonstrated. The KChIP3–TRPV1 interaction reduces the surface localization of TRPV1 and thus alleviates heat hyperalgesia and gait alterations induced by peripheral inflammation. Furthermore, the transmembrane transactivator of transcription (TAT)-31-50 peptide showed analgesic effects on inflammatory hyperalgesia independently of endogenous KChIP3. This work reveals a novel mechanism of peripheral KChIP3 in inflammatory hyperalgesia that is distinct from its classical role as a transcriptional repressor in pain modulation.</p>

<p>Memory performance is highly variable among individuals. Most studies examining human memory, however, have largely focused on the neural correlates of successful memory formation within individuals, rather than the differences among them. As such, what gives rise to this variability is poorly understood. Here, we examined intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings captured from 43 participants (23 male) implanted with subdural electrodes for seizure monitoring as they performed a paired-associates verbal memory task. We identified three separate but related signatures of neural activity that tracked differences in successful memory formation across individuals. High-performing individuals consistently exhibited less broadband power, flatter power spectral density slopes, and greater complexity in their iEEG signals. Furthermore, within individuals across three separate time scales ranging from seconds to days, successful recall was positively associated with these same metrics. Our data therefore suggest that memory ability across individuals can be indexed by increased neural signal complexity.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We show that participants whose intracranial EEG exhibits less low-frequency power, flatter power spectrums, and greater sample entropy overall are better able to memorize associations, and that the same metrics track fluctuations in memory performance across time within individuals. These metrics together signify greater neural signal complexity, which may index the brain's ability to flexibly engage with information and generate separable memory representations. Critically, the current set of results provides a unique window into the neural markers of individual differences in memory performance, which have hitherto been underexplored.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/7/1737?rss=1">The Primary Role of Flow Processing in the Identification of Scene-Relative Object Movement</a></h4>

<p>Retinal image motion could be due to the movement of the observer through space or an object relative to the scene. Optic flow, form, and change of position cues all provide information that could be used to separate out retinal motion due to object movement from retinal motion due to observer movement. In Experiment 1, we used a minimal display to examine the contribution of optic flow and form cues. Human participants indicated the direction of movement of a probe object presented against a background of radially moving pairs of dots. By independently controlling the orientation of each dot pair, we were able to put flow cues to self-movement direction (the point from which all the motion radiated) and form cues to self-movement direction (the point toward which all the dot pairs were oriented) in conflict. We found that only flow cues influenced perceived probe movement. In Experiment 2, we switched to a rich stereo display composed of 3D objects to examine the contribution of flow and position cues. We moved the scene objects to simulate a lateral translation and counter-rotation of gaze. By changing the polarity of the scene objects (from light to dark and vice versa) between frames, we placed flow cues to self-movement direction in opposition to change of position cues. We found that again flow cues dominated the perceived probe movement relative to the scene. Together, these experiments indicate the neural network that processes optic flow has a primary role in the identification of scene-relative object movement.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Motion of an object in the retinal image indicates relative movement between the observer and the object, but it does not indicate its cause: movement of an object in the scene; movement of the observer; or both. To isolate retinal motion due to movement of a scene object, the brain must parse out the retinal motion due to movement of the eye ("flow parsing"). Optic flow, form, and position cues all have potential roles in this process. We pitted the cues against each other and assessed their influence. We found that flow parsing relies on optic flow alone. These results indicate the primary role of the neural network that processes optic flow in the identification of scene-relative object movement.</p>

<p>Block of neurotransmitter receptors at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) has been shown to trigger upregulation of the number of synaptic vesicles released (quantal content, QC), a response termed homeostatic synaptic plasticity. The mechanism underlying this plasticity is not known. Here, we used selective toxins to demonstrate that block of α1-containing nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) at the NMJ of male and female mice triggers the upregulation of QC. Reduction of current flow through nAChRs, induced by drugs with antagonist activity, demonstrated that reduction in synaptic current <i>per se</i> does not trigger upregulation of QC. These data led to the remarkable conclusion that disruption of synaptic transmission is not sensed to trigger upregulation of QC. During studies of the effect of partial block of nAChRs on QC, we observed a small but reproducible increase in the decay kinetics of miniature synaptic currents. The change in kinetics was correlated with the increase in QC and raises the possibility that a change in postsynaptic nAChR conformation may be associated with the presynaptic increase in QC. We propose that, in addition to functioning in synaptic transmission, ionotropic muscle nicotonic nAChRs may serve as signaling molecules that participate in synaptic plasticity. Because nAChRs have been implicated in a number of disease states, the finding that nAChRs may be involved in triggering synaptic plasticity could have wide-reaching implications.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The signals that initiate synaptic plasticity of the nervous system are still incompletely understood. Using the mouse neuromuscular junction as a model synapse, we studied how block of neurotransmitter receptors is sensed to trigger synaptic plasticity. Our studies led to the surprising conclusion that neither changes in synaptic current nor spiking of the presynaptic or postsynaptic cell are sensed to initiate synaptic plasticity. Instead, postsynaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), in addition to functioning in synaptic transmission, may serve as signaling molecules that trigger synaptic plasticity. Because nAChRs have been implicated in a number of disease states, the finding that they may mediate synaptic plasticity has broad implications.</p>

<p>The sparse single-spike activity of dentate gyrus granule cells (DG GCs) is punctuated by occasional brief bursts of 3–7 action potentials. It is well-known that such presynaptic bursts in individual mossy fibers (MFs; axons of granule cells) are often able to discharge postsynaptic CA3 pyramidal cells due to powerful short-term facilitation. However, what happens in the CA3 network after the passage of a brief MF burst, before the arrival of the next burst or solitary spike, is not understood. Because MFs innervate significantly more CA3 interneurons than pyramidal cells, we focused on unitary MF responses in identified interneurons in the seconds-long postburst period, using paired recordings in rat hippocampal slices. Single bursts as short as 5 spikes in &lt;30 ms in individual presynaptic MFs caused a sustained, large increase (tripling) in the amplitude of the unitary MF-EPSCs for several seconds in ivy, axo-axonic/chandelier and basket interneurons. The postburst unitary MF-EPSCs in these feedforward interneurons reached amplitudes that were even larger than the MF-EPSCs during the bursts in the same cells. In contrast, no comparable postburst enhancement of MF-EPSCs could be observed in pyramidal cells or nonfeedforward interneurons. The robust postburst increase in MF-EPSCs in feedforward interneurons was associated with significant shortening of the unitary synaptic delay and large downstream increases in disynaptic IPSCs in pyramidal cells. These results reveal a new cell type-specific plasticity that enables even solitary brief bursts in single GCs to powerfully enhance inhibition at the DG-CA3 interface in the seconds-long time-scales of interburst intervals.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The hippocampal formation is a brain region that plays key roles in spatial navigation and learning and memory. The first stage of information processing occurs in the dentate gyrus, where principal cells are remarkably quiet, discharging low-frequency single action potentials interspersed with occasional brief bursts of spikes. Such bursts, in particular, have attracted a lot of attention because they appear to be critical for efficient coding, storage, and recall of information. We show that single bursts of a few spikes in individual granule cells result in seconds-long potentiation of excitatory inputs to downstream interneurons. Thus, while it has been known that bursts powerfully discharge ("detonate") hippocampal excitatory cells, this study clarifies that they also regulate inhibition during the interburst intervals.</p>

<p>Fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs) exert powerful inhibitory control over the striatum and are hypothesized to balance the massive excitatory cortical and thalamic input to this structure. We recorded neuronal activity in the dorsolateral striatum and globus pallidus (GP) concurrently with the detailed movement kinematics of freely behaving female rats before and after selective inhibition of FSI activity using IEM-1460 microinjections. The inhibition led to the appearance of episodic rest tremor in the body part that depended on the somatotopic location of the injection within the striatum. The tremor was accompanied by coherent oscillations in the local field potential (LFP). Individual neuron activity patterns became oscillatory and coherent in the tremor frequency. Striatal neurons, but not GP neurons, displayed additional temporal, nonoscillatory correlations. The subsequent reduction in the corticostriatal input following muscimol injection to the corresponding somatotopic location in the primary motor cortex led to disruption of the tremor and a reduction of the LFP oscillations and individual neuron's phase-locked activity. The breakdown of the normal balance of excitation and inhibition in the striatum has been shown previously to be related to different motor abnormalities. Our results further indicate that the balance between excitatory corticostriatal input and feedforward FSI inhibition is sufficient to break down the striatal decorrelation process and generate oscillations resulting in rest tremor typical of multiple basal ganglia disorders.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs) play a key role in normal striatal processing by exerting powerful inhibitory control over the network. FSI malfunctions have been associated with abnormal processing of information within the striatum that leads to multiple movement disorders. Here, we study the changes in neuronal activity and movement kinematics following selective inhibition of these neurons. The injections led to the appearance of episodic rest tremor, accompanied by coherent oscillations in neuronal activity, which was reversed following corticostriatal inhibition. These results suggest that the balance between corticostriatal excitation and feedforward FSI inhibition is crucial for maintaining the striatal decorrelation process, and that its breakdown leads to the formation of oscillations resulting in rest tremor typical of multiple basal ganglia disorders.</p>

<p>The structural and functional integrity of subgenual cingulate area 25 (A25) is crucial for emotional expression and equilibrium. A25 has a key role in affective networks, and its disruption has been linked to mood disorders, but its cortical connections have yet to be systematically or fully studied. Using neural tracers in rhesus monkeys, we found that A25 was densely connected with other ventromedial and posterior orbitofrontal areas associated with emotions and homeostasis. A moderate pathway linked A25 with frontopolar area 10, an area associated with complex cognition, which may regulate emotions and dampen negative affect. Beyond the frontal lobe, A25 was connected with auditory association areas and memory-related medial temporal cortices, and with the interoceptive-related anterior insula. A25 mostly targeted the superficial cortical layers of other areas, where broadly dispersed terminations comingled with modulatory inhibitory or disinhibitory microsystems, suggesting a dominant excitatory effect. The architecture and connections suggest that A25 is the consummate feedback system in the PFC. Conversely, in the entorhinal cortex, A25 pathways terminated in the middle-deep layers amid a strong local inhibitory microenvironment, suggesting gating of hippocampal output to other cortices and memory storage. The graded cortical architecture and associated laminar patterns of connections suggest how areas, layers, and functionally distinct classes of inhibitory neurons can be recruited dynamically to meet task demands. The complement of cortical connections of A25 with areas associated with memory, emotion, and somatic homeostasis provide the circuit basis to understand its vulnerability in psychiatric and neurologic disorders.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Integrity of the prefrontal subgenual cingulate cortex is crucial for healthy emotional function. Subgenual area 25 (A25) is mostly linked with other prefrontal areas associated with emotion in a dense network positioned to recruit large fields of cortex. In healthy states, A25 is associated with internal states, autonomic function, and transient negative affect. Constant hyperactivity in A25 is a biomarker for depression in humans and may trigger extensive activation in its dominant connections with areas associated with emotions and internal balance. A pathway between A25 and frontopolar area 10 may provide a critical link to regulate emotions and dampen persistent negative affect, which may be explored for therapeutic intervention in depression.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/7/1662?rss=1">BMP/SMAD Pathway Promotes Neurogenesis of Midbrain Dopaminergic Neurons In Vivo and in Human Induced Pluripotent and Neural Stem Cells</a></h4>

<p>The embryonic formation of midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neurons <i>in vivo</i> provides critical guidelines for the <i>in vitro</i> differentiation of mDA neurons from stem cells, which are currently being developed for Parkinson's disease cell replacement therapy. Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)/SMAD inhibition is routinely used during early steps of stem cell differentiation protocols, including for the generation of mDA neurons. However, the function of the BMP/SMAD pathway for <i>in vivo</i> specification of mammalian mDA neurons is virtually unknown. Here, we report that BMP5/7-deficient mice (<i>Bmp5</i><sup>–/–</sup>; <i>Bmp7</i><sup>–/–</sup>) lack mDA neurons due to reduced neurogenesis in the mDA progenitor domain. As molecular mechanisms accounting for these alterations in <i>Bmp5</i><sup>–/–</sup>; <i>Bmp7</i><sup>–/–</sup> mutants, we have identified expression changes of the BMP/SMAD target genes MSX1/2 (msh homeobox 1/2) and SHH (sonic hedgehog). Conditionally inactivating SMAD1 in neural stem cells of mice <i>in vivo</i> (<i>Smad1</i><sup>Nes</sup>) hampered the differentiation of progenitor cells into mDA neurons by preventing cell cycle exit, especially of TH<sup>+</sup>SOX6<sup>+</sup> (tyrosine hydroxylase, SRY-box 6) and TH<sup>+</sup>GIRK2<sup>+</sup> (potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily-J member-6) substantia nigra neurons. BMP5/7 robustly increased the <i>in vitro</i> differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells and induced neural stem cells to mDA neurons by up to threefold. In conclusion, we have identified BMP/SMAD signaling as a novel critical pathway orchestrating essential steps of mammalian mDA neurogenesis <i>in vivo</i> that balances progenitor proliferation and differentiation. Moreover, we demonstrate the potential of BMPs to improve the generation of stem-cell-derived mDA neurons <i>in vitro</i>, highlighting the importance of sequential BMP/SMAD inhibition and activation in this process.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We identify bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)/SMAD signaling as a novel essential pathway regulating the development of mammalian midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neurons <i>in vivo</i> and provide insights into the molecular mechanisms of this process. BMP5/7 regulate MSX1/2 (msh homeobox 1/2) and SHH (sonic hedgehog) expression to direct mDA neurogenesis. Moreover, the BMP signaling component SMAD1 controls the differentiation of mDA progenitors, particularly to substantia nigra neurons, by directing their cell cycle exit. Importantly, BMP5/7 increase robustly the differentiation of human induced pluripotent and induced neural stem cells to mDA neurons. BMP/SMAD are routinely inhibited in initial stages of stem cell differentiation protocols currently being developed for Parkinson's disease cell replacement therapies. Therefore, our findings on opposing roles of the BMP/SMAD pathway during <i>in vitro</i> mDA neurogenesis might improve these procedures significantly.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/7/1648?rss=1">Sensorimotor Functional and Structural Networks after Intracerebral Stem Cell Grafts in the Ischemic Mouse Brain</a></h4>

<p>Past investigations on stem cell-mediated recovery after stroke have limited their focus on the extent and morphological development of the ischemic lesion itself over time or on the integration capacity of the stem cell graft <i>ex vivo</i>. However, an assessment of the long-term functional and structural improvement <i>in vivo</i> is essential to reliably quantify the regenerative capacity of cell implantation after stroke. We induced ischemic stroke in nude mice and implanted human neural stem cells (H9 derived) into the ipsilateral cortex in the acute phase. Functional and structural connectivity changes of the sensorimotor network were noninvasively monitored using magnetic resonance imaging for 3 months after stem cell implantation. A sharp decrease of the functional sensorimotor network extended even to the contralateral hemisphere, persisting for the whole 12 weeks of observation. In mice with stem cell implantation, functional networks were stabilized early on, pointing to a paracrine effect as an early supportive mechanism of the graft. This stabilization required the persistent vitality of the stem cells, monitored by bioluminescence imaging. Thus, we also observed deterioration of the early network stabilization upon vitality loss of the graft after a few weeks. Structural connectivity analysis showed fiber-density increases between the cortex and white matter regions occurring predominantly on the ischemic hemisphere. These fiber-density changes were nearly the same for both study groups. This motivated us to hypothesize that the stem cells can influence, via early paracrine effect, the functional networks, while observed structural changes are mainly stimulated by the ischemic event.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In recent years, research on strokes has made a shift away from a focus on immediate ischemic effects and towards an emphasis on the long-range effects of the lesion on the whole brain. Outcome improvements in stem cell therapies also require the understanding of their influence on the whole-brain networks. Here, we have longitudinally and noninvasively monitored the structural and functional network alterations in the mouse model of focal cerebral ischemia. Structural changes of fiber-density increases are stimulated in the endogenous tissue without further modulation by the stem cells, while functional networks are stabilized by the stem cells via a paracrine effect. These results will help decipher the underlying networks of brain plasticity in response to cerebral lesions and offer clues to unravelling the mystery of how stem cells mediate regeneration.</p>

<p>Reduced activity of vagal efferents has long been implicated in schizophrenia and appears to be responsible for diminished parasympathetic activity and associated peripheral symptoms such as low heart rate variability and cardiovascular complications in affected individuals. In contrast, only little attention has been paid to the possibility that impaired afferent vagal signaling may be relevant for the disorder's pathophysiology as well. The present study explored this hypothesis using a model of subdiaphragmatic vagal deafferentation (SDA) in male rats. SDA represents the most complete and selective vagal deafferentation method existing to date as it leads to complete disconnection of all abdominal vagal afferents while sparing half of the abdominal vagal efferents. Using next-generation mRNA sequencing, we show that SDA leads to brain transcriptional changes in functional networks annotating with schizophrenia. We further demonstrate that SDA induces a hyperdopaminergic state, which manifests itself as increased sensitivity to acute amphetamine treatment and elevated accumbal levels of dopamine and its major metabolite, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid. Our study also shows that SDA impairs sensorimotor gating and the attentional control of associative learning, which were assessed using the paradigms of prepulse inhibition and latent inhibition, respectively. These data provide converging evidence suggesting that the brain transcriptome, dopamine neurochemistry, and behavioral functions implicated in schizophrenia are subject to visceral modulation through abdominal vagal afferents. Our findings may encourage the further establishment and use of therapies for schizophrenia that are based on vagal interventions.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The present work provides a better understanding of how disrupted vagal afferent signaling can contribute to schizophrenia-related brain and behavioral abnormalities. More specifically, it shows that subdiaphragmatic vagal deafferentation (SDA) in rats leads to (1) brain transcriptional changes in functional networks related to schizophrenia, (2) increased sensitivity to dopamine-stimulating drugs and elevated dopamine levels in the nucleus accumbens, and (3) impairments in sensorimotor gating and the attentional control of associative learning. These findings may encourage the further establishment of novel therapies for schizophrenia that are based on vagal interventions.</p>

<p>Inhibitory interneurons represent 10–15% of the neurons in the somatosensory cortex, and their activity powerfully shapes sensory processing. Three major groups of GABAergic interneurons have been defined according to developmental, molecular, morphological, electrophysiological, and synaptic features. Dendritic-targeting somatostatin-expressing interneurons (SST-INs) have been shown to display diverse morphological, electrophysiological, and molecular properties and activity patterns <i>in vivo</i>. However, the correlation between these properties and SST-IN subtype is unclear. In this study, we aimed to correlate the morphological diversity of layer 5 (L5) SST-INs with their electrophysiological and molecular diversity in mice of either sex. Our morphological analysis demonstrated the existence of three subtypes of L5 SST-INs with distinct electrophysiological properties: T-shaped Martinotti cells innervate L1, and are low-threshold spiking; fanning-out Martinotti cells innervate L2/3 and the lower half of L1, and show adapting firing patterns; non-Martinotti cells innervate L4, and show a quasi-fast spiking firing pattern. We estimated the proportion of each subtype in L5 and found that T-shaped Martinotti, fanning-out Martinotti, and Non-Martinotti cells represent ~10, ~50, and ~40% of L5 SST-INs, respectively. Last, we examined the connectivity between the three SST-IN subtypes and L5 pyramidal cells (PCs). We found that L5 T-shaped Martinotti cells inhibit the L1 apical tuft of nearby PCs; L5 fanning-out Martinotti cells also inhibit nearby PCs but they target the dendrite mainly in L2/3. On the other hand, non-Martinotti cells inhibit the dendrites of L4 neurons while avoiding L5 PCs. Our data suggest that morphologically distinct SST-INs gate different excitatory inputs in the barrel cortex.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Morphologically diverse layer 5 SST-INs show different patterns of activity in behaving animals. However, little is known about the abundance and connectivity of each morphological type and the correlation between morphological subtype and spiking properties. We demonstrate a correlation between the morphological and electrophysiological diversity of layer 5 SST-INs. Based on these findings we built a classifier to infer the abundance of each morphological subtype. Last, using paired recordings combined with morphological analysis, we investigated the connectivity of each morphological subtype. Our data suggest that, by targeting different cell types and cellular compartments, morphologically diverse SST-INs might gate different excitatory inputs in the mouse barrel cortex.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/7/1611?rss=1">LRRK2 G2019S Induces Anxiety/Depression-like Behavior before the Onset of Motor Dysfunction with 5-HT1A Receptor Upregulation in Mice</a></h4>

<p>Mutations in the <i>leucine-rich repeat kinase 2</i> (<i>LRRK2</i>) gene are the most common genetic cause of Parkinson's disease (PD). The neuropathology of <i>LRRK2</i> mutation-related PD, including increased dopaminergic neurodegeneration and Lewy bodies, is indistinguishable from that of idiopathic PD. The subtle nonmotor phenotypes of <i>LRRK2</i> mutation-related PD have not been fully evaluated. In the present study, we examined anxiety/depression-like behaviors and accompanying neurochemical changes in differently aged transgenic (Tg) mice expressing human mutant LRRK2 G2019S. Through multiple behavioral tests, including light–dark test, elevated plus maze, sucrose preference test, forced swimming test, and tail-suspension test, we found that anxiety/depression-like behavior appeared in middle-aged (43–52 weeks) Tg mice before the onset of PD-like motor dysfunction. These behavioral tests were performed using both male and female mice, and there were no sex-related differences in behavioral changes in the middle-aged Tg mice. Along with behavioral changes, serotonin levels also significantly declined in the hippocampus of Tg mice. Additionally, increases in the expression of the 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor (5-HT<sub>1A</sub>R) grew more significant with aging and were detected in the hippocampus, amygdala, and dorsal raphe nucleus. <i>In vitro</i> study using the serotonergic RN46A and hippocampal HT22 cells showed that 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>R upregulation was related to enhanced expression of LRRK2 G2019S and was attenuated by the LRRK2 inhibitor LRRK2-IN-1. Wild-type LRRK2 had no significant effect on 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>R transcription. The present study provides the first <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> evidence demonstrating abnormal regulation of 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>R along with the manifestation of anxiety/depression-like, nonmotor symptom in PD related to LRRK2.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Parkinson's disease (PD), the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, is clinically characterized by motor dysfunctions. In most cases, various nonmotor symptoms present several years before the onset of the classical motor features of PD and severely affect the quality of life of patients. Here, we demonstrate the causative role of <i>leucine-rich repeat kinase 2</i> (<i>LRRK2</i>), a common PD-linked mutation, in the development of anxiety/depression-like behaviors. We found that age-dependent 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor upregulation in the hippocampus, amygdala, and dorsal raphe nucleus is accompanied by the expression of the <i>LRRK2</i> mutant phenotype. Our findings demonstrating a potential mechanism for nonmotor psychiatric symptoms produced by <i>LRRK2</i> mutation suggest that directly targeting the 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor can improve the therapeutic efficacy of drugs for PD-associated depression.</p>

<p>Neurons process information by transforming barrages of synaptic inputs into
spiking activity. Synaptic inhibition suppresses the output firing activity of
a neuron, and is commonly classified as having a subtractive or divisive effect
on a neuron's output firing activity. Subtractive inhibition can narrow the
range of inputs that evoke spiking activity by eliminating responses to
non-preferred inputs. Divisive inhibition is a form of gain control: it
modifies firing rates while preserving the range of inputs that evoke firing
activity. Since these two "modes" of inhibition have distinct impacts on neural
coding, it is important to understand the biophysical mechanisms that
distinguish these response profiles.
</p>
<p>We use simulations and mathematical analysis of a neuron model to find the
specific conditions for which inhibitory inputs have subtractive or divisive
effects. We identify a novel role for the A-type Potassium current (IA). In our
model, this fast-activating, slowly- inactivating outward current acts as a
switch between subtractive and divisive inhibition. If IA is strong (large
maximal conductance) and fast (activates on a time-scale similar to spike
initiation), then inhibition has a subtractive effect on neural firing. In
contrast, if IA is weak or insufficiently fast-activating, then inhibition has
a divisive effect on neural firing. We explain these findings using dynamical
systems methods to define how a spike threshold condition depends on synaptic
inputs and IA.
</p>
<p>Our findings suggest that neurons can "self-regulate" the gain control
effects of inhibition via combinations of synaptic plasticity and/or modulation
of the conductance and kinetics of A-type Potassium channels. This novel role
for IA would add flexibility to neurons and networks, and may relate to recent
observations of divisive inhibitory effects on neurons in the nucleus of the
solitary tract.

<p>Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) is an effective tool for the analysis of
structural brain connectivity in normal development and in a broad range of
brain disorders. However efforts to derive inherent characteristics of
structural brain networks have been hampered by the very high dimensionality of
the data, relatively small sample sizes, and the lack of widely acceptable
connectivity-based regions of interests (ROIs). Typical approaches have focused
either on regions defined by standard anatomical atlases that do not
incorporate anatomical connectivity, or have been based on voxel-wise analysis,
which results in loss of statistical power relative to structure-wise
connectivity analysis. In this work, we propose a novel, computationally
efficient iterative clustering method to generate connectivity-based
whole-brain parcellations that converge to a stable parcellation in a few
iterations. Our algorithm is based on a sparse representation of the whole
brain connectivity matrix, which reduces the number of edges from around a half
billion to a few million while incorporating the necessary spatial constraints.
We show that the resulting regions in a sense capture the inherent connectivity
information present in the data, and are stable with respect to initialization
and the randomization scheme within the algorithm. These parcellations provide
consistent structural regions across the subjects of population samples that
are homogeneous with respect to anatomic connectivity. Our method also derives
connectivity structures that can be used to distinguish between population
samples with known different structural connectivity. In particular, new
results in structural differences for different population samples such as
Females vs Males, Normal Controls vs Schizophrenia, and different age groups in
Normal Controls are also shown.

<p>Technology is increasingly shaping our social structures and is becoming a
driving force in altering human biology. Besides, human activities already
proved to have a significant impact on the Earth system which in turn generates
complex feedback loops between social and ecological systems. Furthermore,
since our species evolved relatively fast from small groups of hunter-gatherers
to large and technology-intensive urban agglomerations, it is not a surprise
that the major institutions of human society are no longer fit to cope with the
present complexity. In this note we draw foundational parallelisms between
neurophysiological systems and ICT-enabled social systems, discussing how
frameworks rooted in biology and physics could provide heuristic value in the
design of evolutionary systems relevant to politics and economics. In this
regard we highlight how the governance of emerging technology (i.e.
nanotechnology, biotechnology, information technology, and cognitive science),
and the one of climate change both presently confront us with a number of
connected challenges. In particular: historically high level of inequality; the
co-existence of growing multipolar cultural systems in an unprecedentedly
connected world; the unlikely reaching of the institutional agreements required
to deviate abnormal trajectories of development. We argue that wise general
solutions to such interrelated issues should embed the deep understanding of
how to elicit mutual incentives in the socio-economic subsystems of Earth
system in order to jointly concur to a global utility function (e.g. avoiding
the reach of planetary boundaries and widespread social unrest). We leave some
open questions on how techno-social systems can effectively learn and adapt
with respect to our understanding of geopolitical complexity.

It is widely assumed that cells must be physically isolated to study their molecular profiles. However, intact tissue samples naturally exhibit variation in cellular composition, which drives covariation of cell-class-specific molecular features. By analyzing transcriptional covariation in 7221 intact CNS samples from 840 individuals representing billions of cells, we reveal the core transcriptional identities of major CNS cell classes in humans. By modeling intact CNS transcriptomes as a function of variation in cellular composition, we identify cell-class-specific transcriptional differences in Alzheimer's disease, among brain regions, and between species. Among these, we show that PMP2 is expressed by human but not mouse astrocytes and significantly increases mouse astrocyte size upon ectopic expression in vivo, causing them to more closely resemble their human counterparts. Our work is available as an online resource (http://oldhamlab.ctec.ucsf.edu) and provides a generalizable strategy for determining the core molecular features of cellular identity in intact biological systems.

We have identified a member of the Growth arrest and DNA damage (Gadd45) family, Gadd45g, which is known to be involved in the regulation of DNA repair, as a key player in the formation of associative fear memory. Gadd45g regulates the temporal dynamics of learning-induced immediate early gene (IEG) expression in the prelimbic prefrontal cortex through its interaction with DNA double-strand break (DSB)-mediated changes in DNA methylation. Our findings suggest a two-hit model of experience-dependent IEG activity and learning that comprises 1) a first wave of IEG expression governed by DSBs followed by an increase in DNA methylation, and 2) a second wave of IEG expression associated with Gadd45g and active DNA demethylation at the same site, which is necessary for memory consolidation.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/265199v1?rss=1">An Augmented Aging Process in Brain White Matter in HIV</a></h4>

Objective: HIV infection and aging are both associated with neurodegeneration. However, whether the aging process alone or other factors associated with advanced age account for the progression of neurodegeneration in the aging HIV-positive (HIV+) population remains unclear. Methods: HIV+ (n=70) and HIV-negative (HIV-, n=34) participants underwent diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and metrics of microstructural properties were extracted from regions of interest (ROIs). A support vector regression model was trained on two independent datasets of healthy adults across the adult life-span (n=765, Cam-CAN = 588; UiO = 177) to predict participant age from DTI metrics, and applied to the HIV dataset. Predicted brain age gap (BAG) was computed as the difference between predicted age and chronological age, and statistically compared between HIV groups. Regressions assessed the relationship between BAG and HIV severity/medical comorbidities. Finally, correlation analyses tested for associations between BAG and cognitive performance. Results: BAG was significantly higher in the HIV+ group than the HIV- group F (1, 103) = 12.408, p = 0.001). HIV RNA viral load was significantly associated with BAG, particularly in older HIV+ individuals (R2 = 0.29, F(7, 70) = 2.66, p = 0.021). Further, BAG was negatively correlated with domain-level cognitive function (learning: r = -0.26, p = 0.008; memory: r = -0.21, p = 0.034). Conclusions: HIV infection is associated with augmented white matter aging, and greater brain aging is associated with worse cognitive performance in multiple domains.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/265041v1?rss=1">Population coupling predicts the plasticity of stimulus responses in cortical circuits</a></h4>

Long-term imaging of sensory cortex reveals a diverse range of stimulus response stability: some neurons retain stimulus responses that are stable over days whereas other neurons have highly plastic stimulus responses. Using a recurrent network model, we explore whether this observation could be due to an underlying diversity in the synaptic plasticity of neurons. We find that, in a network with diverse learning rates, neurons with fast rates are more coupled to population activity than neurons with slow rates. This phenomenon, which we call a plasticity-coupling link, surprisingly predicts that neurons with high population coupling exhibit more long-term stimulus response variability than neurons with low population coupling. We substantiate this prediction using recordings from the Allen Brain Observatory which track the orientation preferences of 15,000 neurons in mouse visual cortex. In agreement with our model, a neuron's population coupling is correlated with the plasticity of its orientation preference. Finally, we show that high population coupling helps plastic neurons alter their stimulus preference during perceptual learning, but hinders the ability of stable neurons to provide an instructive signal for learning. This suggests a particular functional architecture: a stable 'backbone' of stimulus representation formed by neurons with slow synaptic plasticity and low population coupling, on top of which lies a flexible substrate of neurons with fast synaptic plasticity and high population coupling.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/264895v1?rss=1">Occipitotemporal Representations Reflect Individual Differences in Conceptual Knowledge</a></h4>

Through selective attention, decision-makers can learn to ignore behaviorally-irrelevant stimulus dimensions. This can improve learning and can increase the perceptual discriminability of relevant stimulus information. Across cognitive models of categorization, this is typically accomplished through the inclusion of attentional parameters, which provide information about the importance of each stimulus dimension during decision-making. These parameters are often described geometrically, such that perceptual differences over relevant psychological dimensions are accentuated (or stretched), and differences over irrelevant dimensions are down-weighted (or compressed). An open question is whether these attention parameters are reflected in the brain. We examined two published fMRI datasets in which participants learned to categorize stimuli with features that differed in their relevancy. Attentional parameters were derived for each participants using formal categorization models fit to behavioral data. Using multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA), we found that when greater attentional weight was devoted to a particular visual feature (e.g., "color"), its value (e.g., "red") was more easily decoded from occipitotemporal cortex. This effect was sufficiently sensitive to reflect individual differences in conceptual knowledge, indicating that occipitotemporal stimulus representations are embedded within a space similar to that formalized by classic categorization theory.

Cardiovascular health declines with age, increasing the risk of hypertension and elevated heart rate in middle- and old-age. Here, we used multivariate Structural Equation Modelling to investigate the effects of cardiovascular health (diastolic blood pressure, systolic blood pressure and heart rate) on white matter macrostructure (lesion volume and number), and microstructure (as measured by Diffusion Weighted Imaging) in the cross-sectional, population-based Cam-CAN cohort (N = 667, aged 18 to 88). We found that cardiovascular health and age made approximately similar contributions to white matter health and explained up to 56% of variance. Lower diastolic blood pressure, higher systolic blood pressure and higher heart rate were each strongly, and independently, associated with white matter abnormalities on all indices. Body mass and exercise were associated with white matter health, both directly and indirectly via cardiovascular health. These results highlight the importance of cardiovascular risk factors for white matter health across the adult lifespan and suggest that systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and heart rate affect white matter via separate mechanisms.

Sensing vibrations that propagate through solid substrates conveys fundamental information about moving objects and other nearby dynamic events. Here we report that neurons responsive to substrate vibrations applied to the mouse forelimb reveal a new way of representing frequency information in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1). In contrast to vibrotactile stimulation of primate glabrous skin, which produces temporally entrained spiking and frequency independent firing rates, we found that mouse S1 neurons rely on a different coding scheme: their spike rates are conspicuously tuned to a preferred frequency of the stimulus. Histology, peripheral nerve block and optogenetic tagging experiments furthermore reveal that these responses are associated with the activation of mechanoreceptors located in deep subdermal tissue of the distal forelimb. We conclude that the encoding of frequency information of substrate-borne vibrations in the mouse S1 might be analogous to the representation of pitch of airborne sound in auditory cortex.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/251330v1?rss=1">Dissociating decision confidence from evidence reliability in the human brain</a></h4>

Our confidence in a choice and the reliability of evidence pertaining to that choice appear to be inseparable quantities. However, recent computational frameworks suggest that the brain should encode distinct estimates of these quantities for adaptive behavioural control. Consider a line judge in a tennis match deciding whether a ball is out. When the ball is moving quickly, the sensory signal is unreliable. Nevertheless, if the ball lands far from the line, a decision may be easy and confidence high. Decision confidence should reflect the probability that a choice is correct and must therefore, unlike other estimates of certainty such as evidence reliability, be flexibly conditioned on a choice. Here we devised a psychophysical approach to decouple confidence in a sensory choice from the reliability of the sensory evidence upon which a choice is based. Using human fMRI, we observed that an area in medial prefrontal cortex (perigenual cingulate cortex, pgACC) tracked probability correct, the normative definition of decision confidence, whereas neural areas previously thought to track decision confidence, such as ventral striatum and posterior parietal cortex, instead tracked sensory reliability. We show that pgACC activity does not simply co-vary with objective performance but is also linked to within-subject and between-subject variation in a subjective sense of decision confidence. Our study is consistent with the recent proposal that the brain separately maintains choice-dependent and choice-independent estimates of certainty, and sheds light on why dysfunctional confidence estimates often emerge following prefrontal lesions and/or degeneration.

The conserved function of protein phosphorylation, catalysed by members of protein kinase superfamily, is regulated in different ways in different kinase families. Further, differences in activating triggers, cellular localisation, domain architecture and substrate specificity between kinase families are also well known. While the transfer of γ-phosphate from ATP to the hydroxyl group of Ser/Thr/Tyr is mediated by a conserved Asp, the characteristic functional and regulatory sites are specialized at the level of families or sub-families. Such family-specific sites of functional specialization are unknown for most families of kinases. In this work, we systematically identify the family-specific residue features by comparing the extent of conservation of physicochemical properties, Shannon entropy and statistical probability of residue distributions between families of kinases. An integrated discriminatory score, which combines these three features, is developed to demarcate the functionally specialized sites in a kinase family from other sites. We achieved an area under ROC curve of 0.992 for the discrimination of kinase families. Our approach was extensively tested on well-studied families CDK and MAPK, wherein specific protein interaction sites and substrate recognition sites were successfully detected (<i>p-value</i> &lt; 0.05). We also find that the known family-specific oncogenic driver mutation sites were scored high by our method. The method was applied to all known kinases encompassing 107 families from diverse eukaryotic organisms leading to a comprehensive list of family-specific functional sites. Apart from other uses, our method facilitates identification of specific protein interaction sites and drug target sites in a kinase family.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/KpZ8t2QWVnI" width="1" />

Abstract
<p>Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is thought to organize items in working memory and this organizational role may also influence long-term memory. To causally test this hypothesized role of DLPFC in long-term memory formation, we used -burst noninvasive stimulation (TBS) to modulate DLPFC involvement in a memory task that assessed the influence of active short-term retrieval on later memory. Human subjects viewed three objects on a grid and then either actively retrieved or passively restudied one object’s location after a brief delay. Long-term memory for the other objects was assessed after a delay to evaluate the beneficial role of active short-term retrieval on subsequent memory for the entire set of object locations. We found that DLPFC TBS had no significant effects on short-term memory. In contrast, DLPFC TBS impaired long-term memory selectively in the active-retrieval condition but not in the passive-restudy condition. These findings are consistent with the hypothesized contribution of DLPFC to the organizational processes operative during active short-term retrieval that influence long-term memory, although other regions that were not stimulated could provide similar contributions. Notably, active-retrieval and passive-restudy conditions were intermixed, and therefore nonspecific influences of stimulation were well controlled. These results suggest that DLPFC is causally involved in organizing event information during active retrieval to support coherent long-term memory formation.</p>

Abstract
<p>Visual perception includes ventral and dorsal stream processes. However, it is still unclear whether the former is predominantly related to conscious and the latter to nonconscious visual perception as argued in the literature. In this study upright and inverted body postures were rendered either visible or invisible under continuous flash suppression (CFS), while brain activity of human participants was measured with functional MRI (fMRI). Activity in the ventral body-sensitive areas was higher during visible conditions. In comparison, activity in the posterior part of the bilateral intraparietal sulcus (IPS) showed a significant interaction of stimulus orientation and visibility. Our results provide evidence that dorsal stream areas are less associated with visual awareness.</p>

Abstract
<p>In many brain regions involved in learning NMDA receptors (NMDARs) act as coincidence detectors of pre- and postsynaptic activity, mediating Hebbian plasticity. Intriguingly, the parallel fiber (PF) to Purkinje cell (PC) input in the cerebellar cortex, which is critical for procedural learning, shows virtually no postsynaptic NMDARs. Why is this? Here, we address this question by generating and testing independent transgenic lines that overexpress NMDAR containing the type 2B subunit (NR2B) specifically in PCs. PCs of the mice that show larger NMDA-mediated currents than controls at their PF input suffer from a blockage of long-term potentiation (LTP) at their PF-PC synapses, while long-term depression (LTD) and baseline transmission are unaffected. Moreover, introducing NMDA-mediated currents affects cerebellar learning in that phase-reversal of the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) is impaired. Our results suggest that under physiological circumstances PC spines lack NMDARs postsynaptically at their PF input so as to allow LTP to contribute to motor learning.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/1/ENEURO.0191-17.2018?rss=1">Identification of Neurotensin Receptor Expressing Cells in the Ventral Tegmental Area across the Lifespan</a></h4>

Abstract
<p>Neurotensin (Nts) promotes activation of dopamine (DA) neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) via incompletely understood mechanisms. Nts can signal via the G protein-coupled Nts receptors 1 and 2 (NtsR1 and NtsR2), but the lack of methods to detect NtsR1- and NtsR2-expressing cells has limited mechanistic understanding of Nts action. To overcome this challenge, we generated dual recombinase mice that express FlpO-dependent Cre recombinase in NtsR1 or NtsR2 cells. This strategy permitted temporal control over recombination, such that we could identify NtsR1- or NtsR2-expressing cells and determine whether their distributions differed between the developing and adult brain. Using this system, we found that NtsR1 is transiently expressed in nearly all DA neurons and in many non-DA neurons in the VTA during development. However, NtsR1 expression is more restricted within the adult brain, where only two thirds of VTA DA neurons expressed NtsR1. By contrast, NtsR2 expression remains constant throughout lifespan, but it is predominantly expressed within glia. Anterograde tract tracing revealed that NtsR1 is expressed by mesolimbic, not mesocortical DA neurons, suggesting that VTA NtsR1 neurons may represent a functionally unique subset of VTA DA neurons. Collectively, this work reveals a cellular mechanism by which Nts can directly engage NtsR1-expressing DA neurons to modify DA signaling. Going forward, the dual recombinase strategy developed here will be useful to selectively modulate NtsR1- and NtsR2-expressing cells and to parse their contributions to Nts-mediated behaviors.</p>

<p>Consider a large number $n$ of neurons, each being connected to approximately
$N$ other ones, chosen at random. When a neuron spikes, which occurs randomly
at some rate depending on its electric potential, its potential is set to a
minimum value $v_{min}$, and this initiates, after a small delay, two fronts on
the (linear) dendrites of all the neurons to which it is connected. Fronts move
at constant speed. When two fronts (on the dendrite of the same neuron)
collide, they annihilate. When a front hits the soma of a neuron, its potential
is increased by a small value $w_n$. Between jumps, the potentials of the
neurons are assumed to drift in $[v_{min},\infty)$, according to some
well-posed ODE. We prove the existence and uniqueness of a heuristically
derived mean-field limit of the system when $n,N \to \infty$ with $w_n \simeq
N^{-1/2}$. We make use of some recent versions of the results of Deuschel and
Zeitouni \cite{dz} concerning the size of the longest increasing subsequence of
an i.i.d. collection of points in the plan. We also study, in a very particular
case, a slightly different model where the neurons spike when their potential
reach some maximum value $v_{max}$, and find an explicit formula for the
(heuristic) mean-field limit.

<p>When searching a target in a natural scene, both the target's visual
properties and similarity to the background influence whether (and how fast)
humans are able to find it. However, thus far it has been unclear whether
searchers adjust the dynamics of their eye movements (e.g., fixation durations,
saccade amplitudes) to the target they search for. In our experiment
participants searched natural scenes for six artificial targets with different
spatial frequency throughout eight consecutive sessions. High-spatial frequency
targets led to smaller saccade amplitudes and shorter fixation durations than
low-spatial frequency targets if target identity was known before the trial. If
a saccade was programmed in the same direction as the previous saccade
(saccadic momentum), fixation durations and successive saccade amplitudes were
not influenced by target type. Visual saliency and empirical density at the
endpoints of saccadic momentum saccades were comparatively low, indicating that
these saccades were less selective. Our results demonstrate that searchers
adjust their eye movement dynamics to the search target in a sensible fashion,
since low-spatial frequencies are visible farther into the periphery than
high-spatial frequencies. Additionally, the saccade direction specificity of
our effects suggests a separation of saccades into a default scanning mechanism
and a selective, target-dependent mechanism.

<p>The brain in conjunction with the body is able to adapt to new environments
and perform multiple behaviors through reuse of neural resources and transfer
of existing behavioral traits. Although mechanisms that underlie this ability
are not well known, they are largely attributed to neuromodulation. In this
work, we demonstrate that an agent can be multifunctional using the same
sensory and motor systems across behaviors, in the absence of modulatory
mechanisms. Further, we lay out the different levels at which neural reuse can
occur through a dynamical filtering of the brain-body-environment system's
operation - structural network, autonomous dynamics, and transient dynamics.
Notably, transient dynamics reuse can only be explained by studying the
brain-body-environment system as a whole and not just the brain. The
multifunctional agent we present here demonstrates neural reuse at all three
levels.

<p>Time series produced by dynamical systems as frequently the case in
neuroscience are rarely stationary but often exhibit quite abrupt changes due
to bifurcations or other dynamical phenomena. A plethora of methods for
detecting such changes in time series statistics, commonly called change point
analysis, have been developed over the years, in addition to test criteria to
evaluate change point significance. Issues to consider when developing such
methods include computational demands, difficulties arising from either limited
amount of data or a large number of covariates, and arriving at statistical
tests with sufficient power to detect as many change points as contained in
potentially high-dimensional data sets. Here, a general method called Paired
Adaptive Regressors for Cumulative Sum (PARCS) is developed for detecting
multiple change points in multivariate time series. The method's flexibility to
incorporate useful features from other change point detection techniques is
highlighted. The advantages of PARCS over existing approaches are demonstrated
through a series of simulation experiments, followed by a real data application
to neural recordings from rat medial prefrontal cortex during learning.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03405">Particle-without-Particle: a practical pseudospectral collocation method for numerical differential equations with distributional sources. (arXiv:1802.03405v1 [physics.comp-ph])</a></h4>

<p>Differential equations with distributional sources---in particular, involving
delta distributions and/or derivatives thereof---have become increasingly
ubiquitous in numerous areas of physics and applied mathematics. It is often of
considerable interest to obtain numerical solutions for such equations, but the
singular ("point-like") modeling of the sources in these problems typically
introduces nontrivial obstacles for devising a satisfactory numerical
implementation. A common method to circumvent these is through some form of
delta function approximation procedure on the computational grid, yet this
strategy often carries significant limitations.
</p>
<p>In this paper, we present an alternative technique for tackling such
equations: the "Particle-without-Particle" method. Previously introduced in the
context of the self-force problem in gravitational physics, the idea is to
discretize the computational domain into two (or more) disjoint pseudospectral
(Chebyshev-Lobatto) grids in such a way that the "particle" (the singular
source location) is always at the interface between them; in this way, one only
needs to solve homogeneous equations in each domain, with the source
effectively replaced by jump (boundary) conditions thereon. We prove here that
this method is applicable to any linear PDE (of arbitrary order) the source of
which is a linear combination of one-dimensional delta distributions and
derivatives thereof supported at an arbitrary number of particles. We
furthermore apply this method to obtain numerical solutions for various types
of distributionally-sourced PDEs: we consider first-order hyperbolic equations
with applications to neuroscience models (describing neural populations),
parabolic equations with applications to financial models (describing price
formation), second-order hyperbolic equations with applications to wave
acoustics, and finally elliptic (Poisson) equations.

<p>Brain can be represented as a network, where regions are the nodes and
relations between the regions are edges. Within a network, co-existence of
cooperative and competitive relationships between different nodes is called
coopetition. Inter-regional genetic influences on morphological phenotypes
(cortical thickness, surface area) of cortex display such coopetitive
relationships. Here, we have represented these genetic influences as a network
and shown that cooperative and competitive genetic influences on cortical
morphological phenotypes follow distinct organization principles. Utilizing the
theory of structural balance, we have shown that the pattern of collective
regulation of cortical morphological phenotypes by cooperative and competitive
genetic influences are overall bilaterally symmetric and such patterns of
collective genetic regulation are similar to the principal modes of population
variation of cortical morphological phenotypes. Finally, we have observed that
the maximally and minimally imbalanced regions corresponding to the collective
genetic regulation partially overlap with the cortical structural network hubs.

During navigation rodents continually sample the environment with their whiskers. How locomotion modulates neuronal activity in somatosensory cortex and how self-motion is integrated with whisker touch remains unclear. Here, we used calcium imaging in mice running in a tactile virtual reality to investigate modulation of neurons in layer 2/3 (L2/3) and L5 of barrel cortex. About a third of neurons in both layers increased activity during running and concomitant whisking, in the absence of touch. Fewer neurons were modulated by whisking alone (&lt;10%). Whereas L5 neurons responded transiently to wall-touching during running, L2/3 neurons showed sustained activity after touch onset. Consistently, neurons encoding running-with-touch were more abundant in L2/3 compared to L5. Few neurons across layers were also sensitive to abrupt perturbations of tactile flow. We propose that L5 neurons mainly report changes in touch conditions whereas L2/3 neurons continually monitor ongoing tactile stimuli during running.

Pumilio (Pum) is a key component of neuron firing-rate homeostasis that maintains stability of neural circuit activity. Whilst Pum is ubiquitously expressed, we understand little about how synaptic excitation regulates its expression. Here, we characterised the Drosophila dpum promoter and identified multiple Myocyte enhancer factor-2 (Mef2)-binding elements. To understand the transactivation capability of dMef2, we cloned 12 dmef2 splice variants and used a luciferase-based assay to monitor dpum promoter activity. Whilst all 12 dMef2 splice variants enhance dpum promoter activity, exon 10-containing variants induce greater transactivation. Previous work shows dPum expression increases with synaptic excitation. However, we observe no change in dmef2 transcript in CNS exposed to picrotoxin (PTX). The lack of activity-dependence is indicative of additional regulation. We identified p300 as a likely candidate. We show that by binding to dMef2, p300 represses dpum transactivation. Significantly, p300 transcript is down-regulated by enhanced synaptic excitation (PTX) which, in turn, increases transcription of dpum through derepression of dMef2. These results suggest the activity-dependent expression of dpum is regulated by an interaction between p300 and dMef2.

Compared to wakefulness, neuronal activity during non-REM sleep is characterized by a decreased ability to integrate information, but also by the re-emergence of task-related information patterns. To investigate the mechanisms underlying these seemingly opposing phenomena, we measured directed information flow by computing transfer entropy between neuronal spiking activity in three cortical regions and the hippocampus of rats across brain states. State-dependent information flow resulted to be jointly determined by the anatomical distance between neurons and by their functional specialization. We distinguished two regimes, operating at short and long time scales, respectively. From wakefulness to non-REM sleep, transfer entropy at short time scales increased for inter-areal connections between neurons showing behavioral task correlates. Conversely, transfer entropy at long time scales became stronger between non-task modulated neurons and weaker between task-modulated neurons. These results may explain how, during non-REM sleep, a global inter-areal disconnection is compatible with highly specific task-related information transfer.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/264465v1?rss=1">Representation of multiple objects in macaque category-selective areas</a></h4>

Object recognition in the natural world usually occurs in the presence of multiple surrounding objects, but responses of neurons in inferotemporal (IT) cortex, the large brain area responsible for object recognition, have mostly been studied only to isolated objects. We study rules governing responses to multiple objects by cells in two category-selective regions of macaque IT cortex, the middle lateral face patch (ML) and the middle body patch (MB). We find that responses of single ML and MB cells to pairs of objects could be explained by the widely-accepted framework of normalization, with one added ingredient: homogeneous category selectivity of neighboring neurons forming the normalization pool. This rule leads to winner-take-all, contralateral-take-all, or weighted averaging behavior in single cells, depending on the category, spatial configuration, and relative contrast of the two objects. The winner-take-all behavior suggests a potential mechanism for clutter-invariant representation of face and bodies under certain conditions.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/264457v1?rss=1">Multisensory perception reflects individual differences in processing temporal correlations</a></h4>

Sensory signals originating from a single event, such as audiovisual speech, are temporally correlated. Correlated signals are known to facilitate multisensory integration and binding. We sought to further elucidate the nature of this relationship, hypothesizing that multisensory perception will vary with the strength of audiovisual correlation. Human participants detected near-threshold amplitude modulations in auditory and/or visual stimuli. During audiovisual trials, the frequency and phase of auditory modulations were varied, producing signals with a range of correlations. After accounting for individual differences which likely reflect relative temporal processing abilities of participants' auditory and visual systems, we found that multisensory perception varied linearly with strength of correlation. Diffusion modelling confirmed this and revealed that correlation is supplied to the decisional system as sensory evidence. These data implicate correlation as an important cue in audiovisual feature integration and binding and suggest correlational strength as an important factor for flexibility in these processes.

The functional significance of resting state networks and their abnormal manifestations in psychiatric disorders are firmly established, as is the importance of the cortical rhythms in mediating these networks. Resting state networks are known to undergo substantial reorganization from childhood to adulthood, but whether distinct cortical rhythms, which are generated by separable neural mechanisms and are often manifested abnormally in psychiatric conditions, mediate maturation differentially, remains unknown. Using magnetoencephalography (MEG) to map frequency band specific maturation of resting state networks from age 7 to 29 in 162 participants (31 independent), we found significant changes with age in networks mediated by the beta (13-30Hz) and gamma (31-80Hz) bands. More specifically, gamma band mediated networks followed an expected asymptotic trajectory, but beta band mediated networks followed a linear trajectory. Network integration increased with age in gamma band mediated networks, while local segregation increased with age in beta band mediated networks. Spatially, the hubs that changed in importance with age in the beta band mediated networks had relatively little overlap with those that showed the greatest changes in the gamma band mediated networks. These findings are relevant for our understanding of the neural mechanisms of cortical maturation, in both typical and atypical development.

Three dimensional (3D) spatial cells in the mammalian hippocampal formation are believed to support the existence of 3D cognitive maps. Modeling studies are crucial to comprehend the neural principles governing the formation of these maps, yet to date very few have addressed this topic in 3D space. Here, we present a hierarchical network model for the formation of 3D spatial cells using anti-hebbian network. Built on empirical data, the model accounts for the natural emergence of 3D place, border and grid-cells as well as a new type of previously undescribed spatial cell type which we call plane cells. It further explains the plausible reason behind the place and grid-cell anisotropic coding that has been observed in rodents and the potential discrepancy with the predicted periodic coding during 3D volumetric navigation. Lastly, it provides evidence for the importance of unsupervised learning rules in guiding the formation of higher dimensional cognitive maps.

Probiotics are microorganisms that can provide health benefits when consumed. Recent animal studies have demonstrated that probiotics can reverse gut microbiome-related alterations in anxiety and depression-like symptoms, in hormonal responses to stress, and in cognition. However, in humans, the effects of probiotics on neurocognition remain poorly understood and a causal understanding of the gut-brain link in emotion and cognition is lacking. We aimed to fill this gap by studying the effects of a probiotics intervention versus placebo on neurocognition in healthy human volunteers. We set out to investigate the effects of a multispecies probiotic (EcologicBarrier) on specific neurocognitive measures of emotion reactivity, emotion regulation, and cognitive control using fMRI. Critically, we also tested whether the use of probiotics can buffer against the detrimental effects of acute stress on working memory. In a double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, between-subjects intervention study, 58 healthy participants were tested twice, once before and once after 28 days of intervention with probiotics or placebo. Probiotics versus placebo did not affect emotion reactivity, emotion regulation, and cognitive control processes at brain or behavioral level, neither related self-report measures. However, relative to the placebo group, the probiotics group did show a significant stress-related increase in working memory performance after versus before supplementation (digit span backward, p=0.039, {eta}p2=.07). Interestingly, this change was associated with intervention-related neural changes in frontal cortex during cognitive control in the probiotics group, but not in the placebo group. Overall, our results show that neurocognitive effects of supplementation with a multispecies probiotic in healthy women become visible under challenging (stress) situations. Probiotics buffered against the detrimental effects of stress in terms of cognition, especially in those individuals with probiotics-induced changes in frontal brain regions during cognitive control.

<p>by Sneha Vishwanath, Alexandre G. de Brevern, Narayanaswamy Srinivasan</p>

The majority of the proteins encoded in the genomes of eukaryotes contain more than one domain. Reasons for high prevalence of multi-domain proteins in various organisms have been attributed to higher stability and functional and folding advantages over single-domain proteins. Despite these advantages, many proteins are composed of only one domain while their homologous domains are part of multi-domain proteins. In the study presented here, differences in the properties of protein domains in single-domain and multi-domain systems and their influence on functions are discussed. We studied 20 pairs of identical protein domains, which were crystallized in two forms (a) tethered to other proteins domains and (b) tethered to fewer protein domains than (a) or not tethered to any protein domain. Results suggest that tethering of domains in multi-domain proteins influences the structural, dynamic and energetic properties of the constituent protein domains. 50% of the protein domain pairs show significant structural deviations while 90% of the protein domain pairs show differences in dynamics and 12% of the residues show differences in the energetics. To gain further insights on the influence of tethering on the function of the domains, 4 pairs of homologous protein domains, where one of them is a full-length single-domain protein and the other protein domain is a part of a multi-domain protein, were studied. Analyses showed that identical and structurally equivalent functional residues show differential dynamics in homologous protein domains; though comparable dynamics between <i>in-silico</i> generated chimera protein and multi-domain proteins were observed. From these observations, the differences observed in the functions of homologous proteins could be attributed to the presence of tethered domain. Overall, we conclude that tethered domains in multi-domain proteins not only provide stability or folding advantages but also influence pathways resulting in differences in function or regulatory properties.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/_feLOM8p4JU" width="1" />

Implantable retinal stimulators activate surviving neurons to restore a sense of vision in people who have lost their photoreceptors through degenerative diseases. Complex spatial and temporal interactions occur in the retina during multi-electrode stimulation. Due to these complexities, most existing implants activate only a few electrodes at a time, limiting the repertoire of available stimulation patterns. Measuring the spatiotemporal interactions between electrodes and retinal cells, and incorporating them into a model may lead to improved stimulation algorithms that exploit the interactions. Here, we present a computational model that accurately predicts both the spatial and temporal nonlinear interactions of multi-electrode stimulation of rat retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). The model was verified using <i>in vitro</i> recordings of ON, OFF, and ON-OFF RGCs in response to subretinal multi-electrode stimulation with biphasic pulses at three stimulation frequencies (10, 20, 30 Hz). The model gives an estimate of each cell’s spatiotemporal electrical receptive fields (ERFs); i.e., the pattern of stimulation leading to excitation or suppression in the neuron. All cells had excitatory ERFs and many also had suppressive sub-regions of their ERFs. We show that the nonlinearities in observed responses arise largely from activation of presynaptic interneurons. When synaptic transmission was blocked, the number of sub-regions of the ERF was reduced, usually to a single excitatory ERF. This suggests that direct cell activation can be modeled accurately by a one-dimensional model with linear interactions between electrodes, whereas indirect stimulation due to summated presynaptic responses is nonlinear.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2zHEkI8H2O8" width="1" />

<p>by Aurina Arnatkevic̆iūtė, Ben D. Fulcher, Roger Pocock, Alex Fornito</p>

Studies of nervous system connectivity, in a wide variety of species and at different scales of resolution, have identified several highly conserved motifs of network organization. One such motif is a heterogeneous distribution of connectivity across neural elements, such that some elements act as highly connected and functionally important network hubs. These brain network hubs are also densely interconnected, forming a so-called rich club. Recent work in mouse has identified a distinctive transcriptional signature of neural hubs, characterized by tightly coupled expression of oxidative metabolism genes, with similar genes characterizing macroscale inter-modular hub regions of the human cortex. Here, we sought to determine whether hubs of the neuronal <i>C. elegans</i> connectome also show tightly coupled gene expression. Using open data on the chemical and electrical connectivity of 279 <i>C. elegans</i> neurons, and binary gene expression data for each neuron across 948 genes, we computed a correlated gene expression score for each pair of neurons, providing a measure of their gene expression similarity. We demonstrate that connections between hub neurons are the most similar in their gene expression while connections between nonhubs are the least similar. Genes with the greatest contribution to this effect are involved in glutamatergic and cholinergic signaling, and other communication processes. We further show that coupled expression between hub neurons cannot be explained by their neuronal subtype (i.e., sensory, motor, or interneuron), separation distance, chemically secreted neurotransmitter, birth time, pairwise lineage distance, or their topological module affiliation. Instead, this coupling is intrinsically linked to the identity of most hubs as command interneurons, a specific class of interneurons that regulates locomotion. Our results suggest that neural hubs may possess a distinctive transcriptional signature, preserved across scales and species, that is related to the involvement of hubs in regulating the higher-order behaviors of a given organism.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/aI9N3og0p1U" width="1" />

<p>by Rich Pang, Floris van Breugel, Michael Dickinson, Jeffrey A. Riffell, Adrienne Fairhall</p>

Natural decision-making often involves extended decision sequences in response to variable stimuli with complex structure. As an example, many animals follow odor plumes to locate food sources or mates, but turbulence breaks up the advected odor signal into intermittent filaments and puffs. This scenario provides an opportunity to ask how animals use sparse, instantaneous, and stochastic signal encounters to generate goal-oriented behavioral sequences. Here we examined the trajectories of flying fruit flies (<i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>) and mosquitoes (<i>Aedes aegypti</i>) navigating in controlled plumes of attractive odorants. While it is known that mean odor-triggered flight responses are dominated by upwind turns, individual responses are highly variable. We asked whether deviations from mean responses depended on specific features of odor encounters, and found that odor-triggered turns were slightly but significantly modulated by two features of odor encounters. First, encounters with higher concentrations triggered stronger upwind turns. Second, encounters occurring later in a sequence triggered weaker upwind turns. To contextualize the latter history dependence theoretically, we examined trajectories simulated from three normative tracking strategies. We found that neither a purely reactive strategy nor a strategy in which the tracker learned the plume centerline over time captured the observed history dependence. In contrast, “infotaxis”, in which flight decisions maximized expected information gain about source location, exhibited a history dependence aligned in sign with the data, though much larger in magnitude. These findings suggest that while true plume tracking is dominated by a reactive odor response it might also involve a history-dependent modulation of responses consistent with the accumulation of information about a source over multi-encounter timescales. This suggests that short-term memory processes modulating decision sequences may play a role in natural plume tracking.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/NS0UxQs8qhA" width="1" />

<p>by Fleur Zeldenrust, Pascal Chameau, Wytse J. Wadman</p>

Mammalian thalamocortical relay (TCR) neurons switch their firing activity between a tonic spiking and a bursting regime. In a combined experimental and computational study, we investigated the features in the input signal that single spikes and bursts in the output spike train represent and how this code is influenced by the membrane voltage state of the neuron. Identical frozen Gaussian noise current traces were injected into TCR neurons in rat brain slices as well as in a validated three-compartment TCR model cell. The resulting membrane voltage traces and spike trains were analyzed by calculating the coherence and impedance. Reverse correlation techniques gave the Event-Triggered Average (ETA) and the Event-Triggered Covariance (ETC). This demonstrated that the feature selectivity started relatively long before the events (up to 300 ms) and showed a clear distinction between spikes (selective for fluctuations) and bursts (selective for integration). The model cell was fine-tuned to mimic the frozen noise initiated spike and burst responses to within experimental accuracy, especially for the mixed mode regimes. The information content carried by the various types of events in the signal as well as by the whole signal was calculated. Bursts phase-lock to and transfer information at lower frequencies than single spikes. On depolarization the neuron transits smoothly from the predominantly bursting regime to a spiking regime, in which it is more sensitive to high-frequency fluctuations. The model was then used to elucidate properties that could not be assessed experimentally, in particular the role of two important subthreshold voltage-dependent currents: the low threshold activated calcium current (<i>I</i><sub>T</sub>) and the cyclic nucleotide modulated h current (<i>I</i><sub>h</sub>). The ETAs of those currents and their underlying activation/inactivation states not only explained the state dependence of the firing regime but also the long-lasting concerted dynamic action of the two currents. Finally, the model was used to investigate the more realistic “high-conductance state”, where fluctuations are caused by (synaptic) conductance changes instead of current injection. Under “standard” conditions bursts are difficult to initiate, given the high degree of inactivation of the T-type calcium current. Strong and/or precisely timed inhibitory currents were able to remove this inactivation.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/c6sziGsfR6A" width="1" />

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/wyJceEhZ628/article">Heritable tumor cell division rate heterogeneity induces clonal dominance</a></h4>

<p>by Margriet M. Palm, Marjet Elemans, Joost B. Beltman</p>

Tumors consist of a hierarchical population of cells that differ in their phenotype and genotype. This hierarchical organization of cells means that a few clones (i.e., cells and several generations of offspring) are abundant while most are rare, which is called <i>clonal dominance</i>. Such dominance also occurred in published <i>in vitro</i> iterated growth and passage experiments with tumor cells in which genetic barcodes were used for lineage tracing. A potential source for such heterogeneity is that dominant clones derive from cancer stem cells with an unlimited self-renewal capacity. Furthermore, ongoing evolution and selection within the growing population may also induce clonal dominance. To understand how clonal dominance developed in the iterated growth and passage experiments, we built a computational model that accurately simulates these experiments. The model simulations reproduced the clonal dominance that developed in <i>in vitro</i> iterated growth and passage experiments when the division rates vary between cells, due to a combination of initial variation and of ongoing mutational processes. In contrast, the experimental results can neither be reproduced with a model that considers random growth and passage, nor with a model based on cancer stem cells. Altogether, our model suggests that <i>in vitro</i> clonal dominance develops due to selection of fast-dividing clones.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/wyJceEhZ628" width="1" />

Abstract<p>Rett Syndrome (RTT) is an X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder usually caused by mutations in Methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2). RTT is typified by apparently normal development until 6-18 months of age, when motor and communicative skills regress and hand stereotypies, autonomic symptoms, and seizures present. Restoration of MeCP2 function selectively to astrocytes reversed several deficits in a murine model of RTT, but the mechanism of this rescue is unknown. Astrocytes carry out many essential functions required for normal brain functioning including extracellular K<sup>+</sup> buffering. Kir4.1, an inwardly rectifying K<sup>+</sup> channel, is largely responsible for the channel-mediated K<sup>+</sup> regulation by astrocytes. Loss of function mutations in Kir4.1 in human patients results in a severe neurodevelopmental disorder termed EAST or SESAME syndrome. Here we evaluated astrocytic Kir4.1 expression in a murine model of Rett syndrome. We demonstrate by ChIP analysis that Kir4.1 is a direct molecular target of MeCP2. Astrocytes from <i>Mecp2</i>-deficient mice express significantly less Kir4.1 mRNA and protein, which translates into a &gt;50% deficiency in Ba<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive Kir4.1-mediated currents, and impaired extracellular potassium dynamics. By examining astrocytes in isolation we demonstrate that loss of Kir4.1 is cell-autonomous. Assessment through postnatal development revealed that Kir4.1 expression in <i>Mecp2</i>-deficient animals never reaches adult, wild-type levels, consistent with a neurodevelopmental disorder. These are the first data implicating a direct MeCP2 molecular target in astrocytes and provide novel mechanistic insight explaining a potential mechanism by which astrocytic dysfunction may contribute to RTT.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Rett Syndrome (RTT) is a devastating neurodevelopmental disorder that affects 1 in 10 000-25 000 females. Mutations in Methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2), a transcriptional regulator, are responsible for over 95% of Rett cases. Recent work has shown that astrocytes contribute significantly to the disorder, although their contribution to this disease is not known. Here we demonstrate that the critical astrocyte K<sup>+</sup> channel Kir4.1 is a novel molecular target of MeCP2. MeCP2 deficiency leads to decreased <i>Kcnj10</i>/Kir4.1 mRNA levels, protein expression, and currents. These findings provide novel mechanistic insight and begin to elucidate the role of astrocytes in this disorder.</p>

Abstract<p>Research in rodents has established the role of the amygdaloid complex in defensive responses to conditioned threat. In human imaging studies, however, activation of the amygdala by conditioned threat cues is often not observed. One hypothesis states that this finding reflects adaptation of amygdaloid responses over time. We tested this hypothesis by estimating single-trial neural responses over a large number of conditioning trials. Functional MRI was recorded from 18 participants during classical differential fear conditioning: Participants viewed oriented grayscale grating stimuli (45° or 135°) presented centrally in random order. In the acquisition block, one grating (the CS+) was paired with a noxious noise, the unconditioned stimulus (US), on 25% of trials. The other grating, denoted CS-, was never paired with the US. Consistent with previous reports, BOLD in dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and insula, but not the amygdala, was heightened when viewing CS+ stimuli that were not paired with US compared to CS- stimuli. Trial-by-trial analysis showed that over the course of acquisition, activity in the amygdala attenuated. Interestingly, activity in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and insula also declined. Representational similarity analysis (RSA) corroborated these results, indicating that the voxel patterns evoked by CS+ and CS- in these brain regions became less distinguishable over time. Together, the present findings support the hypothesis that the lack of BOLD differences in the amygdaloid complex in many studies of classical conditioning is due to adaptation, and the adaptation effects may reflect changes in large-scale networks mediating aversive conditioning, particularly the salience network.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> In neuroimaging studies of human fear conditioning, activation of the amygdala is often not observed. This problem is examined by applying single-trial fMRI analysis to a classical fear conditioning paradigm. In addition to confirming the amygdala adaptation hypothesis, we discovered that areas of the salience network, to which the amygdala belongs, co-adapted, supporting the hypothesis that the acquisition of defensive responses in humans is mediated by changes in a large-scale brain network.</p>

Abstract<p>Axonal spike is an important upstream process of transmitter release, which directly impacts on release probability from the presynaptic terminals. Despite the functional significance, possible activity-dependent modulation of axonal spikes has not been studied extensively, partly due to inaccessibility of the small structures of axons for electrophysiological recordings. In this study, we tested the possibility of use-dependent changes in axonal spikes at the hippocampal mossy fibers, where direct recordings from the axon terminals are readily feasible. Hippocampal slices were made from mice of either sex, and loose-patch clamp recordings were obtained from the visually identified giant mossy fiber boutons located in the stratum lucidum of the CA3 region. Stimulation of the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus elicited axonal spikes at the single bouton which occurred in all or none fashion. Unexpected from the digital nature of spike signaling, the peak amplitude of the second spikes in response to paired stimuli at 50 ms interval was slightly but reproducibly smaller than the first spikes. Repetitive stimuli at 20 Hz or 100 Hz also caused progressive use-dependent depression during the train. Notably, veratridine, an inhibitor of inactivation of sodium channels, significantly accelerated the depression with minimal effect on the initial spikes. These results suggest that sodium channels contribute to use-dependent depression of axonal spikes at the hippocampal mossy fibers, possibly by shaping the afterdepolarization (ADP) following axonal spikes. Prolonged depolarization during ADP may inactivate a fraction of sodium channels and thereby suppresses the subsequent spikes at the hippocampal mossy fibers.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Spike signaling along axons is thought to highly reliable digital process. In this study, we tested the possibility of analog tuning of axonal spikes using direct recordings from single hippocampal mossy fiber terminals. We found that axonal spikes are subject to robust use-dependent short-term depression. Notably, the application of veratridine, an inhibitor of inactivation of sodium channels, selectively accelerates short-term depression with minimal effect on the initial axonal spikes. These results illustrate the novel form of short-term plasticity of axonal spikes in single axon terminal levels, and suggest that slow activating sodium channels of persistent-type (I<sub>NaP</sub>) or resurgent types (I<sub>NaR</sub>), different from the transient-type (I<sub>NaT</sub>) responsible for spike generation, might be involved in modulation of paired-pulse depression of axonal spikes.</p>

<p>The robust and efficient recognition of visual relations in images is a
hallmark of biological vision. Here, we argue that, despite recent progress in
visual recognition, modern machine vision algorithms are severely limited in
their ability to learn visual relations. Through controlled experiments, we
demonstrate that visual-relation problems strain convolutional neural networks
(CNNs). The networks eventually break altogether when rote memorization becomes
impossible such as when the intra-class variability exceeds their capacity. We
further show that another type of feedforward network, called a relational
network (RN), which was shown to successfully solve seemingly difficult visual
question answering (VQA) problems on the CLEVR datasets, suffers similar
limitations. Motivated by the comparable success of biological vision, we argue
that feedback mechanisms including working memory and attention are the key
computational components underlying abstract visual reasoning.

Hearing loss is a widespread condition that is linked to declines in quality of life and mental health. Hearing aids remain the treatment of choice, but, unfortunately, even state-of-the-art devices provide only limited benefit for the perception of speech in noisy environments. While traditionally viewed primarily as a loss of sensitivity, hearing loss is also known to cause complex distortions of sound-evoked neural activity that cannot be corrected by amplification alone. This Opinion article describes the effects of hearing loss on neural activity to illustrate the reasons why current hearing aids are insufficient and to motivate the use of new technologies to explore directions for improving the next generation of devices.

Many scientific fields currently face the daunting task of studying the dynamics of complex networks. For example, while we know that the rich mental phenomena of humans and other animals are mediated by complex systems of neural circuits in the brain, the mechanistic links between these biological networks and the functions that they mediate are poorly understood. Here we present a novel class of methods, termed multivariate directed connectivity analysis, to investigate network dynamics via patterns of directed interactions between network nodes. We validate these methods using simulated data and apply them to three real-world datasets, two neuroscientific and one investigating the 2016 US presidential candidates' influence on the social media service Twitter. We find that these methods enable novel understanding of how information processing is distributed across networks. The methods are generally applicable to the study of dynamic information networks in biological, computational, and other fields of research.

Rodents are often used for studying chronic pain mechanisms and developing new pain therapeutics, but objectively determining the animals pain state is a major challenge. To improve the precision of using reflexive withdrawal behaviors for interpreting the mouse pain state, we adopted high-speed videography to capture sub-second movement features of mice upon hind paw stimulation. We identified several parameters that are significantly different between behaviors evoked by innocuous and noxious stimuli, and combined them to map the mouse pain state through statistical modeling and machine learning. To test the utility of this approach, we determined the pain state triggered by von Frey hairs (VFHs) and optogenetic activation of two nociceptor populations. Our method reliably assesses the pain-like probability for each mouse paw withdrawal reflex under all scenarios, highlighting the precision of using this high resolution behavior-centered composite methodology to determine the mouse pain state from reflexive withdrawal assays.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/263376v1?rss=1">Increasing the Mobility of EEG Data Collection Using a Latte Panda Computer</a></h4>

Background: Electroencephalography (EEG) experiments often require several computers to ensure accurate stimulus presentation and data collection. However, this requirement can make it more difficult to perform such experiments in mobile settings within, or outside, the laboratory. New Method: Computer miniaturisation and increasing processing power allow for EEG experiments to become more portable. Our goal is to show that a Latte Panda, a small Windows 10 computer, can be used to accurately collect EEG data in a similar manner to a laptop. Using a stationary bike, we also demonstrate that the Latte Panda will allow for more portable EEG experiments. Results: Significant and reliable MMN and P3 responses, event-related potentials (ERPs) typically associated with auditory oddball tasks, were observed and were consistent when using either the laptop or Latte Panda for EEG data collection. Similar MMN and P3 ERPs were also measured in the sitting and stationary biking conditions while using a Latte Panda for data collection. Comparison with Existing Method: Data recorded by the Latte Panda computer produced comparable and equally reliable results to the laptop. As well, similar ERPs during sitting and biking would suggest that EEG experiments can be conducted in more mobile situations despite the increased noise and artefacts associated with muscle movement. Conclusions: Our results show that the Latte Panda is a low-cost, more portable alternative to a laptop computer for recording EEG data. Such a device will further allow for more portable and mobile EEG experimentation in a wider variety of environments.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/263301v1?rss=1">A probabilistic model of sleep structure suggests a primary role for wake probability in overall sleep in Drosophila melanogaster</a></h4>

In humans and flies, sleep is a highly organized behavior, occurring in discrete bouts that are consolidated at night but have a more fragmented structure during the day. Longer episodes correlate with transitions to deeper sleep states for both species, and sleep fragmentation has been shown to have deleterious outcomes for a large number of physiological processes. In mammals and birds, EEG provides an excellent measure of sleep structure and state. In invertebrates, assessment of sleep structure has relied on measures of episode duration, which can fail to capture important aspects of sleep architecture. Here we model Drosophila sleep as a probabilistic behavior and develop analytical tools to measure transition probabilities and the organization of sleep episodes within a defined analysis window. We show that these tools provide insight into the underlying mechanisms of normal sleep and into how they are altered in pathological conditions. The probability of transition to the wake state, P(Wake) is a major driver of normal sleep and responsive to dopaminergic tone, suggesting it is a measure of arousal. Our method for assessing sleep fragmentation adds important information about the organization of sleep bouts that is missing in measures of episode duration alone. Importantly, the ability to obtain a measure of the probability structure underlying sleep in a particular condition or genotype provides a way to compare the state of brain sleep circuits across conditions that utilizes information from all of the many processes that influence sleep.

<div class="section" id="ana25153-sec-0002"><h4>Methods</h4><div class="para"><p>One hundred sixty adult patients with DOAs and 50 sex- and age-matched healthy participants underwent a clinical evaluation and vPSG assessment to quantify slow wave sleep (SWS) interruptions (SWS fragmentation index, slow/mixed and fast arousal ratios, and indexes per hour) and the associated behaviors. First, a case–control analysis was performed in 100 patients and the 50 controls to define the optimal cutoff values using receiver operating characteristic curves.

<div class="section" id="ana25153-sec-0003"><h4>Results</h4><div class="para"><p>The SWS fragmentation index and the mixed, slow, and slow/mixed arousal indexes and ratios were higher in patients with DOAs than controls. The highest area under the curve (AUC) values were obtained for the SWS fragmentation and slow/mixed arousal indexes (AUC = 0.88 and 0.90, respectively). The SWS fragmentation index cutoff value of 6.8/h reached a sensitivity of 79% and a specificity of 82%. The slow/mixed arousal index had a sensitivity of 94% for the 2.5/h cutoff, and 100% specificity for 6/h. Both parameters showed good interrater agreement, and their sensitivities were confirmed in the second group of patients. Combining electroencephalographic parameters and video-based behavioral analyses increased the correct classification rate up to 91.3%.</p></div></div>

Recently, we found that some parenchymal microglia in brain of HIV<sup>+</sup> subjects without encephalitis (HIV/noE) but with varying degrees of neurocognitive impairment express CD16 and CD163, even in the absence of detectable virus production. To further our understanding of microglial activation in HIV, we investigated expression of specific genes by profiling parenchymal microglia from archival brain tissue of patients with HIVE and HIV/noE, and HIV<sup>−</sup> controls.</p></div></div>

<p>Speech is an ecologically essential signal, whose processing crucially involves the subcortical nuclei of the auditory brainstem, but there are few experimental options for studying these early responses in human listeners under natural conditions. While encoding of continuous natural speech has been successfully probed in the cortex with neurophysiological tools such as electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography, the rapidity of subcortical response components combined with unfavorable signal-to-noise ratios signal-to-noise ratio has prevented application of those methods to the brainstem. Instead, experiments have used thousands of repetitions of simple stimuli such as clicks, tone-bursts, or brief spoken syllables, with deviations from those paradigms leading to ambiguity in the neural origins of measured responses. In this study we developed and tested a new way to measure the auditory brainstem response (ABR) to ongoing, naturally uttered speech, using EEG to record from human listeners. We found a high degree of morphological similarity between the speech-derived ABRs and the standard click-evoked ABR, in particular, a preserved Wave V, the most prominent voltage peak in the standard click-evoked ABR. Because this method yields distinct peaks that recapitulate the canonical ABR, at latencies too short to originate from the cortex, the responses measured can be unambiguously determined to be subcortical in origin. The use of naturally uttered speech to measure the ABR allows the design of engaging behavioral tasks, facilitating new investigations of the potential effects of cognitive processes like language and attention on brainstem processing.</p>

Abstract
<p>Transient receptor potential channel, TRPM4, the putative molecular substrate for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated nonselective cation current (<i>I</i><sub>CAN</sub>), is hypothesized to generate bursting activity of pre-Bötzinger complex (pre-BötC) inspiratory neurons and critically contribute to respiratory rhythmogenesis. Another TRP channel, TRPC3, which mediates Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluxes, may be involved in regulating Ca<sup>2+</sup>-related signaling, including affecting TRPM4/<i>I</i><sub>CAN</sub> in respiratory pre-BötC neurons. However, TRPM4 and TRPC3 expression in pre-BötC inspiratory neurons and functional roles of these channels remain to be determined. By single-cell multiplex RT-PCR, we show mRNA expression for these channels in pre-BötC inspiratory neurons in rhythmically active medullary <i>in vitro</i> slices from neonatal rats and mice. Functional contributions were analyzed with pharmacological inhibitors of TRPM4 or TRPC3 <i>in vitro</i> as well as in mature rodent arterially perfused <i>in situ</i> brainstem–spinal cord preparations. Perturbations of respiratory circuit activity were also compared with those by a blocker of <i>I</i><sub>CAN</sub>. Pharmacologically attenuating endogenous activation of TRPM4, TRPC3, or <i>I</i><sub>CAN</sub> <i>in vitro</i> similarly reduced the amplitude of inspiratory motoneuronal activity without significant perturbations of inspiratory frequency or variability of the rhythm. Amplitude perturbations were correlated with reduced inspiratory glutamatergic pre-BötC neuronal activity, monitored by multicellular dynamic calcium imaging <i>in vitro.</i> In more intact circuits <i>in situ</i>, the reduction of pre-BötC and motoneuronal inspiratory activity amplitude was accompanied by reduced post-inspiratory motoneuronal activity, without disruption of rhythm generation. We conclude that endogenously activated TRPM4, which likely mediates <i>I</i><sub>CAN</sub>, and TRPC3 channels in pre-BötC inspiratory neurons play fundamental roles in respiratory pattern formation but are not critically involved in respiratory rhythm generation.</p>

Abstract
<p>Electrical signals generated by molecularly-distinct classes of lateral hypothalamus (LH) neurons have distinct physiological consequences. For example, LH orexin neurons promote net body energy expenditure, while LH non-orexin neurons [VGAT, melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH)] drive net energy conservation. Appropriate switching between such physiologically-opposing LH outputs is traditionally thought to require cell-type-specific chemical modulation of LH firing. However, it was recently found that, <i>in vivo,</i> the LH neurons are also physiologically exposed to electrical oscillations of different frequency bands. The role of the different physiological oscillation frequencies in firing of orexin vs non-orexin LH neurons remains unknown. Here, we used brain-slice whole-cell patch-clamp technology to target precisely-defined oscillation waveforms to individual molecularly-defined classes LH cells (orexin, VGAT, MCH, GAD65), while measuring the action potential output of the cells. By modulating the frequency of sinusoidal oscillatory input, we found that high-frequency oscillations (, 30–200 Hz) preferentially silenced the action potential output orexin<sub>LH</sub> cells. In contrast, low frequencies (-, 0.5–7 Hz) similarly permitted outputs from different LH cell types. This differential control of orexin and non-orexin cells by oscillation frequency was mediated by cell-specific, impedance-unrelated resonance mechanisms. These results substantiate electrical oscillations as a novel input modality for cell-type-specific control of LH firing, which offers an unforeseen way to control specific cell ensembles within this highly heterogeneous neuronal cluster.</p>

Abstract<p>The efficacy of synaptic transmission is determined by the number of neurotransmitter receptors at synapses. Their recruitment depends upon the availability of postsynaptic scaffolding molecules that interact with specific binding sequences of the receptor. At inhibitory synapses, gephyrin is the major scaffold protein that mediates the accumulation of heteromeric glycine receptors (GlyRs) via the cytoplasmic loop in the β-subunit (β-loop). This binding involves high- and low-affinity interactions, but the molecular mechanism of this bimodal binding and its implication in GlyR stabilization at synapses remain unknown. We have approached this question using a combination of quantitative biochemical tools and high-density single molecule tracking in cultured rat spinal cord neurons. The high-affinity binding site could be identified and was shown to rely on the formation of a 3<sub>10</sub>-helix C-terminal to the β-loop core gephyrin-binding motif. This site plays a structural role in shaping the core motif and represents the major contributor to the synaptic confinement of GlyRs by gephyrin. The N-terminal flanking sequence promotes lower affinity interactions by occupying newly identified binding sites on gephyrin. Despite its low affinity, this binding site plays a modulatory role in tuning the mobility of the receptor. Taken together, the GlyR β-loop sequences flanking the core-binding site differentially regulate the affinity of the receptor for gephyrin and its trapping at synapses. Our experimental approach thus bridges the gap between thermodynamic aspects of receptor-scaffold interactions and functional receptor stabilization at synapses in living cells.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> The number of receptors at a synapse defines the strength of signal transmission and is directly dependent on the binding of the receptors to scaffold proteins beneath the synaptic membrane. In this study, we discovered the molecular basis for a dual-affinity interaction between GlyRs and gephyrin scaffolds. We identified GlyR sequences that are specifically required for high- and low-affinity binding. Using single-molecule tracking in cultured neurons both sites were shown to act as elements regulating the diffusion and trapping of GlyRs as a result of the altered receptor-scaffold binding. The novelty of our approach lies in the unique combination of biochemical data of purified proteins with single molecule diffusion analysis. It exemplifies that binding properties can be extracted by analyzing the diffusion behavior of molecules in living cells.</p>

<div class="para"><p>Neural tube defects (NTDs) are among the most common birth defects in humans and yet their molecular etiology remains poorly understood. NTDs are believed to result from the complex interaction of environmental factors with a multitude of genetic risk factors in a classical multifactorial disease model. Mendelian forms of NTDs in which single variants are sufficient to cause the disease are extremely rare. We report a monozygotic twin with severe NTDs (occipital encephalocele and myelomeningocele) and a shared de novo, likely truncating, variant in <em>SMARCC1</em>. RTPCR analysis suggests the potential null nature of the variant attributed to nonsense-mediated decay. <em>SMARCC1</em> is extremely constrained in humans and encodes a highly conserved core chromatin remodeler, BAF155. Mice that are heterozygous for a null allele or homozygous for a hypomorphic allele develop severe NTDs in the form of exencephaly. This is the first report of <em>SMARCC1</em> mutation in humans, and it shows a critical and conserved requirement for intact BAF chromatin remodeling complex in neurulation.

<div class="section" id="ana25141-sec-0002"><h4>Methods</h4><div class="para"><p>One hundred sixteen patients with high suspicion of IH (37 clear-cut IH according to multiple sleep latency test criteria and 79 probable IH), 32 with hypersomnolence associated with a comorbid disorder (non-IH), and 21 controls underwent polysomnography, modified sleep latency tests, and a 32-hour bed rest protocol.

<div class="section" id="ana25141-sec-0003"><h4>Results</h4><div class="para"><p>TST was longer in patients with clear-cut IH than other groups (probable IH, non-IH, and controls) and in patients with probable IH than non-IH and controls. The TST cutoff best discriminating clear-cut IH and controls was 19 hours for the 32-hour recording (sensitivity = 91.9%, specificity = 85.7%) and 12 hours (100%, 85.7%) for the first 24 hours. The 19-hour cutoff displayed a specificity and sensitivity of 91.9% and 81.2% between IH and non-IH patients. Patients with IH above the 19-hour cutoff were overweight, had more sleep inertia, and had higher TST on all periods compared to patients below 19 hours, whereas no differences were found for the 12-hour cutoff. An inverse correlation was found between the mean sleep latency and TST during 32-hour recording in IH patients.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana25141-sec-0004"><h4>Interpretation</h4><div class="para"><p>In standardized and controlled stringent conditions, the optimal cutoff best discriminating patients from controls was 19 hours over 32 hours, allowing a clear-cut phenotypical characterization of major interest for research purposes.

Chitinase levels correlated with disease progression rate (CHIT1, <em>r</em> = 0.56, <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001; CHI3L1, <em>r</em> = 0.31; <em>p</em> = 0.028; CHI3L2, <em>r</em> = 0.29, <em>p</em> = 0.044).

CHI3L1 levels, but not CHIT1 or CHI3L2, increased over time in those with low initial levels (gradient = 0.005 log abundance units/month, <em>p</em> = 0.001). High CHIT1 was associated with shortened survival (hazard ratio [HR] 2.84; <em>p</em> = 0.009).

<p>Background and Purpose: This study was designed to compare the effects of
high-intensity interval training (HIT) and moderate-intensity continuous
training (MOD) on functional recovery and cerebral plasticity during the first
2 weeks following cerebral ischemia. Methods: Rats were randomized as follows:
Control (n=15), SHAM (n=9), MCAO (n=13), MCAO-D1 (n=7), MOD (n=13) and HIT
(n=13). Incremental tests were performed at day 1 (D1) and 14 (D14) to identify
the running speed associated with the lactate threshold (SLT) and the maximal
speed (Smax). Functional tests were performed at D1, D7 and D14. Microglia
form, cytokines, p75NTR, KCC2 and NKCC1 expression were made at D15.
Results-HIT was more effective to improve the endurance performance than MOD
and induced a fast recovery of the impaired forelimb grip force. The Iba-1
positive cells with amoeboid form and the pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine
expression were lower in HIT group, mainly in the ipsilesional hemisphere. A
p75NTR overexpression is observed on the ipsilesional side together with a
restored NKCC1/KCC2 ratio on the contralesional side. Conclusions-Low-volume
HIT based on lactate threshold appears to be more effective after cerebral
ischemia than work-matched MOD to improve aerobic fitness, grip strength and
might promote cerebral plasticity.

<p>Drawing upon a body of research on the evolution of creativity, this paper
proposes a theory of how, when, and why the forward-thinking story-telling
abilities of humans evolved, culminating in the visionary abilities of science
fiction writers. The ability to recursively chain thoughts together evolved
approximately two million years ago. Language abilities, and the ability to
shift between different modes of thought, evolved approximately 100,000 years
ago. Science fiction dates to at least the second Century AD. It is suggested
that well before this time, but after 100,000 years ago, and concurrent with
the evolution of a division of labour between creators and imitators there
arose a division of labour between past, present, and future thinkers.
Agent-based model research suggests there are social benefits to the evolution
of individual differences in creativity such that there is a balance between
novelty-generating creators and continuity-perpetuating imitators. A balance
between individuals focused on the past, present, and future would be expected
to yield similar adaptive benefits.

<p>Despite the decades of efforts, the choice of EEG reference is still a
debated fundamental issue. Non-neutral reference can inevitably inject the
uncontrolled temporal biases into all EEG recordings, which may influence the
spatiotemporal analysis of brain activity. A method, termed microstates,
identifying spatiotemporal EEG features as the quasi-stable topography states
in milliseconds, suggests its potential as biomarkers of neurophysiological
disease. As reference electrode standardization technique (REST) could
reconstruct an infinity reference approximately, it is a question whether REST
or the other references will be more reliable than average reference (AR) for
the microstates analysis. In this study, we design the microstate-based EEG
forward model, and apply different references for microstates analysis. The
spatial similarity between the generated and assumed cluster maps is mainly
investigated. Furthermore, the real EEG data by the parametric bootstrap method
is used to validate the performance of the references. Finally, we find that
REST is robust to recover more similar cluster maps to the assumption than AR
in the simulation, and the cluster maps between REST and AR on the real EEG
data are quite different. This study may indicate that REST contributes to
identifying more objective microstates features than AR.

<p>The insect olfactory system, which includes the antennal lobe (AL), mushroom
body (MB), and ancillary structures, is a relatively simple neural system
capable of learning. Its structural features, which are widespread in
biological neural systems, process olfactory stimuli through a cascade of
networks where large dimension shifts occur from stage to stage and where
sparsity and randomness play a critical role in coding. Learning is partly
enabled by a neuromodulatory reward mechanism of octopamine stimulation of the
AL, whose increased activity induces rewiring of the MB through Hebbian
plasticity. Enforced sparsity in the MB focuses Hebbian growth on neurons that
are the most important for the representation of the learned odor. Based upon
current biophysical knowledge, we have constructed an end-to-end computational
model of the Manduca sexta moth olfactory system which includes the interaction
of the AL and MB under octopamine stimulation. Our model is able to robustly
learn new odors, and our simulations of integrate-and-fire neurons match the
statistical features of in-vivo firing rate data. From a biological
perspective, the model provides a valuable tool for examining the role of
neuromodulators, like octopamine, in learning, and gives insight into critical
interactions between sparsity, Hebbian growth, and stimulation during learning.
Our simulations also inform predictions about structural details of the
olfactory system that are not currently well-characterized. From a machine
learning perspective, the model yields bio-inspired mechanisms that are
potentially useful in constructing neural nets for rapid learning from very few
samples. These mechanisms include high-noise layers, sparse layers as noise
filters, and a biologically-plausible optimization method to train the network
based on octopamine stimulation, sparse layers, and Hebbian growth.

<p>by Michaël Dougoud, Laura Vinckenbosch, Rudolf P. Rohr, Louis-Félix Bersier, Christian Mazza</p>

The consensus that complexity begets stability in ecosystems was challenged in the seventies, a result recently extended to ecologically-inspired networks. The approaches assume the existence of a feasible equilibrium, i.e. with positive abundances. However, this key assumption has not been tested. We provide analytical results complemented by simulations which show that equilibrium feasibility vanishes in species rich systems. This result leaves us in the uncomfortable situation in which the existence of a feasible equilibrium assumed in local stability criteria is far from granted. We extend our analyses by changing interaction structure and intensity, and find that feasibility and stability is warranted irrespective of species richness with weak interactions. Interestingly, we find that the dynamical behaviour of ecologically inspired architectures is very different and richer than that of unstructured systems. Our results suggest that a general understanding of ecosystem dynamics requires focusing on the interplay between interaction strength and network architecture.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/3gE01kroZuI" width="1" />

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div class="para"><p>Objective:</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Evidence suggests disordered breathing is critically involved in Sudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP). To that end, evaluating structures that are activated by seizures and can activate brain regions that produce cardiorespiratory changes can further our understanding of the pathophysiology of SUDEP. Prior preclinical studies have shown that electrical stimulation of the human amygdala induces apnea, suggesting a role for the amygdala in controlling respiration. In this study, we aimed to both confirm these findings in a larger group of patients with intractable temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and also further explore the anatomical and cognitive properties of this effect.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Methods:</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Seven surgical TLE patients had depth electrodes implanted in the amygdala that were used to deliver electrical stimulation during functional mapping prior to resection. Real-time respiratory monitoring was performed in each patient to confirm apnea.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Results:</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Our data confirm that amygdala stimulation reliably induces apnea (occurring in all seven patients) and further suggest that apnea can be overcome by instructing the patient to inhale, and can be prevented entirely by breathing through the mouth prior to electrical stimulation. Finally, stimulation induced apnea occurred only when stimulating the medial most amygdalar contacts located in the central nucleus.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Interpretation:</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>These findings confirm a functional connection between the amygdala and respiratory control in humans. Moreover, they suggest specific amygdalar nuclei may be critical in mediating this effect and that attentional state is critical to apnea mediated by amygdala activation - perhaps alluding to future development of strategies for the prevention of SUDEP.

<h3>ABSTRACT</h3>
<div class="para"><p><b>Background</b>: Understanding the pathological changes underlying mild motor features of the eldery and defining a patient population with prodromal Parkinson's disease (PD) are of great clinical importance. It remains unclear, however, how to accurately and specifically diagnose prodromal PD. We examined whether older adults with minimal parkinsonian motor features have nigrostriatal degeneration and α-synuclein pathology consistent with prodromal PD.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Methods</b>: Brain sections were obtained from older adults with a clinical diagnosis of PD (N=21) and without a clinical diagnosis of PD (N=27) who underwent motor examination proximate to death. Cases without PD were further dichotomized into no motor deficit (n=9) or minimal motor features (n-18) groups using a modified Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale. We performed quantitative unbiased stereological analyses of dopaminergic neurons/terminals and α-synuclein accumulation in the nigrostriatal system.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Results</b>: In all subjects with minimal motor features, there were significant reductions in dopaminergic neurons and terminals in the substantia nigra and putamen that was intermediate between subjects with no motor deficit and PD. Phosphorylated α-synuclein inclusions were observed in the substantia nigra that were of similar density to what was seen in PD. Furthermore, there was greater Lewy neuritic pathology in the putamen relative to PD patients. Lastly, neurons with α-synuclein inclusions displayed reductions in tyrosine hydroxylase expression that was comparable in subjects with both minimal motor features and PD.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><b>Interpretation</b>: Minimal motor features in older adults may represent prodromal PD and identify at risk individuals for testing putative neuroprotective interventions that could slow or prevent PD progression.

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div class="para"><p><em>Objective</em>: To evaluate the outcomes one-year and longer following stereotactic laser amygdalohippocampotomy for mesial temporal lobe epilepsy in a large series of patients treated over a five-year period since introduction of this novel technique.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><em>Methods</em>: Surgical outcomes of a consecutive series of fifty-eight patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy who underwent the surgery at our institution with at least 12-months follow-up were retrospectively evaluated. A subgroup analysis was performed comparing patients with and without mesial temporal sclerosis.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><em>Results</em>: One-year following stereotactic laser amygdalohippocampotomy 53.4% (95% confidence interval: 40.8%-65.7%) of all patients were free of disabling seizures (Engel 1). Three of nine patients became seizure free following repeat ablation. Subgroup analysis showed that 60.5% (95% confidence interval: 45.6%-73.7%) of patients with mesial temporal sclerosis were free of disabling seizures as compared to 33.3% (95% confidence interval: 15.0%-58.5%) of patients without mesial temporal sclerosis. Quality of Life in Epilepsy-31 scores significantly improved at the group level, few procedure-related complications were observed, and verbal memory outcome was better than historical open resection data.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p><em>Interpretation</em>: In an unselected consecutive series of patients, stereotactic laser amygdalohippocampotomy yielded seizure-free rates for patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy lower than, but comparable to, the outcomes typically associated with open temporal lobe surgery. Analogous to results from open surgery, patients without mesial temporal sclerosis fared less well. This novel procedure is an effective minimally invasive alternative to resective surgery. In the minority of patients not free of disabling seizures, laser ablation presents no barrier to additional open surgery. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.</p></div>

Abstract<p>GCaMP is an optogenetic Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor widely used for monitoring neuronal activities but the precise physiological implications of GCaMP signals remain to be further delineated among functionally distinct synapses. The <i>Drosophila</i> neuromuscular junction (NMJ), a powerful genetic system for studying synaptic function and plasticity, consists of tonic and phasic glutamatergic and modulatory aminergic motor terminals of distinct properties. We report a first simultaneous imaging and electric recording study to directly contrast the frequency characteristics of GCaMP signals of the three synapses for physiological implications. Different GCaMP variants were applied in genetic and pharmacological perturbation experiments to examine the Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and clearance processes underlying the GCaMP signal. Distinct mutational and drug effects on GCaMP signals indicate differential roles of Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> channels, encoded by genes including <i>paralytic</i>, <i>Shaker</i>, <i>Shab</i>, and <i>ether-a-go-go</i>, in excitability control of different motor terminals. Moreover, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling properties reflected by the characteristic frequency dependence of the synaptic GCaMP signals were determined to a large extent by differential capacity of mitochondria-powered Ca<sup>2+</sup> clearance mechanisms. Simultaneous focal recordings of synaptic activities further revealed that GCaMPs were ineffective in tracking the rapid dynamics of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx that triggers transmitter release, especially during low-frequency activities, but more adequately reflected cytosolic residual Ca<sup>2+</sup> accumulation, a major factor governing activity-dependent synaptic plasticity. These results highlight the vast range of GCaMP response patterns in functionally distinct synaptic types and provide relevant information for establishing basic guidelines for the physiological interpretations of pre-synaptic GCaMP signals from in situ imaging studies.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> GCaMPs are a family of genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators widely employed in monitoring neuronal circuit activities. This study employed a genetic model system to enable simultaneous recording of presynaptic GCaMP signals in three functionally distinct types of synapses side by side. The results reveal how differential control by membrane excitability and mitochondria-powered Ca<sup>2+</sup> clearance mechanisms shape distinct residual Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics in different synaptic boutons during repetitive firing. Our results demonstrate a wide range of GCaMP response patterns in relation to different types of synaptic transmission and thereby provide background information for proper interpretations of GCaMP signals in a variety of synaptic activities.</p>

Abstract<p>Dopamine has been suggested to be crucially involved in effort-related choices. Key findings are that dopamine depletion (i) changed preference for a high-cost-large-reward option to a low-cost-small-reward option, (ii) but not when the large-reward option was also low-cost or the small-reward option gave no reward, (iii) while increasing the latency in all the cases but only transiently, and that (iv) antagonism of either dopamine D1 or D2 receptors also specifically impaired selection of the high-cost-large-reward option. The underlying neural circuit mechanisms remain unclear. Here we show that findings (i)-(iii) can be explained by the dopaminergic representation of temporal-difference-reward-prediction-error, whose mechanisms have now become clarified, if (1) the synaptic strengths storing the values of actions mildly decay in time and (2) the obtained-reward-representing excitatory input to dopamine neurons increases after dopamine depletion. The former is potentially caused by background neural activity-induced weak synaptic plasticity, and the latter is assumed to occur through post-depletion increase of neural activity in the pedunculopontine nucleus, where neurons representing obtained reward exist and presumably send excitatory projections to dopamine neurons. We further show that finding (iv), which is nontrivial given the suggested distinct functions of the D1 and D2 corticostriatal pathways, can also be explained if we additionally assume a proposed mechanism of temporal-difference-reward-prediction-error calculation, in which the D1 and D2 pathways encode the values of actions with a temporal difference. These results suggest a possible circuit mechanism for the involvements of dopamine in effort-related choices, and simultaneously, provide implications for the mechanisms of temporal-difference-reward-prediction-error calculation.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Depletion of dopamine (DA) or antagonism of either of the two major types of DA receptors was all shown to impair effortful actions to obtain large rewards while sparing reward-seeking or effort-exertion per se. DA has thus been proposed to play specific roles in reward-oriented effort exertion. However, underlying neural circuit mechanisms, and their relations with another popular role of DA, encoding of temporal-difference-reward-prediction-error (TD-RPE), remain unclear. We show that the experimental results suggesting DA's involvements in effort-related choices can be consistently explained by the DA's encoding of TD-RPE if assuming a mild decay of learned values, an increase of obtained-reward-representing input to DA neurons as a secondary effect of DA depletion, and a proposed circuit mechanism of TD-RPE calculation.</p>

<p>EEG signals are records of nonlinear solitary waves in human brains. The
waves have several types (e.g., a, b, g, q, d) in response to different levels
of consciousness. They are classified into two groups: Group-1 consists of
complex storm-like waves (a, b, and g); Group-2 is composed of simple
quasilinear waves (q and d). In order to elucidate the mechanism of EEG wave
formation and propagation, this paper extends the Vlasov-Maxwell equations of
Plasma Brain Dynamics (PBD) to a set of two-fluid, self-similar, nonlinear
solitary wave equations. Numerical simulations are performed for different EEG
signals. Main results include: (1) The excitation and propagation of the EEG
wave packets are dependent of electric and magnetic fields, brain aqua-ions,
electron and ion temperatures, masses, and their initial fluid speeds; (2)
Group-1 complex waves contain three ingredients: the high-frequency
ion-acoustic (IA) mode, the intermediate-frequency lower-hybrid (LH) mode, and
the low-frequency ion-cyclotron (IC) mode; (3) Group-2 simple waves fall within
the IA band, featured by one or a combination of the three envelopes:
sinusoidal, sawtooth, and spiky/bipolar. The study proposes an alternative
model to Quantum Brain Dynamics (QBD) by suggesting that the formation and
propagation of the nonlinear solitary EEG waves in the brain have the same
mechanism as that of the waves in space plasmas

We revisit recent evidence showing that nasal respiration entrains oscillations at the same frequency as breathing in several regions of the rodent brain. Moreover, respiration modulates the amplitude of a specific gamma sub-band (70–120Hz), most prominently in frontal regions. Since rodents often breathe at delta and theta frequencies, we caution that previous studies on delta and theta power and their cross-regional synchrony, as well as on delta–gamma and theta–gamma coupling, may have detected the respiration-entrained rhythm and respiration–gamma coupling.

Matt et al. introduce α-actinin as a critical postsynaptic docking protein for PSD-95 and AMPARs. They found that disruption of the PSD-95-α-actinin interaction by point-mutating the essential residues on either protein leads to reduced synaptic localization of PSD-95 and AMPARs.

Chang and Abderemane-Ali et al. define a unified framework for calmodulin (CaM) control of Kv7 (KCNQ) channels, important in the brain, heart, and ear. A CaM C-lobe calcium-dependent switch releases a shared Apo/CaM clamp conformation that enables Kv7 isoform-specific functional outcomes.

A key constraint in genomic testing in oncology is that matched normal specimens are not commonly obtained in clinical practice. Thus, while well-characterized genomic alterations do not require normal tissue for interpretation, a significant number of alterations will be unknown in whether they are germline or somatic, in the absence of a matched normal control. We introduce SGZ (somatic-germline-zygosity), a computational method for predicting somatic vs. germline origin and homozygous vs. heterozygous or sub-clonal state of variants identified from deep massively parallel sequencing (MPS) of cancer specimens. The method does not require a patient matched normal control, enabling broad application in clinical research. SGZ predicts the somatic vs. germline status of each alteration identified by modeling the alteration’s allele frequency (AF), taking into account the tumor content, tumor ploidy, and the local copy number. Accuracy of the prediction depends on the depth of sequencing and copy number model fit, which are achieved in our clinical assay by sequencing to high depth (&gt;500x) using MPS, covering 394 cancer-related genes and over 3,500 genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Calls are made using a statistic based on read depth and local variability of SNP AF. To validate the method, we first evaluated performance on samples from 30 lung and colon cancer patients, where we sequenced tumors and matched normal tissue. We examined predictions for 17 somatic hotspot mutations and 20 common germline SNPs in 20,182 clinical cancer specimens. To assess the impact of stromal admixture, we examined three cell lines, which were titrated with their matched normal to six levels (10–75%). Overall, predictions were made in 85% of cases, with 95–99% of variants predicted correctly, a significantly superior performance compared to a basic approach based on AF alone. We then applied the SGZ method to the COSMIC database of known somatic variants in cancer and found &gt;50 that are in fact more likely to be germline.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/134RQp414fk" width="1" />

Abstract<p>The central medial nucleus (CeM) is a part of the intralaminar thalamus, which is involved in the control of arousal and sensory processing. However, ionic conductances and mechanisms that regulate the activity of the CeM are not well studied. Here, we used <i>in vitro</i> electrophysiology in acute brain slices from adolescent rats to demonstrate that T-type calcium currents (T-currents) are prominent in the majority of the studied CeM neurons and are critical determinants of low-threshold calcium spikes (LTS), which in turn regulate excitability of these neurons. Using an adenosine-three-phosphate (ATP)-free internal solution decreased T-current density and induced a profound hyperpolarizing shift in steady-state inactivation curves while voltage-dependent activation kinetics were spared. Furthermore, selective pharmacological blockade of T-channels or use of an ATP-free solution reduced both tonic action potential frequency and rebound burst firing in CeM neurons. Our results indicate that T-channels are critical regulators of a thalamocortical circuit output and suggest that cytosolic ATP could be an endogenous regulatory mechanism in which T-channels may functionally gate sensory transmission and arousal <i>in vivo</i>.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Recent studies have revealed the important impact of the central medial nucleus of thalamus (CeM) on control of arousal, yet the key ion channel that regulates its excitability has not been well studied. Here, we used patch-clamp recordings from acute brain slices to demonstrate for the first time that T-channels play an important supportive role in regulation of excitability of rat CeM neurons. Additionally, we found that T-channels not only play a major role in shaping the output of the CeM, but also that activity is strongly regulated by cytosolic adenosine-three-phosphate (ATP). Hence, ATP may be an endogenous regulatory mechanism in which T-channels can functionally gate sensory transmission and arousal <i>in vivo</i>.</p>

<p>The pervasive use of distributional semantic models or word embeddings in a
variety of research fields is due to their remarkable ability to represent the
meanings of words for both practical application and cognitive modeling.
However, little has been known about what kind of information is encoded in
text-based word vectors. This lack of understanding is particularly problematic
when word vectors are regarded as a model of semantic representation for
abstract concepts. This paper attempts to reveal the internal information of
distributional word vectors by the analysis using Binder et al.'s (2016)
brain-based vectors, explicitly structured conceptual representations based on
neurobiologically motivated attributes. In the analysis, the mapping from
text-based vectors to brain-based vectors is trained and prediction performance
is evaluated by comparing the estimated and original brain-based vectors. The
analysis demonstrates that social and cognitive information is better encoded
in text-based word vectors, but emotional information is not. This result is
discussed in terms of embodied theories for abstract concepts.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.01569">Alleviating catastrophic forgetting using context-dependent gating and synaptic stabilization. (arXiv:1802.01569v1 [cs.LG])</a></h4>

<p>Humans and most animals can learn new tasks without forgetting old ones.
However, training artificial neural networks (ANNs) on new tasks typically
cause it to forget previously learned tasks. This phenomenon is the result of
"catastrophic forgetting", in which training an ANN disrupts connection weights
that were important for solving previous tasks, degrading task performance.
Several recent studies have proposed methods to stabilize connection weights of
ANNs that are deemed most important for solving a task, which helps alleviate
catastrophic forgetting. Here, drawing inspiration from algorithms that are
believed to be implemented in vivo, we propose a complementary method: adding a
context-dependent gating signal, such that only sparse, mostly non-overlapping
patterns of units are active for any one task. This method is easy to
implement, requires little computational overhead, and allows ANNs to maintain
high performance across large numbers of sequentially presented tasks when
combined with weight stabilization. This work provides another example of how
neuroscience-inspired algorithms can benefit ANN design and capability.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>White matter degradation has been proposed as one possible explanation for age-related cognitive decline. In the present study, we examined 2 main questions: 1) Do diffusion characteristics predict longitudinal change in cognition independently or synergistically with amyloid status? 2) Are the effects of diffusion characteristics on longitudinal cognitive change tract-specific or global in nature? Cognitive domains of executive function, episodic memory, and processing speed were measured annually (mean follow-up = 3.93 ± 1.25 years). Diffusion tensor imaging and Pittsburgh Compound-B positron emission tomography were performed at baseline in 265 clinically normal older adults (aged 63–90). Tract-specific diffusion was measured as the mean fractional anisotropy (FA) for 9 major white matter tracts. Global diffusion was measured as the mean FA across the 9 white matter tracts. Linear mixed models demonstrated independent, rather than synergistic, effects of global FA and amyloid status on cognitive decline. After controlling for amyloid status, lower global FA was associated with worse longitudinal performance in episodic memory and processing speed, but not executive function. After accounting for global FA, none of the individual tracts predicted a significant change in cognitive performance. These findings suggest that global, rather than tract-specific, diffusion characteristics predict longitudinal cognitive decline independently of amyloid status.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>This study aimed to determine whether prenatal stress, measured by the number of stressful life events during the first 20 weeks of pregnancy, might relate to mood dysregulation and altered brain structure in young adulthood. Participants included 93 young adults from a community-based birth cohort from the Czech Republic. Information on prenatal stress exposure was collected from their mothers in 1990−1992. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and mood-related data were collected from the young adults in 2015. MRI analyses focused on overall gray matter (GM) volume and GM volume of cortical regions previously associated with major depression. Higher prenatal stress predicted more mood dysregulation, lower overall GM volume, and lower GM volume in mid-dorsolateral frontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and precuneus in young adulthood. We observed no prenatal stress by sex interactions for any of the relations. We conclude that prenatal stress is an important risk factor that relates to worse mood states and altered brain structure in young adulthood irrespective of sex. Our results point to the importance and long-lasting effects of prenatal programming and suggest that offspring of mothers who went through substantial stress during pregnancy might benefit from early intervention that would reduce the odds of mental illness in later life.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>In the mammalian cortex, GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons represent 2 major neuronal classes, which establish inhibitory and excitatory synapses, respectively. Despite differences in their anatomy, physiology and developmental origin, both cell types require support from glial cells, particularly astrocytes, for their growth and survival. Recent experiments indicate that glutamatergic neurons also depend on astrocytes for synapse formation. However, it is not clear if the same holds true for GABAergic neurons. By studying highly pure GABAergic cell cultures, established through fluorescent activated cell sorting, we find that purified GABAergic neurons are smaller and have reduced survival, nevertheless they establish robust synaptic transmission in the absence of glia. Support from glial cells reverses morphological and survival deficits, but does little to alter synaptic transmission. In contrast, in cultures of purified glutamatergic neurons, morphological development, survival and synaptic transmission are collectively dependent on glial support. Thus, our results demonstrate a fundamental difference in the way GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons depend on glia for the establishment of synaptic transmission, a finding that has important implications for our understanding of how neuronal networks develop.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The normal development of thalamocortical connections plays a critical role in shaping brain connectivity in the prenatal and postnatal periods. Recent studies using advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques in neonates and infants have shown that abnormal thalamocortical connectivity is associated with adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. However, all these studies have focused on a single neuroimaging modality, overlooking the dynamic relationship between structure and function at this early stage. Here, we study the relationship between structural and functional thalamocortical connectivity patterns derived from healthy full-term infants scanned with diffusion-weighted MRI and resting-state functional MRI within the first weeks of life (mean gestational age = 39.3 ± 1.2 weeks; age at scan = 24.2 ± 7.9 days). Our results show that while there is, in general, good spatial agreement between both MRI modalities, there are regional variations that are system-specific: regions involving primary-sensory cortices exhibit greater structural/functional overlap, whereas higher-order association areas such as temporal and posterior parietal cortices show divergence in spatial patterns of each modality. This variability illustrates the complementarity of both modalities and highlights the importance of multimodal approaches.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Cortical spreading depolarization (SD) is the electrophysiological event underlying migraine aura, and a critical contributor to secondary damage after brain injury. Experimental models of SD have been used for decades in migraine and brain injury research; however, they are highly invasive and often cause primary tissue injury, diminishing their translational value. Here we present a non-invasive method to trigger SDs using light-induced depolarization in transgenic mice expressing channelrhodopsin-2 in neurons (Thy1-ChR2-YFP). Focal illumination (470 nm, 1–10 mW) through intact skull using an optical fiber evokes power-dependent steady extracellular potential shifts and local elevations of extracellular [K<sup>+</sup>] that culminate in an SD when power exceeds a threshold. Using the model, we show that homozygous mice are significantly more susceptible to SD (i.e., lower light thresholds) than heterozygous ChR2 mice. Moreover, we show SD susceptibility differs significantly among cortical divisions (motor, whisker barrel, sensory, visual, in decreasing order of susceptibility), which correlates with relative channelrhodopsin-2 expression. Furthermore, the NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 blocks the transition to SD without diminishing extracellular potential shifts. Altogether, our data show that the optogenetic SD model is highly suitable for examining physiological or pharmacological modulation of SD in acute and longitudinal studies.</span>

<p>by Peter W. Donhauser, Esther Florin, Sylvain Baillet</p>

Magnetoencephalography and electroencephalography (MEG, EEG) are essential techniques for studying distributed signal dynamics in the human brain. In particular, the functional role of neural oscillations remains to be clarified. For that reason, imaging methods need to identify distinct brain regions that concurrently generate oscillatory activity, with adequate separation in space and time. Yet, spatial smearing and inhomogeneous signal-to-noise are challenging factors to source reconstruction from external sensor data. The detection of weak sources in the presence of stronger regional activity nearby is a typical complication of MEG/EEG source imaging. We propose a novel, hypothesis-driven source reconstruction approach to address these methodological challenges. The imaging with embedded statistics (iES) method is a subspace scanning technique that constrains the mapping problem to the actual experimental design. A major benefit is that, regardless of signal strength, the contributions from all oscillatory sources, which activity is consistent with the tested hypothesis, are equalized in the statistical maps produced. We present extensive evaluations of iES on group MEG data, for mapping 1) induced oscillations using experimental contrasts, 2) ongoing narrow-band oscillations in the resting-state, 3) co-modulation of brain-wide oscillatory power with a seed region, and 4) co-modulation of oscillatory power with peripheral signals (pupil dilation). Along the way, we demonstrate several advantages of iES over standard source imaging approaches. These include the detection of oscillatory coupling without rejection of zero-phase coupling, and detection of ongoing oscillations in deeper brain regions, where signal-to-noise conditions are unfavorable. We also show that iES provides a separate evaluation of oscillatory synchronization and desynchronization in experimental contrasts, which has important statistical advantages. The flexibility of iES allows it to be adjusted to many experimental questions in systems neuroscience.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/TNJ39uqAYcw" width="1" />

<p>by Volker Pernice, Rava Azeredo da Silveira</p>

Neural populations respond to the repeated presentations of a sensory stimulus with correlated variability. These correlations have been studied in detail, with respect to their mechanistic origin, as well as their influence on stimulus discrimination and on the performance of population codes. A number of theoretical studies have endeavored to link network architecture to the nature of the correlations in neural activity. Here, we contribute to this effort: in models of circuits of stochastic neurons, we elucidate the implications of various network architectures—recurrent connections, shared feed-forward projections, and shared gain fluctuations—on the stimulus dependence in correlations. Specifically, we derive mathematical relations that specify the dependence of population-averaged covariances on firing rates, for different network architectures. In turn, these relations can be used to analyze data on population activity. We examine recordings from neural populations in mouse auditory cortex. We find that a recurrent network model with random effective connections captures the observed statistics. Furthermore, using our circuit model, we investigate the relation between network parameters, correlations, and how well different stimuli can be discriminated from one another based on the population activity. As such, our approach allows us to relate properties of the neural circuit to information processing.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ANUis3AuuHE" width="1" />

<p>Direct electrical stimulation of the brain has emerged as a powerful treatment for multiple neurological diseases, and as a potential technique to enhance human cognition. Despite its application in a range of brain disorders, it remains unclear how stimulation of discrete brain areas affects memory performance and the underlying electrophysiological activities. Here, we investigated the effect of direct electrical stimulation in four brain regions known to support declarative memory: hippocampus (HP), parahippocampal region (PH) neocortex, prefrontal cortex (PF), and lateral temporal cortex (TC). Intracranial EEG recordings with stimulation were collected from 22 patients during performance of verbal memory tasks. We found that high  (62–118 Hz) activity induced by word presentation was modulated by electrical stimulation. This modulatory effect was greatest for trials with "poor" memory encoding. The high  modulation correlated with the behavioral effect of stimulation in a given brain region: it was negative, i.e., the induced high  activity was decreased, in the regions where stimulation decreased memory performance, and positive in the lateral TC where memory enhancement was observed. Our results suggest that the effect of electrical stimulation on high  activity induced by word presentation may be a useful biomarker for mapping memory networks and guiding therapeutic brain stimulation.</p>

<p>The striatum has been shown to play a critical role in reward prediction. It is composed of two neurochemically and anatomically distinct compartments known as the striosomes and the matrix. The striosomes comprise only about 15% of the striatum by volume and are distributed mosaically therein. Accordingly, it has been difficult to identify striosomal neurons in electrophysiological recordings and it has been unclear whether striosomal neurons, which project to midbrain dopaminergic neurons, engage in reward prediction. In this study, we utilized a mouse line (Sepw1-NP67) selectively expressing Cre in striosomal neurons, combined with endoscopic <i>in vivo</i> calcium imaging to selectively record activities of striosomal neurons during an odor-conditioning task. As mice learned the task, striosomal neurons in the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) showed predictive activities to odor cues that were associated with water rewards or aversive air puffs. These activities were proportional to the expected reward or air-puff intensity. Intriguingly, repeated recordings of the same striosomal neurons over a period of weeks revealed that predictive activities were learning-stage specific. That is, these activities disappeared after continuous training. Furthermore, presentations of rewards or air puffs activated some striosomal neurons. These findings suggest that the striosomes participate in reward prediction with learning stage-specific neural ensembles, and that they also send reward and aversive signals to dopaminergic neurons.</p>

Abstract
<p>Economic decision-making is disrupted in individuals with gambling disorder, an addictive behavior observed in Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients receiving dopaminergic therapy. The subthalamic nucleus (STN) is involved in the inhibition of impulsive behaviors; however, its role in impulse control disorders and addiction is still unclear. Here, we recorded STN local field potentials (LFPs) in PD patients with and without gambling disorder during an economic decision-making task. Reaction times analysis showed that for all patients, the decision whether to risk preceded task onset. We compared then for both groups the STN LFP preceding high- and low-risk economic decisions. We found that risk avoidance in gamblers correlated with larger STN LFP low-frequency (&lt;12-Hz) fluctuations preceding task onset. In particular, the amplitude of low-frequency LFP fluctuations carried significant information about future decisions. Decisions of patients not affected by gambling disorder were instead not correlated with pretask STN LFP. Our results suggest that STN activity preceding task onset affects risk decisions by preemptively inhibiting attraction to high but unlikely rewards in favor of a long-term payoff.</p>

<p><i>LIS1</i> mutations cause lissencephaly (LIS), a severe developmental brain malformation. Much less is known about its role in the mature nervous system. LIS1 regulates the microtubule motor cytoplasmic dynein 1 (dynein), and as LIS1 and dynein are both expressed in the adult nervous system, Lis1 could potentially regulate dynein-dependent processes such as axonal transport. We therefore knocked out Lis1 in adult mice using tamoxifen-induced, Cre-ER-mediated recombination. When an actin promoter was used to drive Cre-ER expression (Act-Cre-ER), heterozygous Lis1 knockout (KO) caused no obvious change in viability or behavior, despite evidence of widespread recombination by a Cre reporter three weeks after tamoxifen exposure. In contrast, homozygous Lis1 KO caused the rapid onset of neurological symptoms in both male and female mice. One tamoxifen-dosing regimen caused prominent recombination in the midbrain/hindbrain, PNS, and cardiac/skeletal muscle within a week; these mice developed severe symptoms in that time frame and were killed. A different tamoxifen regimen resulted in delayed recombination in midbrain/hindbrain, but not in other tissues, and also delayed the onset of symptoms. This indicates that Lis1 loss in the midbrain/hindbrain causes the severe phenotype. In support of this, brainstem regions known to house cardiorespiratory centers showed signs of axonal dysfunction in KO animals. Transport defects, neurofilament (NF) alterations, and varicosities were observed in axons in cultured DRG neurons from KO animals. Because no symptoms were observed when a cardiac specific Cre-ER promoter was used, we propose a vital role for Lis1 in autonomic neurons and implicate defective axonal transport in the KO phenotype.</p>

<p><i>Solenopsis invicta</i>, the red imported fire ant, represents one of the most devastating invasive species. To understand their sensory physiology, we identified and characterized their Hymenoptera-specific (Hs) TRPA channel, SiHsTRPA. Consistent with the sensory functions of SiHsTRPA, it is activated by heat, an electrophile, and an insect repellent. Nevertheless, SiHsTRPA does not respond to most of the honey bee ortholog (AmHsTRPA)-activating compounds. The jewel wasp ortholog (NvHsTRPA) is activated by these compounds even though it outgroups both AmHsTRPA and SiHsTRPA. Characterization of AmHsTRPA/SiHsTRPA chimeric channels revealed that the amino acids in the N terminus, as well as ankyrin repeat 2 (AR2) of AmHsTRPA, are essential for the response to camphor. Furthermore, amino acids in ARs 3 and 5–7 were specifically required for the response to diallyl disulfide. Thus, amino acid substitutions in the corresponding domains of SiHsTRPA during evolution would be responsible for the loss of chemical sensitivity. SiHsTRPA-activating compounds repel red imported fire ants, suggesting that SiHsTRPA functions as a sensor for noxious compounds. SiHsTRPA represents an example of the species-specific modulation of orthologous TRPA channel properties by amino acid substitutions in multiple domains, and SiHsTRPA-activating compounds could be used to develop a method for controlling red imported fire ants.</p>

Abstract
<p>The prefrontal cortex receives a dense serotonergic innervation that plays an important role in its regulation. However, how serotonin regulates different pyramidal and interneuron cell classes in this area is incompletely understood. Previous work in rats has shown that serotonin differentially regulates two classes of pyramidal cells in layer 5. It excites one class by activating 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors, whereas it more subtly modulates the integrative properties of the other by co-activating 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors. Here we have used electrophysiological recordings, combined with retrograde labeling and morphological reconstruction, to show that the first cell class corresponds to long range corticofugal neurons and the second corresponds to intratelencephalic neurons. These results suggest that, in rats, serotonin facilitates subcortical output while more subtly modulating cortico-cortical and cortico-striatal output. Interestingly, these results obtained in rats differ from those previously reported for mouse prefrontal cortex. Therefore we reinvestigated the effects of serotonin in mice and confirmed that serotonin predominantly activates inhibitory 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors on long-range corticofugal cells. Thus serotonin exerts opposite effects on these cells in rats and mice. Finally, we determined whether cortical serotonin responsiveness in mice is regulated during development. Serotonin elicited predominantly depolarizing inward current responses during the early postnatal period, whereas inhibitory 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor-mediated responses did not become evident until the end of the second postnatal week. These results reveal commonalities as well as unexpected differences in the serotonergic regulation of long-range corticofugal and intratelencephalic neurons of layer 5 in rat and mouse.</p>

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div class="para"><p><b>Objective</b>: Astrocytes fulfill neuronal trophic roles normally, but are transformed in Alzheimer's disease (AD) into A1-type reactive astrocytes that may destroy neurons through unknown mechanisms. <b>Methods</b>: To investigate astrocyte inflammatory mechanisms, astrocyte-derived exosomes (ADEs) were isolated immunochemically from plasmas of AD patients and matched controls for ELISA quantification of complement proteins. <b>Results</b>: ADE levels of C1q, C4b, C3d, factor B, factor D, Bb, C3b and C5b-C9 terminal complement complex (TCC), but not mannose-binding lectin (MBL), normalized by the CD81 exosome marker were significantly higher for AD patients (n=28) than age- and gender-matched controls (all p&lt;0.0001). ADE normalized levels of IL-6, TNF-α and IL-1β were significantly higher for AD patients than controls, but there was greater overlap between the two groups than for complement proteins. Mean ADE levels of complement proteins for AD patients in a longitudinal study were significantly higher (n=16, p&lt;0.0001) at the AD2 stage of moderate dementia than at the AD1 preclinical stage five to 12 years earlier, which were the same as for controls. ADE levels of complement regulatory proteins CD59, CD46, decay-accelerating factor (DAF) and complement receptor type 1 (CR1), but not factor I, were significantly lower for AD patients than controls (p&lt;0.0001 for CD59 and DAF), were diminished by the AD1 stage and were further decreased at the AD2 stage. <b>Interpretation</b>: ADE complement effector proteins in AD are produced by dysregulated systems, attain higher levels than in controls, and may potentially damage neurons in the late inflammatory phase of AD.

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<div class="para"><p>Introduction</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-antibody encephalitis is mediated by IgG-autoantibodies directed against the NR1-subunit of the NMDAR. Around 20% of patients have an underlying ovarian teratoma, and the condition responds to early immunotherapies and ovarian teratoma removal. However, despite clear therapeutic relevance, mechanisms of NR1-IgG production and the contribution of germinal center B cells to NR1-IgG levels are unknown.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Methods</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Clinical data and longitudinal paired serum NR1-reactive IgM and IgG levels from ten patients with NMDAR-antibody encephalitis were determined. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from these ten patients, and two available ovarian teratomas, were stimulated with combinations of immune factors, and tested for secretion of total IgG and NR1-antibodies.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Results</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>In addition to disease-defining NR1-IgG, serum NR1-IgM were found in 6/10 patients. NR1-IgM levels were typically highest around disease onset, and detected for several months into the disease course. Moreover, circulating patient B cells were differentiated into CD19<sup>+</sup>CD27<sup>++</sup>CD38<sup>++</sup> antibody-secreting cells <em>in vitro</em> and, in 90% of patients, secreted NR1-IgM and NR1-IgG. Secreted levels of NR1-IgG correlated with serum NR1-IgG (p&lt;0.0001) and this was observed across the varying disease durations, suggestive of an ongoing process. Furthermore, ovarian teratoma tissue contained infiltrating lymphocytes which produced NR1-IgG in culture.</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Interpretation</p></div>
<div class="para"><p>Persistent serum NR1-IgM and NR1-IgG, alongside the consistent production of NR1-IgG from circulating B cells and from ovarian teratomas suggest ongoing germinal center-reactions may account for the peripheral cell populations which secrete NR1-IgG. Cells participating in germinal center reactions might be a therapeutic target for the treatment of NMDAR-antibody encephalitis. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.</p></div>

<div class="section" id="ana25145-sec-0002"><h4>Methods</h4><div class="para"><p>We analyzed 3,604 brain high-resolution T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging scans from 1,417 participants: 1,214 MS patients (253 clinically isolated syndrome [CIS], 708 relapsing-remitting [RRMS], 128 secondary-progressive [SPMS], and 125 primary-progressive [PPMS]), over an average follow-up of 2.41 years (standard deviation [SD] = 1.97), and 203 healthy controls (HCs; average follow-up = 1.83 year; SD = 1.77), attending seven European centers. Disability was assessed with the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). We obtained volumes of the deep GM (DGM), temporal, frontal, parietal, occipital and cerebellar GM, brainstem, and cerebral white matter. Hierarchical mixed models assessed annual percentage rate of regional tissue loss and identified regional volumes associated with time-to-EDSS progression.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana25145-sec-0003"><h4>Results</h4><div class="para"><p>SPMS showed the lowest baseline volumes of cortical GM and DGM. Of all baseline regional volumes, only that of the DGM predicted time-to-EDSS progression (hazard ratio = 0.73; 95% confidence interval, 0.65, 0.82; <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001): for every standard deviation decrease in baseline DGM volume, the risk of presenting a shorter time to EDSS worsening during follow-up increased by 27%. Of all longitudinal measures, DGM showed the fastest annual rate of atrophy, which was faster in SPMS (–1.45%), PPMS (–1.66%), and RRMS (–1.34%) than CIS (–0.88%) and HCs (–0.94%; <em>p</em> &lt; 0.01). The rate of temporal GM atrophy in SPMS (–1.21%) was significantly faster than RRMS (–0.76%), CIS (–0.75%), and HCs (–0.51%). Similarly, the rate of parietal GM atrophy in SPMS (–1.24-%) was faster than CIS (–0.63%) and HCs (–0.23%; all <em>p</em> values &lt;0.05). Only the atrophy rate in DGM in patients was significantly associated with disability accumulation (beta = 0.04; <em>p</em> &lt; 0.001).</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana25145-sec-0004"><h4>Interpretation</h4><div class="para"><p>This large, multicenter and longitudinal study shows that DGM volume loss drives disability accumulation in MS, and that temporal cortical GM shows accelerated atrophy in SPMS than RRMS. The difference in regional GM atrophy development between phenotypes needs to be taken into account when evaluating treatment effect of therapeutic interventions. Ann Neurol 2018</p></div></div>

<div class="section" id="ana25144-sec-0001"><h4>Objective</h4><div class="para"><p>Nemaline myopathy (NM) is one of the most common congenital nondystrophic myopathies and is characterized by muscle weakness, often from birth. Mutations in <em>ACTA1</em> are a frequent cause of NM (ie, NEM3). <em>ACTA1</em> encodes alpha-actin 1, the main constituent of the sarcomeric thin filament. The mechanisms by which mutations in <em>ACTA1</em> contribute to muscle weakness in NEM3 are incompletely understood. We hypothesized that sarcomeric dysfunction contributes to muscle weakness in NEM3 patients.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana25144-sec-0002"><h4>Methods</h4><div class="para"><p>To test this hypothesis, we performed contractility measurements in individual muscle fibers and myofibrils obtained from muscle biopsies of 14 NEM3 patients with different <em>ACTA1</em> mutations. To identify the structural basis for impaired contractility, low angle X-ray diffraction and stimulated emission-depletion microscopy were applied.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana25144-sec-0003"><h4>Results</h4><div class="para"><p>Our findings reveal that muscle fibers of NEM3 patients display a reduced maximal force-generating capacity, which is caused by dysfunctional sarcomere contractility in the majority of patients, as revealed by contractility measurements in myofibrils. Low angle X-ray diffraction and stimulated emission-depletion microscopy indicate that dysfunctional sarcomere contractility in NEM3 patients involves a lower number of myosin heads binding to actin during muscle activation. This lower number is not the result of reduced thin filament length. Interestingly, the calcium sensitivity of force is unaffected in some patients, but decreased in others.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana25144-sec-0004"><h4>Interpretation</h4><div class="para"><p>Dysfunctional sarcomere contractility is an important contributor to muscle weakness in the majority of NEM3 patients. This information is crucial for patient stratification in future clinical trials. Ann Neurol 2018</p></div></div>

                <h4><a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25151">Randomized trial of transcranial direct current stimulation for poststroke dysphagia</a></h4>

<div class="section" id="ana25151-sec-0001"><h4>Objective</h4><div class="para"><p>We evaluated whether transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is able to enhance dysphagia rehabilitation following stroke. Besides relating clinical effects with neuroplastic changes in cortical swallowing processing, we aimed to identify factors influencing treatment success.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana25151-sec-0002"><h4>Methods</h4><div class="para"><p>In this double-blind, randomized study, 60 acute dysphagic stroke patients received contralesional anodal (1mA, 20 minutes) or sham tDCS on 4 consecutive days. Swallowing function was thoroughly assessed before and after the intervention using the validated Fiberoptic Endoscopic Dysphagia Severity Scale (FEDSS) and clinical assessment. In 10 patients, swallowing-related brain activation was recorded applying magnetoencephalography before and after the intervention. Voxel-based statistical lesion pattern analysis was also performed.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana25151-sec-0003"><h4>Results</h4><div class="para"><p>Study groups did not differ according to demographic data, stroke characteristics, or baseline dysphagia severity. Patients treated with tDCS showed greater improvement in FEDSS than the sham group (1.3 vs 0.4 points, mean difference = 0.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.4–1.4, <em>p</em> &lt; 0.0005). Functional recovery was accompanied by a significant increase of activation (<em>p</em> &lt; 0.05) in the contralesional swallowing network after real but not sham tDCS. Regarding predictors of treatment success, for every hour earlier that treatment was initiated, there was greater improvement on the FEDSS (adjusted odds ratio = 0.99, 95% CI = 0.98–1.00, <em>p</em> &lt; 0.05) in multivariate analysis. Stroke location in the right insula and operculum was indicative of worse response to tDCS (<em>p</em> &lt; 0.05).</p></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ana25151-sec-0004"><h4>Interpretation</h4><div class="para"><p>Application of tDCS over the contralesional swallowing motor cortex supports swallowing network reorganization, thereby leading to faster rehabilitation of acute poststroke dysphagia. Early treatment initiation seems beneficial. tDCS may be less effective in right-hemispheric insulo-opercular stroke. Ann Neurol 2018</p></div></div>

<p>Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia in human
beings, and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The current
standard of care includes interventional catheter ablation in selected
patients, but the success rate is limited. The major limitation of the current
approach to AF is the lack of fundamental understanding of its underlying
mechanism. Specifically, it remains unclear whether human AF dynamics are a
deterministic or a stochastic process. Here we assess for determinism in human
AF by evaluating the properties of the symbolic representation of intracardiac
electrical recordings obtained from patients. Specifically, we evaluate (a) the
number of the missing ordinal patterns, (b) the rate of missing ordinal pattern
decay for increased length of the time series, and (c) the causal-entropy
complexity plane of the Bandt-Pompe symbolic representation. When used
together, these are powerful tools to detect determinism, even in the presence
of experimental noise and brief time series.

<p>`Bursting', defined as periods of high frequency firing of a neuron separated
by periods of quiescence, has been observed in various neuronal systems, both
\textit{in vitro} and \textit{in vivo}. It has been associated with a range of
neuronal processes, including efficient information transfer and the formation
of functional networks during development, and has been shown to be sensitive
to genetic and pharmacological manipulations. Accurate detection of periods of
bursting activity is thus an important aspect of characterising both
spontaneous and evoked neuronal network activity. A wide variety of
computational methods have been developed to detect periods of bursting in
spike trains recorded from neuronal networks. In this chapter, we review
several of the most popular and successful of these methods.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>We recently reported that right-side dominance of the inferior parietal lobule (IPL) in self-body recognition (proprioceptive illusion) task emerges during adolescence in typical human development. Here, we extend this finding by demonstrating that functional lateralization to the right IPL also develops during adolescence in another self-body (specifically a self-face) recognition task. We collected functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from 60 right-handed healthy children (8–11 years), adolescents (12–15 years), and adults (18–23 years; 20 per group) while they judged whether a presented face was their own (Self) or that of somebody else (Other). We also analyzed fMRI data collected while they performed proprioceptive illusion task. All participants performed self-face recognition with high accuracy. Among brain regions where self-face-related activity (Self vs. Other) developed, only right IPL activity developed predominantly for self-face processing, with no substantial involvement in other-face processing. Adult-like right-dominant use of IPL emerged during adolescence, but was not yet present in childhood. Adult-like common activation between the tasks also emerged during adolescence. Adolescents showing stronger right-lateralized IPL activity during illusion also showed this during self-face recognition. Our results suggest the importance of the right IPL in neuronal processing of information associated with one’s own body in typically developing humans.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Unlike visual signals, sound can reach the ears from any direction, and the ability to localize sounds from all directions is essential for survival in a natural environment. Previous studies have largely focused on the space in front of a subject that is also covered by vision and were often limited to measuring spatial tuning along the horizontal (azimuth) plane. As a result, we know relatively little about how the auditory cortex responds to sounds coming from spatial locations outside the frontal space where visual information is unavailable. By mapping single-neuron responses to the full spatial field in awake marmoset (<span style="font-style: italic;">Callithrix jacchus</span>), an arboreal animal for which spatial processing is vital in its natural habitat, we show that spatial receptive fields in several auditory areas cover all spatial locations. Several complementary measures of spatial tuning showed that neurons were tuned to both frontal space and rear space (outside the coverage of vision), as well as the space above and below the horizontal plane. Together, these findings provide valuable new insights into the representation of all spatial locations by primate auditory cortex.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Cortical resting state networks have been consistently identified in infants using resting state-functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). Comparable studies in adults have demonstrated cerebellar components of well-established cerebral networks. However, there has been limited investigation of early cerebellar functional connectivity. We acquired non-sedated rs-fMRI data in the first week of life in 57 healthy, term-born infants and at term-equivalent postmenstrual age in 20 very preterm infants (mean birth gestational age 27 ± 2 weeks) without significant cerebral or cerebellar injury. Seed correlation analyses were performed using regions of interests spanning the cortical and subcortical gray matter and cerebellum. Parallel analyses were performed using rs-fMRI data acquired in 100 healthy adults. Our results demonstrate that cortico-cerebellar functional connectivity is well-established by term. Intra- and cortico-cerebellar functional connectivity were largely similar in infants and adults. However, infants showed more functional connectivity structure within the cerebellum, including stronger homotopic correlations and more robust anterior–posterior anticorrelations. Prematurity was associated with reduced correlation magnitudes, but no alterations in intra- and cortico-cerebellar functional connectivity topography. These results add to the growing evidence that the cerebellum plays an important role in shaping early brain development during infancy.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Cortical thickness (CT) and surface area (SA) vary widely between individuals and are associated with intellectual ability and risk for various psychiatric and neurodevelopmental conditions. Factors influencing this variability remain poorly understood, but the radial unit hypothesis, as well as the more recent supragranular cortex expansion hypothesis, suggests that prenatal and perinatal influences may be particularly important. In this report, we examine the impact of 17 major demographic and obstetric history variables on interindividual variation in CT and SA in a unique sample of 805 neonates who received MRI scans of the brain around 2 weeks of age. Birth weight, postnatal age at MRI, gestational age at birth, and sex emerged as important predictors of SA. Postnatal age at MRI, paternal education, and maternal ethnicity emerged as important predictors of CT. These findings suggest that individual variation in infant CT and SA is explained by different sets of environmental factors with neonatal SA more strongly influenced by sex and obstetric history and CT more strongly influenced by socioeconomic and ethnic disparities. Findings raise the possibility that interventions aimed at reducing disparities and improving obstetric outcomes may alter prenatal/perinatal cortical development.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Radial migration of cortical projection neurons is a prerequisite for shaping a distinct multilayered cerebral cortex during mammalian corticogenesis. Members of Rab GTPases family were reported to regulate radial migration. Here, in vivo conditional knockout or in utero knockdown (KD) of Rab23 in mice neocortex causes aberrant polarity and halted migration of cortical projection neurons. Further investigation of the underlying mechanism reveals down-regulation of N-cadherin in the Rab23-deficient neurons, which is a cell adhesion protein previously known to modulate radial migration. (Shikanai M, Nakajima K, Kawauchi T. 2011. N-cadherin regulates radial glial fiber-dependent migration of cortical locomoting neurons. Commun Integr Biol. 4:326–330.) Interestingly, pharmacological inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2) also decreases the expression of N-cadherin, implicating an upstream effect of ERK1/2 on N-cadherin and also suggesting a link between Rab23 and ERK1/2. Further biochemical studies show that silencing of Rab23 impedes activation of ERK1/2 via perturbed platelet-derived growth factor-alpha (PDGFRα) signaling. Restoration of the expression of Rab23 or N-cadherin in Rab23-KD neurons could reverse neuron migration defects, indicating that Rab23 modulates migration through N-cadherin. These studies suggest that cortical neuron migration is mediated by a molecular hierarchy downstream of Rab23 via N-cadherin.</span>

Mycolactone is the exotoxin produced by <i>Mycobacterium ulcerans</i> and is the virulence factor behind the neglected tropical disease Buruli ulcer. The toxin has a broad spectrum of biological effects within the host organism, stemming from its interaction with at least two molecular targets and the inhibition of protein uptake into the endoplasmic reticulum. Although it has been shown that the toxin can passively permeate into host cells, it is clearly lipophilic. Association with lipid carriers would have substantial implications for the toxin’s distribution within a host organism, delivery to cellular targets, diagnostic susceptibility, and mechanisms of pathogenicity. Yet the toxin’s interactions with, and distribution in, lipids are unknown. Herein we have used coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, guided by all-atom simulations, to study the interaction of mycolactone with pure and mixed lipid membranes. Using established techniques, we calculated the toxin’s preferential localization, membrane translocation, and impact on membrane physical and dynamical properties. The computed water-octanol partition coefficient indicates that mycolactone prefers to be in an organic phase rather than in an aqueous environment. Our results show that in a solvated membrane environment the exotoxin mainly localizes in the water-membrane interface, with a preference for the glycerol moiety of lipids, consistent with the reported studies that found it in lipid extracts of the cell. The calculated association constant to the model membrane is similar to the reported association constant for Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein. Mycolactone is shown to modify the physical properties of membranes, lowering the transition temperature, compressibility modulus, and critical line tension at which pores can be stabilized. It also shows a tendency to behave as a linactant, a molecule that localizes at the boundary between different fluid lipid domains in membranes and promotes inter-mixing of domains. This property has implications for the toxin’s cellular access, T-cell immunosuppression, and therapeutic potential.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/LYJj4QzsN_A" width="1" />

<p>by Caitlin Collins, Xavier Didelot</p>

Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) in microbial organisms have the potential to vastly improve the way we understand, manage, and treat infectious diseases. Yet, microbial GWAS methods established thus far remain insufficiently able to capitalise on the growing wealth of bacterial and viral genetic sequence data. Facing clonal population structure and homologous recombination, existing GWAS methods struggle to achieve both the precision necessary to reject spurious findings and the power required to detect associations in microbes. In this paper, we introduce a novel phylogenetic approach that has been tailor-made for microbial GWAS, which is applicable to organisms ranging from purely clonal to frequently recombining, and to both binary and continuous phenotypes. Our approach is robust to the confounding effects of both population structure and recombination, while maintaining high statistical power to detect associations. Thorough testing via application to simulated data provides strong support for the power and specificity of our approach and demonstrates the advantages offered over alternative cluster-based and dimension-reduction methods. Two applications to <i>Neisseria meningitidis</i> illustrate the versatility and potential of our method, confirming previously-identified penicillin resistance loci and resulting in the identification of both well-characterised and novel drivers of invasive disease. Our method is implemented as an open-source R package called treeWAS which is freely available at https://github.com/caitiecollins/treeWAS.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/OLN5pMOESlw" width="1" />

<p>by Pau Farré, Eldon Emberly</p>

The packaging of DNA inside a nucleus shows complex structure stabilized by a host of DNA-bound factors. Both the distribution of these factors and the contacts between different genomic locations of the DNA can now be measured on a genome-wide scale. This has advanced the development of models aimed at predicting the conformation of DNA given only the locations of bound factors—the chromatin folding problem. Here we present a maximum-entropy model that is able to predict a contact map representation of structure given a sequence of bound factors. Non-local effects due to the sequence neighborhood around contacting sites are found to be important for making accurate predictions. Lastly, we show that the model can be used to infer a sequence of bound factors given only a measurement of structure. This opens up the possibility for efficiently predicting sequence regions that may play a role in generating cell-type specific structural differences.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/O5rA1JNPMq0" width="1" />

<p>by Ximing Li, William R. Holmes</p>

Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) holoenzymes play a critical role in decoding Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in neurons. Understanding how this occurs has been the focus of numerous studies including many that use models. However, CaMKII is notoriously difficult to simulate in detail because of its multi-subunit nature, which causes a combinatorial explosion in the number of species that must be modeled. To study the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-calmodulin-CaMKII reaction network with detailed kinetics while including the effect of diffusion, we have customized an existing stochastic particle-based simulator, Smoldyn, to manage the problem of combinatorial explosion. With this new method, spatial and temporal aspects of the signaling network can be studied without compromising biochemical details. We used this new method to examine how calmodulin molecules, both partially loaded and fully loaded with Ca<sup>2+</sup>, choose pathways to interact with and activate CaMKII under various Ca<sup>2+</sup> input conditions. We found that the dependence of CaMKII phosphorylation on Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal frequency is intrinsic to the network kinetics and the activation pattern can be modulated by the relative amount of Ca<sup>2+</sup> to calmodulin and by the rate of Ca<sup>2+</sup> diffusion. Depending on whether Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx is saturating or not, calmodulin molecules could choose different routes within the network to activate CaMKII subunits, resulting in different frequency dependence patterns. In addition, the size of the holoenzyme produces a subtle effect on CaMKII activation. The more extended the subunits are organized, the easier for calmodulin molecules to access and activate the subunits. The findings suggest that particular intracellular environmental factors such as crowding and calmodulin availability can play an important role in decoding Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals and can give rise to distinct CaMKII activation patterns in dendritic spines, Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel nanodomains and cytoplasm.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/yb7HPOwKnGo" width="1" />

The biological basis of consciousness is one of the most challenging and fundamental questions in 21st century science. A related pursuit aims to identify the neural correlates and causes of unconsciousness. We review current trends in the investigation of physiological, pharmacological, and pathological states of unconsciousness at the level of large-scale functional brain networks. We focus on the roles of brain connectivity, repertoire, graph-theoretical techniques, and neural dynamics in understanding the functional brain disconnections and reduced complexity that appear to characterize these states.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptors (D<sub>2</sub>Rs) contribute to the inverted U-shaped relationship between dopamine signaling and prefrontal function.

Moreover, eight functional single nucleotide polymorphisms combined into a polygenic co-expression index (PCI) predicted co-expression of this <span style="font-style: italic;">DRD2</span> network and were associated with prefrontal function in humans. Here, we investigated the non-linear association of the PCI with behavioral and Working Memory (WM) related brain response to pharmacological D<sub>2</sub>Rs stimulation. Fifty healthy volunteers took part in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, functional MRI (fMRI) study with bromocriptine and performed the N-Back task. The PCI by drug interaction was significant on both WM behavioral scores (<span style="font-style: italic;">P</span> = 0.046) and related prefrontal activity (all corrected <span style="font-style: italic;">P</span> &lt; 0.05) using a polynomial PCI model. Non-linear responses under placebo were reversed by bromocriptine administration. fMRI results on placebo were replicated in an independent sample of 50 participants who did not receive drug administration (<span style="font-style: italic;">P</span> = 0.034). These results match earlier evidence in non-human primates and confirm the physiological relevance of this <span style="font-style: italic;">DRD2</span> co-expression network. Results show that in healthy subjects, different alleles evaluated as an ensemble are associated with non-linear prefrontal responses.

While both intrinsic and extrinsic cues are known to influence this process, whether distinct neuronal progenitor groups contribute to neuron diversity and allocation is poorly understood. Using in vivo genetic fate-mapping combined with whole-cell patch clamp recording, we show that the firing pattern and apical dendritic morphology of excitatory neurons in layer 4 of the barrel cortex are specified in part by their neural precursor lineage. Further, we show that separate precursors contribute to unique features of barrel cortex topography including the intralaminar position and thalamic innervation of the neurons they generate. Importantly, many of these lineage-specified characteristics are different from those previously measured for pyramidal neurons in layers 2–3 of the frontal cortex. Collectively, our data elucidate a dynamic temporal program in neuronal precursors that fine-tunes the properties of their progeny according to the lamina of destination.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Rhythmic synchronization of neurons is known to affect neuronal interactions. In the motor system, oscillatory power fluctuations modulate corticospinal excitability. However, previous research addressing phase-specific gain modulation in the motor system has resulted in contradictory findings. It remains unclear how many time windows of increased responsiveness each oscillatory cycle provides. Moreover, we still lack conclusive evidence as to whether the motor cortex entails an intrinsic response modulation along the rhythm cycle, as shown for spinal neurons. We investigated this question with single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation over the primary motor cortex at rest. Application of near-motor threshold stimuli revealed a frequency- and phase-specific gain modulation at both cortical and spinal level, independent of the spontaneous oscillatory power fluctuations at each level. We detected bilateral sensorimotor circuits in the lower beta-band (14–17 Hz) and unilateral corticospinal circuits in the upper beta-band (20–24 Hz). These findings provide novel evidence that intrinsic activity in the human motor cortex modulates input gain along the beta oscillatory cycle within distinct circuits. In accordance with periodic alternations of synchronous hyper- and depolarization, increased neuronal responsiveness occurred once per oscillatory beta cycle. This information may lead to new brain state-dependent and circuit-specific interventions for targeted neuromodulation.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Half a century ago, Donald Hebb posited that mental imagery is a constructive process that emulates perception. Specifically, Hebb claimed that visual imagery results from the reactivation of neural activity associated with viewing images. He also argued that neural reactivation and imagery benefit from the re-enactment of eye movement patterns that first occurred at viewing (fixation reinstatement). To investigate these claims, we applied multivariate pattern analyses to functional MRI (fMRI) and eye tracking data collected while healthy human participants repeatedly viewed and visualized complex images. We observed that the specificity of neural reactivation correlated positively with vivid imagery and with memory for stimulus image details. Moreover, neural reactivation correlated positively with fixation reinstatement, meaning that image-specific eye movements accompanied image-specific patterns of brain activity during visualization. These findings support the conception of mental imagery as a simulation of perception, and provide evidence consistent with the supportive role of eye movement in neural reactivation.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Flexible interactions between brain regions enable neural systems to adaptively transfer and process information. However, the neural substrates that regulate adaptive communications between brain regions are understudied. In this human fMRI study, we investigated this issue by tracking time-varying, task-evoked changes in functional connectivity between localized occipitotemporal regions while participants performed different tasks on the same visually presented stimuli. We found that functional connectivity between ventral temporal and the primary visual regions selectively increased during the processing of task-relevant information. Further, additional task demands selectively strengthen these targeted connectivity patterns. To identify candidate regions that contribute to this increase in inter-regional coupling, we regressed the task-specific time-varying connectivity strength between primary visual and occipitotemporal regions against voxel-wise activity patterns elsewhere in the brain. This allowed us to identify a set of frontal and parietal regions whose activity increased as a function of task-evoked functional connectivity. These results suggest that frontoparietal regions may provide top-down biasing signals to influence task-specific interactions between brain regions.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Creativity is the ability to see the world in new ways. Creative individuals exhibit the ability to switch between different modes of thinking and shift their mental focus. This suggests a connection between creativity and dynamic interactions of brain networks. We report here the first investigation into the relationship between the reconfiguration of dynamic brain networks during the resting state and verbal creativity using two fMRI datasets involving 574 subjects. We find that verbal creativity correlates with temporal variability of the functional-connectivity (FC) patterns of the lateral prefrontal cortex, the precuneus, and the parahippocampal gyrus. High variability of these regions indicates flexible connectivity patterns which may facilitate executive functions. Furthermore, verbal creativity correlates with the temporal variability of FC patterns within the default mode network (DMN), between the DMN and attention/sensorimotor network, and between control and sensory networks. High variability of FCs between the DMN and attention networks characterizes frequent adjustments of attention. Finally, dynamic interaction between the cerebellum and task control network also contributes to verbal creativity, suggesting a relationship between the cerebellum and creativity. This study reveals a close relationship between verbal creativity and high variability of cortical networks involved in spontaneous thought, attention and cognitive control.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Several human imaging studies have suggested that anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is highly active when participants receive competing inputs, and that these signals may be important for influencing the downstream planning of actions. Despite increasing evidence from several neuroimaging studies, no study has examined ACC activity at the level of the single neuron in rodents performing similar tasks. To fill this gap, we recorded from single neurons in ACC while rats performed a stop-change task. We found higher firing on trials with competing inputs (STOP trials), and that firing rates were positively correlated with accuracy and movement speed, suggesting that when ACC was engaged, rats tended to slow down and perform better. Finally, firing was the strongest when STOP trials were preceded by GO trials and was reduced when rats adapted their behavior on trials subsequent to a STOP trial. These data provide the first evidence that activity of single neurons in ACC is elevated when 2 responses are in competition with each other when there is a need to change the course of action to obtain reward.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Neuron-glial related cell adhesion molecule NrCAM is a newly identified negative regulator of spine density that genetically interacts with Semaphorin3F (Sema3F), and is implicated in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). To investigate a role for NrCAM in spine pruning during the critical adolescent period when networks are established, we generated novel conditional, inducible NrCAM mutant mice (Nex1Cre-ERT2: NrCAMflox/flox). We demonstrate that NrCAM functions cell autonomously during adolescence in pyramidal neurons to restrict spine density in the visual (V1) and medial frontal cortex (MFC). Guided by molecular modeling, we found that NrCAM promoted clustering of the Sema3F holoreceptor complex by interfacing with Neuropilin-2 (Npn2) and PDZ scaffold protein SAP102. NrCAM-induced receptor clustering stimulated the Rap-GAP activity of PlexinA3 (PlexA3) within the holoreceptor complex, which in turn, inhibited Rap1-GTPase and inactivated adhesive β1 integrins, essential for Sema3F-induced spine pruning. These results define a developmental function for NrCAM in Sema3F receptor signaling that limits dendritic spine density on cortical pyramidal neurons during adolescence.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The synaptic connectivity of cortex is plastic, with experience shaping the ongoing interactions between neurons. Theoretical studies of spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) have focused on either just pairs of neurons or large-scale simulations.

We develop a low-dimensional mean field theory for STDP in recurrent networks and show the emergence of assemblies of strongly coupled neurons with shared stimulus preferences. After training, this connectivity is actively reinforced by spike train correlations during the spontaneous dynamics. Furthermore, the stimulus coding by cell assemblies is actively maintained by these internally generated spiking correlations, suggesting a new role for noise correlations in neural coding.

<p>by Ryan C. Kennedy, Meir Marmor, Ralph Marcucio, C. Anthony Hunt</p>

A significant portion of bone fractures fail to heal properly, increasing healthcare costs. Advances in fracture management have slowed because translation barriers have limited generation of mechanism-based explanations for the healing process. When uncertainties are numerous, analogical modeling can be an effective strategy for developing plausible explanations of complex phenomena. We demonstrate the feasibility of engineering analogical models in software to facilitate discovery of biomimetic explanations for how fracture healing may progress. Concrete analogical models—Callus Analogs—were created using the MASON simulation toolkit. We designated a Target Region initial state within a characteristic tissue section of mouse tibia fracture at day-7 and posited a corresponding day-10 Target Region final state. The goal was to discover a coarse-grain analog mechanism that would enable the discretized initial state to transform itself into the corresponding Target Region final state, thereby providing an alternative way to study the healing process. One of nine quasi-autonomous Tissue Unit types is assigned to each grid space, which maps to an 80×80 μm region of the tissue section. All Tissue Units have an opportunity each time step to act based on individualized logic, probabilities, and information about adjacent neighbors. Action causes transition from one Tissue Unit type to another, and simulation through several thousand time steps generates a coarse-grain analog—a theory—of the healing process. We prespecified a minimum measure of success: simulated and actual Target Region states achieve ≥ 70% Similarity. We used an iterative refinement protocol to explore many combinations of Tissue Unit logic and action constraints. Workflows progressed through four stages of analog mechanisms. Similarities of 73–90% were achieved for Mechanisms 2–4. The range of Upper-Level similarities increased to 83–94% when we allowed for uncertainty about two Tissue Unit designations. We have demonstrated how Callus Analog experiments provide domain experts with a fresh medium and tools for thinking about and understanding the fracture healing process.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/qhxB-qfzMYk" width="1" />

<p>by Bandan Chakrabortty, Ikram Blilou, Ben Scheres, Bela M. Mulder</p>

Plant morphogenesis is strongly dependent on the directional growth and the subsequent oriented division of individual cells. It has been shown that the plant cortical microtubule array plays a key role in controlling both these processes. This ordered structure emerges as the collective result of stochastic interactions between large numbers of dynamic microtubules. To elucidate this complex self-organization process a number of analytical and computational approaches to study the dynamics of cortical microtubules have been proposed. To date, however, these models have been restricted to two dimensional planes or geometrically simple surfaces in three dimensions, which strongly limits their applicability as plant cells display a wide variety of shapes. This limitation is even more acute, as both local as well as global geometrical features of cells are expected to influence the overall organization of the array. Here we describe a framework for efficiently simulating microtubule dynamics on triangulated approximations of arbitrary three dimensional surfaces. This allows the study of microtubule array organization on realistic cell surfaces obtained by segmentation of microscopic images. We validate the framework against expected or known results for the spherical and cubical geometry. We then use it to systematically study the individual contributions of global geometry, cell-edge induced catastrophes and cell-face induced stability to array organization in a cuboidal geometry. Finally, we apply our framework to analyze the highly non-trivial geometry of leaf pavement cells of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> and <i>Hedera helix</i>. We show that our simulations can predict multiple features of the microtubule array structure in these cells, revealing, among others, strong constraints on the orientation of division planes.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-ogXqfE-FHg" width="1" />

<p>by Fei Qi, Magdalena Motz, Kirsten Jung, Jürgen Lassak, Dmitrij Frishman</p>

Translation of consecutive prolines causes ribosome stalling, which is alleviated but cannot be fully compensated by the elongation factor P. However, the presence of polyproline motifs in about one third of the <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> proteins underlines their potential functional importance, which remains largely unexplored. We conducted an evolutionary analysis of polyproline motifs in the proteomes of 43 <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> strains and found evidence of evolutionary selection against translational stalling, which is especially pronounced in proteins with high translational efficiency. Against the overall trend of polyproline motif loss in evolution, we observed their enrichment in the vicinity of translational start sites, in the inter-domain regions of multi-domain proteins, and downstream of transmembrane helices. Our analysis demonstrates that the time gain caused by ribosome pausing at polyproline motifs might be advantageous in protein regions bracketing domains and transmembrane helices. Polyproline motifs might therefore be crucial for co-translational folding and membrane insertion.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/tDkLZ5Cs-1M" width="1" />

Two recent papers have tackled the fundamental questions of how place fields are formed in a new environment and what plasticity mechanisms contribute to this process. Bittner et al., in their recent publication, discovered a novel plasticity rule that, in contrast to previous rules, spans the behavioral, seconds-long, timescale. Sheffield et al. have monitored, for the first time, dendritic activity during place field formation, and show the emergence of spatially tuned local NMDA spikes in basal dendrites of CA1 neurons.

Modern neuroscientific techniques that specifically manipulate and measure neuronal activity in behaving animals now allow bridging of the gap from the cellular to the behavioral level. However, in doing so, they also pose new challenges. Research using incompletely defined manipulations in a high-dimensional space without clear hypotheses is likely to suffer from multiple well-known conceptual and statistical problems. In this context it is essential to develop hypotheses with testable implications across levels.

The hippocampus is one of the brain’s great mysteries. Historically, theories of its function included emotion, response inhibition, general memory and spatial perception/learning, with memory versus space emerging as a particular focus of more recent debates. A 1978 paper by Olton and colleagues captured this dichotomy by exploiting their newly developed radial maze task to reveal a profound deficit in the ability of hippocampally lesioned rats to execute a spatial memory task. This finding supported the emerging spatial map theory of hippocampal function, and helped pave the way for the subsequent uncovering of an entire brain system linking space and memory.

2018 marks the 40th anniversary of Trends in Neurosciences (TINS), which I had the honor of joining last summer as its editor. As part of the anniversary, we will be issuing a series of 40 short Science and Society articles, each highlighting a past paper (or two) published during one of the years 1978–2017. At its core, the series aims to showcase the breadth of neuroscientific research, and give a glimpse of the remarkable progress during the last few decades. The February issue of TINS launches the series, with four articles discussing papers from 1978, 1988, 1998, and 2008.

Prior to the 21st century, genetic mechanisms that regulate sleep were largely unknown. In 1998, de Lecea et al. [1] (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95:322–327) and Sakurai et al. [2] (Cell 1998; 92: 573–585) reported the discovery of a gene they named hypocretin and orexin, respectively, which led to a revolution in our understanding of genetic and neuronal mechanisms that regulate sleep.

Rett syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder that primarily affects females and is caused by mutations in the methyl-CpG-binding-protein 2 (MECP2) gene. Initially, MeCP2 had been shown to be a repressor of gene transcription. In their 2008 paper, Chahrour and colleagues (DOI: 10.1126/science.1153252) reported that MeCP2 could also function as a transcriptional activator.

The structural identification of the cationic channel of the acetylcholine nicotinic receptor involved its biochemical tagging by channel blockers, followed by site-directed mutagenesis analyses reported in two papers in 1988. The ion channel was demonstrated to be lined by the transmembrane segment MII, in which the binding sites of channel blockers are “framed” by anionic rings.

Turchi et al. demonstrate that the basal forebrain, a major source of modulatory projections to the cerebral cortex, controls the level of broadly shared (“global”) spontaneous fluctuations without altering the spatial structure of resting-state networks.

He et al. performed single-vessel fMRI in rat to map spatiotemporal correlations of ultra-slow arteriole CBV and venule BOLD fluctuations, concurrent with intracellular-calcium photometry. They find a 2 mm correlation length, which bears on the resolution of functional connectivity.
