                Background Reducing maternal and neonatal deaths in low- and middle-income countries requires a comprehensive understanding of the challenges within the healthcare system. Effective upward referral systems play a crucial role in ensuring timely emergency care for obstetric complications in the healthcare system. The aim of this study is to understand the factors (antecedents) and defining characteristics (attributes) that influence upward referrals of obstetric emergencies. from Community Health Centres to higher-level hospitals in the OR Tambo district, Eastern Cape, South Africa. Methods Data were collected through document analysis, observations, focus group discussions and in-depth interviews, consisting of 59 participants, using a qualitative grounded theory approach. Results The study reveals a complex web of interrelated antecedents and attributes that influence the effectiveness of upward referrals in obstetric emergencies. While formal protocols exist, referral decisions are often undermined by systemic barriers. The findings suggest that the lack of coordination between referring and receiving facilities, coupled with fragmented feedback systems, hampers continuity of care. Despite these challenges, instances of effective referral were observed in settings where interprofessional collaboration, timely information sharing, and adequate preparation of patients were prioritised. Conclusion Effective upward referral of obstetric emergencies depends on timely decision-making, adequate patient preparation, clear communication, and inter-facility collaboration. This highlights the need for an integrated approach that strengthens health system functions, which are essential to reducing preventable maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality in resource-constrained settings like South Africa.

                Introduction One-lung ventilation (OLV) is used to isolate one lung during thoracic surgery, but manipulation and positioning can affect heart-lung interaction. Cardiomegaly may exacerbate these changes, especially in the left lateral decubitus (LLD) position. Objectives To investigate the effect of cardiomegaly on heart-lung interaction during OLV, particularly in the LLD position. Case presentation A 20-year-old male with recurrent spontaneous pneumothorax was scheduled for right-sided bronchopleural fistula repair via thoracotomy. The patient presented with cardiomegaly (cardiothoracic ratio 75%) and echocardiographic evidence of right ventricular and atrial dilation. In the LLD position, OLV led to desaturation when both lungs were ventilated, but oxygenation improved when only the left lung was ventilated. Results Cardiomegaly alters heart-lung interaction during OLV, particularly in the LLD position. The enlarged heart exerts pressure on the left lung, impairing ventilation. When both lungs are ventilated in this position, ventilation is directed toward the right lung, reducing oxygenation and causing desaturation. However, restricting ventilation to the left lung improved oxygenation due to better lung compliance and less interference from the enlarged heart. Conclusions Cardiomegaly affects heart-lung interaction during OLV in the LLD position. Oxygenation improves when only the left lung is ventilated, likely due to less compression of the left lung. The supine position may further enhance oxygenation even with bilateral ventilation. This case highlights the importance of considering cardiomegaly in OLV management. This section should be written as per the CARE checklist item 3.

                arXiv:2602.17557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Lewy body dementia (LBD) present overlapping clinical features yet require distinct diagnostic strategies. While neuroimaging-based brain network analysis is promising, atlas-based representations may obscure individualized anatomy. Gyral folding-based networks using three-hinge gyri provide a biologically grounded alternative, but inter-individual variability in cortical folding results in inconsistent landmark correspondence and highly irregular network sizes, violating the fixed-topology and node-alignment assumptions of most existing graph learning methods, particularly in clinical datasets where pathological changes further amplify anatomical heterogeneity. We therefore propose a probability-invariant random-walk-based framework that classifies individualized gyral folding networks without explicit node alignment. Cortical similarity networks are built from local morphometric features and represented by distributions of anonymized random walks, with an anatomy-aware encoding that preserves permutation invariance. Experiments on a large clinical cohort of AD and LBD subjects show consistent improvements over existing gyral folding and atlas-based models, demonstrating robustness and potential for dementia diagnosis.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16887">Construction of a classification model for dementia among Brazilian adults aged 50 and over</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2602.16887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To build a dementia classification model for middle-aged and elderly Brazilians, implemented in Python, combining variable selection and multivariable analysis, using low-cost variables with modification potential. Observational study with a predictive modeling approach using a cross-sectional design, aimed at estimating the chances of developing dementia, using data from the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSI-Brazil), involving 9,412 participants. Dementia was determined based on neuropsychological assessment and informant-based cognitive function. Analyses were performed using Random Forest (RF) and multivariable logistic regression to estimate the risk of dementia in the middle-aged and elderly populations of Brazil. The prevalence of dementia was 9.6%. The highest odds of dementia were observed in illiterate individuals (Odds Ratio (OR) = 7.42), individuals aged 90 years or older (OR = 11.00), low weight (OR = 2.11), low handgrip strength (OR = 2.50), self-reported black skin color (OR = 1.47), physical inactivity (OR = 1.61), self-reported hearing loss (OR = 1.65), and presence of depressive symptoms (OR = 1.72). Higher education (OR=0.44), greater life satisfaction (OR=0.72), and being employed (OR=0.78) were protective factors. The RF model outperformed logistic regression, achieving an area under the ROC curve of 0.776, with a sensitivity of 0.708, a specificity of 0.702, an F1-score of 0.311, a G-means of 0.705, and an accuracy of 0.703. Conclusion: The findings reinforce the multidimensional nature of dementia and the importance of accessible factors for identifying vulnerable individuals. Strengthening public policies focused on promoting brain health can contribute significantly to the efficient allocation of resources in primary care and dementia prevention in Brazil

                arXiv:2408.00770v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new illusion that challenges our understanding of stereo vision. The illusion consists of a larger circle at 50cm, and smaller circle in front of it at 40cm, with constant angular sizes throughout. We move the larger circle forward by 10cm (to 40cm) and then back again (to 50cm). The question is, what distance should we move the smaller circle forward and back to maintain a constant perceived separation in depth between the circles? Constant physical distance (10cm) or constant retinal disparity (6.7cm)? Observers choose constant disparity. We therefore argue the 'Linton Stereo Illusion' appears to suggest that perceived stereo depth reflects retinal disparities rather than 3D geometry.

                arXiv:2505.10444v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a method for inferring entropy production (EP) in high-dimensional stochastic systems, including many-body systems and non-Markovian systems with long memory. Standard techniques for estimating EP become intractable in such systems due to computational and statistical limitations. We infer trajectory-level EP and lower bounds on average EP by exploiting a nonequilibrium analogue of the Maximum Entropy principle, along with convex duality. Our approach uses only samples of trajectory observables, such as spatiotemporal correlations. It does not require reconstruction of high-dimensional probability distributions or rate matrices, nor impose any special assumptions such as discrete states or multipartite dynamics. In addition, it may be used to compute a hierarchical decomposition of EP, reflecting contributions from different interaction orders, and it has an intuitive physical interpretation as a "thermodynamic uncertainty relation." We demonstrate its numerical performance on a disordered nonequilibrium spin model with 1000 spins and a large neural spike-train dataset.

                arXiv:2602.16072v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Epilepsy affects over 50 million people worldwide, and one-third of patients suffer drug-resistant seizures where surgery offers the best chance of seizure freedom. Accurate localization of the epileptogenic zone (EZ) relies on intracranial EEG (iEEG). Clinical workflows, however, remain constrained by labor-intensive manual review. At the same time, existing data-driven approaches are typically developed on single-center datasets that are inconsistent in format and metadata, lack standardized benchmarks, and rarely release pathological event annotations, creating barriers to reproducibility, cross-center validation, and clinical relevance. With extensive efforts to reconcile heterogeneous iEEG formats, metadata, and recordings across publicly available sources, we present $\textbf{Omni-iEEG}$, a large-scale, pre-surgical iEEG resource comprising $\textbf{302 patients}$ and $\textbf{178 hours}$ of high-resolution recordings. The dataset includes harmonized clinical metadata such as seizure onset zones, resections, and surgical outcomes, all validated by board-certified epileptologists. In addition, Omni-iEEG provides over 36K expert-validated annotations of pathological events, enabling robust biomarker studies. Omni-iEEG serves as a bridge between machine learning and epilepsy research. It defines clinically meaningful tasks with unified evaluation metrics grounded in clinical priors, enabling systematic evaluation of models in clinically relevant settings. Beyond benchmarking, we demonstrate the potential of end-to-end modeling on long iEEG segments and highlight the transferability of representations pretrained on non-neurophysiological domains. Together, these contributions establish Omni-iEEG as a foundation for reproducible, generalizable, and clinically translatable epilepsy research. The project page with dataset and code links is available at omni-ieeg.github.io/omni-ieeg.

                arXiv:2602.16829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When feedback is absorbed faster than task structure can be evaluated, the learner will favor feedback over truth. A two-timescale model shows this feedback-truth gap is inevitable whenever the two rates differ and vanishes only when they match. We test this prediction across neural networks trained with noisy labels (30 datasets, 2,700 runs), human probabilistic reversal learning (N = 292), and human reward/punishment learning with concurrent EEG (N = 25). In each system, truth is defined operationally: held-out labels, the objectively correct option, or the participant's pre-feedback expectation - the only non-circular reference decodable from post-feedback EEG. The gap appeared universally but was regulated differently: dense networks accumulated it as memorization; sparse-residual scaffolding suppressed it; humans generated transient over-commitment that was actively recovered. Neural over-commitment (~0.04-0.10) was amplified tenfold into behavioral commitment (d = 3.3-3.9). The gap is a fundamental constraint on learning under noisy supervision; its consequences depend on the regulation each system employs.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01507">A Parameter-free Adaptive Resonance Theory-based Topological Clustering Algorithm Capable of Continual Learning</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2305.01507v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In general, a similarity threshold (i.e., a vigilance parameter) for a node learning process in Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART)-based algorithms has a significant impact on clustering performance. In addition, an edge deletion threshold in a topological clustering algorithm plays an important role in adaptively generating well-separated clusters during a self-organizing process. In this paper, we propose an ART-based topological clustering algorithm that integrates parameter estimation methods for both the similarity threshold and the edge deletion threshold. The similarity threshold is estimated using a determinantal point process-based criterion, while the edge deletion threshold is defined based on the age of edges. Experimental results with synthetic and real-world datasets show that the proposed algorithm has superior clustering performance to state-of-the-art clustering algorithms without requiring parameter specifications specific to the datasets.

Nanopore sensing holds the potential to revolutionize proteomics, yet current methods often rely on ensemble aggregation, where thousands of events must be statistically aggregated or averaged to identify a protein or peptide signature. While effective for pure samples, this aggregation strategy fails in complex, heterogeneous mixtures where the identity of individual molecules must be determined in real-time. Here, we demonstrate high-fidelity classification of peptides from single, individual translocation events, eliminating the need for ensemble averaging. This sensitivity is achieved using the anthrax toxin protective antigen (PA) nanopore. Unlike static pores used more generally, the PA pore’s dynamic active-site clamps generate information-rich, multi-state signals. These clamps also enable the utility of high-affinity capture, permitting analysis at low nanomolar concentrations. We developed a machine learning framework that makes inferences on these dynamical multi-state signals and achieves ~91% accuracy on single events. This work establishes a framework for true single-molecule proteomics, enabling the resolution of complex mixtures that bulk aggregation methods cannot decipher.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, wastewater-based epidemiology has progressively taken a central role as a pathogen surveillance tool. Tracking viral loads and variant outbreaks in sewage offers advantages over clinical surveillance methods by providing estimates not biased by testing practices and enabling early detection. However, wastewater-based epidemiology poses new computational research questions that need to be solved in order for this approach to be implemented broadly and successfully. Here, we address the variant deconvolution problem, where we aim to estimate the relative abundances of genomic variants from next-generation sequencing data of a mixed wastewater sample. We introduce <i>LolliPop,</i> a computational method to solve the variant deconvolution problem. <i>LolliPop</i> is tailored to wastewater time series sequencing data and applies temporal regularization in the form of a fused ridge penalty. We show that this regularization is equivalent to kernel smoothing and that it makes abundance estimates robust to very high levels of missing data, which is common for wastewater sequencing. We use the bootstrap to produce confidence intervals, and develop analytical standard errors that can produce similar confidence intervals at a fraction of the computational cost. We demonstrate the application of our method to data from the Swiss wastewater surveillance efforts as well as on simulated data.

                <p>by Francesco Caredda, Lisa Gennai, Paolo De Los Rios, Andrea Pagnani</p>

We present FeatureDCA, a statistical framework for protein sequence modeling and generation that extends Direct Coupling Analysis (DCA) with biologically meaningful conditioning. The method can leverage different kinds of information, such as phylogeny, optimal growth temperature, enzymatic activity or, as in the case presented here, principal components derived from multiple sequence alignments, and use it to improve the learning process and consequently efficiently condition the generative process. FeatureDCA allows sampling to be guided toward specific regions of sequence space while maintaining the efficiency and interpretability of Potts-based inference. Across multiple protein families, our autoregressive implementation of FeatureDCA matches or surpasses the generative accuracy of established models in reproducing higher-order sequence statistics while preserving substantial sequence diversity. Structural validation with AlphaFold and ESMFold confirms that generated sequences adopt folds consistent with their intended wild-type targets. In a detailed case study of the Response Regulator family (PF00072), which comprises distinct structural subclasses linked to different DNA-binding domains, FeatureDCA accurately reproduces class-specific architectures when conditioned on subtype-specific principal components, highlighting its potential for fine-grained structural control. Predictions of experimental deep mutational scanning data show accuracy comparable to that of unconditioned autoregressive Potts models, indicating that FeatureDCA also captures local functional constraints. These results position FeatureDCA as a flexible and transparent approach for targeted sequence generation, bridging statistical fidelity, structural realism, and interpretability in protein design.

                <p>by Lin Zeng, Zhenzhen Li, Enzhi Shen, Shikui Tu, Lei Xu</p>

PIWI proteins maintain genome integrity by piRNA-guided cleavage of complementary RNA targets. While Cleave-N’-Seq (CNS-seq) has advanced our understanding of PIWI targeting logic through quantitative mapping of cleavage rates and pairing rules, its labor-intensive workflows hinder systematic exploration of sequence determinants. Here, we present PAIRNet, a deep learning framework that predicts PIWI-mediated RNA cleavage rates by explicitly modeling guide-target interactions. Recognizing that interaction geometry, not just sequence, dictates cleavage efficiency, PAIRNet integrates biochemical insights with computational innovation: it encodes pairing states, mismatch types, insertions, and deletions alongside learnable positional embeddings to quantify spatial dependencies; employs a hybrid CNN-Transformer architecture prioritizing duplex dynamics over static sequence features to resolve both local catalytic motifs (e.g., contiguous base-pairing at g10–g11) and distal structural perturbations; and incorporates interpretability modules (saliency maps, counterfactual analysis) to link interaction patterns to biochemical insights and uncover position-specific cleavage rules. Validated across four PIWI-guide datasets, PAIRNet consistently ranks among the top two performers in all experimental conditions, achieving the most pronounced relative improvements in PCC, 34.7% for MILI and 14.6% for MIWI, over second-ranking methods. Critically, PAIRNet recapitulates key biological principles—stringent complementarity at catalytic residues (g10–g11) and tolerance for 3’ mismatches—aligning with structural studies of PIWI dynamics. By bridging biochemical precision with computational scalability, PAIRNet establishes a roadmap for designing high-specificity piRNA silencing tools while accelerating mechanistic studies of RNA-guided genome defense.

Bacteria can encode dozens of different immune systems that protect them from infection by mobile genetic elements (MGEs). MGEs themselves may also carry immune systems, such as CRISPR-Cas, to target competitor MGEs. It is unclear when this is favored by natural selection, and whether toxin–antitoxin (TA) systems—common competitive mechanisms carried by plasmids—can alter their efficacy. Here, we develop and test novel theory to analyze the outcome of competition between plasmids when one carries a CRISPR-Cas system that targets the other plasmid. Our mathematical model and experiments using <i>Escherichia coli</i> and competing IncP plasmids reveal that plasmid-borne CRISPR-Cas is beneficial to the plasmid carrying it when the plasmid has not recently transferred to a new host. However, CRISPR-Cas is selected against when the plasmid carrying it transfers horizontally, if a resident competitor plasmid encodes a TA system that elicits post-segregational killing. Consistent with a TA barrier to plasmid-borne CRISPR-Cas, a bioinformatic analysis reveals that naturally occurring CRISPR-Cas-bearing plasmids avoid targeting other plasmids with TA systems across bacterial genera. Our work shows how the benefit of plasmid-borne CRISPR-Cas is severely reduced against TA-encoding competitor plasmids, but only when plasmid-borne CRISPR-Cas is horizontally transferred. These findings have key implications for the distribution of prokaryotic defenses and our understanding of their role in competition between MGEs, and the utility of CRISPR-Cas as a tool to remove plasmids from pathogenic bacteria.

                <p>by Nick Quinn-Bohmann, Alex V. Carr, Sean M. Gibbons</p>

Prebiotic, probiotic, and combined (synbiotic) interventions often show variable outcomes across individuals, driven by complex interactions between introduced biotics, the endogenous microbiota, and the host diet. Predicting individual-specific success or failure of probiotic and prebiotic therapies remains a major challenge. Here, we leverage microbial community-scale metabolic models (MCMMs) to predict probiotic engraftment and microbiota-mediated short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production in response to probiotic and prebiotic interventions. Using data from two human clinical trial cohorts, testing a five-strain probiotic combined with the prebiotic inulin designed to improve metabolic health and an eight-strain probiotic designed to treat recurrent <i>Clostridioides difficile</i> infections, respectively, we show that MCMM-predicted engraftment largely agrees with measurements, achieving 75%–80% accuracy. Engraftment probabilities varied across taxa. MCMMs captured treatment-driven shifts in predicted SCFA production, and higher model-predicted growth rates of <i>Akkermansia muciniphila</i> were negatively associated with glucose area under the curve (AUC) in the first trial, providing clues about the mechanisms underlying treatment efficacy. Extending these models to a third human cohort undergoing a healthy diet and lifestyle intervention revealed substantial inter-individual variability in predicted responses to increasing dietary fiber, which were significantly associated with baseline-to-follow-up changes in cardiometabolic health markers. Finally, our simulation results suggested that personalized prebiotic selection may further enhance probiotic efficacy. Together, these findings demonstrate the potential of metabolic modeling to guide personalized microbiome-mediated interventions.

                <p>by Laurie J. Mitchell, Saori Miura, Youjung Han, Jann Zwahlen, Camille A. Sautereau, Bruno Frédérich, Vincent Laudet</p>

Understanding the developmental basis of phenotypic plasticity is key to unraveling the origins of biodiversity. In coral reef fishes, color pattern changes during ontogeny can serve adaptive functions, yet the mechanisms and ecological contexts shaping these transitions remain largely unknown. Here, we investigated color pattern development in the tomato anemonefish (<i>Amphiprion frenatus</i>), which exhibits transient posterior white barring during early juvenile stages. We demonstrated that the timing of bar loss is plastic and modulated by the social environment, where juveniles cohabiting with adult conspecifics exhibited bar loss ~24 days earlier than those isolated from adults. Through transcriptomic profiling, we identified gene expression changes implicating apoptosis- and autophagy-related pathways, as well as alterations in chromatophore development. Moreover, shifts in the expression of multiple thyroid hormone marker genes highlighted the potential neuroendocrinal integration of social cues that promoted bar loss. Ultrastructural analyses via transmission electron microscopy and in-situ assays indicated massive apoptosis of iridophores and associated dermal remodeling during the white-to-orange transition. The pharmacological inhibition of caspases delayed bar loss, confirming the functional role of programmed cell death. Behavioral trials revealed that adults responded differently to juveniles with/without the posterior bar, suggesting a role of transient barring in conflict avoidance during recruitment. Lastly, our evolutionary reconstruction of this plastic trait suggests that colony size is an important factor promoting this ontogenetic switch throughout anemonefishes. Our results provide compelling evidence for socially mediated plasticity in color pattern ontogeny with ecological and evolutionary implications for communication and species diversification in reef fishes.

                <p>by Carina Bergmann, Lisa M. Häsler, Marius Lambert, Stephan A. Kaeser, Stephanie A. Schultz, Barbara Riond, Marco Weiss, Martina Balz, Tobias Knauf-Witzens, Mathias Jucker</p>

Blood levels of neurofilament light chain (NfL) increase with age in healthy humans and have been shown to predict all-cause human mortality. To determine whether this relationship is conserved across species, we analyzed NfL in the blood of various animals. We observed age-related increases in NfL levels comparable to those seen in humans in mice, cats, dogs and horses. Longitudinal analysis of NfL trajectories in aged mice demonstrated that a faster rate of NfL increase predicts mortality. When comparing baseline NfL levels across 13 species, we found that those with lower baseline NfL levels tended to have longer lifespans; however, the collinearity between body size and life span complicates the interpretation of this finding. NfL was also robustly detected in blood of 39 additional mammalian species, as well as a few reptiles and birds, consistent with a conserved amino acid sequence of the NfL fragment in blood. Given the growing interest in NfL as a biomarker for neurological health and mortality in humans, our findings suggest that NfL may serve as a cross-species blood biomarker for assessing aging interventions and predicting mortality.

                Vocational students often experience career path anxiety due to uncertainty about labor market demands, limited mentoring, and misalignment between curricula and industry needs. In Indonesia, this is amplified by uneven career guidance despite mandates for workforce readiness. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) enable adaptive, data-driven, and psychologically informed support that links students’ skills with real-time labor markets. This study used a design science research approach to build and evaluate an AI-driven career guidance system with three components: (1) a supervised machine learning skills mapping engine, (2) an adaptive mentoring module using an AI chatbot and mentor matching, and (3) a real-time labor market intelligence module using natural language processing to analyze job postings and trends. A mixed-methods evaluation involved 180 vocational students from three schools in South Kalimantan assigned to intervention and control groups. Quantitative data were collected through pre–post career anxiety surveys and system performance metrics, while qualitative data were gathered through interviews and focus group discussions. Analysis included paired-sample t-tests, predictive model evaluation, and thematic analysis. Students using the AI system showed a significant 26.7% reduction in career path anxiety compared with minimal change in the control group (p < 0.001). The skills mapping model achieved 87% accuracy in predicting suitable career pathways with strong precision, recall, and F1-scores. Engagement was high: 65% repeatedly conducted skill-gap analyses, 79% joined adaptive mentoring, and 87% downloaded personalized career roadmaps. Qualitative findings revealed greater confidence, clearer direction, and better alignment between students’ competencies and labor market expectations. The AI-driven career guidance system effectively reduced career anxiety while strengthening readiness through personalized skills mapping, adaptive mentoring, and real-time labor market intelligence. The study shows that human-centered AI can enhance vocational guidance, bridge school–industry gaps, and support more confident, evidence-based career decisions among vocational students in Indonesia nationwide.

                Background Rising health expenditure has become a persistent challenge in middle-income economies. Rapid industrial growth, expanding financial systems, and weak environmental controls place growing pressure on public and private healthcare budgets. Understanding how finance, governance related channels, and environmental stress interact with health spending remains limited. Motivation You need evidence that links economic structure, environmental pressure, and financial development to health expenditure over the long run. This study responds to that gap by examining lower-middle- and upper-middle-income countries over the period 1995 to 2023, with attention to asymmetric and cross-country dynamics. Findings Health expenditure rises with industrialisation, foreign direct investment, carbon dioxide emissions, financial development, and trade openness. A 10 percent increase in industrial output raises health spending by about 1.8 percent. The same increase in foreign direct investment and trade openness increases health spending by roughly 1.5 percent and 1.6 percent. Carbon dioxide emissions exert the strongest effect. A 10 percent increase raises healthcare costs by nearly 6.7 percent. Renewable energy consumption reduces health expenditure. A 10 percent increase lowers health spending by about 1.7 percent. Results remain stable under DCE, DCE-IV, and asymmetric NARDL estimations. Implications You should treat health expenditure as a downstream outcome of financial expansion, environmental stress, and governance related policy choices. Stronger environmental regulation, cleaner energy transition, and finance aligned with sustainability can ease long-run healthcare burdens. Integrating health, energy, and financial policies can support fiscal stability and sustainable development in middle-income economies.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-892/v3?src=rss">Why Are Christian Schools Popular in Japan Despite the Small Number of Christians? : A Case Study of a Catholic Girls’ Junior and Senior High School [version 3; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                The proportion of Christians in Japan’s population is very small (0.7%). In contrast, Christian-affiliated schools are numerous and enjoy widespread popularity. As previous studies suggest, Christian schools—especially those for girls—are often associated with positive social images (such as being “refined” or “upper-class”), particularly among young women, and this association has been considered one reason for their popularity. However, much of the existing research is based on statistical analysis, literature review, or quantitative methods, and few studies have employed detailed qualitative approaches. Some earlier studies have applied Pierre Bourdieu’s theory of class reproduction to analyze the popularity of Christian girls’ schools, but they often frame this in terms of marriage as a pathway to upward social mobility—a perspective that does not fully align with the values of today’s youth, who tend to place greater emphasis on their individual careers. Therefore, this paper focuses on one Christian-affiliated integrated junior and senior high school for girls (referred to as School X) and explores the reasons for its popularity through semi-structured interviews with its alumni. Unlike previous research that has been constrained by gender biases, this study examines the appeal of such schools from the perspective of cultural capital. In particular, it emphasizes the relevance of alignment between the students’ values and the founding mission of the school. The findings reveal that the students perceived School X’s education as directly contributing to the acquisition of various forms of capital and habitus, as defined by Bourdieu (although not articulated in such terms by the students themselves). Additionally, These results indicate a strong sense of coherence between the school’s founding ideals and the students’ personal values. In conclusion, this paper offers insight—through the lens of cultural capital and habitus—into why Christian girls’ schools in Japan continue to be highly regarded.

     alt="RNAseq Analysis of the Cerebellum Reveals Significant Gene Dysregulation That May Explain Chronic Disease Progression in Mild Traumatic Brain Injury"/>
<p>Mice were subjected to 15 repetitive mild traumatic brain injuries using a modified closed head model, in a three impact days and two rest days rotation. Acute animals were sarificed at 48 h post final injury, and chronic animals were sacrified at 90 days post final injury. mRNA frm cerebellum tissue was analyzed for differential gene expression, gene set enrichment, and geen ontology. The chronic time point showed greater disruption to gene expression, ontology, and enriched pathways. The data suggests that secondary injury and possible repair mechanisms are long-lived after the final impact and extend beyond the impact zone.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is a major public health concern worldwide and contributes to chronic, persistent neurodegenerative diseases; however, the mechanisms are not fully understood. Most studies have examined cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and thalamus brain tissue, but the impact on the cerebellum following repetitive mTBI (rmTBI) leading to secondary injury cascades and long-term pathophysiology is largely unexplored. This study investigated changes in gene expression in cerebellum tissue from an established murine model of rmTBI. The cerebellum tissue from 15 male C57BL/6J mice was analyzed using RNA sequencing technology for animals sacrificed 48 h (acute) and 90 days (chronic) following a repetitive mild impact schedule. Differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis showed no dysregulated genes above log2 fold change at 48 h, but 360 DEGs at 90 days. At 90 days, multiple Gene Ontologies were different to controls, including disruption to mitochondria, proteosomes, ribosomes, and a reduction in vital cellular energy processes. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis in the chronic injury group revealed that dysregulated genes were characteristic of multiple neurological diseases, including <i>Parkinson's</i> and <i>Huntington's disease</i> genetic signatures. This data demonstrates that the cerebellum and other brain regions disparate from the site of impact are more than just a bystander in chronic neurodegenerative pathologies and provides a vital link to the development of neurological disorders like Parkinson's disease from rmTBI trauma.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To characterize Fc-glycosylation profiles in patients with anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis (NMDARe) and assess their association with antibody compartmentalization (cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] vs serum), disease triggers (viral, tumor-related or idiopathic), and 1-year outcomes.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We analyzed immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 and IgG2/3 Fc-glycosylation by liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry in paired serum/CSF samples from 50 age- and sex-matched patients with NMDARe identified in IDIBAPS/Hospital Clinic of Barcelona database and the Spanish study on herpes encephalitis. Patients were classified by disease trigger as post-herpetic, tumor-related, or idiopathic. One-year outcomes were defined as <i>good</i> (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] ≤2) or <i>poor</i> (≥3). Fc glycoprofiles were quantified for fucosylation, sialylation, galactosylation, and bisecting N-acetylglucosamination.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Across IgG subclasses (IgG1–3), CSF antibodies showed significantly reduced sialylation and galactosylation compared to serum (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001), indicating a pro-inflammatory compartmentalized response within the central nervous system. These inflammatory Fc-glycoforms were predominant in post-herpetic cases of NMDARe (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01) compared to tumor-related and idiopathic forms, suggesting that viral-induced NMDAR may alter antibody Fc-glycosylation via B-cell glycosylation pathway modulation. Furthermore, reduced sialylation, galactosylation and fucosylation in CSF and serum were associated with <i>poor</i> 1-year outcomes (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), suggesting that compartmentalized inflammation and enhanced innate immune activation, including natural killer (NK) cell–mediated cytotoxicity driven by afucosylated antibodies, might contribute to neurological dysfunction.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In NMDARe, CSF Fc-glycosylation profiles are both compartment- and trigger-specific. Because glycan signatures shape innate immune interactions (e.g., with NK cells), these findings highlight distinct pathogenic mechanisms and support Fc-glycosylation profiling as a potential prognostic biomarker.

                Prolonged grief disorder (PGD) is a psychiatric condition that describes individuals who experience persistent grief reactions characterized by preoccupation with the loss. This review provides an overview of the evidence on neurobiological processes associated with PGD. We propose that, although the neurobiological circuitry of PGD overlaps with that of anxiety and depression, it also involves neural responses that reflect the distinct symptom profiles of people with PGD. Specifically, while recruitment of cognitive control and salience networks is observed across common mental disorders, there is evidence that aberrant neural processes implicated in reward processes and appetitive functions are somewhat distinctive to PGD. We emphasize that methodological limitations suggest caution is needed in interpreting current evidence, and more rigorous research is required to delineate key distinct neurobiological processes of PGD.

                Xue and colleagues show that cone bipolar cells (CBCs) form a hierarchical, coupled network rather than independent parallel channels. Paired recordings and two-photon imaging identify driver CBCs that distribute sustained signals via electrical-chemical communication, generating patterned glutamate clouds that integrate CBC activity and enhance detection of small, low-contrast stimuli.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100715">Motor biases reflect a misalignment between visual and proprioceptive reference frames</a></h4>

              
                Goal-directed movements can fail due to errors in our perceptual and motor systems. While these errors may arise from random noise within these sources, they also reflect systematic motor biases that vary with the location of the target. The origin of these systematic biases remains controversial. Drawing on data from an extensive array of reaching tasks conducted over the past 30 years, we evaluated the merits of various computational models regarding the origin of motor biases. Contrary to previous theories, we show that motor biases produced by human participants do not arise from systematic errors associated with the sensed hand position during motor planning or from the biomechanical constraints imposed during motor execution. Rather, motor biases are primarily caused by a misalignment between eye-centric and body-centric representations of position. This model can account for motor biases across a wide range of contexts, encompassing movements with the right versus left hand, finger versus hand movements, visible and occluded starting positions, as well as before and after sensorimotor adaptation.

">Neural Representational Geometry of Feature Binding Operations</a></h4>

              
                The brain faces the feature binding problem: how are multiple stimulus features and variables combined into coherent representations that support flexible behavior? A key finding from neuroscience is that some brain regions employ factorized representations, where distinct features are encoded in neural state space in such a way that enables independent readout and robust generalization. Various algebraic operations have been proposed to model multi-variable representations, but despite extensive study of their theoretical properties (e.g., capacity, noise robustness), it remains unclear which operations produce the representational geometries observed in neural recordings. We systematically evaluate six binding operations implemented in recurrent spiking neural networks performing a working memory task. We find that only superposition and binding with slot-filler structure produce factorized geometry with favorable scaling, while the alternatives do not. These results provide a taxonomy linking algebraic binding operations to neural representational signatures, offering guidance for both computational modelers and experimentalists.

                Longitudinal brain imaging is essential for understanding neural mechanisms. Here, we present a saline-free, chronic preparation for repeated neural recording in adult Drosophila over multiple days. We describe steps for mounting flies, performing manual surgery on the head cuticle without external saline, and resealing the opening to create a transparent optical window. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by tracking single-neuron spiking and neuronal calcium dynamics over 7-10 days. This protocol is potentially applicable to other insect species.

">Dopamine ramps as a normative consequence of dual-process control</a></h4>

              
                Midbrain dopamine neurons are thought to implement a temporal difference (TD) reward prediction error (RPE) that updates cached values stored in striatum. This has been challenged by evidence that dopamine "ramps up" to predictable rewards during goal-directed behaviour. Here, we propose that dopamine ramps are RPEs generated by a dual-process learning system in which values inferred using a world model train cached values via the RPE. Ramps arise because efficient training of cached values requires that inferred values contribute to the update target but not the prediction component of the RPE. The model reproduces key dopamine ramp phenomena, including learning dynamics on fast and slow timescales, global updates following changes in reward expectation, transient responses during unexpected state transitions, and sensitivity to state uncertainty manipulations. We therefore argue that dopamine ramps are a signature of interactions between inferred and cached values that revise the traditional dichotomy between model-based and model-free learning.

">ApoE-Dependent Lipid Handling by Median Eminence Microglia Preserves Myelin Integrity and Metabolic Function</a></h4>

              
                Microglia regulate hypothalamic control of systemic metabolism, but the mechanisms underlying their contribution remain unclear. Here, we identify a distinct apolipoprotein E (ApoE)-expressing microglial population enriched in the median eminence (ME), a brain region involved in sensing peripheral cues and metabolic regulation. These microglia engage multiple functional programs related to lipid handling, interferon signaling, and stress responses that are differentially regulated within the ME. Consumption of a Western diet (WD) increased interferon signaling and lipid accumulation in ME microglia. Expression of the human APOE4 isoform in mice exacerbated microglial lipid dysregulation, interferon signaling, and impaired ME myelin organization. Deleting APOE in microglia attenuated their ability to couple lipid accumulation to interferon signaling, identifying microglial APOE as a cell-intrinsic determinant of interferon responses. Finally, selective activation of liver X receptor signaling using synthetic HDL nanoparticles restored microglial lipid homeostasis, improved hypothalamic leptin responsiveness, and limited weight gain in WD-fed mice. Together, these findings define an Apoe-dependent regulatory program in ME microglia that is therapeutically targetable and clarify how nutritional stress disrupts hypothalamic control of metabolic homeostasis.

">Development and Validation of the Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Reporting Assessment Tool(TMS-RAT)</a></h4>

              
                Background: A standardised tool for comprehensive reporting can improve transparency, support consistent documentation, and enable comparison across transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) studies. The most used reporting checklist lacks clear definitions of full reporting and was not initially evaluated for usability or inter-rater reliability. A scoping review of studies using this checklist shows that its items are reported only 50% of the time, suggesting that method descriptions are often incomplete. Methods: We developed the TMS Reporting Assessment Tool (TMS-RAT), a comprehensive reporting framework that provides clear definitions and examples for its items, covering a wide range of TMS protocols. We tested the usability and reliability of the TMS-RAT by rating all studies published between 1991 and 2025 using afferent conditioning (n = 333), a protocol encompassing many reporting categories identified during tool development. Seventeen independent raters contributed across three development phases, a validation phase, and a retest phase, with naive raters introduced in each phase. Iterative refinements of the tool were informed by inter-rater reliability, qualitative rater feedback, and consultation with external TMS experts. Results: We present two versions of the tool: the 72-item TMS-RAT v1.0, designed to guide comprehensive reporting, and the TMS-RAT v1.1, a subset of 50 items with the highest inter-rater (overall AC1 = 0.78, range = [0.60-0.99]) and test-retest reliability (overall AC1 = 0.82, range = [0.65-1.0]), intended for retrospective evaluation of reporting in systematic reviews, meta-analyses. Conclusion: The TMS-RAT is a comprehensive, reliable tool that seeks to improve transparency and reproducibility in TMS research.

">Postnatal conversion of methylcytosine to hydroxymethylcytosine reconfigures the human neuronal epigenome</a></h4>

              
                Healthy brain development requires a coordinated process of postnatal cellular maturation throughout the first two decades of life that transforms neuronal morphology, connectivity, physiology, and gene expression. The maturation and stable maintenance of neuron identity is driven, in part, by large-scale reconfiguration of the neuronal DNA methylome. Neurons have uniquely high levels of 5-hydroxy-methyl-cytosine (hmC) compared to other cell types, yet the relative contributions of 5hmC and 5-methyl-cytosine (mC) remain unknown because most experimental assays do not distinguish these marks. We measured mC and hmC using bisulfite- and oxidative-bisulfite sequencing in excitatory and inhibitory neurons, along with mRNA and histone modifications, from the prefrontal cortex of 103 human donors, ranging from 38 days to 77 years of age. Up to half of all CG dinucleotides convert from mC to hmC in a gradual process extending throughout the first decade of life, dramatically reshaping the neuronal methylome. Asymmetric enrichment of hmC on the sense strand of actively transcribed genes increases in a linear, clock-like fashion throughout the lifespan, indicating a mechanistic link between transcription and hmC. We found that sex differences in X-linked DNA methylation in the human brain are primarily driven by hmCG rather than mCG, suggesting an important role for hmC in X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) and escape gene expression. We found key changes in 5hmC at dynamic cis-regulatory elements marked by changing cell type-specific levels of active and repressive histone modifications. Collectively, our findings reveal the dynamic trajectory of hmC in human neurons across the lifespan and highlight the association of DNA hydroxymethylation with transcription, chromatin state, and sex-specific gene regulation.

">A biofidelic Goat Model of Traumatic Optic Neuropathy with Optic Canal Fracture via Transnasal Endoscopy</a></h4>

              
                Traumatic optic neuropathy (TON) is a major cause of irreversible vision loss following blunt cranial trauma, yet the absence of clinically relevant large animal models that faithfully recapitulate human TON has significantly impeded translational research. Current rodent models do not reproduce optic canal fracture, a key injury mechanism in many patients with TON. Here, we combined high-fidelity finite element analysis (FEA) with iterative engineering to establish a reproducible goat model of TON. We first built a high-resolution human-head finite element model to characterize force transmission to the optic nerve. Across clinically relevant periorbital impacts, stress preferentially concentrated in the intracanalicular segment, reaching a peak force density of approximately 500 N/m^2 at 50.6 ms, about fivefold higher than in the intraorbital segment. Simulations further showed that direct optic canal impact reproduced comparable intracanalicular stress with a markedly lower input force: 195 N, compared with 3900 N for periorbital impact. Guided by these insights, we developed transnasal endoscopic impact systems capable of inducing optic canal fractures in goats. TON was confirmed within 24 hours by a characteristic relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD), and at 1 month post-injury goats (n = 14) exhibited a 10%-20% reduction in ganglion cell complex (GCC) thickness and 40%-65% reductions in flash visual evoked potential (FVEP) and pattern electroretinogram (PERG) amplitude ratios (all P <= 0.001), with structural and functional preservation of the fellow eye. This study presents a robust, standardized, and clinically relevant large-animal platform for investigating TON pathophysiology.

">Temperature effects on taste preferences are influenced by TRPM8</a></h4>

              
                Taste perception is influenced by stimulus and oral temperature. Change in oral temperature modulates trigeminal neurons. Whether trigeminal thermal sensing interacts with taste is unknown. Here we studied temperature influences on mouse taste preferences and how they could change following silencing of TRPM8 (transient receptor potential melastatin 8) -- a thermoreceptor supporting cool and warm temperature coding by trigeminal neurons. Female and male TRPM8 gene deficient and C57BL/6J (B6) control mice (n = 69) entered thermolickometry tests where they sampled taste solutions at cool (15{degrees}C) and warm (30{degrees}C) temperatures during brief-access (10-sec long) exposure trials, which capture oral sensory/tongue control of licking behavior. Taste solutions included innately avoided bitter quinine (0.03 and 0.3 mM) and preferred sugars (sucrose or glucose, 100 and 500 mM). Mice were respectively maintained under water restriction or water-replete conditions during quinine and sugar tests, which were conducted separately. Analyses revealed that 15{degrees}C enhanced, while 30{degrees}C reduced, licks to quinine in both B6 and TRPM8 deficient mice, which responded similarly (p > 0.05). In contrast, licks to static concentrations of sugars trended towards enhancement by 30{degrees}C, compared to 15{degrees}C, in male B6 mice but were suppressed, and inhibited, by 30{degrees}C (p < 0.05) in male TRPM8 deficient mice. This result agrees with prior studies that show warmth normally facilitates sweetness and that 30{degrees}C stimulation of oral tissues becomes anomalously aversive in TRPM8 deficient mice. These data provide initial evidence that TRPM8 thermosensory influences interact with sugar taste preferences, which may reflect a trigeminal-taste cross-modal phenomenon.

">Neural processing of natural speech by adults with and without dyslexia: Evidence for atypical cortical decoding of speech information in the delta and theta EEG bands</a></h4>

              
                Neural oscillations in the delta (0.5-4 Hz) and theta (4-8 Hz) bands play a key role in tracking the temporal structure of speech. According to Temporal Sampling (TS) theory, dyslexia arises from atypical entrainment of these low-frequency oscillations to speech during infancy and childhood, which is particularly disruptive regarding phonological encoding. However, studies of adults with dyslexia have rarely examined both delta and theta cortical tracking under naturalistic listening conditions, and have not measured delta-band cortical tracking. Using EEG, here we focused on delta and theta band cortical tracking continuous natural speech by adults with and without dyslexia, applying a decoding analysis previously used with dyslexic children. Forty-eight English-speaking adults (24 dyslexic, 24 control) listened to a 16-minute continuous spoken narrative while EEG was recorded. Neural decoding of the speech envelope was quantified using backward multivariate Temporal Response Function (mTRF) models applied at two levels: a between-group analysis evaluating group-level differences in neural representation patterns, and a within-participant analysis assessing individual decoding accuracy. Cerebro-acoustic coherence was computed in parallel to provide a complementary measure of neural-speech synchronisation. Additional analyses examined band power, cross-frequency phase-amplitude coupling (PAC), and cross-frequency phase-phase coupling (PPC). Dyslexic adults exhibited less accurate delta- and theta-band decoding in the between-group analysis and reduced theta-band decoding accuracy in the within-participant analysis, alongside reduced coherence in both bands and increased delta-band power, particularly over the right temporal region. No group differences were found for PAC or PPC.

">Synergistic and redundant information dynamics are modulated by Alzheimer's disease and cognitive impairment</a></h4>

              
                The early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a cause of progressive cognitive decline, remains challenging. Recent information-theoretic advances allow brain dynamics to be quantified in terms of how regions share and combine information. Integrated Information Decomposition ({Phi}ID) separates redundant (the same content present in multiple regions) from synergistic information (new content that emerges only when regions are considered together). Such information-dynamic measures may provide biomarkers relevant to AD risk and progression. Here we applied integrated information decomposition ({Phi}ID) to resting-state fMRI from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), to test whether {Phi}ID measures are diagnostically sensitive and track cognition along the AD spectrum. For each region, we computed total synergy and redundancy and compared values across cognitively normal (CN), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD groups. Compared to CN, AD patients showed a striking synergy reduction across the entire brain, in concert with widespread redundancy increases, particularly in the executive and default mode networks. Transitions from CN to AD included an intermediate MCI decrease in redundancy, possibly reflecting early disease compensation strategies. This AD informational shift from complex higher level information processing to more robust inefficient forms likely reflects a cognitive shift to simpler, less integrative cognitive processes. Indeed, when re-analysing the data according to a standard cognitive clinical test (the Montreal Cognitive Assessment), we found a synergy-redundancy shift in high versus low performers broadly very similar to the CN to AD shift. AD shows a clear information-processing signature: reduced global synergy and increased redundancy, especially in the executive control network. These striking results provide powerful insights into the widespread information processing reconfiguration that occurs in AD, with clear changes already emerging at the earlier MCI stage. Further, these results provide a novel route to support early diagnosis and stratification.

">No effect of anodal high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation during motor sequence learning in older people</a></h4>

              
                Background Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) targeting the primary motor cortex (M1) has previously been shown to enhance motor learning in older adults. However, findings across studies are inconsistent, which may be partly due to variability in stimulation parameters and montages across experimental protocols. Objective We aimed to replicate the effect of 1mA conventional anodal tDCS over the M1 hotspot during one session of motor sequence learning on retention (24h) compared to sham stimulation in older adults. In addition, we aimed to compare the effect of high definition (HD tDCS) versus conventional tDCS on motor sequence learning to explore if stimulation montage and according focality affects the effect sizes found. Methods In a pre-registered, double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled, parallel study design including 52 older adults, we investigated the effects of conventional and HD tDCS on motor sequence learning in a serial reaction time task (SRTT), using a crossover design for the stimulation montage. Results Although all groups showed motor sequence learning over time, both during practice sessions (main effect of time: p < 0.0001), as well as across session (main effect of time: p < 0.0001), we observed no significant effects on learning between stimulation groups (main effect of stimulation: p = 0. 68) or montages (main effect of montage: p = 0. 66). For all groups, motor sequence learning improvements were maintained but not further enhanced after 24 hours of consolidation (HD tDCS: p = 0.64; conventional tDCS: p = 0.76; HD sham: p = 0.69; conventional sham: p = 0.57). Conclusion Our findings indicate that neither conventional nor HD tDCS enhanced motor sequence learning in older adults. To better understand potential long-term or cumulative effects, we recommend that future studies investigate the effects of repeated tDCS sessions administered throughout the motor learning process.

">Common neural representation between visual perception and imagery in eidetikers</a></h4>

              
                Eidetic imagery is experienced as "seen" in external space, unlike typical visual mental imagery, which occurs in the mind's eye. To investigate whether eidetic imagery and perception share common neural substrates, we measured brain activity in eidetikers and typical imagers using fMRI while they performed perception and imagery tasks. Multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) revealed that imagined objects could be classified based on perceptual activation patterns in right BA19 for eidetikers, but not for typical imagers. This effect was specific to BA19 and was not observed in early visual areas (BA17/18). Subjective ratings confirmed that eidetikers experienced images as percept-like. These findings provide neural evidence for percept-like mental imagery and show that individual differences in subjective experience are reflected in the high-level visual cortex.

">Building Goal-Directed Cognitive Graphs</a></h4>

              
                Flexible, goal-directed behavior depends on learning predictive relationships, yet how reward shapes learned transition structure remains incompletely understood. Here we introduce the Sparse Cognitive Graph, a reinforcement-learning framework in which a continuously updated transition representation is sparsified into a directed graph that governs valuation and choice. Applied to human behavioral and mouse optogenetic datasets, the framework accounts for learning and decision-making across tasks and generates experimentally testable predictions. Differences in inferred graph topology give rise to distinct behavioral regimes despite unimodally distributed parameters, and dynamically evolving graphs reproduce canonical two-step task signatures within a unified framework. In mice, reward selectively enhanced learning of transitions preceding desirable outcomes, and dopamine stimulation produced behavioral effects consistent with enhanced transition learning. The model further predicts low-dimensional population signatures localized to graph entry and goal states. Together, these findings provide a mechanistic account of how reward-dependent learning biases internal relational structure to support flexible, goal-directed behavior.

">Spatial correspondences of Audiovisual Stimuli on Double Flash Illusion Perception and its Cognitive Modeling</a></h4>

              
                Perceptual processing integrates information from multiple sensory modalities to form a coherent representation of the environment. A classic example of such is the Sound-Induced Flash Illusion (SIFI), where the perceived number of visual flashes is altered by conflicting auditory stimuli. While the SIFI is a well-established phenomenon of multisensory integration, the influence of physical spatial characteristics--specifically stimulus eccentricity and spatial congruence--on integration levels remains debated.To address this gap, this study used the SIFI paradigm to investigate the effect of visual stimulus spatial location and the spatial congruence between auditory and visual stimuli on audiovisual integration. In Experiments 1 and 2, we found that when spatial attention was controlled via cueing, unimodal visual performance remained consistent across locations. However, the susceptibility to SIFI increased progressively from the central to the peripheral visual field, exhibiting a spatial pattern of Gaussian distribution. Bayesian modeling further supported this by showing that this spatial modulation was driven by an increase in the integration weight assigned audiovisual representations in the periphery, rather than changes in sensory uncertainty alone. Conversely, Experiment 3 demonstrated that the spatial congruence of audiovisual stimuli did not affect the SIFI or alter the integration processing. These findings refine our current understanding of the spatial modulation upon audiovisual integration. By incorporating the visual system's spatial properties into a Bayesian framework, we provide a computational explanation for the eccentricity-dependent nature of multisensory integration.

">Hippocampal trace coding dominates and disrupts place coding</a></h4>

              
                The hippocampus is widely viewed as a spatial mapping system because many CA1 neurons show location-specific activity during exploration. However, the hippocampus is also required for non-spatial learning, including trace eye-blink conditioning. Because most prior reports of non-spatial signals were obtained in immobile animals, it has been proposed that the hippocampus encodes space during locomotion and non-spatial variables during immobility. To test this directly, we used calcium imaging to record thousands of CA1 neurons while rats performed trace eye-blink conditioning during free exploration of an open field. Across more than 6,000 neurons from five rats, mean firing rates during trace-conditioning periods were [~]1.5-fold higher than during non-trial periods, and this difference persisted after controlling for locomotor speed. At the single-cell level, task-related modulation was widespread and strongly biased toward increased firing. Task-enhanced neurons outnumbered spatially selective neurons by more than threefold, indicating that trace coding predominated over place coding. Although trace-conditioning events occurred at random spatial locations and during continuous locomotion, trace-related activity remained robust at both single-cell and population levels. In contrast, spatial coding was reduced during trace periods, with lower spatial information and decreased similarity between task and non-task rate maps. These findings show that during active behavior, trace coding dominates and disrupts place coding, challenging the view that the hippocampus functions primarily as a stable spatial map.

                <p>Auditory-evoked EEG signals contain rich temporal and cognitive features that reflect both the identity of individuals and their neural response to external stimuli. Traditional unimodal approaches often fail to fully leverage this multidimensional information fully, limiting their effectiveness in real-world biometric and neurocognitive applications. This study aims to develop a unified deep learning model capable of jointly performing biometric identification, auditory stimulus language classification, and device modality recognition, thereby exploiting both physiological and cognitive dimensions of auditory-evoked EEG. We introduce TriNet-MTL (Triple-Task Neural Transformer for Multitask Learning), a multi-branch deep learning framework composed of a shared temporal encoder and a transformer-based sequence modeling unit, trained and validated on auditory-evoked EEG data from 20 human participants (16 males and 4 females). The architecture is designed to simultaneously learn task-specific features via three dedicated output heads, each addressing one of the following: user identity (biometric), stimulus language (native vs non-native), and stimulus delivery mode (in-ear vs bone conduction). The model is trained using a sliding window approach and optimized through joint cross-entropy loss across tasks. TriNet-MTL demonstrates robust performance across all three classification tasks, achieving high accuracy in biometric identification (&gt;93%) and strong generalization in cognitive state inference. Multi-task training further improves representation learning, reducing inter-task interference while enhancing task synergy. The proposed TriNet-MTL framework effectively captures both user-specific and cognitively informative patterns from auditory-evoked EEG, establishing a promising direction for integrated EEG-based biometric authentication and cognitive state monitoring in real-world systems.</p>

                <p>Neurite outgrowth is essential for neural circuit formation and is tightly regulated by secreted factors and their receptors. The secreted extracellular domain of the amyloid precursor protein (sAPP&alpha;) has been shown to modulate neurite outgrowth. Recently, the gamma amino butyric acid receptor type-B subunit 1a (GABA<SUB>B</SUB>R1a) was identified as an sAPP&alpha; binding partner that mediates its effects on synaptic transmission. Here, we investigated whether this interaction also regulates neurite outgrowth. In mouse primary hippocampal neurons of either sex, the GABA<SUB>B</SUB>R agonist baclofen reduced axon length; whereas its antagonist CGP54626 increased axon length in primary hippocampal neurons. Moreover, GABA<SUB>B</SUB>R1a knock-out increased axon length and abolished the effect of baclofen. Application of sAPP&alpha; reduced axon length, an effect that required the presence of both GABA<SUB>B</SUB>R1a and the extension domain of sAPP&alpha;, which mediates its binding to GABA<SUB>B</SUB>R1a. Similarly, the APP 17mer peptide, which is sufficient to bind GABA<SUB>B</SUB>R1a and mimic the effects of sAPP on synaptic transmission, reduced axon outgrowth in wild-type but not in GABA<SUB>B</SUB>R1a-deficient neurons. Together, these findings indicate that the 1a isoform contributes to GABA<SUB>B</SUB>R-dependent suppression of neurite outgrowth and mediates the inhibitory effect of sAPP&alpha; on neurite outgrowth.</p>

<p>The parcellation of cortical types along the gradient of laminar complexity of the human cerebral cortex provides the basis for a Modern Neurodevelopmental Synthesis. This synthesis integrates ontogeny, phylogeny, gene expression, receptor architecture, cellular features, and synaptic connectivity and aims to guide experimental design for human cortical studies.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The human cerebral cortex can be parceled into cortical areas according to particular physiological, clinico-pathological, and anatomical features. Alternatively, it can be parceled into cortical types based on laminar complexity. Cortical types are related to synaptic connectivity and are rooted in ontogeny and phylogeny. In this review, first, we summarize the history of human cortical type schemes and provide a Rosetta Stone to help identify the equivalences between them. Second, we review the developmental specification, phylogenesis, and embryogenesis of mammalian cortical types within the frame of the Prosomeric Model and the Hypothesis of the Dual Origin of the Neocortex and propose a causal model for human pallial patterning. Finally, we relate human cortical types to molecular features and synaptic connectivity according to the principles of the Structural Model. A Modern Neurodevelopmental Synthesis of the human cortex emerges, aiming to be a helpful framework for experimental design in basic and clinical neuroscience.</p>

The specific region of an antibody responsible for binding to an antigen, known as the paratope, is essential for immune recognition. Accurate identification of this small yet critical region can accelerate the development of therapeutic antibodies. Determining paratope locations typically relies on modeling the antibody structure, which is computationally intensive and difficult to scale across large antibody repertoires. We introduce Paraplume, a sequence-based paratope prediction method that leverages embeddings from protein language models (PLMs), without the need for structural input and achieves superior performance across multiple benchmarks compared to current methods. In addition, reweighting PLM embeddings using Paraplume predictions yields more informative sequence representations, improving downstream tasks such as binder classification and epitope binning. Applied to large antibody repertoires, Paraplume reveals that antigen-specific somatic hypermutations are associated with larger paratopes, suggesting a potential mechanism for affinity enhancement. Our findings position PLM-based paratope prediction as a powerful, scalable alternative to structure-dependent approaches, opening new avenues for understanding antibody evolution.

                <p>by Sharia M. Ahmed, Cormac R. LaPrete, Iza Ciglenecki, Andrew Azman, Daniel T. Leung, Lindsay T. Keegan</p>

Since 2021, there has been a resurgence in the number of cholera cases, countries affected, and the case fatality rate. Because most cholera patients recover without antibiotic treatment, current cholera treatment guidelines only consider the tradeoffs between patient recovery and antibiotic stewardship. However, antibiotics also greatly reduce bacteria shedding, creating a potential role for antibiotics in cholera outbreak response through reduced transmission. We developed a compartmental model of cholera transmission in a non-endemic setting to quantify the potential impact of expanded antibiotic treatment on disease burden and antibiotic use. Through simulations, we evaluated different outbreak scenarios, by varying the reproductive number, care-seeking behavior, and proportion of non-severe cases receiving antibiotics. We found that expanding antibiotic treatment could significantly reduce the final outbreak size under certain outbreak characteristics. In these scenarios, treating non-severely symptomatic infections with antibiotics decreased cholera transmission and, in some cases, the total number of antibiotic doses used. We show that the effectiveness of expanded antibiotic treatment is highly dependent on achieving high care-seeking rates among non-severely symptomatic infections and tailoring the approach to specific outbreak conditions. While expanding antibiotic eligibility could enhance outbreak control in some settings, careful consideration of antibiotic resistance risks is necessary in high-transmission contexts.

                <p>by Alex Best, Nik Cunniffe</p>

Understanding, predicting and managing the spread of plant pathogens is crucial given the economic, societal and climatic benefits of plants, including crops and trees. Mathematical models have long been used to investigate disease dynamics in plants. An important component of such models is to account for spatial structure, since plant hosts are immobile and a majority of disease spread will often be localised. Here we apply a lattice-based mathematical modelling approach, a pair approximation, to model disease spread. While this method has previously been used to develop epidemiological theory, it has not been used to predict spread in a specific pathosystem. We fit our lattice-based epidemiological model to experimental data relating to Bahia bark scaling of citrus, an economically-important disease in north-eastern Brazil, and compare its performance to a more commonly used dispersal-kernel modelling approach. We show that the lattice-based model fits the data well, predicting a significant degree of near-neighbour infections, with similar estimated values of epidemiologically-meaningful parameters to the dispersal model. We highlight the pros and cons of the lattice-based approach and discuss how it may be used to predict disease spread and optimise control of plant diseases.

                <p>by Pankaj Dhakad, Bernard Y. Kim, Dmitri A. Petrov, Darren J. Obbard</p>

High-quality genome annotations are essential if we are to address central questions in comparative genomics, such as the origin of new genes, the drivers of genome size variation, and the evolutionary forces shaping gene content and structure. Here, we present protein-coding gene annotations for 301 species of the family Drosophilidae, generated using the Comparative Annotation Toolkit (CAT) and BRAKER3, and incorporating available RNA-seq and protein evidence. We take a comparative phylogenetic approach to annotation, with the aim of improving consistency and accuracy, and to generate a robust set of gene annotations and orthology assignments. We analyze our annotations using a phylogenetic mixed-model approach and find that gene number and CDS length exhibit moderate phylogenetic heritability (40% and 9.7%, respectively). For comparison, we also present analyses using a subset of the 215 highest quality genomes, although the findings were not markedly different. Our work suggests that while evolutionary history contributes to variation in these traits, species-specific factors—including assembly error—play a substantial role in shaping observed differences. To illustrate the utility of our annotations for comparative analyses, we investigate codon usage bias and amino acid composition across Drosophilidae. We find that codon usage is correlated with overall GC content and evolves slowly, but that it is also strongly shaped by selection—such that, in general, species with the strongest selection on synonymous codon usage show the lowest GC bias in third codon positions. This comparative annotation dataset forms part of an ongoing collaborative project to sequence and annotate all species of Drosophilidae, with data and annotations being made rapidly and freely available on an ongoing basis. We hope that this effort will serve as a foundation for studies in evolutionary and functional genomics and comparative biology across Drosophilidae.

                <p>by Jingjin Xu, Zihan Chang, Wei Deng, Luwei Qian, Honggang Su, Xun Huang, Yunsi Kang, Haibo Xie, Chengtian Zhao</p>

Regulation of neural cell morphology remains a fundamental question in neuroscience. Photoreceptor cells, a specialized class of neurons capable of initiating the phototransduction cascade, exhibit distinct structural and morphological characteristics. While the structural and morphological differences between rod and cone photoreceptors have been extensively studied, the variability in the morphology of cone outer segments (OS) remains largely unexplored. Zebrafish possess four distinct cone types, each displaying unique OS morphologies. By modulating opsin expression across cone types, we reveal that the morphology of the cone OS correlates directly with the wavelength sensitivity of the expressed opsins, with cones expressing longer wavelength-sensitive opsins exhibiting elongated OS. This regulatory mechanism is conserved across various vertebrates. Furthermore, we show that alterations in light intensity—induced by ectopic lipid droplet formation in the light path or by changing the environment light intensity—can also modulate OS morphology. Notably, this morphological plasticity is not transient, but rather dependent on long-term neural activity. Based on these findings, we propose a model for the regulation of cone OS length. Our data suggest that both opsin sensitivity and light intensity shape cone OS morphology through long-term neural activity, providing critical insights into neural plasticity in these light-sensitive neurons.

                Background Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) are a common cause of orofacial pain, and research on therapeutic approaches has grown substantially in recent years. This bibliometric study aimed to assess the scientific output of Scopus-indexed articles on temporomandibular disorder (TMD) treatment, highlighting research trends, key authors, keywords and influential patterns. Methods A comprehensive search was conducted in the Scopus database from January 2014 to Au-gust 2024. Results The search retrieved 621 articles; after excluding those not related to TMD treatment, 220 were analyzed. The main topics were treatment types and classifications of TMD. The journal contributing the most scientific content was the Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery. The leading institutions in this field were three universities from Brazil. Conclusions The analysis reveals a steady increase in research related to TMD treatment. Although significant advances have been made, ongoing research is still necessary in order to establish appropriate treatment protocols that contribute to safeguarding global health.

                Background Recent attention has shifted towards alternative herbal mouthwashes due to the long-term unwanted side effects associated with Chlorhexidine, a common oral hygiene agent. These herbal options aim to serve as preventive therapies against dental caries, which are primarily caused by Streptococcus mutans. Methods This study evaluated the in vitro antimicrobial activity of ethanolic extracts from Salvia officinalis and Rosmarinus officinalis L. against Streptococcus mutans using the disk agar diffusion method to measure the zone of inhibition. The study assessed both the individual and synergistic effects of the extracts and determined their minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Results The findings indicated that the 50% ethanolic extracts of both S. officinalis and R. officinalis L., as well as their combined application, exhibited significant antimicrobial activity against Streptococcus mutans. The MIC values were 200 μg/mL for S. officinalis and 400 μg/mL for R. officinalis L. Additionally, higher concentrations of 1600 μg/mL for S. officinalis and 3200 μg/mL for R. officinalis L. resulted in a 10 mm inhibition of bacterial growth. Conclusion These findings suggest that these extracts are promising candidates as natural preventive agents for managing dental caries and promoting oral health.

     alt="Neuromeric Organization of the Microbat Brain: Conserved and Distinct Regional Features"/>
<p>The fundamental neuromeric modular plan is remarkably conserved across bats and rodents. However, there are significant regional differences in the size and organization of specific derivatives (A). In addition, both <i>Tadarida brasiliensis</i> and <i>Myotis myotis</i> share similar general patterns of TH-positive processes and tracts in the basal plate of the diencephalo-midbrain-rostral hindbrain. Interestingly, a notable molecular variation was observed in the medial habenula (MHb) as revealed by TH-positive processes (B).

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p><i>Myotis myotis</i> and <i>Tadarida brasiliensis</i> are both microbat species belonging to the Vespertilionidae and Molossidae families, respectively. Our goal is to determine if the 85-million-year evolutionary divergence between microbats and the Muridae family (mice and rats) has led to significant regional variations in the brain. However, the 34-million-year split between <i>M. myotis</i> and <i>T. brasiliensis</i> serves as in-group control to contextualize the larger divergence with rodents. Using the prosomeric framework, main brain derivatives from each neuromeric partition were compared between these two microbats and with rodents. We found that although the fundamental neuromeric organization is conserved across microbats (<i>M. myotis</i> and <i>T. brasiliensis</i>) and rodents (rats, mice, and gerbils), there are significant regional differences within distinct derivatives such that microbats exhibit smaller corpus callosum, isocortex, optic chiasm, and cerebellum when compared to rodents. On the other hand, the overall pattern of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive processes and tracts in the basal plate of the diencephalon-midbrain-rostral hindbrain in both bats is similar to that found in rodents and primates. However, a key difference was found in the medial habenula (MHb). Although <i>M. myotis</i> showed selective TH expression in the MHb, this was absent in <i>T. brasiliensis</i>. Collectively, these findings suggest that the 85-million-year evolutionary divergence between bats and rodents has led to notable regional variations in brain anatomy, even though their basic modular plan remained the same.</p>

     alt="The Regenerative Stage-Defined Neurogenic Properties in the Spinal Cord of Xenopus laevis: Correlation Between Neurogenic Potential and Functional Repair of the Spinal Cord"/>
<p><i>Xenopus laevis</i> exhibits developmental stage-dependent regeneration capacity in various organs, including the spinal cord. This study demonstrates a strong association between the regeneration capacity and neurogenic activity in the spinal cord. In tadpoles, the spinal cord exhibits active neurogenesis and regenerates after injury, whereas in froglets, neurogenesis is significantly reduced, and the regeneration capacity is lost. These findings suggest that neurogenesis contributes to the functional repair of the spinal cord in <i>Xenopus</i> and may also play a role in mammals. 

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Many treatments for spinal cord injury (SCI) have been developed; however, none of these treatments enable complete functional repair. In this study, we utilized a model amphibian, <i>Xenopus laevis</i>, which has regeneration capacity of the spinal cord in the tadpole stages but loses it during metamorphosis, to identify differences in spinal cord properties between the regenerative and non-regenerative stages. We compared the spatiotemporal expression patterns of transcription factors important for neural tube development as well as cell proliferation markers between tadpoles and metamorphosed young adults (froglets) in <i>Xenopus</i> as well as between <i>Xenopus</i> and mouse embryos. We found that <i>Xenopus</i> drastically changed properties in ependymal cells of the spinal cord during the transition from regenerative to non-regenerative stages, and that similar change occurred in the mouse neural tube between 12.5 and 14.5 dpc, during which neurogenesis is known to cease. We then investigated neurogenic activity during <i>Xenopus</i> metamorphosis by labeling newly generated neurons and found that it was correlated with regeneration capacity. We also found that neurogenesis actively occurred after SCI at the regenerative stages but was scarcely reactivated at the non-regenerative stages, suggesting that neurogenesis may play an important role in the process of spontaneous regeneration in <i>Xenopus</i>. We propose that supplying neurons as a treatment for SCI is a valid strategy based on principles of regeneration, which are naturally possessed by regenerative animals.</p>

                Background Smart home-enabled smart cities require low-latency data processing, precise energy forecasting, and strong risk prediction to guarantee efficient energy use and secure system functionality. Traditional cloud-centric IoT architectures face issues such as high latency, excessive energy consumption, and limited real-time threat detection. To tackle these problems, this research presents a fog-cloud-IoT-based framework aimed at improving energy efficiency, security, and operational reliability within smart home settings. Methods This study introduces a Cost-Effective Risk Prediction and Energy Management in Fog-Cloud-IoT (CREFCI) model. The architecture employs a Raspberry Pi 4 fog node for local data processing and communication, tracks user preferences and device statuses locally, ensures network security through Suricata IDS/IPS, and keeps a synchronized duplicate database in the IoT cloud for analytics and user interaction via Android and Web APIs. Interoperability among Zig bee, Z-Wave, and Wi-Fi protocols is facilitated through JSON/XML data transformation, energy demand is predicted using ANN-based learning, and risk scores are calculated through likelihood-impact analysis. Results Experimental assessments reveal that the CREFCI model achieves 75% accuracy in energy prediction, surpassing existing models by 13% for the highest predictions and doubling accuracy for the third-highest probability estimates. The model decreases mean absolute error (MAE) by 50% and enhances accuracy in lower-ranked predictions by 40–44%. Energy consumption is significantly lowered by 50–80%, using only 0.3–0.5 kWh compared to 1.0–1.7 kWh in competing methods. Furthermore, average latency is reduced by 40–60%, underscoring the effectiveness of fog-based processing. Conclusions The CREFCI model successfully integrates fog computing, cloud analytics, ensemble learning, and risk assessment to improve energy efficiency, prediction accuracy, and security in smart home IoT systems. By reducing latency reducing energy consumption, and providing real-time risk prediction, CREFCI offers a scalable and cost-effective solution for next-generation fog–cloud–IoT smart city infrastructures.

                Objectives To develop and evaluate EffiRadNet, a lightweight, user-friendly, open-source image classification model based on EfficientNet-B0, tailored for simple binary classification tasks in radiology, involving visually distinct image. The model aims to provide high accuracy and usability while remaining computationally efficient and accessible to non-engineering users. Methods EffiRadNet was trained and validated on three task-specific, class-balanced datasets (200 training and 200 validation images per dataset) sourced from the Open Access Biomedical Image Search Engine. The three classification tasks included a “Medical” task distinguishing radiological from non-radiological medical images, a “Modality” task classifying X-rays versus other radological modalities, and a “X-rays” task differentiating chest X-rays from other anatomical X-rays. The model used transfer learning with EfficientNet-B0 pretrained on ImageNet, fine-tuned with a modified two-class output layer. Performance was assessed across different hyperparameter settings using AUC, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value. Results EffiRadNet achieved strong classification performance across all tasks, with AUC values up to 1.0 under optimal hyperparameters (≥≤30 epochs, batch size = 16, learning rate = 0.0001). The “Medical” and “X-rays” models showed balanced sensitivity and specificity, while the “Modality” model displayed high sensitivity but variable specificity depending on hyperparameters. Training times ranged from 11 to 12 minutes, inference took less than 30 seconds per dataset. Conclusion EffiRadNet is a fast, accurate, and accessible AI tool for binary classification of radiological images. Its open-source availability and minimal hardware requirements make it well-suited for tasks such as image modality classification, dataset preprocessing, and quality control.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/15-291/v1?src=rss">Diagnostic Accuracy of PET Imaging for Lymph Node Detection in Breast cancer patients undergoing Upfront Surgery: A Single-Institution Analysis of Breast Cancer Patients [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background The role of PET imaging in lymph node staging for breast cancer patients proceeding to upfront surgery remains incompletely characterized. We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of PET imaging in immediate surgical patients. Methods A retrospective cohort of 70 breast cancer patients undergoing upfront surgery was analyzed. PET imaging findings were compared with histopathological examination (HPE) results. Diagnostic accuracy metrics including sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and likelihood ratios were calculated. Results Among 70 surgical patients (mean age 53.9 ± 11.5 years), 26 (37.14%) had pathologically confirmed lymph node involvement. PET imaging demonstrated sensitivity of 69.23% (95% CI: 48.27-85.67), specificity of 81.82% (95% CI: 67.27-91.60), PPV of 69.23%, and NPV of 81.82%. The test correctly identified 18 of 26 patients with nodal disease while avoiding false positives in 36 of 44 node-negative patients. Positive likelihood ratio was 3.81, and negative likelihood ratio was 0.38. The F1-score was 0.6923, indicating good balance between precision and sensitivity for surgical planning. Conclusions PET imaging demonstrates clinically meaningful sensitivity (69.23%) and high negative predictive value (81.82%) in upfront surgical patients, supporting its utility for identifying patients with nodal involvement and confidently excluding nodal disease when negative. These performance characteristics suggest that PET can inform surgical extent and staging accuracy in immediate surgical patients, though positive findings warrant confirmatory assessment when staging determines operative planning.

                The propagation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices in healthcare, while remote monitoring has enabled and patient care has improved, significant vulnerabilities have introduced that threaten the security of sensitive medical data. To address this crucial challenge, the study proposes a novel framework to enhance the privacy of data and trustworthiness in healthcare IoT ecosystems using advanced anomaly detection. We introduced a Customized Sand Cat Swarm driven Updated Random Forest (CSCS-URF) model, as a first step, data is preprocessed using min-max normalization and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE). The Second step is analyzing data by an ensemble classifier optimized via a customized swarm intelligence algorithm to effectively identify security anomalies. Then, evaluate the system on the CICIoT20232 dataset, the proposed CSCS-URF method shows superior performance compared to existing benchmarks, achieving an accuracy of 97%, precision of 94%, recall of 96%, and an F1-score of 95%. These results indicate that the CSCS-URF framework is a robust solution for proactive security, enabling the early detection of potential breaches to strengthen system integrity and safeguard patient data against evolving cyber threats in the healthcare sector.

                Background Biobanks are critical infrastructures for biomedical research but are energy- and cost-intensive due to reliance on ultra-low temperature (ULT) storage and redundant systems. The challenge is reducing environmental impact without compromising specimen quality or continuity. Service centers are well positioned to address this challenge, operating at scale and providing governance beyond the capacity of individual laboratories. Methods The Johns Hopkins Biobank, a CAP-accredited service-center repository, partnered with the School of Medicine Energy and Sustainability Committee to conduct a freezer audit across 34 departments and two campuses. Inventories were assessed for age, utilization, and efficiency, and policies were implemented to encourage migration of biospecimens into centralized storage. Strategies prioritized vapor-phase liquid nitrogen (LN2) for viable collections and incorporated MVE Variō systems as energy-efficient alternatives for ULT needs. Governance required investigators to evaluate centralized options before acquiring new freezers, reinforced through outreach at faculty meetings and symposia. Results The audit identified nearly 1,300 ULT freezers, with over 70% beyond their median life expectancy of 8.5 years. Consolidation of specimens into a Biobank-managed freezer farm reduced institutional energy demand and improved monitoring. LN2 provided stability for viable specimens, while Variō units offered adjustable storage (–20 °C to –150 °C) with minimal electricity use and no facility cooling load. Governance helped to curb uncontrolled expansion of departmental freezers, while the Biobank functioned as an emergency response resource with at-temperature backup capacity. Adoption of centralized storage has been gradual but continues to expand. Conclusions This case study demonstrates how an academic service center can integrate sustainability, quality, and contingency planning. The Johns Hopkins Biobank illustrates that shared resources, supported by institutional governance, provide a practical framework to reduce environmental impact while ensuring uncompromising specimen protection. As an institutional case study, this report is intended to illustrate operational strategy within a defined governance and infrastructure environment rather than to function as a universally prescriptive implementation model.

                Background The global aging population worldwide has led to increased attention toward ensuring a good quality of life (QoL) among older adults, particularly those residing in long-term care facilities. This study aimed to identify the determinants of quality of life among older adults living in a social care center in West Jakarta. Method This quantitative study employed a descriptive cross-sectional design involving 288 participants from a social care center. Data were collected using structured questionnaires measuring sleep behavior, medication adherence, nutritional intake, infection prevention, physical activity, and quality of life. Results The results indicated that sleep behavior was significantly associated with QoL (p = 0.002), whereas no statistically significant associations were found between QoL and other variables, including medication adherence, nutritional intake, infection prevention, and physical activity. Conclusion Sleep behaviour was identified as a significant association of QoL among institutionalized individuals. These findings suggest that sleep-focused approach should be prioritized in care strategies to improve the quality of life of older adults in long-term care.

                Background Goal setting is a foundational element of pediatric rehabilitation, guiding therapeutic planning, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration, and enhancing clinical outcomes. For children with neuromotor disabilities, goals must be both technically sound and personally meaningful—reflecting family priorities and child-centered values. The SMART framework (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) is widely adopted to improve goal clarity and therapeutic effectiveness, while the F-words for Child Development framework (Function, Family, Fitness, Fun, Friends, Future) emphasizes contexts meaningful for the children and their families. Studies on goal analysis of children with neuromotor disabilities from Qatar is very limited. Objective This study aimed to evaluate the quality and meaningfulness of physical therapy goals set for children with neuromotor disabilities in Qatar, using both the SMART elements and the F-words for Child Development framework. Methods A retrospective, cross-sectional analytical study was conducted at the largest pediatric outpatient physical therapy department in Qatar. Electronic medical records from January to December 2019 were reviewed. A purposive sample of 100 children (between 12 months and 14 years) with neuromotor conditions—including cerebral palsy, developmental delay, Down syndrome, and genetic/metabolic disorders—was selected. A total of 183 goals from 92 children were finally analyzed. Each goal was mapped to identify its alignment with both the S.M.A.R.T and F-words framework. Results Overall adherence to SMART elements was high, particularly for goals that were specific, measurable, achievable, and time-bound. Goals mapped to the Relevant element were inconsistent, possibly reflecting limited family engagement in the goal-setting process. All goals aligned with at least one F-words domain, with Function being the most frequently represented. Domains such as Family, Fun, Fitness, Friends, and Future were notably underutilized. Conclusion While physical therapy goals for children with neuromotor disabilities in Qatar demonstrate strong technical structure, their meaningfulness from a family-centered perspective remains suboptimal. Strengthening family engagement and broadening the application of F-words during the goal-setting process are essential to enhancing family-centered care for children with neuromotor disabilities in Qatar.

                Context The human endonuclease Artemis, required for immunoglobulin rearrangements of V(D)J segments in B cells and thereby contributing to the adaptive immune response, belongs to the metallo-β-lactamase enzyme superfamily. β-lactam antibiotics, including ceftriaxone, are widely used in clinical practice and display strong affinity for β-lactamase catalytic sites. In vitro, ceftriaxone has been shown to block the activity of Artemis. Based on these structural similarities, the hypothesis according to which certain β-lactams could inhibit Artemis and therefore the immune response was previously proposed by our teams. This study aimed to determine in vivo whether ceftriaxone exposure alters vaccine-induced humoral immunity. Methods To explore the hypothesis put forward above, we developed an animal model to evaluate the antibody immune response to tetanus toxin induced by a diphtheria–tetanus–poliomyelelitis (DTP) vaccine in the presence or absence of ceftriaxone. Male BALB/c mice were vaccinated either before or after a five-day intraperitoneal ceftriaxone treatment; control groups received isotonic saline. The mice immune response to vaccine was quantified by measuring interactions with specific antigens using immunochromatographic tests, enabling longitudinal assessment of anti-tetanus toxoid antibodies. Results We report the first experimental evidence of a specific weakening of vaccine-induced immune response in animals receiving ceftriaxone, with significantly reduced anti-tetanus antibody levels when vaccination followed antibiotic exposure. The response remained efficient in animals receiving isotonic saline treatment as control, and in mice vaccinated prior to ceftriaxone administration. Conclusions These results confirm our hypothesis that the immune response to tetanus toxin is impaired and that a refractory period for humoral immunity may be caused by the inhibition of Artemis by ceftriaxone. This work highlights a clinically relevant interaction between β-lactam antibiotics and adaptive immune responses.

                Background Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a significant comorbidity in cardiovascular treatments, increasing the likelihood of adverse outcomes. Choosing between drug-eluting balloons (DEB) and drug-eluting stents (DES) in patients with CKD requires careful consideration of efficacy and safety. To address this gap, we conducted a systematic review of DEB and DES in CKD patients, focusing on mortality, MACE, TLR, and stent thrombosis. Methods This systematic review followed the PRISMA guidelines. Comprehensive searches were performed in PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Web of Science, and ScienceDirect until September 2025. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort study comparing DEB and DES in CKD patients were included. Four reviewers independently screened and extracted data on mortality, MACE, target lesion revascularization (TLR), and stent thrombosis, and conflicts were resolved through discussion. Results Five studies (four retrospective cohorts, one RCT) met inclusion criteria after screening 4,093 records, involving CKD/ESRD patients undergoing PCI with DEB (paclitaxel-coated) versus contemporary DES. MACE rates were equivalent: 17% in both arms (Funayama et al., ESRD dialysis cohort) and 10% in both arms (Jeger et al., RCT; HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.38-2.57). Target lesion revascularization (TLR) and target vessel failure (TVF) showed heterogeneity: DES favored in some (e.g., Waha et al., aHR 0.20, 95% CI 0.06-0.69), DEB numerically in others (e.g., Joh et al., 2-year TVF 14.3% DEB vs. 27.8% DES), with no meta-analysis due to clinical/methodological differences; thrombosis was low and sparse (0% DEB vs. 2.2% DES in Funayama). Conclusion In CKD/ESRD patients, DEB and DES yield equivalent MACE, though TLR/TVF results vary by study design, CKD severity, and procedural factors. No clear superiority emerged, supporting individualized strategy selection based on lesion characteristics, bleeding risk, and expertise. Prospective RCTs with standardized CKD subgroups and DEB optimization are needed for definitive guidance. PROSPERO registration ID: CRD420251039001 (05/15/2025)

                Abstract* The forecast of time series in financial applications is difficult to perform as time series forecasting is nonlinear in nature, seasonal, and has structural variability. Stock price series tend to follow a lot of nonlinear dynamics, which undermines the power of single-model approaches. Hybrid decomposition-based models have attracted increasing interest in order to gain accuracy by separating heterogeneous features from one another. In this work, we present a hybrid forecasting methodology that incorporates STD decomposition with RBFNN (Radial Basis Function Neural Network). The time series is decomposed, where trend, seasonal, and dispersion components are separately modeled using RBFNN with Gaussian basis functions. The predicted feature sets are then recombined to construct a forecast, to be evaluated with weekly Tesla stock price data and standard accuracy performance metrics. The STD–RBFNN model gives very low forecasting errors under different variables and a high coefficient of determination. It shows superiority compared with an alternative hybrid neural network model, especially in modeling nonlinear variation under similar experimental conditions. This results in substantially greater forecasting accuracy because trend, seasonal, and dispersion components separate before neural modeling. The proposed STD and RBFNN pipeline is a good and highly flexible method to forecast complex nonlinear and seasonal financial time series.

                Background This study aimed to evaluate the characteristics of diabetic foot ulcers in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in Iraq. Methods The study included 881 participants with T2DM and different types of foot ulcers, who attended a specialized diabetes center. Data on demographics, clinical characteristics, biochemical investigations, comorbidities, and treatment regimens were collected and analyzed. Results The majority of the cases (96.8%) were due to T2DM, with an average age of 58 years and a mean BMI of 30 kg/m2. Participants had elevated serum creatinine, blood urea, and glucose levels, with uncontrolled HbA1c levels. Comorbidities included hypertension, ischemic heart disease, diabetic neuropathy, and retinopathy. Most participants were on insulin and statins. Diabetic foot ulcers were mainly on the right foot (48%) and classified as Grade 2 in Wagner’s system. Some participants had Charcot deformity or stages of amputation. Conclusions Random plasma glucose levels and diabetic retinopathy were significantly associated with the classification of foot ulcers. Further research is needed to explore additional variables related to T2DM and foot ulcers, emphasizing the importance of glucose control and retinopathy in ulcer classification.

                Background Infertility has become a significant issue that requires attention as its prevalence has increased globally and nationally in Saudi Arabia over the past few decades. This study aimed to explore patients’ perceptions towards infertility and in vitro fertilization-related services. Additionally, this study examined the barriers that prevent couples from seeking infertility treatment and IVF in Khobar and Dammam, Saudi Arabia. Methods This study employed a qualitative, hybrid thematic analysis approach. Fifteen participants were included in the study. Participants were divided into three categories: infertility patients, infertility caregivers, and administrative staff working in infertility clinics. Results This study identified four main themes: patients’ experiences, infertility services in Eastern Province, and perceived barriers to receiving treatment. Participants reported that they believed infertility was on the rise, especially male infertility. The reported obstacles included financial burdens, lack of awareness, societal influences, and lengthy, complex treatment processes. Conclusions This study highlights the significant barriers that couples encounter in accessing infertility treatment. These findings emphasize the urgent need for improved public health policies, such as utilizing case management to support patients and incorporating insurance coverage for infertility treatments, along with enhanced support services.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1375/v2?src=rss">Methods2AOP: A Collaboration to Strengthen the Integration of Test Methods into the Adverse Outcome Pathway Framework [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                The Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) framework is a pivotal tool for organizing mechanistic knowledge and linking it to adverse outcomes of regulatory significance. However, the integration of test method information, particularly New Approach Methods (NAMs), within the central repository for AOP knowledge, (the AOP-Wiki), has been suboptimal, limiting the framework’s utility for regulatory decision-making. The Methods2AOP collaboration, comprised of various international stakeholders, was established to address this gap and enhance the role of test methods within the AOP framework. This paper reviews their work emphasizing the importance of linking detailed test method information and conceptually proposes how it may be included in the AOP knowledgebase in alignment with existing assay documentation standards and governance frameworks. The Methods2AOP collaboration proposes using ontologies to standardize and structure information, thereby facilitating interoperability, enabling reusability, and establishing clear connections between test methods and Key Events (KEs). A conceptual model is presented to demonstrate qualitative similarities between concepts in key event components and structured methods information. The implementation of Methods2AOP recommendations would increase the clarity and transparency of method descriptions, which could support regulatory acceptance and a wider adoption of NAMs. The broad community of stakeholders impacted by this work stands to benefit from the Methods2AOP recommendations through enhanced regulatory decisions, increased visibility and scientific impact, new market opportunities, and the accelerated adoption of NAMs in regulatory affairs. In summary, the Methods2AOP collaboration presents a comprehensive effort to formally standardize the integration of test methods into the AOP framework, thereby fostering a more robust, and transparent system that aligns with the goals of the scientific and regulatory communities.

                Shammas et al. report that LCMV infection epigenetically primes hippocampal neurons for heightened responses to viral rechallenge, driving synaptopathy. These findings suggest epigenetic inflammatory memory in neurons, resembling previous observations in other CNS non-immune cells, and may guide therapeutic interventions.

                Ralhan et al. describe how lipidated particles of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) isoforms ApoE2 and ApoE3-Christchurch protect neurons from oxidative stress through the efflux of unsaturated and oxidized lipids via ABCA7. This mechanism ameliorated multiple dysfunctions observed in ApoE4 models.

                Myelin thickness and internode length are matched to axon caliber in the central nervous system (CNS), critical for optimal axonal action potential conduction.

                In this issue of Neuron, Papadopoulos et al. demonstrate that stimulus encoding accuracy in auditory cortex rises and then falls with increasing arousal. Their model of stimulus-induced transitions between discrete, arousal-dependent attractor states of spiking neurons successfully accounts for their data.

                Collie et al. show how adaptive control in Drosophila visual pursuit arises from two parallel pathways: one steers objects from the periphery toward the center, while the other maintains central fixation and modulates gain based on object motion and running speed. This architecture supports vigorous pursuit while maintaining feedback stability.
