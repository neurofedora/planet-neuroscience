	<p>Objective: Functional magnetic resonance imaging data pose significant challenges due to their inherently noisy and complex nature, making traditional statistical models less effective in capturing predictive features. While deep learning models offer superior performance through their non-linear capabilities, they often lack transparency, reducing trust in their predictions. This study introduces the Time Reversal (TR) pretraining method to address these challenges. TR aims to learn temporal dependencies in data, leveraging large datasets for pretraining and applying this knowledge to improve schizophrenia classification on smaller datasets. Methods: We pretrained an LSTM-based model with attention using the TR approach, focusing on learning the direction of time in fMRI data, achieving over 98 % accuracy on HCP and UK Biobank datasets. For downstream schizophrenia classification, TR-pretrained weights were transferred to models evaluated on FBIRN, COBRE, and B-SNIP datasets. Saliency maps were generated using Integrated Gradients (IG) to provide post hoc explanations for pretraining, while Earth Mover&amp;amp;rsquo;s Distance (EMD) quantified the temporal dynamics of salient features in the downstream tasks. Results: TR pretraining significantly improved schizophrenia classification performance across all datasets: median AUC scores increased from 0.7958 to 0.8359 (FBIRN), 0.6825 to 0.7778 (COBRE), and 0.6341 to 0.7224 (B-SNIP). The saliency maps revealed more concentrated and biologically meaningful salient features along the time axis, aligning with the episodic nature of schizophrenia. TR consistently outperformed baseline pretraining methods, including OCP and PCL, in terms of AUC, balanced accuracy, and robustness. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the dual benefits of the TR method: enhanced predictive performance and improved interpretability. By aligning model predictions with meaningful temporal patterns in brain activity, TR bridges the gap between deep learning and clinical relevance. These findings emphasize the potential of explainable AI tools for aiding clinicians in diagnostics and treatment planning, especially in conditions characterized by disrupted temporal dynamics.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/12/1/ENEURO.0418-24.2024?rss=1">Functional Regrowth of Norepinephrine Axons in the Adult Mouse Brain Following Injury</a></h4>

              
                <p>It is widely believed that axons in the central nervous system of adult mammals do not regrow following injury. This failure is thought, at least in part, to underlie the limited recovery of function following injury to the brain or spinal cord. Some studies of fixed tissue have suggested that, counter to dogma, norepinephrine (NE) axons regrow following brain injury. Here, we have used in vivo two-photon microscopy in layer 1 of the primary somatosensory cortex in transgenic mice harboring a fluorophore selectively expressed in NE neurons. This protocol allowed us to explore the dynamic nature of NE axons following injury with the selective NE axon toxin <I>N</I>-(2-chloroethyl)-<I>N</I>-ethyl-2-bromobenzylamine (DSP4). Following DSP4, NE axons were massively depleted and then slowly and partially recovered their density over a period of weeks. This regrowth was dominated by new axons entering the imaged volume. There was almost no contribution from local sprouting from spared NE axons. Regrown axons did not appear to use either the paths of previously lesioned NE axons or NE axons that were spared and survived DSP4 as a guide. To measure NE release, GCaMP8s was selectively expressed in neocortical astrocytes and startle-evoked, NE receptor-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients were measured. These Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients were abolished soon after DSP4 lesion but returned to pre-lesion values after 3&ndash;5&nbsp;weeks, roughly coincident with NE axon regrowth, suggesting that the regrown NE axons are competent to release NE in response to a physiological stimulus in the awake mouse.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/12/1/ENEURO.0419-24.2024?rss=1">Interaction between Facial Expression and Color in Modulating ERP P3</a></h4>

              
                <p>The relationships between facial expression and color affect human cognition functions such as perception and memory. However, whether these relationships influence selective attention and brain activity contributed to selective attention remains unclear. For example, reddish angry faces increase emotion intensity, but it is unclear whether brain activity and selective attention are similarly enhanced. To investigate these questions, we examined whether event-related potentials for faces vary depending on facial expression and color by recording electroencephalography (EEG) data. We conducted an oddball task using stimuli that combined facial expressions (angry, neutral) and facial colors (original, red, green). The participants counted the number of times a rarely appearing target face stimulus appeared among the standard face stimuli. The results indicated that the difference in P3 amplitudes for the target and standard faces depended on the combinations of facial expressions and facial colors; the P3 for red angry faces were greater than those for red neutral faces. Additionally, facial expression or facial color had no significant main effect or interaction effect on P1 amplitudes for the target, and facial expression had significant main effects only on the N170 amplitude. These findings suggest that the interaction between facial expression and color modulates the P3 associated with selective attention. Moreover, the response enhancement resulting from this interaction appears to occur at a cognitive processing stage that follows the processing stage associated with facial color or expression alone. Our results support the idea that red color increases the human response to anger from an EEG perspective.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-265/v3?src=rss">Ambient Air Pollution and Chronic kidney disease risk in Deltan communities: A Policy Brief, 2023 [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 2 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a persistent, devastating, yet neglected, non-communicable disease, particularly in developing and emerging countries. The traditional risk factors for CKD, such as hypertension and diabetes have received relatively ample attention but do not sufficiently explain the high burden of CKD. Ambient air pollution is an emerging environmental risk factor for CKD; however, epidemiological data and evidence are lacking for susceptible populations in developing countries. The Niger Delta region of Nigeria is a petrochemical hub known for environmental degradation, including air pollution, and thus, serves as a good case study for investigating the association between air pollution and CKD. This brief is based on an exploratory mixed-methods study conducted in four communities situated near an oil and gas refinery in Warri, Nigeria, to explore perceived and actual air pollution risks and determine whether long-term exposure to ambient air pollution is associated with CKD. Air pollutant concentrations measured in partnership with citizen scientists using portable air sensors, showed that all except one air pollutant (ozone) exceeded the WHO acceptable limits in all four communities. PM2.5 ranged from 22.8 to 28.0 μg/m3, PM10, 40.6 to 55.5 μg/m3, and CO2, 584-652 ppm. The overall prevalence of CKD was 12.3% but even higher (18%) in a socially deprived semi-urban community closest to the oil refinery. Hypertension, diabetes, other behavioral risk factors, and exposures associated with CKD were prevalent in the four communities and environmental health information was lacking. A multifaceted approach is required to mitigate air pollution and the associated NCD risks in the region. The government needs to invest in air monitoring services, cleaner technologies, and environmental risk communication through various media channels. We strongly recommend public inclusion in planning, designing, and implementing educational interventions. Lastly, environmental risk factors such as air pollution should feature prominently in strategic plans for NCD prevention.

                This article provides a comprehensive analysis of knee strengthening post-surgery, focusing on key performance indicators (KPIs) essential for recovery and performance enhancement. The study delves into the importance of range of motion (ROM), load management through repetitions maximum (RM) and velocity-based training (VBT), speed variations, repetition schemes for hypertrophy and strength, and the assessment of pain, inflammation, and effusion. Emphasis is placed on dynamic alignment, muscle activation, and rate of perceived exertion (RPE) to tailor individualized rehabilitation programs. The integration of these KPIs ensures a balanced approach, enhancing muscle strength and joint integrity while minimizing injury risk. Regular monitoring and adjustments based on these indicators are recommended to optimize outcomes and ensure sustained progress in knee function and overall mobility.

                The splenic localization of hydatid cysts is extremely rare. A 50-year-old obese female who consults with a painful and febrile syndrome of the right hypochondrium. Abdominal ultrasound and a CT scan computed tomography revealed a complete situs inversus, a mass of the right hypochondrium measuring 152 mm with membrane detachment, and infiltration of the surrounding fat, evoking a type II complicated splenic hydatic cyst. The patient was operated on in an emergency via midline laparotomy. Exploration revealed situs inversus, an angiant cyst of the spleen. Exposition of the splenic pedicle is difficult. The samples were then infected. Total splenectomy was performed. The postoperative period was unproblematic, and the patient was discharged with antibiotic and antiparasitic treatment and habitual vaccination.

                Introduction Recent advances in elucidating the pathogenetic mechanisms of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) and improvements in clinical trial design have reinvigorated the potential for agents developed in preclinical studies to be translated into new therapeutic agents, as well as highlighting the need for improved and effective means of measuring neuropathy in preclinical and clinical research. A systematic review of the literature on the methods of measuring the severity of DPN and the association of the results of each method with diabetic retinopathy would contribute positively to the above developments. Methods The intended scoping review will be aligned, in combination, with the frameworks proposed by Arksey and O’Malley, the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR), and the framework proposed by Peters et al. in 2015. The PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL, and ProQuest databases will be searched, as well as the ClinicalTrials.gov registry. The search strategy will include the following sequence of Boolean terms and operators: (“retinopathy” OR “eye disease” OR “eye disease” OR “maculopathy” OR “retinal” OR “macular”) AND “neuropathy” and for the title/abstract or abstract only “severity” AND (“diabetes” OR “diabetic”). The yielded publications will be screened according to criteria. This will be followed by data extraction, synthesis and presentation of results, discussion and conclusions. Discussion The different ways of measuring the severity of peripheral neuropathy identified in the previous literature will be discussed, as well as the association of neuropathy and/or its severity with retinopathy in patients with diabetes. The main aim of the discussion will be to elucidate the role of different methods of measuring the severity of DPN and its association with retinopathy. Registration The protocol has been registered on the international platform of registered systematic review and meta-analysis protocols (INPLASY).

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-65/v1?src=rss">Work Alienation and Whistleblowing Intention: The Mediating and Moderating Role of Religious Political Orientation and Social Value Orientation [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Abstract* Background This study investigates how perceived work alienation influences whistleblowing intention, with religious political orientation as a mediator and social value orientation as a moderator. Previous research has shown work alienation negatively correlates with prosocial behavior and activism while positively correlating with knowledge hiding. The study proposes that work alienation negatively predicts whistleblowing intention, with both religious political orientation and social value orientation playing influential roles in this relationship. Methods Predictive correlational design with a mediation and moderation analysis was used in this study. The participants of this study were 263 Indonesians (131 males, 132 females; M age = 25.91 years old; SD age = 5.47 years). Results The findings confirm that higher work alienation leads to lower whistleblowing intention. While religious political orientation did not significantly mediate the relationship between work alienation and whistleblowing intention as hypothesized, the study revealed that prosocial-type social value orientation weakens the negative relationship between work alienation and whistleblowing intention. The individualistic type showed no significant moderating effect. Conclusion The research demonstrates that work alienation significantly predicts whistleblowing intention, with prosocial social value orientation serving as a buffer against the negative effects of work alienation on whistleblowing intention. These findings contribute to our understanding of the psychological factors influencing whistleblowing behavior in corruption prevention and eradication efforts.

                Background Insufficient awareness of foot self-care among diabetic individuals results in diabetic foot ulcers especially in the Indian population considering its varied ethnicity and lifestyle practices. The management of diabetes and diabetic foot ulcers therefore demands a well-coordinated approach that involves multiple healthcare providers (HCPs). The present study aims to develop and validate an interprofessional collaborative (IPC) educational program involving HCPs to efficiently oversee and instruct the public on appropriate strategies for self-managing diabetic foot health in the Indian population. Methods The research group worked on creating an educational module titled ‘An Interprofessional Collaborative Educational Module on Self-Management of Foot for Individuals with Type II Diabetes Mellitus.’ The objective of this module was to promote the adoption of proper practices in self-managing foot health for individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus. A panel of 13 experts participated in a two-stage validation process using the Delphi method to assess the module and its educational resources. Subsequently, the module was tested on a group of 30 participants, i.e., individuals with diabetes, with its efficacy evaluated through conversation analysis and in-depth interviews. Results The three-month-long module included three sessions • 1: Diabetes and its health implications • 2: Diabetic foot and self-management • 3: Interprofessional education in diabetic foot care The mode of content delivery was via Whatsapp, and the educational resources, in the form of pamphlets, flowcharts, handouts, case-based cartoons, and videos on diabetes, including diabetic foot, its risks, and self-management, were shared regularly. All participating experts consensually validated the module and educational resources. Analysis of in-depth interviews revealed that the module immensely benefitted the participants and helped them improve their knowledge and practices of foot care in diabetes. Conclusions The study highlights the importance of developing and validating IPC educational modules tailored to diabetic foot care. It can aid in enhancing adherence to proper diabetic foot care practices. By promoting collaborative care approaches, these educational resources can contribute to better preventive practices, potentially reducing the risk of complications like foot ulcers and amputations in individuals with diabetes.

                Background The deductive system of BCL-algebra has not been thoroughly explored, and its fuzzification remains undefined. This study aims to the association of this gap by introducing a fuzzy extension of the deductive system of BCL-algebra using Pythagorean fuzzy sets. Methods We define a Pythagorean fuzzy set as a pair of membership and non-membership functions, where the sum of their squares lies between 0 and 1. These functions are used to extend the classical deductive system of BCL-algebra, allowing for reasoning based on fuzzy degrees. The system incorporates fuzzy operations such as union, intersection, and complement, while maintaining the structure of BCL-algebra. We also introduce key components such as the accuracy function, score function, degree of indeterminacy, and square deviation to measure the certainty, truth, uncertainty, and deviation of fuzzy sets. Results We prove that the intersection of two Pythagorean fuzzy deductive systems remains a valid Pythagorean fuzzy deductive system within BCL-algebra. However, we show that the union of such systems does not necessarily form a valid fuzzy deductive system. The study also provides detailed proofs using induction, logical derivations, and algebraic techniques. Conclusion The results disclose that while the intersection of Pythagorean fuzzy deductive systems preserves the system's structure, the union does not, offering new insights into the behavior and limitations of fuzzy systems in BCL-algebra.

                Introduction Pancreatic carcinoma (PC) is a highly malignant and lethal tumor characterized by a dismal prognosis which raised the need to identify other prognostic factors for better patient risk stratification. This study investigated the prognostic significance of tumor budding (TB) in pancreatic carcinoma using artificial intelligence. Methods In this retrospective multicenter study, we collected all cases of PC diagnosed (2008-2022). TB was assed using 2methods: manuel on hematoxylin-eosin (HE) slides and semi-automated using QUPATH software. The selected slide for each case was digitalized using NIS software version 4.00 connected to the microscope NIKON (Eclipse Ni-U). The pathological images were then incorporated into QUPATH. The budds were counted using cell count functionality based on the nucleus size and pixel variability, and TB scores were categorized as BUDD1(0-4), BUDD2(5-9) and BUDD3(≥10). We analyzed the association between the TB score and prognostic clinicopathological factors and overall survival. Results 25patients were included (mean age:62.3years;male-to-female ratio:2.57). TB was found in 100%of cases and a high TB score (BUDD2-3) was observed in 56%of cases (using QUPATH versus 48% using HE slides); statistical analysis showed no significant difference between the two methods(p=0.589). A high TB score was associated with older age(>72 years), ductal histological subtype and advanced stage (pT>2).53.8% of patients with lymph node metastasis or advanced stage had high TB score. Multivariate analysis revealed that TB score was strongly and independently associated with overall survival (OS), with a hazard ratio of 2.35. Conclusion TB is an additional prognostic factor in PC, and using artificial intelligence via QUPATH software offers a promising and accessible tool for pathologists to evaluate TB and to improve risk stratification in patients with PC.

                <p>by Ahmed Daoud, Asa Ben-Hur</p>

Complex deep learning models trained on very large datasets have become key enabling tools for current research in natural language processing and computer vision. By providing pre-trained models that can be fine-tuned for specific applications, they enable researchers to create accurate models with minimal effort and computational resources. Large scale genomics deep learning models come in two flavors: the first are large language models of DNA sequences trained in a self-supervised fashion, similar to the corresponding natural language models; the second are supervised learning models that leverage large scale genomics datasets from ENCODE and other sources. We argue that these models are the equivalent of foundation models in natural language processing in their utility, as they encode within them chromatin state in its different aspects, providing useful representations that allow quick deployment of accurate models of gene regulation. We demonstrate this premise by leveraging the recently created Sei model to develop simple, interpretable models of intron retention, and demonstrate their advantage over models based on the DNA language model DNABERT-2. Our work also demonstrates the impact of chromatin state on the regulation of intron retention. Using representations learned by Sei, our model is able to discover the involvement of transcription factors and chromatin marks in regulating intron retention, providing better accuracy than a recently published custom model developed for this purpose.

Transfer learning aims to integrate useful information from multi-source datasets to improve the learning performance of target data. This can be effectively applied in genomics when we learn the gene associations in a target tissue, and data from other tissues can be integrated. However, heavy-tail distribution and outliers are common in genomics data, which poses challenges to the effectiveness of current transfer learning approaches. In this paper, we study the transfer learning problem under high-dimensional linear models with t-distributed error (Trans-PtLR), which aims to improve the estimation and prediction of target data by borrowing information from useful source data and offering robustness to accommodate complex data with heavy tails and outliers. In the oracle case with known transferable source datasets, a transfer learning algorithm based on penalized maximum likelihood and expectation-maximization algorithm is established. To avoid including non-informative sources, we propose to select the transferable sources based on cross-validation. Extensive simulation experiments as well as an application demonstrate that Trans-PtLR demonstrates robustness and better performance of estimation and prediction when heavy-tail and outliers exist compared to transfer learning for linear regression model with normal error distribution.

Computational models are complex scientific constructs that have become essential for us to better understand the world. Many models are valuable for peers within and beyond disciplinary boundaries. However, there are no widely agreed-upon standards for sharing models. This paper suggests 10 simple rules for you to both (i) ensure you share models in a way that is at least “good enough,” and (ii) enable others to lead the change towards better model-sharing practices.

                <p>by Julien Laussu, Deborah Michel, Léa Magne, Stephane Segonds, Steven Marguet, Dimitri Hamel, Muriel Quaranta-Nicaise, Frederick Barreau, Emmanuel Mas, Vincent Velay, Florian Bugarin, Audrey Ferrand</p>

Understanding the interplay between biology and mechanics in tissue architecture is challenging, particularly in terms of 3D tissue organization. Addressing this challenge requires a biological model enabling observations at multiple levels from cell to tissue, as well as theoretical and computational approaches enabling the generation of a synthetic model that is relevant to the biological model and allowing for investigation of the mechanical stresses experienced by the tissue. Using a monolayer human colon epithelium organoid as a biological model, freely available tools (Fiji, Cellpose, Napari, Morphonet, or Tyssue library), and the commercially available Abaqus FEM solver, we combined vertex and FEM approaches to generate a comprehensive viscoelastic finite element model of the human colon organoid and demonstrated its flexibility. We imaged human colon organoid development for 120 hours, following the evolution of the organoids from an immature to a mature morphology. According to the extracted architectural/geometric parameters of human colon organoids at various stages of tissue architecture establishment, we generated organoid active vertex models. However, this approach did not consider the mechanical aspects involved in the organoids’ morphological evolution. Therefore, we applied a finite element method considering mechanical loads mimicking osmotic pressure, external solicitation, or active contraction in the vertex model by using the Abaqus FEM solver. Integration of finite element analysis (FEA) into the vertex model achieved a better fit with the biological model. Therefore, the FEM model provides a basis for depicting cell shape, tissue deformation, and cellular-level strain due to imposed stresses. In conclusion, we demonstrated that a combination of vertex and FEM approaches, combining geometrical and mechanical parameters, improves modeling of alterations in organoid morphology over time and enables better assessment of the mechanical cues involved in establishing the architecture of the human colon epithelium.

The structure of the early metabolic network is unknown. Here, we report that when considered together, pentose utilization pathways form all life-essential precursors. We speculate that the chemistry preserved in pentose metabolism could therefore have been a central structural element in early metabolism.

                This study explored the occurrence of Listeria monocytogenes in fresh produce across Nigeria and selected developing countries, applying a holistic health perspective through a structured review and quantitative synthesis of available research published between 2006 and 2022. Following PRISMA standards, a pre-specified protocol for the review was designed and documented in PROSPERO (ID = CRD42024521833). A comprehensive search of PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases yielded 12 eligible studies. Data were extracted using standardized protocols, and pooled prevalence was calculated using a random-effects model. The overall prevalence was 8.4% (95% CI: 6.3-10.8%), with higher contamination in West Africa (10.5%) compared to Southeast Asia (5.2%). Leafy vegetables exhibited the highest contamination (12.1%). Molecular detection via PCR had higher detecting sensitivity (11.6%) compared to traditional culture methods (7.3%). The analysis revealed significant heterogeneity among the included studies (I2 = 97.79%, p < 0.0001), indicating considerable variability in the reported prevalence of Listeria spp. Environmental factors, such as temperature and poor agricultural practices, contributed to contamination. These findings underscore the need for robust hygiene controls and monitoring to mitigate L. monocytogenes risks in fresh produce.

                Ayurveda is one of the oldest holistic healthcare approaches in the world, underpinning the interdependency of mind, body, and spirit in encouraging harmony and preventing disease. The safety and effectiveness of Ayurveda were explored systematically through this review in various global contexts, including its historical development, current practice, and epidemiological trends. This study assesses the integration of Ayurveda into healthcare systems by analyzing experiences in India, the United States, Europe, and the Middle East and its potential to contribute to global health challenges. As Ayurveda’s originator, India has established a robust regulatory framework, extensive clinical research, and government policy support for its integration into mainstream medicine. Evidence supports the efficacy of Ayurvedic therapies, such as Panchakarma and herbal formulations, for treating chronic diseases with minimal side effects. Ayurveda has entered the fold of complementary and alternative medicine in the United States and Germany. Ayurveda treatments have been shown to be effective in various conditions, such as diabetes and arthritis, although regulatory inconsistencies and quality assurance remain significant barriers. There is a cultural affinity towards traditional medicine in the Middle East and Southeast Asia, leading to a growing adoption supported by collaborative initiatives and research. Despite the globally relevant Ayurveda, the non-uniform nature of regulatory standards, lack of large-scale clinical trials, and standardization of formulations form barriers to its more general acceptance. Recommendations for the future include fostering interdisciplinary research, harmonizing regulation, and leveraging digital health in furthering personalized medicine. This study underscores Ayurveda’s transformative potential in global healthcare, advocating sustainable, patient-centered solutions to address chronic and emerging health issues.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/11-1405/v3?src=rss">Differential gene expression during recall of behaviorally conditioned immune enhancement in rats: a pilot study [version 3; peer review: 4 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Behaviorally conditioned immune functions are suggested to be regulated by bidirectional interactions between CNS and peripheral immune system via the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, sympathetic nervous system (SNS), and the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS). Since the current knowledge about biochemical pathways triggering conditioned immune enhancement is limited, the aim of this pilot study was gaining more insights into that. Methods Rats were conditioned with camphor smell and poly I:C injection, mimicking a viral infection. Following stimulus re-exposure, animals were sacrificed at different time points, and neural tissues along the HPA axis was analyzed with a rat genome array together with plasma protein using Luminex analysis. Results In the hypothalamus, we observed a strong upregulation of genes related to Wnt/β-catenin signaling (Otx2, Spp1, Fzd6, Zic1), monoaminergic transporter Slc18a2 and opioid-inhibitory G-protein Gpr88 as well as downregulation of dopaminergic receptors, vasoactive intestinal peptide Vip, and pro-melanin-concentrating hormone Pmch. In the pituitary, we recognized mostly upregulation of steroid synthesis in combination with GABAergic, cholinergic and opioid related neurotransmission, in adrenal glands, altered genes showed a pattern of activated metabolism plus upregulation of adrenoceptors Adrb3 and Adra1a. Data obtained from spleen showed a strong upregulation of immunomodulatory genes, chemo-/cytokines and glutamatergic/cholinergic neurotransmission related genes, as also confirmed by increased chemokine and ACTH levels in plasma. Conclusions Our data indicate that in addition to the classic HPA axis, there could be additional pathways as e.g. the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAIP), connecting brain and immune system, modulating and finetuning communication between brain and immune system.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-59/v1?src=rss">Case Report: Surgical and cultural approaches to managing hematocolpos in adolescents: A Tunisian case report with video insights [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Hematocolpos is a gynecological disorder characterized by the accumulation of menstrual blood in the vagina due to anatomical obstruction, often resulting from an imperforate hymen (IH), the most common etiology in approximately 90% of cases. This condition can remain undiagnosed until adolescence, when menarche triggers clinical symptoms such as cyclical lower abdominal pain, primary amenorrhea, and in severe cases, a rapidly enlarging pelvic mass. Complications may include urinary retention, constipation, and infection if not promptly treated. Early diagnosis and intervention are crucial to prevent long-term consequences such as endometriosis, retrograde menstruation, and infertility. In Tunisia, the hymen holds significant cultural and social value, symbolizing virginity and moral purity, complicating the surgical management of hematocolpos. This case report discusses the surgical and cultural considerations involved in the treatment of a 13-year-old Tunisian girl diagnosed with hematocolpos. A hymen-sparing hymenotomy was selected, preserving the hymenal ring while creating an adequate orifice for menstrual flow, ensuring a balance between medical treatment and cultural sensitivities. The procedure, which included drainage of 600 ml of retained blood and meticulous suturing to maintain the hymen’s appearance, was successful. The patient experienced regular menstrual cycles and expressed satisfaction with the outcome 12 months postoperatively. This case highlights the importance of providing culturally sensitive care in regions where the hymen holds symbolic value. Virginity-sparing surgical techniques offer a suitable approach that addresses both medical and social concerns, ensuring patient well-being while respecting cultural beliefs.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-58/v1?src=rss">Social pain: A systematic review on interventions [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Social pain is emotional distress caused harm or threat to social connections that results in social exclusion, rejection, or loss. Social Pain is also a potentiator of physical pain. Supportive social relationships are widely recognized for their impact on maintaining health and well-being. The Passion of Jesus Christ serves as a quintessential example of social pain (i.e., desertion, betrayal, denial) potentiating physical pain (i.e., beatings, Crown of Thorns, crucifixion). Christ opts to forgive. Although forgiveness is one solution to reduce social pain, other interventions exist. This review seeks to identify and summarize interventions associated with reducing social pain. We conducted a systematic review using Medline (PubMed), Google Scholar, and Cochrane CENTRAL to identify relevant articles. Results: The database searches produced 548 articles. Fourteen randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included in this systematic review. Acetaminophen, both deceptive and open-label placebos, mindfulness training, and psilocybin were found to reduce social pain. Of note, the combination of acetaminophen and forgiveness yielded superior results compared to either acetaminophen or forgiveness alone. Pharmacological interventions operate on the premise that the neural pathways responsible for physical pain also play a role in social pain. Both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions are available for reducing social pain.

                Ramakrishnan et al. deleted AMPK in a spontaneous breast cancer metastasis mouse model and metastatic cell lines and showed that it is required for breast cancer metastasis. AMPK is required to mitigate ROS levels by generating NADPH, and thus, antioxidants could restore metastasis in AMPK-deficient cells.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92979">Surprising features of nuclear receptor interaction networks revealed by live-cell single-molecule imaging</a></h4>

              
                Type II nuclear receptors (T2NRs) require heterodimerization with a common partner, the retinoid X receptor (RXR), to bind cognate DNA recognition sites in chromatin. Based on previous biochemical and overexpression studies, binding of T2NRs to chromatin is proposed to be regulated by competition for a limiting pool of the core RXR subunit. However, this mechanism has not yet been tested for endogenous proteins in live cells. Using single-molecule tracking (SMT) and proximity-assisted photoactivation (PAPA), we monitored interactions between endogenously tagged RXR and retinoic acid receptor (RAR) in live cells. Unexpectedly, we find that higher expression of RAR, but not RXR, increases heterodimerization and chromatin binding in U2OS cells. This surprising finding indicates the limiting factor is not RXR but likely its cadre of obligate dimer binding partners. SMT and PAPA thus provide a direct way to probe which components are functionally limiting within a complex TF interaction network providing new insights into mechanisms of gene regulation in vivo with implications for drug development targeting nuclear receptors.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101523">Parabrachial CGRP neurons modulate active defensive behavior under a naturalistic threat</a></h4>

              
                Recent studies suggest that calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) neurons in the parabrachial nucleus (PBN) represent aversive information and signal a general alarm to the forebrain. If CGRP neurons serve as a true general alarm, their activation would modulate both passive nad active defensive behaviors depending on the magnitude and context of the threat. However, most prior research has focused on the role of CGRP neurons in passive freezing responses, with limited exploration of their involvement in active defensive behaviors. To address this, we examined the role of CGRP neurons in active defensive behavior using a predator-like robot programmed to chase mice. Our electrophysiological results revealed that CGRP neurons encode the intensity of aversive stimuli through variations in firing durations and amplitudes. Optogenetic activation of CGRP neuron during robot chasing elevated flight responses in both conditioning and retention tests, presumably by amyplifying the perception of the threat as more imminent and dangerous. In contrast, animals with inactivated CGRP neurons exhibited reduced flight responses, even when the robot was programmed to appear highly threatening during conditioning. These findings expand the understanding of CGRP neurons in the PBN as a critical alarm system, capable of dynamically regulating active defensive behaviors by amplifying threat perception, ensuring adaptive responses to varying levels of danger.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/83973">Sensory experience controls dendritic structure and behavior by distinct pathways involving degenerins</a></h4>

              
                Dendrites are crucial for receiving information into neurons. Sensory experience affects the structure of these tree-like neurites, which, it is assumed, modifies neuronal function, yet the evidence is scarce, and the mechanisms are unknown. To study whether sensory experience affects dendritic morphology, we use the <i>Caenorhabditis elegans'</i> arborized nociceptor PVD neurons, under natural mechanical stimulation induced by physical contacts between individuals. We found that mechanosensory signals induced by conspecifics and by glass beads affect the dendritic structure of the PVD. Moreover, developmentally isolated animals show a decrease in their ability to respond to harsh touch. The structural and behavioral plasticity following sensory deprivation are functionally independent of each other and are mediated by an array of evolutionarily conserved mechanosensory amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channels (degenerins). Calcium imaging of the PVD neurons in a micromechanical device revealed that controlled mechanical stimulation of the body wall produces similar calcium dynamics in both isolated and crowded animals. Our genetic results, supported by optogenetic, behavioral, and pharmacological evidence, suggest an activity-dependent homeostatic mechanism for dendritic structural plasticity, that in parallel controls escape response to noxious mechanosensory stimuli.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/75393">Oversized cells activate global proteasome-mediated protein degradation to maintain cell size homeostasis</a></h4>

              
                Proliferating animal cells maintain a stable size distribution over generations despite fluctuations in cell growth and division size. Previously, we showed that cell size control involves both cell size checkpoints, which delay cell cycle progression in small cells, and size-dependent regulation of mass accumulation rates (Ginzberg et al., 2018). While we previously identified the p38 MAPK pathway as a key regulator of the mammalian cell size checkpoint (S. Liu et al., 2018), the mechanism of size-dependent growth rate regulation has remained elusive. Here, we quantified global rates of protein synthesis and degradation in cells of varying sizes, both under unperturbed conditions and in response to perturbations that trigger size-dependent compensatory growth slowdown. We found that protein synthesis rates scale proportionally with cell size across cell cycle stages and experimental conditions. In contrast, oversized cells that undergo compensatory growth slowdown exhibit a superlinear increase in proteasome-mediated protein degradation, with accelerated protein turnover per unit mass, suggesting activation of the proteasomal degradation pathway. Both nascent and long-lived proteins contribute to the elevated protein degradation during compensatory growth slowdown, with long-lived proteins playing a crucial role at the G1/S transition. Notably, large G1/S cells exhibit particularly high efficiency in protein degradation, surpassing that of similarly sized or larger cells in S and G2, coinciding with the timing of the most stringent size control in animal cells. These results collectively suggest that oversized cells reduce their growth efficiency by activating global proteasome-mediated protein degradation to promote cell size homeostasis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96600">The protective roles of eugenol on type 1 diabetes mellitus through NRF2-mediated oxidative stress pathway</a></h4>

              
                Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), known as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, is characterized by persistent hyperglycemia resulting from damage to the pancreatic β cells and an absolute deficiency of insulin, leading to multi-organ involvement and a poor prognosis. The progression of T1DM is significantly influenced by oxidative stress and apoptosis. The natural compound eugenol (EUG) possesses anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, and anti-apoptotic properties. However, the potential effects of EUG on T1DM had not been investigated. In this study, we established the streptozotocin (STZ)-induced T1DM mouse model in vivo and STZ-induced pancreatic β cell MIN6 cell model in vitro to investigate the protective effects of EUG on T1DM, and tried to elucidate its potential mechanism. Our findings demonstrated that the intervention of EUG could effectively induce the activation of nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (NRF2), leading to an up-regulation in the expressions of downstream proteins NQO1 and HMOX1, which are regulated by NRF2. Moreover, this intervention exhibited a significant amelioration in pancreatic β cell damage associated with T1DM, accompanied by an elevation in insulin secretion and a reduction in the expression levels of apoptosis and oxidative stress-related markers. Furthermore, ML385, an NRF2 inhibitor, reversed these effects of EUG. The present study suggested that EUG exerted protective effects on pancreatic β cells in T1DM by attenuating apoptosis and oxidative stress through the activation of the NRF2 signaling pathway. Consequently, EUG holds great promise as a potential therapeutic candidate for T1DM.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95135">The NeuroML ecosystem for standardized multi-scale modeling in neuroscience</a></h4>

              
                Data-driven models of neurons and circuits are important for understanding how the properties of membrane conductances, synapses, dendrites, and the anatomical connectivity between neurons generate the complex dynamical behaviors of brain circuits in health and disease. However, the inherent complexity of these biological processes makes the construction and reuse of biologically detailed models challenging. A wide range of tools have been developed to aid their construction and simulation, but differences in design and internal representation act as technical barriers to those who wish to use data-driven models in their research workflows. NeuroML, a model description language for computational neuroscience, was developed to address this fragmentation in modeling tools. Since its inception, NeuroML has evolved into a mature community standard that encompasses a wide range of model types and approaches in computational neuroscience. It has enabled the development of a large ecosystem of interoperable open-source software tools for the creation, visualization, validation, and simulation of data-driven models. Here, we describe how the NeuroML ecosystem can be incorporated into research workflows to simplify the construction, testing, and analysis of standardized models of neural systems, and supports the FAIR (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability) principles, thus promoting open, transparent and reproducible science.

                The central amygdala (CeA) has emerged as an important brain region for regulating both negative (fear and anxiety) and positive (reward) affective behaviors. The CeA has been proposed to encode affective information in the form of valence (whether the stimulus is good or bad) or salience (how significant is the stimulus), but the extent to which these two types of stimulus representation occur in the CeA is not known. Here, we used single cell calcium imaging in mice during appetitive and aversive conditioning and found that majority of CeA neurons (~65%) encode the valence of the unconditioned stimulus (US) with a smaller subset of cells (~15%) encoding the salience of the US. Valence and salience encoding of the conditioned stimulus (CS) was also observed, albeit to a lesser extent. These findings show that the CeA is a site of convergence for encoding oppositely valenced US information.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97731">Mapping patterns of thought onto brain activity during movie-watching</a></h4>

              
                Movie-watching is a central aspect of our lives and an important paradigm for understanding the brain mechanisms behind cognition as it occurs in daily life. Contemporary views of ongoing thought argue that the ability to make sense of events in the ‘here and now’ depend on the neural processing of incoming sensory information by auditory and visual cortex, which are kept in check by systems in association cortex. However, we currently lack an understanding of how patterns of ongoing thoughts map onto the different brain systems when we watch a film, partly because methods of sampling experience disrupt the dynamics of brain activity and the experience of movie-watching. Our study established a novel method for mapping thought patterns onto the brain activity that occurs at different moments of a film, which does not disrupt the time course of brain activity or the movie-watching experience. We found moments when experience sampling highlighted engagement with multi-sensory features of the film or highlighted thoughts with episodic features, regions of sensory cortex were more active and subsequent memory for events in the movie was better—on the other hand, periods of intrusive distraction emerged when activity in regions of association cortex within the frontoparietal system was reduced. These results highlight the critical role sensory systems play in the multi-modal experience of movie-watching and provide evidence for the role of association cortex in reducing distraction when we watch films.

">Natural body-selective motion processing in humans: Evidence from event-related potentials</a></h4>

              
                As social species, perception of body motion is crucial to daily interactions, yet the underlying neural processes and their dynamics are not fully understood. While well-established EEG evidence has identified temporal markers of biological body motion, and recent fMRI research points to naturalistic body networks, the temporal markers of higher-level, naturalistic body motion processes remain unknown. The present study bridges this gap, showing that at the stage of P2, the cortex may already distinguish between the global motion of naturalistic bodies compared to objects. Exploratory analyses point to a similar body-specific modulation across stimulus species, namely human and monkey. The findings of the present study expand our understanding of body motion processes, in line with emerging, integrative models of multi-faceted body processes.

">Large extracellular vesicles containing mitochondria (EVMs) derived from Alzheimer disease cells harbor pathologic functional and molecular profiles and spread mitochondrial dysfunctions</a></h4>

              
                In addition to small extracellular vesicles known as exosomes, cells release large extracellular vesicles containing mitochondria (EVMs). However, the molecular and functional characteristics of EVMs, as well as the impact of EVM secretion on the spreading of mitochondrial dysfunction between cells, remain unknown in the context of Alzheimer Disease (AD). Here, we provide an ultrastructural, biochemical, and functional characterization of EVMs isolated from cells expressing the amyloid precursor protein (APP) with the familial Swedish mutation (APPswe). We identified differential proteomic and lipidomic signatures in APPswe-derived EVMs compared to control EVMs and revealed a specific proteomic profile in EVMs isolated from conditioned media of fibroblasts from AD patients at the prodromal stage of the disease. Our findings show that APP-C terminal fragments (APP-CTFs) pathogenic accumulation in cells potentiates EVM secretion through the budding of the plasma membrane. We lastly demonstrated that APP-CTFs loaded EVMs are active carriers of dysfunctional mitochondria that transfer mitochondrial pathology to naive control recipient cells.

">Brain dynamics during architectural experience: prefrontal and hippocampal regions track aesthetics and spatial complexity</a></h4>

              
                Architectural experience involves processing the spatial layout of an environment and our emotional reaction to it. However, these two processes are largely studied separately. Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and first-person movies of journeys through buildings and cities to determine the contribution of different brain regions to spatial and aesthetic aspects of the built environment. During scanning, participants watched 48 movies that show first-person-view travel through different spaces; immediately after each video, they either judged the spatial layout complexity or valence of the environment. After scanning, participants also reported the memorability of the spaces encountered. Activity in brain regions previously linked to valence processing (e.g. ventromedial prefrontal cortex) were modulated by aesthetic qualities of the stimuli (i.e. increased for pleasant spaces compared to unpleasant spaces) and the task (more active when judging valence), whereas activity in brain regions linked with spatial processing (e.g. parahippocampal regions) increased in complex layouts compared to simple layouts. The hippocampus and parahippocampal cortex were associated with the memorability of spaces and were modulated by both aesthetic and spatial qualities. We also tested for curvature, fascination, coherence and hominess - qualities linked to aesthetic judgement in architecture. We replicated findings activating right lingual gyrus for fascination, left inferior occipital gyrus for coherence, and left cuneus for hominess, and found inverse curvature (increasing rectilinearity) activated spatial, valence and visual processing regions. Overall, these findings provide important insights into how different brain regions respond whilst experiencing new buildings and city spaces, which is needed to advance the field of neuroarchitecture.

">A critical initialization for biological neural networks</a></h4>

              
                Artificial neural networks learn faster if they are initialized well. Good initializations can generate high-dimensional macroscopic dynamics with long timescales. It is not known if biological neural networks have similar properties. Here we show that the eigenvalue spectrum and dynamical properties of large-scale neural recordings in mice (two-photon and electrophysiology) are similar to those produced by linear dynamics governed by a random symmetric matrix that is critically normalized. An exception was hippocampal area CA1: population activity in this area resembled an efficient, uncorrelated neural code, which may be optimized for information storage capacity. Global emergent activity modes persisted in simulations with sparse, clustered or spatial connectivity. We hypothesize that the spontaneous neural activity reflects a critical initialization of whole-brain neural circuits that is optimized for learning time-dependent tasks.

">Developmental axon diameter growth of central nervous system axons does not depend on ensheathment or myelination by oligodendrocytes</a></h4>

              
                Myelination facilitates the rapid conduction of action potentials along axons. In the central nervous system (CNS), myelinated axons vary over 100-fold in diameter, with conduction speed scaling linearly with increasing diameter. Axon diameter and myelination are closely interlinked, with axon diameter exerting a strong influence on myelination. Conversely, myelinating Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system can both positively and negatively affect axon diameter. However, whether axon diameter is regulated by CNS oligodendrocytes is less clear. Here, we investigated CNS axon diameter growth in the absence of myelin using mouse (Mbpshi/shi and Myrf conditional knockout) and zebrafish (olig2 morpholino) models. We find that neither the ensheathment of axons, nor the formation of compact myelin are required for CNS axons to achieve appropriate and diverse diameters. This indicates that developmental CNS axon diameter growth is independent of myelination, and shows that myelinating cells of CNS and PNS differentially influence axonal morphology.

">Exosomes derived from highly scalable and regenerative human progenitor cells promote functional improvement in a rat model of ischemic stroke</a></h4>

              
                Globally, there are 15 million stroke patients each year who have significant neurological deficits. Today, there are no treatments that directly address these deficits. With demographics shifting to an older population, the problem is worsening. Therefore, it is crucial to develop feasible therapeutic treatments for stroke. In this study, we tested exosomes derived from embryonic endothelial progenitor cells (eEPC) to assess their therapeutic efficacy in a rat model of ischemic stroke. Importantly, we have developed purification methods aimed at producing robust and scalable exosomes suitable for manufacturing clinical grade therapeutic exosomes. We characterized exosome cargos including RNA-seq, miRNAs targets, and proteomic mass spectrometry analysis, and we found that eEPC-exosomes were enhanced with angiogenic miRNAs (i.e., miR-126), anti-inflammatory miRNA (i.e., miR-146), and anti-apoptotic miRNAs (i.e., miR-21). The angiogenic activity of diverse eEPC-exosomes sourced from a panel of eEPC production lines was assessed in vitro by live-cell vascular tube formation and scratch wound assays, showing that several eEPC-exosomes promoted the proliferation, tube formation, and migration in endothelial cells. We further applied the exosomes systemically in a rat middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model of stroke and tested for neurological recovery (mNSS) after injury in ischemic animals. The mNSS scores revealed that recovery of sensorimotor functioning in ischemic MCAO rats increased significantly after intravenous administration of eEPC-exosomes and outpaced recovery obtained through treatment with umbilical cord stem cells. Finally, we investigated the potential mechanism of eEPC-exosomes in mitigating ischemic stroke injury and inflammation by the expression of neuronal, endothelial, and inflammatory markers. Taken together, these data support the finding that eEPCs provide a valuable source of exosomes for developing scalable therapeutic products and therapies for stroke and other ischemic diseases.

">Compensation of Hyperexcitability with Simulation-Based Inference</a></h4>

              
                The activity of healthy neuronal networks is tightly regulated, and a shift towards hyperexcitability can cause various problems, such as epilepsies, memory deficits, and motor disorders. Numerous cellular, synaptic, and intrinsic mechanisms of hyperexcitability and compensatory mechanisms to restore healthy activity have been proposed. However, quantifying multiple compensatory mechanisms and their dependence on specific pathophysiological mechanisms has proven challenging, even in computational models. We use simulation-based inference to quantify the interactions of compensatory mechanisms in a spiking neuronal network model. Various parameters of the model can compensate for changes in other parameters to maintain baseline activity, and we rank them by their compensatory potential. Furthermore, specific causes of hyperexcitability - interneuron loss, excitatory recurrent synapses, and principal cell depolarization - have distinct compensatory mechanisms that can restore normal excitability. Our results show that spiking neuronal network simulators could provide the quantitative foundation for targeting pathophysiological network mechanisms with precise interventions.

                Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the spinal cord is relevant for studying sensation, movement, and autonomic function. Preprocessing of spinal cord fMRI data involves segmentation of the spinal cord on gradient-echo echo planar imaging (EPI) images. Current automated segmentation methods do not work well on these data, due to the low spatial resolution, susceptibility artifacts causing distortions and signal drop-out, ghosting, and motion-related artifacts. Consequently, this segmentation task demands a considerable amount of manual effort which takes time and is prone to user bias. In this work, we (i) gathered a multi-center dataset of spinal cord gradient-echo EPI with ground-truth segmentations and shared it on OpenNeuro [https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds005143/versions/1.3.0], and (ii) developed a deep learning-based model, EPISeg, for the automatic segmentation of the spinal cord on gradient-echo EPI data. We observe a significant improvement in terms of segmentation quality compared to other available spinal cord segmentation models. Our model is resilient to different acquisition protocols as well as commonly observed artifacts in fMRI data. The training code is available at [https://github.com/sct-pipeline/fmri-segmentation/], and the model has been integrated into the Spinal Cord Toolbox as a command-line tool.

                While a growing body of literature exists on initial word-to-meaning mapping and retrieval of fully lexicalized words, our understanding on the learning of semantic knowledge that occurs between these two stages remains limited. The current study investigated the neural correlates of retrieving newly learned word meanings using oscillatory brain dynamics. Participants learned to associate new words with unknown objects and performed overt and covert naming tasks during the first and last days of a five-day training period. Behavioral results showed improved overt naming on Day 5 compared to Day 1. Selecting only words that were successfully produced in the overt naming task, we examined alpha (8-12 Hz) and beta (13-25 Hz) band oscillatory activity associated with lexical-semantic retrieval while participants produced new words covertly, both pre- (Day 1) and post (Day 5) lexicalization. The results showed a robust alpha and lower beta power decrease during covert naming after learning. We hypothesize that this alpha-beta power decrease indexes successful word retrieval following lexical-semantic integration and consolidation.

">Differential effects of dopamine and serotonin on reward and punishment processes in humans: A systematic review and meta-analysis</a></h4>

              
                Importance: To support treatment assignment, mechanistic biomarkers should be selectively sensitive to specific interventions. Here, we examine whether different components of reinforcement learning in humans satisfy this necessary precondition. We focus on pharmacological manipulations of dopamine and serotonin that form the backbone of first-line management of common mental illnesses such as depression and anxiety. Objective: To perform a meta-analysis of pharmacological manipulations of dopamine and serotonin and examine whether they show distinct causal effects on reinforcement learning components in healthy humans. Data Sources: Ovid MEDLINE/PubMed, Embase, and PsycInfo databases were searched for studies published between January 1, 1946 and January 19, 2023 (repeated April 9, 2024, and October 15, 2024) investigating dopaminergic or serotonergic effects on reward/punishment processes in healthy humans. Study Selection: Studies reporting randomized, placebo-controlled, dopaminergic or serotonergic manipulations on a behavioral outcome from a reward/punishment processing task in healthy humans were included. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Standardized mean difference (SMD) scores were calculated for the comparison between each drug (dopamine/serotonin) and placebo on a behavioral reward or punishment outcome and quantified in random-effects models for overall reward/punishment processes and four main subcategories. Study quality, moderators, heterogeneity, and publication bias were also assessed. Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): Performance on reward/punishment processing tasks. Results: In total, 68 dopamine and 39 serotonin studies in healthy volunteers were included (Ndopamine=2452, Nplacebo=2432; Nserotonin=1364, Nplacebo=1393 participants). Dopamine increased overall reward (SMD=0.21; 95%CI [0.12 0.30]) but not punishment function (SMD=-0.09; 95%CI [-0.27,0.10]). Serotonin did not meaningfully affect overall punishment (SMD=0.22; 95%CI [-0.04,0.49]) or reward (SMD=0.01; 95%CI [-0.33,0.35]). Importantly, dopaminergic and serotonergic manipulations had distinct and selective effects on subcomponents. Dopamine affected reward learning/sensitivity (SMD=0.25; 95%CI [0.10,0.40]), reward discounting (SMD=-0.08; 95%CI [-0.14,-0.01]) and reward vigor (SMD=0.32; 95%CI [0.11,0.54]). By contrast, serotonin shaped punishment learning/sensitivity (SMD=0.32; 95%CI [0.05,0.59]), reward discounting (SMD=-0.35; 95%CI [-0.67,-0.02]), and aversive Pavlovian processes (within-subject studies only; SMD=0.36; 95%CI [0.20,0.53]). Conclusions and Relevance: Pharmacological manipulations of both dopamine and serotonin have measurable effects on reinforcement learning in humans. The selective effects on different components suggests that reinforcement learning tasks could form the basis of selective, mechanistically interpretable biomarkers to support treatment assignment.

">Variance spectrum scaling analysis for high-dimensional coordination in human movement</a></h4>

              
                Coordinated movement has been essential to our evolution as a species but its study has been limited by ideas largely developed for one-dimensional data. The field is poised for a change by high-density recording tools and the popularity of data sharing. New ideas are needed to revive classical theoretical questions such as the organization of the highly redundant biomechanical degrees of freedom and the optimal distribution of variability for efficiency and adaptiveness. Methods have been focused on increasing dimensions: making inferences from one or few measured dimensions about the properties of a higher dimensional system. The opposite problem is to record 100+ kinematic degrees of freedom and make inferences about properties of the embedded manifold. We present an approach to quantify the smoothness and degree to which the manifold is distributed among embedding dimensions. The principal components of embedding dimensions are rank ordered by variance. The power-law scaling exponent of this variance spectrum is a function of the smoothness and dimensionality of the embedded manifold. It defines a threshold value beyond which the manifold becomes non differentiable. We verified this approach by showing that the Kuramoto model close to global synchronization in the upper critical end of the coupling parameter obeys the threshold. Next, we tested if the scaling exponent was sensitive to participants' gait impairment in a full-body motion capture dataset containing short gait trials. Variance scaling was highest in the healthy individuals, followed by osteoarthritis patients after hip-replacement, and lastly, the same patients pre-surgery. Thinking about manifold dimensionality, smoothness, and scaling could inform classic problems in movement science and exploration of the biomechanics of full-body action.

">Mechanical impact on neural stem cell lineage decisions in human brain organoids</a></h4>

              
                During neurodevelopment neural stem cells give rise to a spatially patterned tissue in which a regionally differentially regulated balance between proliferation and differentiation produces the fine-tuned number of neurons and macroglia necessary for a functional central nervous system. The cells driving these highly intricated developmental processes of patterning, growth and differentiation are constantly exposed to a mechanical environment that is however variable between different brain regions and along differentiation trajectories. Here we demonstrate that both, acute mechanical manipulations as well as a persistent change in the mechanical environment provided to human brain organoids, instruct neural stem cell lineage decisions. Furthermore, we dissect the underlying changes in the molecular program of organoid-resident cells by bulk- and single cell RNA-sequencing and reveal that mechanical manipulations impact on molecular programs governing early patterning events as well as cell-type specifically alter cellular metabolism. Thus, our results unravel a regulatory network linking mechanics and neural stem cell lineage decisions.

">Impaired Myelination in Multiple Sclerosis Organoids: p21 Links Oligodendrocyte Dysfunction to Disease Subtype</a></h4>

              
                Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune inflammatory disease of the central nervous system. The cause of the disease is unknown but both genetic and environmental factors are strongly implicated in its pathogenesis. We derived cerebral and spinal cord organoids from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) from healthy controls as well as from primary progressive MS (PPMS), secondary progressive MS (SPMS) and relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) patients to investigate and compare oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination capacity in healthy subjects and MS subtypes. In MS organoids, particularly in PPMS, we observed a decrease in p21 expression associated with a dysregulation of PAK1 and E2F1 expression. In parallel, a decrease in oligodendrocyte maturation was detected in long-term cultured cerebral and spinal cord organoids, especially in PPMS, leading to a reduced myelination capacity. Disruption of astrocyte and neuronal populations was also observed. Our findings demonstrate that in MS, inherent deficits in the p21 pathway may alter glial and neuronal cell populations and may contribute to the disease pathogenesis by reducing the capacity for myelin repair.

">C12ORF57: a novel principal regulator of synaptic AMPA currents and excitatory neuronal homeostasis</a></h4>

              
                Biallelic recurrent loss of function mutations in C12ORF57, a novel open reading frame, underlie Temtamy syndrome (TS), a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by dysgenesis of the corpus callosum, epilepsy, and severe intellectual disability. To study the heretofore unknown function of this gene, we used a knockout (KO) mouse model of its murine ortholog, Grcc10. Grcc10 KO mice exhibit the characteristic phenotypic features seen in human TS patients, including increased epileptiform activity. Consistent with this propensity for seizures, hippocampal neurons in these mice show significantly increased AMPA receptor expression levels and higher amplitude of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs). We also find that GRCC10/C12ORF57 modulates the activity of calcium/calmodulin dependent kinase 4 (CAMK4) and regulates the expression of CREB and ARC, which are involved in synaptic scaling of AMPA receptors. Through multiple lines of inquiry, we establish that C12ORF57/GRCC10 plays a central modulatory role in synaptic homeostasis and uncover a novel mechanism for neuronal excitatory tuning.

">Predictive acoustical processing in human cortical layers</a></h4>

              
                In our dynamic environments, predictive processing is vital for auditory perception and its associated behaviors. Predictive coding formalizes inferential processes by implementing them as information exchange across cortical layers and areas. With laminar-specific blood oxygenation level dependent we measured responses to a cascading oddball paradigm, to ground predictive auditory processes on the mesoscopic human cortical architecture. We show that the violation of predictions are potentially hierarchically organized and associated with responses in superficial layers of the planum polare and middle layers of the lateral temporal cortex. Moreover, we relate the updating of the brain's internal model to changes in deep layers. Using a modeling approach, we derive putative changes in neural dynamics while accounting for draining effects. Our results support the role of temporal cortical architecture in the implementation of predictive coding and highlight the ability of laminar fMRI to investigate mesoscopic processes in a large extent of temporal areas.

">Replay builds an efficient cognitive map offline to avoid computation online</a></h4>

              
                How do humans integrate fragmented experiences into a coherent structure for novel inferences? Although offline replay is proposed to reorganize memories, whether it constructs an integrated cognitive map remains unclear. Using magnetoencephalography, we tracked neural activity as participants learned one-dimensional, pairwise rank relationships that together formed a two-dimensional (2D) conceptual map, and then inferred unobserved relationships. Offline replay during rest integrated piecemeal memories into a 2D representation, predicting future inference accuracy. This offline replay and fast on-task replay during inference correlated with grid-cell-like code, representing a generalizable schema that minimized effortful online computations. In contrast, slow on-task replay focusing on trial-specific details, negatively correlated with grid-like codes and inference performance. Together, replay builds an efficient cognitive map offline, reducing reliance on deliberate computations online.

">Rapid "recycling" of logical algorithm representations in fronto-parietal reasoning systems following computer programming instructions</a></h4>

              
                Programming is a cornerstone of modern society, yet its cognitive and neural basis remains poorly understood. In this study, we test the hypothesis that programming "recycles" pre-existing neural mechanisms and representations in fronto-parietal reasoning networks. Using fMRI, we scanned programming-naive undergraduates (n=22) before (PRE) and after (POST) an introductory Python course. During the PRE scan, participants viewed pseudocode (plain English descriptions of algorithms), and during the POST scan, they read Python code. We found that a left-lateralized fronto-parietal network, previously implicated in programming experts, distinguished between "for" loops and "if" conditionals across both pseudocode and Python code. Representational similarity analysis revealed consistent representations of algorithms across formats (code/pseudocode) and learning stages. Furthermore, such representations encode abstract meanings rather than superficial features. Our findings demonstrate that programming not only recycles pre-existing neural resources evolved for logical reasoning, but the recycling takes place rapidly with only a single semester of training.

">Development of catecholaminergic neurons of Otp-lineage in the medial extended amygdala and other centers of the social behavior network</a></h4>

              
                Catecholaminergic (CA) neurons of the medial extended amygdala, preoptic region and adjacent alar hypothalamus have been involved in different aspects of social behavior. Previous data suggested that at least some CA neurons of the medial extended amygdala could originate in a hypothalamic embryonic domain that expresses the transcription factor Otp. To investigate this, we used Otp-eGFP mice to analyze coexpression of GFP and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) throughout ontogenesis by way of double immunofluorescence. Our results showed that some TH cells coexpress GFP in the medial extended amygdala preoptic region, and alar and basal hypothalamus. However, the presence of TH/GFP double-labeled cells in the extended amygdala is transient, as they are not seen in adults. Based on previous data, the Otp-related CA cells of the medial extended amygdala might derive from the telencephalon-opto-hypothalamic domain, and those of the central paraventricular and supraoptic hypothalamic nuclei likely derive from the supraopto-paraventricular hypothalamic core domain. Taken together, these data provide new evidence for several Otp-related CA subpopulations in centers of the social brain network. The results open interesting questions about the role of these catecholaminergic subpopulations during the development and in different aspects of social behavior.

">Deficiency of Shank3 in the Nucleus Accumbens Reveals a Loss of Social-Specific Motivation</a></h4>

              
                Deficits in social interaction are a hallmark symptom of autism and other neuropsychiatric disorders. SHANK3 encodes a postsynaptic density scaffold protein and is one of the most common causal genes for autism. SHANK3 protein is highly expressed in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a critical brain region underlying motivated behavior, including social motivation. We previously reported that global Shank3{Delta}e4-22 deletion mice have decreased motivation for palatable food, increased unilateral social investigation, and show a hypoactive NAc and NAc-connected circuits. We thus developed a new Shank3flox/flox mouse tool to conditionally knockdown SHANK3 in a region-specific manner. We found that knockdown of Shank3 in the NAc decreased social preference in the 3-chamber assay and decreased social motivation in the social conditioned place preference (sCPP) assay. Shank3-NAc deletion did not alter food reward seeking, reciprocal social investigation, or anxiety-like behaviors, that we report in global Shank3{Delta}e4-22 deletion mice. These data establish a novel and specific role of Shank3 in the NAc on social motivation.

                Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects brain regions with remarkable heterogeneity, but the precise impact of this disease on hundreds of small cortical, subcortical, and brainstem regions remains poorly defined. Here, as a prelude to testing preclinical models to prevent AD, we systematically quantified effects of human AD mutations in APP and PSEN1 on 231 regions and comprehensively evaluated changes in volume with unprecedented resolution in genetically diverse mice as a function of sex and genetic background. We studied 34 5XFAD F1 hybrids and 23 sibling controls at 14 months, evaluating learning and memory behaviors, followed by ex vivo diffusion tensor images (DTI) at 25 micron resolution. We delineated 231 regions of interest (ROIs) bilaterally with high precision. Remarkably, we found bidirectional changes: marked volume increases (up to 10%) in neocortex, hippocampus, amygdala, and sensory nuclei, contrasted with decreases in striatum, pallidum, thalamus, hypothalamus, and most fiber tracts. These opposing effects are unrelated to amyloid load and are likely to reflect temporal gradients in susceptibility of ROIs. Effects are similar in both sexes but far more prominent in females. Genetic background strongly modulates penetrance of the human mutations with the AD-BXD77 F1 type having the greatest sensitivity. Light sheet microscopy and stereological analysis of NeuN+ neurons and amyloid beta; aggregates in 22 regions revealed up to 20% loss of cells in CA3 and in anterior and intralaminar parts of the thalamus. Volumetric changes correlated with impaired fear acquisition and memory, with cases and controls often showing opposite relations between performance and regional volumes. These findings reveal unprecedented regional heterogeneity in AD progression and suggest therapeutic efficacy may vary substantially across genetic backgrounds and between sexes.

">Unique transcriptional profiles of adult human immature neurons in healthy aging, Alzheimer's disease, and cognitive resilience</a></h4>

              
                The existence and functional significance of immature neurons in the adult human brain, particularly in the context of neurodegenerative disorders, remain controversial. While rodent studies have highlighted active roles for adult-born immature neurons in the hippocampus under both healthy conditions and in Alzheimer's disease (AD), evidence from the human brain is limited and lacks detailed molecular characterization. To address this gap, we performed single-nucleus RNA sequencing in aged healthy, AD and dementia-resilient human hippocampus to probe immature neuronal signatures and gene expression alterations associated with AD pathology and resilience. Employing a novel experimental and computational pipeline, we identified persistent populations of immature neurons across all donor groups, with transcriptional profiles distinct from both fetal counterparts and adult mature hippocampal neurons. These profiles were associated with 'juvenile' cellular functions, suggesting that the presence of these immature neuronal populations per se may actively contribute to maintaining homeostasis within the aged human hippocampus, a role that may be disrupted in AD. In the resilient brain, immature neurons were involved in transcriptional programs and intercellular interactions associated with anti-inflammatory, neurotrophic, neuroprotective, myelinating, anti-apoptotic and anti-amyloidogenic signaling pathways, suggesting active roles for the immature cells in enhancing cognitive resilience in the presence of AD pathology. Our findings reveal novel, putative physiological roles for immature neurons in the healthy and resilient adult human brain, and offer a resource for probing new strategies with potential functional relevance in AD.

	<p>Backgrounds and Objectives: Obesity presents a significant global public health challenge and is associated with declines in both general and food-related inhibitory control, crucial for maintaining a healthy weight and preventing obesity progression. An increasing body of research suggests that acute aerobic exercise may improve inhibitory function. However, the effects and underlying mechanisms of acute aerobic exercise on both general and food-related inhibition in obese adults remain unclear. This study aimed to explore the potential impacts and underlying neuroelectronic mechanisms of a single session of aerobic exercise at varying intensities on general and food-related inhibitory functions among young adult males with obesity. Design: A within-subject design comprising three sessions (control, low-intensity exercise, moderate-intensity exercise) &amp;amp;times; three picture types (high-calorie food, low-calorie food, neutral picture) was employed. Methods: Eighteen young adult males with obesity [body mass index (BMI): 34.60 &amp;amp;plusmn; 4.21 kg/m2, aged 24.50 &amp;amp;plusmn; 5.13 years (Mean &amp;amp;plusmn; SD)] were recruited. They participated in three intervention sessions: acute aerobic exercise at low [40&amp;amp;ndash;50% maximal Heart Rate (HRmax)], moderate (65&amp;amp;ndash;70% HRmax), and a control session (sitting rest), separated by five-day intervals in a counterbalanced order. Following each session, participants performed a food-related Go/No-go task, and EEG recordings (N2 and P3 components) were conducted within 15 min. Results: Moderate-intensity exercise elicited larger N2 amplitudes compared to the control session across different picture types and task conditions. However, there was no significant effect on behavioral indicators or P3 amplitude across sessions. Additionally, food stimuli (both high- and low-calorie) resulted in lower No-go accuracy and smaller N2 amplitudes compared to neutral stimuli. Conclusions: Acute moderate-intensity exercise might influence general and food-related inhibitory function in obese individuals at the neuroelectric stage, potentially by enhancing attentional resources for managing cognitive control and conflict detection. Moreover, reduced N2 amplitudes and No-go accuracy in response to food stimuli compared to non-food stimuli indicate a diminished ability to allocate attentional and neural resources to manage food-related conflicts. However, due to the relatively small sample size, caution is advised when generalizing these findings to the broader population. The pilot test indicated that obese participants had difficulty sustaining high-intensity exercise at 80&amp;amp;ndash;90% of their maximum heart rate for a continuous or 20 min period, highlighting potential challenges in exercise adherence at high intensities within this population. Future research is needed to utilize interdisciplinary approaches and multimodal technologies to clarify how exercise influences food-related cognition, appetite regulation, and brain mechanisms in obesity, aiming to better contribute to the prevention and treatment of obesity.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Traumatic acute subdural hematoma (aSDH) often requires surgical intervention, such as craniotomy, to relieve mass lesions and pressure. The extent of hematoma evacuation significantly impacts patient outcomes. This study utilizes 3D Slicer software to analyse post-craniotomy hematoma volume changes and evaluate their prognostic significance in aSDH patients. Methods: Among 178 adult patients diagnosed with aSDH from January 2015 to December 2022, 64 underwent hematoma evacuation via craniotomy. Initial scans were performed within 24 h of trauma, followed by routine postoperative scans to assess residual hematoma. We conducted radiomic analysis of preoperative and postoperative volumes, surface area, Feret diameter, sphericity, flatness, and elongation. Clinical parameters, including SOFA score, APACHE score, pupillary response, comorbidities, age, anticoagulation status, and preoperative haematocrit and haemoglobin levels, were also evaluated. Results: Changes in &amp;amp;Delta; surface area significantly correlated with 30-day outcomes (p = 0.03) and showed moderate predictive accuracy (AUC = 0.65). Patients with a &amp;amp;Delta; surface area &amp;amp;gt; 30,090 mm2 experienced poorer outcomes (OR = 6.66, p = 0.02). Significant features included preoperative surface area (p = 0.009), Feret diameter (p = 0.0012). In multivariate analysis, only the Feret diameter remained significant (p = 0.01). Conclusions: Postoperative &amp;amp;Delta; surface area is, among other variables, a strong predictor of 30-day outcomes, while in multivariate analysis, preoperative Feret diameter remains the only independent predictor. Radiomic analysis with 3D Slicer may enhance prognostic accuracy and inform tailored therapeutic strategies.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: The study examined the relationships between specific Theory-of-Mind (ToM) dimensions, cognitive planning, and sleep duration in aging adults. Methods: The sample included 179 participants, comprising 46 cognitively healthy individuals, 75 diagnosed with amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (aMCI), and 58 with non-amnestic (naMCI). The mean age of the participants was 70.23 years (SD = 4.74), with a mean educational attainment of 12.35 years (SD = 3.22) and gender distribution of 53 men and 126 women. ToM assessment included tasks measuring the understanding and interpretation of non-literal speech, proverbs and metaphors, as well as an emotion-recognition test. For cognitive planning, a Tower Test was utilized. Sleep duration was measured using actigraphy. Results: We identified significant differences in various ToM tasks&amp;amp;rsquo; performance between the groups, particularly in non-literal speech tasks and third-order ToM stories. The HC group consistently outperformed both MCI groups in these tasks, with aMCI showing higher performance than naMCI. Mediation analysis applied to examine potential direct and indirect effects of sleep duration on ToM tasks indicated that total sleep time had significant indirect effects through cognitive planning&amp;amp;mdash;mainly as rule violation total score&amp;amp;mdash;on specific ToM aspects. Hence, besides the effects of MCI pathologies and especially of naMCI, sleep duration seems also to be associated with ToM performance in aging via specific executive functioning decrements. Conclusions: The findings underscore the social implications of ToM deficits due to MCI and/or sleep duration decrease, particularly in naMCI older adults, as they can seriously impair their social interactions. Targeted interventions could improve emotional understanding, communication, and overall quality of life.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Prosopagnosia is the inability to recognize people by their faces. Developmental prosopagnosia is the hereditary or congenital variant of the condition. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the assessment of developmental prosopagnosia in a clinical context, using a combination of commercially available clinical assessment tools and experimental tools described in the research literature. Methods: We conducted a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment of a man with Tourette syndrome and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The patient (ON) had experienced difficulties with face identity recognition throughout his life but believed they were caused by a lack of interest in others. Results: The neuropsychological assessment revealed varying degrees of difficulties primarily related to executive functions, attention, reaction time, and memory processes, as expected in a person with Tourette&amp;amp;rsquo;s syndrome and ADHD. In addition, ON reported severe problems with face recognition on a prosopagnosia questionnaire and demonstrated severely impaired performance on tests of face memory and face perception commonly used to diagnose prosopagnosia. Interestingly, he reported familial face recognition problems on the maternal side of the family, while tics and ADHD symptoms occurred on the paternal side. This suggests that, in this case, the conditions were likely inherited through different genetic pathways. Conclusions: Proper assessment of face recognition problems, which includes a broad spectrum of clinical assessment tools, could help patients develop awareness and acceptance of themselves and their difficulties, and could serve as a basis for the development of clinical interventions. While ON&amp;amp;rsquo;s DP, Tourette syndrome, and ADHD may have distinct genetic origins, impairment in face identity recognition has been observed across several neurodevelopmental conditions and is likely more common than currently thought.</p>

                <p>The full complement of ion channels which influence insect auditory mechanotransduction and the mechanisms by which their influence is exerted remain unclear. <I>Shal</I> (K<SUB>v</SUB>4), a <I>Shaker</I> family member encoding voltage-gated potassium channels in <I>Drosophila melanogaster</I>, has been shown to localize to dendrites in some neuron types, suggesting the potential role of <I>Shal</I> in <I>Drosophila</I> hearing, including mechanotransduction. A GFP trap was used to visualize the localization of the <I>Shal</I> channel in Johnston's organ neurons responsible for hearing in the antenna. <I>Shal</I> protein was localized strongly to the cell body and inner dendritic segment of sensory neurons. It was also detectable in the sensory cilium, suggesting its involvement not only in general auditory function but specifically in mechanotransduction. Electrophysiological recordings to assess neural responses to auditory stimuli in mutant <I>Shal</I> flies revealed significant decreases in auditory responses. Laser Doppler vibrometer recordings indicated abnormal antennal free fluctuation frequencies in mutant lines, indicating an effect on active antennal tuning, and thus active transduction mechanisms. This suggests that <I>Shal</I> participates in coordinating energy-dependent antennal movements in <I>Drosophila</I> that are essential for tuning the antenna to courtship song frequencies.</p>

                <p>The social environment has long been recognized to play an important role in substance use, which is often modeled in rodents using operant conditioning. However, most operant chambers only accommodate one rodent at a time. We present PeerPub&mdash;a unique social operant chamber. PeerPub employs touch sensors to track the licking behavior on drinking spouts. When the number of licks meets a set reinforcement schedule, it dispenses a drop of solution with a fixed volume as a reward at the tip of the spout. A radio frequency identification (RFID) chip implanted in each rat&rsquo;s skull identifies it throughout the experiment. The system is managed by a Raspberry Pi computer. We evaluated PeerPub using Sprague Dawley rats in daily 1&nbsp;h sessions, where supersac (a glucose and saccharin solution) was provided under a fixed-ratio five schedule. We discovered that male rats consumed more supersac in dual rat conditions compared with single rat conditions. These findings illustrate PeerPub&rsquo;s effectiveness in modeling the interaction between motivated behavior and social context. We expect devices like PeerPub will help highlight the role of social environments in substance use disorder phenotypes. All computer code, 3D design, and build instructions for PeerPub can be found at <A HREF="http://github.com/nijie321/PeerPub">http://github.com/nijie321/PeerPub</A>.</p>

                Background Leprosy, or Hansen’s disease, is a chronic infectious disease that primarily affects the skin and peripheral nervous system, often leading to disabilities, including trophic ulcers (TU). The role of vitamin D and vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene polymorphisms in the development of TU among leprosy patients remain unclear. Objective This study aims to investigate the differences in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels and the frequency of VDR gene FokI polymorphism between leprosy patients with and without TU, and to evaluate their association with the occurrence of TU. Methods This Institutional Review Board-approved, single-center, observational, analytic case-control study will enroll adult leprosy patients from the Dermatology and Venereology Clinic at Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital in Jakarta, Indonesia. Participants will be divided into cases (patients with TU) and controls (patients without TU). Serum 25(OH)D levels will be measured using a chemiluminescence immunoassay, and FokI polymorphism detection is conducted through polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) methods. Statistical analysis will be performed to evaluate the differences and associations. Results Data collection commenced in March 2024 and was completed in September 2024. Data analysis and reporting are expected to be finalized by January 2025. Discussion The findings of this study will enhance the current understanding of the role of the vitamin D axis in the development of TU among leprosy patients. This could lead to new therapeutic strategies, such as vitamin D supplementation or personalized medicine based on genetic profiling, potentially reducing the burden of TU among leprosy patients.

                Background The quality of registry based studies depends largely on the data accuracy of the registries. The Dutch Perinatal Registry (Perined) is a nationwide database comprising perinatal data digitally provided by different healthcare providers. Perined data are used for comparing outcomes across regions and healthcare institutions as well as for quality analyses and research purposes. However, little is known about the data quality of the Perined database. Therefore, this research protocol depicts our proposed study assessing the quality of Perined data compared to hospital records and case report forms (CRFs) that were part of the IUGR Risk Selection (IRIS) study. Methods In the planned comparison study data from Perined and the IRIS Study will be used. The IRIS study was a large cluster-randomized trial investigating the effectiveness of routine third trimester ultrasonography in reducing severe adverse perinatal outcomes among Dutch low-risk pregnant women. A subsample of the IRIS study of neonates being at risk of severe adverse perinatal outcomes and their mothers will be used. Baseline demographic data were collected by midwives from participating women at inclusion (around 22 weeks’ gestation) using CRFs, and in-depth neonatal and maternal clinical data were retrieved from hospital records by trained research assistants. These latter IRIS study data were linked and compared to Perined data. Completeness of Perined data will be calculated for every variable. The reliability will be assessed as the percent of agreement between Perined and hospital record data or the CRF-based data. Additionally, intra-class correlation coefficients will be calculated for continuous variables, and Kappa and ‘Prevalence-and-Bias-Adjusted Kappa’ will be calculated for categorical variables. Discussion The results of the planned comparison study will provide users of Perined data insight in its data quality. This will serve as an example of the accuracy of registry based data used in maternal and neonatal care research.

                Background Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination among children and adolescents is crucial for the prevention of HPV-related diseases later in life. However, HPV vaccination uptake remains suboptimal in this population. This protocol outlines a comprehensive review that aims to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions targeting parents and parent-adolescent dyads in improving HPV vaccination uptake among children and adolescents aged 9-18 years. Objective The objective of this study is to assess the impact of parent-directed and parent-adolescent dyad interventions on HPV vaccination uptake in children and adolescents aged 9-18 years. Specific objectives include reviewing existing literature on parent-oriented and parent-adolescent dyad interventions, assessing vaccination uptake, identifying influencing factors, and providing evidence-based recommendations for intervention development and implementation. Methods A systematic review will be conducted, encompassing literature published up to the present day. Various databases will be searched for relevant studies on parent-focused and parent-adolescent dyad interventions aimed at improving HPV vaccination uptake. Data extraction and analysis will be performed to assess the proportion of children and adolescents receiving HPV vaccination following interventions, factors influencing vaccination uptake, and completion rates of the recommended vaccine series. Results The review findings will be analyzed using appropriate statistical methods, including meta-analysis to estimate the overall effect size of interventions. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses will be conducted to explore heterogeneity and assess the robustness of the results. Conclusion This protocol outlines a comprehensive review that will contribute to the current understanding of the effectiveness of parent-oriented and parent-adolescent dyad interventions in improving HPV vaccination uptake among children and adolescents. The findings will inform the development and implementation of targeted interventions to address barriers and improve vaccination coverage, ultimately reducing the burden of HPV-related diseases.

                Background Breast cancer (BC) is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality among women worldwide. The role of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in improving clinical outcomes for breast cancer patients has gained significant attention; however, its impact on long-term survival and recurrence rates remains under investigation. Thus, we evaluated the effectiveness of NAC on metastasis, recurrence rates, and overall survival in BC patients. Statistical analyses, including Chi-square tests and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, were employed to assess differences between groups. Methods In this retrospective study, 46 Sudanese patients with locally advanced BC were consecutively collected attending Alsharif Specialized Hospital during the period from 2015 to 2016, comprising 28 patients who received NAC (case group) and 18 patients who underwent upfront surgery (control group). Data regarding demographics, histological types, treatment regimens, prognostic markers, survival, recurrence and metastasis were collected Results Most of patients in both groups were > 40 years old. Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) was the predominant histological type observed. Notably, the metastasis rate was lower in the case group than in the control group (n=6; 21.4% vs. n=9; 50%, P = 0.043). However, the recurrence rates and overall survival did not differ significantly between the two groups (P = 0.353 and P = 0.454, respectively). The estimated mean survival time was 74.1 months for the case group compared to 82.0 months for the control group, but without significant difference (log-rank P = 0.973). Conclusion While NAC appears to reduce metastasis rates in breast cancer patients, it does not significantly impact recurrence rates or overall survival. These results underscore the need for further research to explore additional factors that influence long-term outcomes of breast cancer management.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-54/v1?src=rss">Applications of MR Finger printing derived T1 and T2 values in Adult brain: A Systematic review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is essential for brain imaging, but conventional methods rely on qualitative contrast, are time-intensive, and prone to variability. Magnetic resonance finger printing (MRF) addresses these limitations by enabling fast, simultaneous mapping of multiple tissue properties like T1, T2. Using dynamic acquisition parameters and a precomputed signal dictionary, MRF provides robust, qualitative maps, improving diagnostic precision and expanding clinical and research applications in brain imaging. Methods Database searches were performed through PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of science to identify relevant articles focusing on the application of MR finger printing in the adult brain. We utilized the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis guidelines to extract data from the selected studies. Results Nine articles were included in the final review, with a total sample size of 332 participants. In healthy brains, notable regional, sex, age, and hemispheric variations were identified, particularly in the corpus callosum and thalamus. MRF effectively differentiated meningioma subtypes, glioma grades, and IDH mutation status, with T2 values providing particularly predictive for glioma classification. In brain metastases, significant relaxometry differences were noted between normal and lesional tissues. For multiple sclerosis, MRF values correlated with clinical and disability measures, distinguishing relapsing-remitting secondary progressive forms. In traumatic brain injury, longitudinal T1 changes strongly correlated with clinical recovery, surpassing T2 values. Conclusions The systematic review highlighted MRD as a groundbreaking technique that enhances neurological diagnosis by simultaneously quantifying T1 and T2 relaxation times. With reduced acquisition times, MRF outperforms conventional MRI in detecting subtle pathologies, distinguishing properties, and providing reliable biomarkers.

                Background Good animal welfare is important ethically but also to ensure animals provide valid scientific models. Despite thousands of amphibians in research laboratories there is minimal quantitative evidence pertaining to their management and welfare. This study validated methods to non-invasively measure corticosterone, the amphibian ‘stress’ hormone, from tank water to provide a robust and reliable welfare assessment tool. Methods We report experiments (A) that evaluate parameters linked to the performance of our biochemical extraction methods for waterborne corticosterone and, importantly, associated sampling procedures. We evaluate appropriate sampling water type, sampling vessel, filtration methods, potential degradation of waterborne corticosterone over time and the impact of sampling procedures on animal corticosterone levels. We wanted to determine sampling parameters that yielded the least background corticosterone and had minimum negative impact on the animals. The second series of experiments (B) evaluated parameters linked to the biology of Xenopus, including the influence of circadian rhythm, sex and snout-vent length on waterborne corticosterone levels, since fundamental knowledge of a species’ biology is essential for designing robust experiments and in the interpretation of the results. Results We propose collecting corticosterone samples in deionised water in either plastic or glass containers. The filtering process does not impact the amount of corticosterone measured in the water sample. Levels of corticosterone collected in the water change over a 48-hr period so we advocate standardising time from hormone collection to storage at - 20 °C. Repeated transfer of frogs to sampling containers does not increase corticosterone, suggesting our methods are not cumulatively stressful. Corticosterone levels were not impacted by circadian phase, sex or snout-vent length. Conclusion We have developed and validated robust methods to quantify waterborne corticosterone. We hope they provide a template for researchers wishing to develop methods to measure waterborne corticosterone in aquatic amphibians.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Isolated rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) is, in most cases, an early stage of Parkinson's disease or related disorders. Diagnosis requires an overnight video-polysomnogram (vPSG), however, even for sleep experts, interpreting vPSG data is challenging. Using a 3D camera, automated analysis of movements has yielded high accuracy. We aimed to replicate and extend prior work using a conventional 2D camera.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The dataset included 172 vPSG recordings from a clinical sleep center, 81 patients with iRBD and 91 non-RBD healthy controls (63 with a range of other sleep disorders and 28 healthy sleepers). An optical flow computer vision algorithm automatically detected movements during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, from which features of rate, ratio, magnitude and velocity of movements, and ratio of immobility were extracted.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Patients with iRBD exhibited an increased number of shorter movements and immobility periods. Accuracies for detecting iRBD ranged from 84.9% (with 2 features) to 87.2% (with 5 features). Combining all 5 features but only analyzing short (0.1–2 second duration) movements achieved the highest accuracy at 91.9%. Of the 11 patients with iRBD without noticeable movements during vPSG, 7 were correctly identified.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This work improves prior art by using a 2D camera routinely used in sleep laboratories and improving performance by adding only 3 features. This approach could be implemented in clinical sleep laboratories to facilitate and improve the diagnosis of iRBD. Coupled with automated detection of REM sleep, it should also be tested in the home environment using conventional infrared cameras to detect and/or monitor RBD. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                <p>by Xiaoyi Wang, Zhen Jin</p>

Human mobility between different regions is a major factor in large-scale outbreaks of infectious diseases. Deep learning models incorporating infectious disease transmission dynamics for predicting the spread of multi-regional outbreaks due to human mobility have become a hot research topic. In this study, we incorporate the Graph Transformer Neural Network and graph learning mechanisms into a metapopulation SIR model to build a hybrid framework, Metapopulation Graph Transformer Neural Network (M-Graphormer), for high-dimensional parameter estimation and multi-regional epidemic prediction. The framework effectively solves the problem that existing models may lose some hidden spatial dependencies in the data when dealing with the dynamic graph structure of the network due to human mobility. We performed multi-wave infectious disease prediction in multiple regions based on real epidemic data. The results show that the framework is capable of performing high-dimensional parameter estimation and accurately predicting epidemic transmission dynamics in multiple regions even with low data quality. In addition, we retrospectively extrapolate the temporal evolution patterns of contact rate under different interventions implemented in different regions, reflecting the dynamics of intervention intensity and the need for flexibility in adjusting interventions in different regions. To provide early warning of infectious disease transmission, we retrospectively predicted the arrival time of infectious diseases using data from the early stages of outbreaks.

                <p>by Luca Oneto, Davide Chicco</p>

Machine learning has become a powerful tool for computational analysis in the biomedical sciences, with its effectiveness significantly enhanced by integrating domain-specific knowledge. This integration has give rise to informed machine learning, in contrast to studies that lack domain knowledge and treat all variables equally (uninformed machine learning). While the application of informed machine learning to bioinformatics and health informatics datasets has become more seamless, the likelihood of errors has also increased. To address this drawback, we present eight guidelines outlining best practices for employing informed machine learning methods in biomedical sciences. These quick tips offer recommendations on various aspects of informed machine learning analysis, aiming to assist researchers in generating more robust, explainable, and dependable results. Even if we originally crafted these eight simple suggestions for novices, we believe they are deemed relevant for expert computational researchers as well.

                <p>by Amrit Bagchi, Bapi Sarker, Jialiang Zhang, Marcus Foston, Amit Pathak</p>

Cell collectives, like other motile entities, generate and use forces to move forward. Here, we ask whether environmental configurations alter this proportional force-speed relationship, since aligned extracellular matrix fibers are known to cause directed migration. We show that aligned fibers serve as active conduits for spatial propagation of cellular mechanotransduction through matrix exoskeleton, leading to efficient directed collective cell migration. Epithelial (MCF10A) cell clusters adhered to <i>soft</i> substrates with aligned collagen fibers (AF) migrate faster with much lesser traction forces, compared to random fibers (RF). Fiber alignment causes higher motility waves and transmission of normal stresses deeper into cell monolayer while minimizing shear stresses and increased cell-division based fluidization. By contrast, fiber randomization induces cellular jamming due to breakage in motility waves, disrupted transmission of normal stresses, and heightened shear driven flow. Using a novel motor-clutch model, we explain that such ‘force-effective’ fast migration phenotype occurs due to rapid stabilization of contractile forces at the migrating front, enabled by higher frictional forces arising from simultaneous compressive loading of parallel fiber-substrate connections. We also model ‘<i>haptotaxis</i>’ to show that increasing ligand connectivity (but not continuity) increases migration efficiency. According to our model, increased rate of front stabilization via higher resistance to substrate deformation is sufficient to capture ‘<i>durotaxis’</i>. Thus, our findings reveal a new paradigm wherein the rate of leading-edge stabilization determines the efficiency of supracellular collective cell migration.

                <p>by Kwang Su Kim, Masashi Iwamoto, Kosaku Kitagawa, Hyeongki Park, Sanae Hayashi, Senko Tsukuda, Takeshi Matsui, Masanori Atsukawa, Kentaro Matsuura, Natthaya Chuaypen, Pisit Tangkijvanich, Lena Allweiss, Takara Nishiyama, Naotoshi Nakamura, Yasuhisa Fujita, Eiryo Kawakami, Shinji Nakaoka, Masamichi Muramatsu, Kazuyuki Aihara, Takaji Wakita, Alan S.

Quantification of intrahepatic covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) is a key for evaluating an elimination of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in infected patients. However, quantifying cccDNA requires invasive methods such as a liver biopsy, which makes it impractical to access the dynamics of cccDNA in patients. Although HBV RNA and HBV core-related antigens (HBcrAg) have been proposed as surrogate markers for evaluating cccDNA activity, they do not necessarily estimate the amount of cccDNA. Here, we employed a recently developed multiscale mathematical model describing intra- and intercellular viral propagation and applied it in HBV-infected patients under treatment. We developed a model that can predict intracellular HBV dynamics by use of extracellular viral markers, including HBsAg, HBV DNA, and HBcrAg in peripheral blood. Importantly, the model prediction of the amount of cccDNA in patients over time was confirmed to be well correlated with the data for quantified cccDNA by paired liver biopsy. Thus, our method combining classic and emerging surrogate markers enables us to predict the decay dynamics of cccDNA in patients undergoing treatment.

<p>Fossils work well for reconstructing the evolutionary history of brain shape and size but are mute to the evolution of subcortical structures. Leveraging the use of scaling attributes, simulation and 3D mapping we predict subcortical anatomy for fossil Carnivora. These data help to expand the search space for paleoneurological study.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Paleoneurology reconstructs the evolutionary history of nervous systems through direct observations from the fossil record and comparative data from extant species. Although this approach can provide direct evidence of phylogenetic links among species, it is constrained by the availability and quality of data that can be gleaned from the fossil record. Here, we sought to translate brain component relationships in a sample of extant Carnivora to make inferences about brain structure in fossil species. Using high resolution magnetic resonance imaging on extant canids and felids and 3D laser scanning on fossil Carnivora, spanning some 40 million years of evolution, we derived measurements for select brain components. From these primary data, predictive equations of cortical (gray matter mass, cortical thickness, and gyrification index) and subcortical structures (caudate nucleus, putamen, and external globus pallidus mass) were used to derive estimates for select fossil Carnivora. We found that regression equations based on both extant and simulation samples provided moderate to high predictability of subcortical masses for fossil Carnivora. We also found that using exploratory probabilistic mapping of subcortical structures in extant Carnivora, a reasonable prediction could be made of the 3D subcortical morphospace of fossil endocasts. These results identify allometric departures and establish adult species ranges in brain component size for fossil species. The integrative approach taken in this study may serve as a model to promote further dialog between neurobiologists working on extant Carnivora models and paleoneurologists describing the nervous system of fossils from this understudied group of mammals.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27161?af=R">Early‐Life Adversity Predicts Markers of Aging‐Related Neuroinflammation, Neurodegeneration, and Cognitive Impairment in Women</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Despite the overwhelming evidence for profound and longstanding effects of early-life stress (ELS) on inflammation, brain structure, and molecular aging, its impact on human brain aging and risk for neurodegenerative disease is poorly understood. We examined the impact of ELS severity in interaction with age on blood-based markers of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, brain volumes, and cognitive function in middle-aged women.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We recruited 179 women (aged 30–60 years) with and without ELS exposure before the onset of puberty. Using Simoa technology, we assessed blood-based markers of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, including serum concentrations of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and neurofilament light chain (NfL). We further obtained T1-weighted and T2-weighted magnetic resonance images to assess brain volumes and we assessed cognitive performance sensitive to early impairments associated with the development of dementia, using the Cambridge Neuropsychological Automated Test Battery. We used generalized additive models to examine nonlinear interaction effects of ELS severity and age on these outcomes.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Analyses revealed significant nonlinear interaction effects of ELS severity and age on NfL and GFAP serum concentrations, total and subcortical gray matter volume loss, increased third ventricular volume, and cognitive impairment.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These findings suggest that ELS profoundly exacerbates peripheral, neurostructural, and cognitive markers of brain aging. Our results are critical for the development of novel early prevention strategies that target the impact of developmental stress on the brain to mitigate aging-related neurological diseases.

                Background Glaucoma, the primary cause of irreversible blindness globally, mainly presents as primary open-angle glaucoma and is more common in sub-Saharan Africa. This chronic disease of the optic nerve often goes undiagnosed due to its asymptomatic early stages. Increased awareness and regular eye exams can help in early detection and management. Purpose/Objectives This study aims to comprehensively identify the existing literature on screening programs or interventions for primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) at the primary healthcare level. Additionally, the study aims to outline the characteristics of these screening programs/interventions and emphasize the most successful programs that have been implemented at the primary healthcare level. Methods The scoping review will be conducted following the framework developed by Arksey and O’Malley and Levac et al. (2010) methodological enhancement for conducting a scoping review project. The search will cover peer-reviewed articles published in English between the inception and May 2024 from databases such as PubMed, Google Scholar, Science Direct, EBSCOhost, Web of Science, and the WHO Global Database. The search on the EBSCOhost platform will include databases such as Academic Search Complete, APA PsycInfo, Health Source-Consumer Edition, Health Source: Nursing/Academic Edition, MEDLINE with full text, and Open Dissertations. The extracted data will be analyzed using QualCoder 1.9 version. The study findings will be reported following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR), and a checklist will be completed to ensure adherence to reporting guidelines. Conclusion This review will help identify research gaps in primary healthcare POAG screening programs and recommend effective interventions.

                Background Trichoderma spp. hold significant potential as biocontrol agents in agriculture due to their antagonistic properties against plant pathogens. The study aimed to characterize and identify Trichoderma isolates from rhizospheric regions of vegetable crops. Methods In this study, Trichoderma isolates were collected from rhizospheric soil samples of vegetable crops from different ecological zones and were selected for comprehensive morphological and molecular characterization. The isolates were visually assessed for colony color, growth pattern, aerial mycelium presence, phialide and conidial morphology, and chlamydospore presence. Molecular analysis was employed based on ITS and tef-1α sequences. Diversity indices were also computed for different ecological zones. Results The morphological characteristics and phylogenetic trees for both regions provided a clear species resolution, with four main clades: Harzianum, Viride, Brevicompactum and Longibrachiatum with 12 species T. harzinaum, T. afroharzianum, T. lentiforme, T. inhamatum, T. camerunense, T. azevedoi, T. atroviride, T. asperellum, T. asperelloides, T. koningii, T. longibrachiatum and T. brevicompactum and nine species as a new country record. Diversity indices indicated that high mountain regions displayed the highest species diversity and evenness (H = 1.724 [0.28], J = 0.84, D = 0.28), followed by hilly regions (H = 1.563 [0.28], J = 0.72, D = 0.28). Plains, on the other hand, exhibited lower species diversity (H = 1.515, J = 0.66, D = 0.33). The calculated species abundance values showed that plains (E = 2.11), mid-hills (E = 1.95), and high mountains (E = 1.99) each had their unique diversity profiles. Notably, T. afroharzianum and T. asperellum were predominant. Conclusions Overall, the study unveiled a rich diversity of Trichoderma species in different agricultural zones of Nepal. These findings shed light on the ecological distribution and diversity of Trichoderma spp., which could have significant implications for sustainable agriculture and biological control strategies.

                Background Radiological case reports summarize the imaging characteristics of individual cases to identify patterns and valuable lessons. Their writing can be guided by the CARE reporting guidelines or the CARE-radiology reporting guidelines. However, the impact of following these guidelines, or not following them, on the quality and efficiency of radiological case reports writing remain unclear. Objective To examine whether following the CARE reporting guidelines or the CARE-radiology reporting guidelines, or not following any reporting guidelines, affects the quality and writing efficiency of radiological case reports. Protocol The purpose of this protocol is to outline the background and objectives of this study, as well as the design of a cluster randomized controlled trial (cRCT). We will design a three-arm, multicentre cRCT, targeting radiologists or radiology students from different medical institutions. The intervention include training on the CARE-radiology checklist; the second intervention involves training on the CARE checklist. The control group will follow standard procedures without any intervention. After the intervention, participants will be required to write a case report within a period of 10 days. The primary outcome measures will be the completeness and clarity of the case reports. Discussion This study aims to enhance the adherence of researchers to reporting guidelines for case reports through rigorous design. The results will be further explained and interpreted in the final trial outcomes. Registration This study has been registered with the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, with the registration number: ChiCTR2400089973.

                Background Intestinal parasitoses are one of the main causes of morbidity and mortality in Africa, with a prevalence of 42.18%. The tropical climate in the D.R. Congo provides parasites with an environment conducive to their proliferation. The prevalence rates of intestinal parasitoses remain poorly understood in the D.R. Congo. Objective This study aims to estimate the overall and specific prevalence of intestinal parasitosis and to determine an association between intestinal parasitosis and the season. Methods From January 1, 2020, to December 31, 2021, patients for whom a direct stool examination was requested at the Notre Dame de l’Espérance University Hospital Center were included in this study. Stool samples were collected and examined under an optical microscope. Results During the period of the study, we recorded 187 patients aged 2 to 77 years. The prevalence of intestinal parasitosis was 75.40%. The specific prevalence rates for parasites were as follows: Entamoeba H., the most common, with a prevalence of 55.08%, followed by Trichomonas I. and Giardia L. with respective prevalence rates of 9.09% and 6.24%. Ascaris L. had a prevalence of 27.81%, followed by Schistosoma M., Ankylostoma D., and Enterobius V. with respective prevalence rates of 3.74%, 1.60%, and 1.07%. There was no association between the season and the overall prevalence of intestinal parasitosis. Conclusion The prevalence of intestinal parasitosis was higher during the dry season. There is no statistically valid association between the season and the prevalence of intestinal parasitosis.

                Objective To develop predictive models for healthcare workforce transition success under decentralization using Support Vector Machine (SVM) analysis and identify key determinants across organizational support domains. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among healthcare personnel (n=430) who transferred from Ministry of Public Health facilities to Provincial Administrative Organizations in Thailand during 2023-2024. The SVM model evaluated 37 predictor variables spanning demographic characteristics, benefits, and welfare domains. Four kernel functions were compared to identify optimal model performance, and feature importance analysis was conducted to determine key predictors. Results The linear kernel demonstrated superior performance (accuracy: 71.43%, sensitivity: 49.02%, specificity: 85.37%) compared to other kernel functions. Analysis revealed five key predictors (feature weights >0.25): competitive compensation (0.427), career development opportunities (0.358), fair promotion processes (0.336), hazardous work compensation (0.285), and educational leave opportunities (0.252). While employee qualifications (0.236) emerged as a significant demographic predictor, organizational support factors, particularly financial incentives and professional development opportunities, showed stronger predictive power for transition success. Conclusions This study represents the first application of machine learning techniques to predict healthcare personnel transition success in decentralization contexts. The SVM model effectively identified critical factors influencing workforce transitions, emphasizing the importance of balanced organizational support mechanisms. These findings provide evidence-based guidance for healthcare administrators implementing decentralization policies, offering generalizable insights for workforce management during health system reforms.

                Fu et al. discover a non-metabolic function of TKT in gliomas. Mechanistically, TKT undergoes translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus following chemotherapy. Nuclear TKT interacts with XRN2 to prevent excessive R-loop accumulation, while depletion of TKT leads to increased R-loop accumulation and genome instability, potentiating chemotherapy efficacy.

The authors argue that delayed tumor formation observed in Miro1KO mice results from impaired mitochondrial transfer, which involves reduced microtubule association, disruption of the mitochondrial network, and TNT formation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96784">Fractal cycles of sleep, a new aperiodic activity-based definition of sleep cycles</a></h4>

              
                Sleep cycles are defined as episodes of non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) sleep followed by an episode of REM sleep. Fractal or aperiodic neural activity is a well-established marker of arousal and sleep stages measured using electroencephalography. We introduce a new concept of ‘fractal cycles’ of sleep, defined as a time interval during which time series of fractal activity descend to their local minimum and ascend to the next local maximum. We assess correlations between fractal and classical (i.e. non-REM – REM) sleep cycle durations and study cycles with skipped REM sleep. The sample comprised 205 healthy adults, 21 children and adolescents and 111 patients with depression. We found that fractal and classical cycle durations (89±34 vs 90±25 min) correlated positively (<i>r</i>=0.5, p&lt;0.001). Children and adolescents had shorter fractal cycles than young adults (76±34 vs 94±32 min). The fractal cycle algorithm detected cycles with skipped REM sleep in 91–98% of cases. Medicated patients with depression showed longer fractal cycles compared to their unmedicated state (107±51 vs 92±38 min) and age-matched controls (104±49 vs 88±31 min). In conclusion, fractal cycles are an objective, quantifiable, continuous and biologically plausible way to display sleep neural activity and its cycles.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95528">High-resolution awake mouse fMRI at 14 tesla</a></h4>

              
                High-resolution awake mouse functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) remains challenging despite extensive efforts to address motion-induced artifacts and stress. This study introduces an implantable radio frequency (RF) surface coil design that minimizes image distortion caused by the air/tissue interface of mouse brains while simultaneously serving as a headpost for fixation during scanning. Furthermore, this study provides a thorough acclimation method used to accustom animals to the MRI environment minimizing motion-induced artifacts. Using a 14 T scanner, high-resolution fMRI enabled brain-wide functional mapping of visual and vibrissa stimulation at 100 µm×100 µm×200 µm resolution with a 2 s per frame sampling rate. Besides activated ascending visual and vibrissa pathways, robust blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) responses were detected in the anterior cingulate cortex upon visual stimulation and spread through the ventral retrosplenial area (VRA) with vibrissa air-puff stimulation, demonstrating higher-order sensory processing in association cortices of awake mice. In particular, the rapid hemodynamic responses in VRA upon vibrissa stimulation showed a strong correlation with the hippocampus, thalamus, and prefrontal cortical areas. Cross-correlation analysis with designated VRA responses revealed early positive BOLD signals at the contralateral barrel cortex (BC) occurring 2 s prior to the air-puff in awake mice with repetitive stimulation, which was not detected using a randomized stimulation paradigm. This early BC activation indicated a learned anticipation through the vibrissa system and association cortices in awake mice under continuous exposure of repetitive air-puff stimulation. This work establishes a high-resolution awake mouse fMRI platform, enabling brain-wide functional mapping of sensory signal processing in higher association cortical areas.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93183">A high-throughput platform for single-molecule tracking identifies drug interaction and cellular mechanisms</a></h4>

              
                The regulation of cell physiology depends largely upon interactions of functionally distinct proteins and cellular components. These interactions may be transient or long-lived, but often affect protein motion. Measurement of protein dynamics within a cellular environment, particularly while perturbing protein function with small molecules, may enable dissection of key interactions and facilitate drug discovery; however, current approaches are limited by throughput with respect to data acquisition and analysis. As a result, studies using super-resolution imaging are typically drawing conclusions from tens of cells and a few experimental conditions tested. We addressed these limitations by developing a high-throughput single-molecule tracking (htSMT) platform for pharmacologic dissection of protein dynamics in living cells at an unprecedented scale (capable of imaging &gt;10<sup>6</sup> cells/day and screening &gt;10<sup>4</sup> compounds). We applied htSMT to measure the cellular dynamics of fluorescently tagged estrogen receptor (ER) and screened a diverse library to identify small molecules that perturbed ER function in real time. With this one experimental modality, we determined the potency, pathway selectivity, target engagement, and mechanism of action for identified hits. Kinetic htSMT experiments were capable of distinguishing between on-target and on-pathway modulators of ER signaling. Integrated pathway analysis recapitulated the network of known ER interaction partners and suggested potentially novel, kinase-mediated regulatory mechanisms. The sensitivity of htSMT revealed a new correlation between ER dynamics and the ability of ER antagonists to suppress cancer cell growth. Therefore, measuring protein motion at scale is a powerful method to investigate dynamic interactions among proteins and may facilitate the identification and characterization of novel therapeutics.

                Transcription factor partners can cooperatively bind to DNA composite elements to augment gene transcription. Here, we report a novel protein-DNA binding screening pipeline, termed Spacing Preference Identification of Composite Elements (SPICE), that can systematically predict protein binding partners and DNA motif spacing preferences. Using SPICE, we successfully identified known composite elements, such as AP1-IRF composite elements (AICEs) and STAT5 tetramers, and also uncovered several novel binding partners, including JUN-IKZF1 composite elements. One such novel interaction was identified at CNS9, an upstream conserved noncoding region in the human <i>IL10</i> gene, which harbors a non-canonical IKZF1 binding site. We confirmed the cooperative binding of JUN and IKZF1 and showed that the activity of an <i>IL10</i>-luciferase reporter construct in primary B and T cells depended on both this site and the AP1 binding site within this composite element. Overall, our findings reveal an unappreciated global association of IKZF1 and AP1 and establish SPICE as a valuable new pipeline for predicting novel transcription binding complexes.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98742">Nitric oxide modulates contrast suppression in a subset of mouse retinal ganglion cells</a></h4>

              
                Neuromodulators have major influences on the regulation of neural circuit activity across the nervous system. Nitric oxide (NO) has been shown to be a prominent neuromodulator in many circuits and has been extensively studied in the retina. Here, it has been associated with the regulation of light adaptation, gain control, and gap junctional coupling, but its effect on the retinal output, specifically on the different types of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), is still poorly understood. In this study, we used two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging and multi-electrode array (MEA) recordings to measure light-evoked activity of RGCs in the ganglion cell layer in the ex vivo mouse retina. This approach allowed us to investigate the neuromodulatory effects of NO on a cell type-level. Our findings reveal that NO selectively modulates the suppression of temporal responses in a distinct subset of contrast-suppressed RGC types, increasing their activity without altering the spatial properties of their receptive fields. Given that under photopic conditions, NO release is triggered by quick changes in light levels, we propose that these RGC types signal fast contrast changes to higher visual regions. Remarkably, we found that about one-third of the RGC types, recorded using two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging, exhibited consistent, cell type-specific adaptational response changes throughout an experiment, independent of NO. By employing a sequential-recording paradigm, we could disentangle those additional adaptational response changes from drug-induced modulations. Taken together, our research highlights the selective neuromodulatory effects of NO on RGCs and emphasizes the need of considering non-pharmacological activity changes, like adaptation, in such study designs.

">Revealing hidden knowledge in amnestic mice</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a form of dementia in which memory and cognitive decline is thought to arise from underlying neurodegeneration. These cognitive impairments, however, are transient when they first appear and can fluctuate across disease progression. Here, we investigate the neural mechanisms underlying fluctuations of performance in amnestic mice. We trained APP/PS1+ mice on an auditory go/no-go task that dissociated learning of task contingencies (knowledge) from its more variable expression under reinforcement (performance). APP/PS1+ exhibited significant performance deficits compared to control mice. Using large-scale two-photon imaging of 6,216 excitatory neurons in 8 mice, we found that auditory cortical networks were more suppressed, less selective to the sensory cues, and exhibited aberrant higher-order encoding of reward prediction compared to control mice. A small sub-population of neurons, however, displayed the opposite phenotype, reflecting a potential compensatory mechanism. Volumetric analysis demonstrated that deficits were concentrated near A{beta} plaques. Strikingly, we found that these cortical deficits were reversed almost instantaneously on probe (non-reinforced) trials when APP/PS1+ performed as well as control mice, providing neural evidence for intact stimulus-action knowledge despite variable ongoing performance. A biologically-plausible reinforcement learning model recapitulated these results and showed that synaptic weights from sensory-to-decision neurons were preserved (i.e. intact stimulus-action knowledge) despite poor performance that was due to inadequate contextual scaling (i.e. impaired performance). Our results suggest that the amnestic phenotype is transient, contextual, and endogenously reversible, with the underlying neural circuits retaining the underlying stimulus-action associations. Thus, memory deficits commonly observed in amnestic mouse models, and potentially at early stages of dementia in humans, relate more to contextual drivers of performance rather than degeneration of the underlying memory traces.

">Age-dependent alterations in the head-direction signal in a rat model of Fragile X Syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is a common monogenic cause of autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability (ASD/ID), but the neural mechanisms underlying its symptoms remain unclear. Here, we investigate the development of the head-direction (HD) system in a rat model of FXS (Fmr1-/y rats). Using high-density silicon probes, we recorded neuronal activity in the postsubiculum (PoSub), a cortical hub of the HD system, during exploration and sleep in juvenile and adult Fmr1-/y and wild-type (WT) rats. Juvenile Fmr1-/y rats exhibited enhanced HD tuning characterized by sharper directional tuning curves and improved stability of the HD signal in relation to the external environment. This enhancement was intrinsic to the HD circuit and persisted across behavioral and sleep states. However, by adulthood, HD tuning in Fmr1-/y rats became unstable, with increased drift in the allocentric reference frame despite intact intrinsic HD dynamics. These findings reveal a transient enhancement of spatial coding in the HD system of juvenile Fmr1-/y, followed by a degradation in adulthood, providing insights into network-level dysfunctions in FXS and their developmental trajectories. Overall, our work establishes the HD system as a valuable and tractable model for studying neurodevelopmental disorders.

">Spherical code of retinal orientation-selectivity enables decoding in ensembled and retinotopic operation</a></h4>

              
                Selectivity to orientations of edges is seen at the earliest stages of visual processing, in retinal orientation-selective ganglion cells (OSGCs), thought to prefer vertical or horizontal orientation. However, as stationary edges are projected on the hemispherical retina as lines of longitude or latitude, how edge orientation is encoded, and decoded by the brain, is unknown. Here, by mapping the OS of thousands of OSGCs at known retinal locations in mice, we identified three OSGC types whose preferences match two longitudinal fields, and a fourth type matching two latitudinal fields, the members of each field-pair being non-orthogonal. A geometric decoder revealed that two OS sensors yield optimal orientation decoding when approaching the deviation from orthogonality we observed for OSGC field-pairs. Retinotopically-organized decoding generated type-specific variation in decoding efficiency across the visual field. OS tuning was greater in the dorsal retina, possibly reflecting an evolutionary adaptation to an environmental gradient of edges.

">Hippocampal-cortical connectivity relates to inter-individual differences and training gains in distinguishing similar memories</a></h4>

              
                Mnemonic discrimination (MD) is the ability to distinguish current experiences from similar memories. Research on the brain correlates of MD has focused on how regional neural responses are linked to MD. Here we go beyond this approach to investigate inter-regional functional connectivity patterns related to MD, its inter-individual variability and training-related improvement. Based on prior work we focused on medial temporal lobe (MTL), prefrontal cortex (PFC) and visual regions. We used fMRI to determine how functional connectivity patterns between these regions are related to MD before and after 2-weeks of web-based cognitive training. We found that hippocampal-PFC connectivity was negatively associated with interindividual variability in MD performance across two different tasks. Hippocampal-PFC connectivity decrease was also linked to interindividual variability in post-training MD improvement. Additionally, training led to increased connectivity from the lateral occipital cortex to the occipital pole area. Our results point to a hippocampal-PFC connectivity pattern which is a reliable, task-invariant, marker of MD performance. This pattern is further related to MD training gains providing causal evidence for its relevance in distinguishing similar memories. Overall, we show that hippocampal-PFC connectivity constitutes a neural resource for MD that enables training-related improvements and could be targeted in future research to enhance cognition.

">Physiological and molecular impairment of PV circuit homeostasis in mouse models of autism</a></h4>

              
                Circuit dysfunction in autism may involve a failure of homeostatic plasticity. To test this, we studied parvalbumin (PV) interneurons which exhibit rapid homeostatic plasticity of intrinsic excitability following whisker deprivation in mouse somatosensory cortex. Brief deprivation reduces PV excitability by increasing Kv1 current to increase PV spike threshold. We found that PV homeostatic plasticity is disrupted in Tsc2+/- and Fmr1-/- models of autism. In wildtype mice, deprivation elevates the transcription factor ER81 which drives Kcna1 transcription, increasing Kv1.1 protein in the axon initial segment and soma. These molecular signatures of homeostasis were absent in Tsc2+/- and Fmr1-/-. Whisker enrichment increased PV excitability, but not in Tsc2+/-, indicating that homeostasis is lost bidirectionally. Deprivation reduced feedforward L4-L2/3 inhibition in wildtype but not Tsc2+/- mice. Thus, two autism models show a convergent loss of PV circuit homeostasis at physiological and molecular levels, potentially contributing to sensory processing impairments.

">Human hippocampal ripples predict the alignment of experience to a grid-like schema</a></h4>

              
                Humans create internal cognitive maps that allow us to make inferences beyond direct experience. These maps often rely on hexagonal grid-cell-like neural codes, serving as a schema for two-dimensional (2D) spaces. Yet it remains unclear how new experiences become aligned with this schema, especially in non-spatial contexts. Here, we show that hippocampal ripples - brief bursts of neuronal activity during rest - predict the emergence of grid-like codes in a novel 2D inference task. We recorded intracranial neuronal activity in 42 epilepsy patients as they learned rank relationships among feature objects (for example, objects differing in "magic" or "speed"). After learning, these objects were combined to form "compounds" occupying a 2D conceptual space defined by two feature dimensions. During learning, hippocampal ripple activity increased during pauses between trials, suggesting that ripples integrated newly acquired information offline. Subsequently, ripple activity during post-learning rest predicted the later emergence of grid-like codes in the entorhinal cortex (EC) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a core region of the default mode network (DMN), when participants inferred unseen relationships among the compounds. Critically, coordination during rest between hippocampal ripples and DMN activity in the mPFC predicted participants ability to infer complex relationships beyond direct memory retrieval. These findings provide the first direct evidence that hippocampal ripples, working with the DMN, align new experiences with a grid-like schema offline, transforming discrete learning events into structured knowledge that supports flexible and adaptive reasoning in human cognition.

">Two independent translocation modes drive neural stem cell dissemination into the human fetal cortex</a></h4>

              
                The strong size increase of the human neocortex is supported both by the amplification and the basal translocation of a neural stem cell population, the basal radial glial cells (or bRG cells). Using live imaging of second trimester human fetal tissue and cortical organoids, we identify two independent translocation modes for bRG cell colonization of the human neocortex. On top of an actomyosin-dependent movement called mitotic somal translocation (MST), we identify a microtubule-dependent motion occurring during interphase, that we call interphasic somal translocation (IST). We show that IST is driven by the LINC complex, through the nuclear envelope recruitment of the dynein motor and of its activator LIS1. Consequently, IST severely altered in LIS1 patient-derived cortical organoids. We also demonstrate that MST occurs during prometaphase and is a mitotic spindle translocation event. MST is controlled by the mitotic cell rounding molecular pathway, via Moesin and Vimentin, driving translocation. We report that 85% of bRG cell translocation is due to IST, for a total movement of 0,67 mm per month of human fetal gestation. Our work identifies how bRG cells colonize the human fetal cortex, and further shows that IST and MST are conserved in bRG-related migrating glioblastoma cells.

">Temporal recurrence as a general mechanism toexplain neural responses in the auditory system</a></h4>

              
                Computational models of neural processing in the auditory cortex usually ignore that neurons have an internal memory: they characterize their responses from simple convolutions with a finite temporal window of arbitrary duration. To circumvent this limitation, we propose here a new, simple and fully recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture incorporating cutting-edge computational blocks from the deep learning community and constituting the first attempt to model auditory responses with deep RNNs. We evaluated the ability of this approach to fit neural responses from 8 publicly available datasets, spanning 3 animal species and 6 auditory brain areas, representing the largest compilation of this kind. Our recurrent models significantly outperform previous methods and a new Transformerbased architecture of our design on this task, suggesting that temporal recurrence is the key to explain auditory responses. Finally, we developed a novel interpretation technique to reverse-engineer any pretrained model, regardless of their stateful or stateless nature. Largely inspired by works from explainable artificial intelligence (xAI), our method suggests that auditory neurons have much longer memory (several seconds) than indicated by current STRF techniques. Together, these results highly motivate the use of deep RNNs within computational models of sensory neurons, as protean building blocks capable of assuming any function.

">Unlocking information alignment between interacting brains with EEG hyperscanning</a></h4>

              
                Social interactions shape our perception of the world as the people we interact with, and groups we belong to, influence how we interpret incoming information. Alignment between interacting individuals sensory and cognitive processes plays a critical role in facilitating cooperation and communication in everyday joint activities. However, despite recent advances in hyperscanning techniques to measure the brain activity of multiple people simultaneously, the neural processes underlying this alignment remain unknown. Here, we leveraged Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) with electroencephalography (EEG) hyperscanning data to measure neural representations and uncover the emergence of information alignment between interacting individuals brains during joint visual categorisation. We recorded EEG from 24 pairs of participants sitting back-to-back while they performed a 4-way categorisation task based on rules they first agreed upon together. The results revealed significant interbrain information alignment as early as 45 ms after stimulus presentation, lasting over hundreds of milliseconds. Importantly, early alignment between brains arose between 45 and 180 ms regardless of whether participants performed the task together or were randomly matched up a posteriori to form pseudo pairs, whereas alignment after 200 ms was only present for real pairs who previously formed the categories together. This result distinguishes alignment that was socially induced by pre-agreed and shared interpretation of the stimuli from alignment that was purely evoked by shared sensory responses due to participants seeing the same visual input. In addition, our results showed that socially induced alignment was an active and dynamic process, which strengthened over time with practice and reinforcement of shared agreements, but appeared to remain largely task specific with no transfer during passive viewing of the same stimuli. Together, these findings highlight distinct sensory evoked and socially induced processes underpinning human perception and interbrain information alignment during social interactions that can be effectively captured and disentangled with Interbrain RSA.

	<p>Acute vertigo or dizziness is a frequent presentation to the emergency department (ED), making up between 2.1% and 4.4% of all consultations. Given the nature of the ED where the priority is triage, diagnostic delays and misdiagnoses are common, with as many as a third of vertebrobasilar strokes presenting with acute vertigo or dizziness being missed. Here, we review diagnostic errors identified in the evaluation and treatment of the acutely dizzy patient and discuss strategies to overcome them. Lessons learned include focusing on structured history taking, asking about timing and triggers to inform a targeted examination, assessing subtle ocular motor findings (e.g., by use of HINTS(+)), and avoiding overreliance on brain imaging (including early magnetic resonance imaging including diffusion-weighted sequences [DWI-MRI]). Importantly, up to 20% of DWI-MRI may be false negatives if obtained within the first 24&amp;amp;ndash;48 h after symptom onset. Likewise, overreliance on focal neurologic findings to confirm a stroke diagnosis should be avoided because isolated dizziness, vertigo, or even unsteadiness may be the only symptoms in some patients with vertebrobasilar stroke. Furthermore, in patients with triggered episodic vestibular symptoms provocation maneuvers should be preferred over HINTS(+), and a potential diagnosis of stroke should not be immediately dismissed in younger patients presenting with a headache (where migraine may be more common), but the possibility of a vertebral artery dissection should be further evaluated. Importantly, moderate training of non-experts allows for significant improvement in diagnostic accuracy in the acutely dizzy patient and thus should be prioritized.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: A neurobiological framework of bi- or multilingual neurocognitive development must consider the following: (i) longitudinal behavioral and neural measures; (ii) brain developmental constraints across structure and function; and (iii) the development of global multilingual competence in a homogeneous social environment. In this study, we investigated whether multilingual competence yields early changes in executive attention control mechanisms and their underlying neural structures in the frontal&amp;amp;ndash;striatal system, such as the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex/pre-supplemental area and the left caudate. Methods: We employed longitudinal neuroimaging and functional connectivity methods in a small group of multilingual children over two years. Results: We found that the dACC/preSMA is functionally influenced by changes in multilingual competence but not yet structurally adapted, while the left caudate, in a developmental stage, is influenced, adapts, and specializes due to multilingual experience. Furthermore, increases in multilingual competence strengthen connections between the dACC/preSMA, left caudate, and other structures of the cognitive control network, such as the right inferior frontal gyrus and bilateral inferior parietal lobules. Conclusions: These findings suggest that multilingual competence impacts brain &amp;amp;ldquo;adaptation&amp;amp;rdquo; and &amp;amp;ldquo;specialization&amp;amp;rdquo; during childhood. The results may provide insights and guide future research on experience-expectant and experience-dependent brain plasticity to explain the &amp;amp;ldquo;interaction&amp;amp;rdquo; between multilingualism and neurodevelopment.</p>

                <p>Status epilepticus (SE) links to high mortality and morbidity. Considering the neuroprotective property of baicalein (BA), we investigated its effects on post-SE neuronal injury via the NLRP3/GSDMD pathway. Mice were subjected to SE modeling and BA interference, with seizure severity and learning and memory abilities evaluated. The histological changes, neurological injury and neuron-specific enolase (NSE)-positive cell number in hippocampal CA1 region, and cell death were assessed. Levels of the NOD-, LRR-, and pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3)/gasdermin-D (GSDMD) pathway-related proteins, inflammatory factors, and Iba-1 + NLRP3+ and Iba-1 + GSDMD-N+ cells were determined. BA ameliorated post-SE cognitive dysfunction and neuronal injury in mice, as evidenced by shortened escape latency, increased number of crossing the target quadrant within 60&nbsp;s and the time staying in the target quadrant, alleviated hippocampal damage, increased viable cell number, decreased neuronal injury, and increased NSE-positive cells. Mechanistically, BA repressed microglial pyroptosis, reduced inflammatory factor release, and attenuated neuronal injury by inhibiting the NLRP3/GSDMD pathway. The NLRP3 inhibitor exerted similar effects as BA on SE mice, while the NLRP3 activator partially reversed BA-improved post-SE neuronal injury in mice. Conjointly, BA reduced microglial pyroptosis in hippocampal CA1 area by inhibiting the NLRP3/GSDMD pyroptosis pathway, thereby ameliorating post-SE neuronal injury in mice.</p>

[version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction A major obstacle in understanding the relationship between diet and non-communicable diseases (NCDs) lies in the subjectivity and the bias in traditional dietary intake assessment methods. Food diaries, 24-hour food recall interviews, and food frequency questionnaires (FFQ) result in under- and over-reporting of nutrient and energy intake, compromising the accuracy of studies linking diet to NCDs. The emergence of image classification technology has facilitated a new approach to dietary intake assessment which addresses the subjective limitations associated with traditional self-reporting methods. Furthermore, a need to integrate multi-omics and advanced health analyses to comprehensively characterise NCD risk presents an opportunity to combine a range of technologies to better understand diet-induced NCD. Method This observational study will adopt an enhanced surveillance method, whereby we will utilise wearable cameras and activity monitors to record dietary intake, physical activity, and sleep. Participants will wear these for 3 separate one-week periods at home (with a 2 and 3-week break in between each period). At the end of each monitoring period, participants will attend a study visit at the clinical research facility, where they will undergo body composition assessments, as well as cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk and autonomic nervous system health analysis using state-of-the-art technologies that measure Advanced Glycation End products (AGE) and accelerated photoplethysmography (APG). At the end of the first and last monitoring period, participants will also provide blood, urine, stool, and breath samples, and an in-depth interview will also be conducted during the final visit to assess participants’ perceptions towards the novel technologies. The study parameters will be integrated to advance our insights into how diet intricately influences the mechanisms underlying NCDs.

                Alternative splicing is crucial in gene regulation, with significant implications in clinical settings and biotechnology. This review article compiles bioinformatics RNA-seq tools for investigating differential splicing; offering a detailed examination of their statistical methods, case applications, and benefits. A total of 22 tools are categorised by their statistical family (parametric, non-parametric, and probabilistic) and level of analysis (transcript, exon, and event). The central challenges in quantifying alternative splicing include correct splice site identification and accurate isoform deconvolution of transcripts. Benchmarking studies show no consensus on tool performance, revealing considerable variability across different scenarios. Tools with high citation frequency and continued developer maintenance, such as DEXSeq and rMATS, are recommended for prospective researchers. To aid in tool selection, a guide schematic is proposed based on variations in data input and the required level of analysis. Additionally, advancements in long-read RNA sequencing are expected to drive the evolution of differential splicing tools, reducing the need for isoform deconvolution and prompting further innovation.

                <p>by José María Salazar Campos, Lena F. Burbulla, Sarah Jäkel</p>

The major pathological feature of Parkinson ‘s disease (PD), the second most common neurodegenerative disease and most common movement disorder, is the predominant degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, a part of the midbrain. Despite decades of research, the molecular mechanisms of the origin of the disease remain unknown. While the disease was initially viewed as a purely neuronal disorder, results from single-cell transcriptomics have suggested that oligodendrocytes may play an important role in the early stages of Parkinson’s. Although these findings are of high relevance, particularly to the search for effective disease-modifying therapies, the actual functional role of oligodendrocytes in Parkinson’s disease remains highly speculative and requires a concerted scientific effort to be better understood. This Unsolved Mystery discusses the limited understanding of oligodendrocytes in PD, highlighting unresolved questions regarding functional changes in oligodendroglia, the role of myelin in nigral dopaminergic neurons, the impact of the toxic environment, and the aggregation of alpha-synuclein within oligodendrocytes.

                <p>by Jeff Maltas, Anh Huynh, Kevin B. Wood</p>

As failure rates for traditional antimicrobial therapies escalate, recent focus has shifted to evolution-based therapies to slow resistance. Collateral sensitivity—the increased susceptibility to one drug associated with evolved resistance to a different drug—offers a potentially exploitable evolutionary constraint, but the manner in which collateral effects emerge over time is not well understood. Here, we use laboratory evolution in the opportunistic pathogen <i>Enterococcus faecalis</i> to phenotypically characterize collateral profiles through evolutionary time. Specifically, we measure collateral profiles for 400 strain-antibiotic combinations over the course of 4 evolutionary time points as strains are selected in increasing concentrations of antibiotic. We find that at a global level—when results from all drugs are combined—collateral resistance dominates during early phases of adaptation, when resistance to the selecting drug is lower, while collateral sensitivity becomes increasingly likely with further selection. At the level of individual populations; however, the trends are idiosyncratic; for example, the frequency of collateral sensitivity to ceftriaxone increases over time in isolates selected by linezolid but decreases in isolates selected by ciprofloxacin. We then show experimentally how dynamic collateral sensitivity relationships can lead to time-dependent dosing windows that depend on finely timed switching between drugs. Finally, we develop a stochastic mathematical model based on a Markov decision process consistent with observed dynamic collateral profiles to show measurements across time are required to optimally constrain antibiotic resistance.

                <p>by Weifeng Dai, Tian Wang, Yang Li, Yi Yang, Yange Zhang, Yujie Wu, Tingting Zhou, Hongbo Yu, Liang Li, Yizheng Wang, Gang Wang, Dajun Xing</p>

Sensitivity to motion direction is a feature of visual neurons that is essential for motion perception. Recent studies have suggested that direction selectivity is re-established at multiple stages throughout the visual hierarchy, which contradicts the traditional assumption that direction selectivity in later stages largely derives from that in earlier stages. By recording laminar responses in areas 17 and 18 of anesthetized cats of both sexes, we aimed to understand how direction selectivity is processed and relayed across 2 successive stages: the input layers and the output layers within the early visual cortices. We found a strong relationship between the strength of direction selectivity in the output layers and the input layers, as well as the preservation of preferred directions across the input and output layers. Moreover, direction selectivity was enhanced in the output layers compared to the input layers, with the response strength maintained in the preferred direction but reduced in other directions and under blank stimuli. We identified a direction-tuned gain mechanism for interlaminar signal transmission, which likely originated from both feedforward connections across the input and output layers and recurrent connections within the output layers. This direction-tuned gain, coupled with nonlinearity, contributed to the enhanced direction selectivity in the output layers. Our findings suggest that direction selectivity in later cortical stages partially inherits characteristics from earlier cortical stages and is further refined by intracortical connections.

In recent preclinical studies, dysregulation of INs in the mPFC has been implicated in the pathophysiology of substance use disorder, characterized by vulnerability to chronic drug use. Here, we explore the diversity of mPFC INs and their connectivity and roles in vulnerability to addiction. We also discuss how these INs change over time with drug exposure. Finally, we focus on noninvasive brain stimulation as a therapeutic approach for targeting INs in substance use disorder, highlighting its potential to restore neural circuits.

                Introduction Fluimucil, also known as N-acetylcysteine (NAC), has been used as a medicinal drug for treating Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease. Recent research has shown NAC’s potential as a neuroprotective agent, preventing oxidative damage and promoting neurodegenerative treatment. This study conducted bibliometric analysis of articles related to NAC use, identifying research trends, current trends, and correlations between research and institutions. The findings can help identify unpublished research and guide future research strategies. This research not only provides public interest in NAC research but also offers valuable insights for future research. Methods In this work, a literature review methodology is employed to gather data from the Scopus database using the keywords fluimucil, nac, n-acetylcystein, and neuroprotective. Data were analyzed using Biblioshiny and VOSviewer software to produce visualizations and bibliometric maps. We conducted quantitative and qualitative analysis. Results The research trend found are Documents by Year, Documents by Author, Documents by Affiliations, Documents by country or territory, Documents by funding sponsor, Factorial Map Of The Documents With The Highest Contributes, Documents by Subject Area, Network Visualization, Overlay visualization of scopus database using Vosviewer, Density Visualization, Thematic Map, and Qualitative Analysis. Conclusions Research on the neuroprotective effects of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) or fluimucil has several limitations and strengths. It uses quantitative and qualitative analysis to identify research trends and mechanisms of NAC action. However, the data may be biased and the methodology may differ. The study has significant potential for future research, particularly in treating neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson and Alzheimer. It also contributes to the understanding of NAC mechanisms.

                Background Cervical spondylosis is the common degenerative disease of the vertebrae in adults which can lead to change in sagittal alignment of cervical spine. Radiograph and Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are widely used imaging modalities for measuring the sagittal parameters. However sagittal parameters measured using radiograph and MRI can be influence by patient positioning and imaging technique. The study aims to compare sagittal parameters measured using MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) and radiograph in cervical spondylosis patients. Methods The study was done retrospectively. 77 patients who underwent both MRI and radiograph were included in the study. The sagittal parameters such as Neck Tilt (NT), T1 slope (T1S), thoracic inlet angle (TIA), C2-C7 angle (C2-C7A) and C2-C7 sagittal vertical axis (C2-C7 SVA) were measured on sagittal MRI and lateral cervical spine radiograph. Paired t-test was used to compare cervical sagittal measurements between MRI and radiography. Results The cervical sagittal parameters such as NT, T1S, TIA and C2-7 SVA showed significant difference between MRI and radiograph (p < 0.05). But C2-C7A did not show significant difference (p > 0.05) Conclusion The study concludes that MRI cannot be used as an alternative to cervical spine radiograph in spondylosis patient for measuring the sagittal balance as there was significant difference between sagittal parameters except C2-C7 A.

                The role of posture in spinal pain is unclear which might be linked to characteristics of postural outcome measures. This systematic scoping review mapped the clinical utility of postural outcome tools for spinal pain. Following Joanna Briggs Institute framework, twelve bibliographic databases were searched until 8th August 2023. Article selection, characterisation/mapping and synthesis using qualitative content analysis were performed by two independent reviewers. Clinical utility was defined by psychometric and clinimetric criteria. 85 eligible studies were identified from 89 publications. Twenty-eight distinct postural outcome tools plus bespoke measures were identified. Most tools were sophisticated computer-based electronic devices or complex time-consuming questionnaires, with limited applicability in non-occupational settings. Clinical utility domains most achieved were construct validity and inter/intra-rater reliability. Tools being underpinned by the biopsychosocial model of pain, sensitivity to clinical change, and predictive validity were the least achieved. Tools had limited clinical utility and were based on postural-structural-biomechanical pain model.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-43/v1?src=rss">Income-Based analysis of health security in Western Asia through an integrated GHSI, MCDM, and Clustering Model [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Objectives Infectious diseases present significant challenges to global health security in contemporary, interconnected global environments. This study aimed to evaluate and compare health security performance in Western Asia (WA), with a focus on income group-based disparities and region-specific insights. Methods This study utilized the Global Health Security Index (GHSI) to assess health security across 17 WA countries categorized by income level. Health security indicators for 2019 and 2021 were analyzed using the D-CRITIC method to determine the relative importance of each indicator (Global Health Security Index, 2021): https://ghsindex.org/report-model/). A combined D-CRITIC-CoCoSo framework was employed to rank the countries, followed by K-means clustering for grading. The study also investigated correlations between financial allocation’s indicators and health security outcomes using Spearman’s rank correlation. A comparative analysis elucidated regional disparities across income categories. Results This study highlights WA’s progress in health security by prioritizing foundational health systems, detection/reporting, rapid response, and risk management. From 2019 to 2021, priorities varied by income group, with high-income countries focusing on detection, upper-middle-income countries focusing on risk environments, and low-income countries focusing on prevention. While some nations demonstrated improvement, others, such as Armenia, experienced decline, revealing persistent vulnerabilities. This study revealed significant variability in health security capacity, with both progress and setbacks among countries in different clusters. High- and upper-middle-income countries, such as Qatar and Georgia, leverage investments and international partnerships to improve their rankings, while conflict-affected, low-resource countries, including Iraq, Yemen, and Syria, face stagnation or decline. Strong correlations were observed between financial resource allocation indicators and health performance. Higher investments in countries like Armenia and Georgia led to significantly improved health outcomes, while minimal spending in Syria and Yemen weakened their resilience to health threats. Conclusion Disparities in health resilience persist, underscoring the need for equitable resource allocation and regional cooperation to enhance public health security.

                Background It is uncommon to develop vision-threatening orbital cellulitis with panophthalmitis during pregnancy. Typically, the reasons are trauma-related or endogenous. It requires immediate diagnosis and treatment, but this has proven difficult because of local and systemic medications’ safety and adverse effects during pregnancy. Globe salvage has a poor prognosis, with most patients undergoing enucleation or evisceration of the diseased eye. Case presentation We presented a 22-year-old woman in her third trimester of pregnancy who encountered orbital cellulitis with panophthalmitis caused by methicillin-positive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). Despite rigorous intravenous and topical antibiotics, she underwent evisceration of the affected eye. However, the pregnancy, progressed without incident, with the delivery of a healthy baby at full-term. Conclusion Bacterial infection is uncommon during pregnancy, but may cause endogenous panophthalmitis and orbital cellulitis, especially in immunosuppression and anemia, with a poor visual outcome.

                Background Diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) in resource-limited countries relies primarily on bacteriological confirmation using Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) stain on sputum or other representative samples. However, this method has low sensitivity due to suboptimal sampling and techniques. While AFB culture remains a gold standard for diagnosing TB and other mycobacterial infections, its limitations include slow turnaround time, and the requirement for specialized resources and expertise. Neutrophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes are crucial in the pathogenesis of granulomatous inflammation and immune reactions. We investigated the usefulness of the haematological parameters and their ratios, like the Neutrophil to Lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and Monocyte to Lymphocyte ratio (MLR), for diagnosing tuberculosis. Methods We retrospectively grouped 114 patients with fever into those diagnosed with TB and control groups. We obtained their haematological data and calculated their derived ratios. The ratios obtained from the two groups were compared. Their sensitivity and specificity were calculated. Results Haematological parameters like MLR were higher in TB patients than in the control group. Although NLR was not significantly increased, MLR was significantly increased with p values <0.05. These tests had low sensitivity but high specificity. Conclusion Serum NLR and MLR emerge as valuable tools in TB diagnosis. Their simplicity and cost-effectiveness render them particularly suitable for screening and recurrence monitoring in rural and remote settings, thereby mitigating loss to follow-up.

                <p>Transient focal neurological episodes (TFNE), often associated with convexity subarachnoid hemorrhage (cSAH), are common in cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), but their pathophysiology remains incompletely understood. In six patients with unremitting TFNE, using high-resolution post-contrast magnetic resonance imaging and vessel wall imaging (VWI), we found various combinations of transient leptomeningeal, parenchymal and vessel wall enhancement; in 5 of 6 the enhancement included regions corresponding anatomically to symptoms. Three patients had resolution of TFNE and enhancement (2 with corticosteroid treatment, 1 without). Our observations suggest that inflammation might contribute to the pathophysiology of CAA-related TFNE and cSAH, with potential wider relevance for the associated high risks of recurrent ICH in CAA more generally.
