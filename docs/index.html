                In Japanese language education, the term "learning environment" is used in various contexts. This paper investigates the term "learning environment" in previous studies and notes that traditional learning environments have been characterized as "morphological characteristics learning environments" focusing on static learners. However, since learning environments involve a dynamic, reciprocal relationship where learners and their surroundings interact and evolve, the paper advocates for a re-conceptualization of "experiential-ecological learning environments" that captures this dynamic nature. Furthermore, to enrich the experiential-ecological learning environment for learners, the presence of learning environment engineers and the meaningful valuing of environmental enrichments is essential. Lastly, the paper emphasizes that by combining various individual learning experiences, it is possible to create a sustainable and richer learning environment.

Abstract: The insufficient supervision limit the performance of the deep supervised models for brain disease diagnosis. It is important to develop a learning framework that can capture more information in limited data and insufficient supervision. To address these issues at some extend, we propose a multi-stage graph learning framework which incorporates 1) pretrain stage : self-supervised graph learning on insufficient supervision of the fmri data 2) fine-tune stage : supervised graph learning for brain disorder diagnosis. Experiment results on three datasets, Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange ABIDE I, ABIDE II and ADHD with AAL1,demonstrating the superiority and generalizability of the proposed framework compared to the state of art of models.(ranging from 0.7330 to 0.9321,0.7209 to 0.9021,0.6338 to 0.6699)

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05747">Closed-Loop phase selection in EEG-TMS using Bayesian Optimization</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.05747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research on transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) combined with encephalography feedback (EEG-TMS) has shown that the phase of the sensorimotor mu rhythm is predictive of corticospinal excitability. Thus, if the subject-specific optimal phase is known, stimulation can be timed to be more efficient. In this paper, we present a closed-loop algorithm to determine the optimal phase linked to the highest excitability with few trials. We used Bayesian optimization as an automated, online search tool in an EEG-TMS simulation experiment. From a sample of 38 participants, we selected all participants with a significant single-subject phase effect (N = 5) for simulation. We then simulated 1000 experimental sessions per participant where we used Bayesian optimization to find the optimal phase. We tested two objective functions: Fitting a sinusoid in Bayesian linear regression or Gaussian Process (GP) regression. We additionally tested adaptive sampling using a knowledge gradient as the acquisition function compared with random sampling. We evaluated the algorithm's performance in a fast optimization (100 trials) and a long-term optimization (1000 trials). For fast optimization, the Bayesian linear regression in combination with adaptive sampling gives the best results with a mean phase location accuracy of 79 % after 100 trials. With either sampling approach, Bayesian linear regression performs better than GP regression in the fast optimization. In the long-term optimization, Bayesian regression with random sampling shows the best trajectory, with a rather steep improvement and good final performance of 87 % mean phase location accuracy. We show the suitability of closed-loop Bayesian optimization for phase selection. We could increase the speed and accuracy by using prior knowledge about the expected function shape compared with traditional Bayesian optimization with GP regression.

                arXiv:2410.05841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of small amplitude electric currents delivered through the scalp, termed transcranial current stimulation (tCS, tDCS / tACS when using DC / AC currents) holds considerable promise for developing safe and effective treatments for central nervous system disorders. Initially welcomed with skepticism due to significant gaps of knowledge in terms of neurophysiology and biophysical mechanisms, tCS is maturing as a technology while its mechanisms of action are gradually being elucidated. However, there remain open questions about the mechanisms of action that warrant clarification to bring tCS to its full potential. In this review focused on tACS, we make an attempt at providing an overview of the converging experimental evidence, from results obtained in various species, regarding the mechanisms of action. We also highlight the remaining points of uncertainty regarding potential confounds, and propose possible experimentally testable solutions to address those issues. Finally, we outline how a continued focus on deepening our understanding of tACS mechanisms might provide significant insights into fundamental, long-standing questions in neuroscience.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05972">Node-reconfiguring multilayer networks of human brain function</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.05972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The properties of functional brain networks are heavily influenced by how the network nodes are defined. A common approach uses Regions of Interest (ROIs), which are predetermined collections of fMRI measurement voxels, as network nodes. Their definition is always a compromise, as static ROIs cannot capture the dynamics and the temporal reconfigurations of the brain areas. Consequently, the ROIs do not align with the functionally homogeneous regions, which can explain the very low functional homogeneity values observed for the ROIs. This is in violation of the underlying homogeneity assumption in functional brain network analysis pipelines and it can cause serious problems such as spurious network structure. We introduce the node-reconfiguring multilayer network model, where nodes represent ROIs with boundaries optimized for high functional homogeneity in each time window. In this representation, network layers correspond to time windows, intralayer links depict functional connectivity between ROIs, and interlayer link weights quantify overlap between ROIs on different layers.The ROI optimization approach increases functional homogeneity notably, yielding an over 10-fold increase in the fraction of ROIs with high homogeneity compared to static ROIs from the Brainnetome atlas. The optimized ROIs reorganize non-trivially at short time scales of consecutive time windows and across several windows. The amount of reorganization across time windows is connected to intralayer hubness: ROIs that show intermediate levels of reorganization have stronger intralayer links than extremely stable or unstable ROIs. Our results demonstrate that reconfiguring parcellations yield more accurate network models of brain function. This supports the ongoing paradigm shift towards the chronnectome that sees the brain as a set of sources with continuously reconfiguring spatial and connectivity profiles.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06517">Dynamics of Adaptive Continuous Attractor Neural Networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.06517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attractor neural networks consider that neural information is stored as stationary states of a dynamical system formed by a large number of interconnected neurons. The attractor property empowers a neural system to encode information robustly, but it also incurs the difficulty of rapid update of network states, which can impair information update and search in the brain. To overcome this difficulty, a solution is to include adaptation in the attractor network dynamics, whereby the adaptation serves as a slow negative feedback mechanism to destabilize which are otherwise permanently stable states. In such a way, the neural system can, on one hand, represent information reliably using attractor states, and on the other hand, perform computations wherever rapid state updating is involved. Previous studies have shown that continuous attractor neural networks with adaptation (A-CANNs) exhibits rich dynamical behaviors accounting for various brain functions. In this paper, we present a comprehensive view of the rich diverse dynamics of A-CANNs. Moreover, we provide a unified mathematical framework to understand these different dynamical behaviors, and briefly discuss about their biological implications.

                arXiv:2410.06534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural biomarkers that can classify or predict disease are of broad interest to the neurological and psychiatric communities. Such biomarkers can be informative of disease state or treatment efficacy, even before there are changes in symptoms and/or behavior. This work investigates EEG-estimated functional connectivity (FC) as a Parkinson's Disease (PD) biomarker. Specifically, we investigate FC mediated via neural oscillations and consider such activity during the Simons conflict task. This task yields sensory-motor conflict, and one might expect differences in behavior between PD patients and healthy controls (HCs). In addition to considering spatially focused approaches, such as FC, as a biomarker, we also consider temporal biomarkers, which are more sensitive to ongoing changes in neural activity. We find that FC, estimated from delta (1-4Hz) and theta (4-7Hz) oscillations, yields spatial FC patterns significantly better at distinguishing PD from HC than temporal features or behavior. This study reinforces that FC in spectral bands is informative of differences in brain-wide processes and can serve as a biomarker distinguishing normal brain function from that seen in disease.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06633">On the Minimal Theory of Consciousness Implicit in Active Inference</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2410.06633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multifaceted nature of experience poses a challenge to the study of consciousness. Traditional neuroscientific approaches often concentrate on isolated facets, such as perceptual awareness or the global state of consciousness and construct a theory around the relevant empirical paradigms and findings. Theories of consciousness are, therefore, often difficult to compare; indeed, there might be little overlap in the phenomena such theories aim to explain. Here, we take a different approach: starting with active inference, a first principles framework for modelling behaviour as (approximate) Bayesian inference, and building up to a minimal theory of consciousness, which emerges from the shared features of computational models derived under active inference. We review a body of work applying active inference models to the study of consciousness and argue that there is implicit in all these models a small set of theoretical commitments that point to a minimal (and testable) theory of consciousness.

                arXiv:2410.06739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anatomical connectivity between different regions in the brain can be mapped to a network representation, the connectome, where the intensities of the links, the weights, influence its structural resilience and the functional processes it sustains. Yet, many features associated with the weights in the human brain connectome are not fully understood, particularly their multiscale organization. In this paper, we elucidate the architecture of weights, including weak ties, in multiscale hierarchical human brain connectomes reconstructed from empirical data. Our findings reveal multiscale self-similarity in the weighted statistical properties, including the ordering of weak ties, that remain consistent across the analyzed length scales of every individual and the group representatives. This phenomenon is effectively captured by a renormalization of the weighted structure applied to hyperbolic embeddings of the connectomes, based on a unique weighted geometric model that integrates links of all weights across all length scales. This eliminates the need for separate generative weighted connectivity rules for each scale or to replicate weak and strong ties at specific scales in brain connectomes. The observed symmetry represents a distinct signature of criticality in the weighted connectivity of human brain connectomes, aligning with the fractality observed in their topology, and raises important questions for future research, like the existence of a resolution threshold where the observed symmetry breaks, or whether it is preserved in cases of neurodegenerative disease or psychiatric disorder.

Abstract: We propose a model for diagnosing Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) using multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. Our approach integrates brain connectivity data from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and functional MRI (fMRI), employing graph neural networks (GNNs) for fused graph classification. To improve diagnostic accuracy, we introduce a loss function that maximizes inter-class and minimizes intra-class margins. We also analyze network node centrality, calculating degree, subgraph, and eigenvector centralities on a bimodal fused brain graph to identify pathological regions linked to ASD. Two non-parametric tests assess the statistical significance of these centralities between ASD patients and healthy controls. Our results reveal consistency between the tests, yet the identified regions differ significantly across centralities, suggesting distinct physiological interpretations. These findings enhance our understanding of ASD's neurobiological basis and offer new directions for clinical diagnosis.

                arXiv:2410.05294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-Other Reorganization (SOR) is a theory of how interacting entities or individuals, each of which can be described as an autocatalytic network, collectively exhibit cumulative, adaptive, open-ended change, or evolution. Zachar et al.'s critique of SOR stems from misunderstandings; it does not weaken the arguments in (Gabora & Steel, 2021). The formal framework of Reflexively Autocatalytic and foodset-derived sets (RAFs) enables us to model the process whereby, through their interactions, a set of elements become a 'collective self.' SOR shows how the RAF setting provides a means of encompassing abiogenesis and cultural evolution under the same explanatory framework and provides a plausible explanation for the origins of both evolutionary processes. Although SOR allows for detrimental stimuli (and products), there is (naturally) limited opportunity for elements that do not contribute to or reinforce a RAF to become part of it. Replication and cumulative, adaptive change in RAFs is well-established in the literature. Contrary to Zachar et al., SOR is not a pure percolation model (such as SIR); it encompasses not only learning (modeled as assimilation of foodset elements) but also creative restructuring (modeled as generation of foodset-derived elements), as well as the emergence of new structures made possible by new foodset- and foodset-derived elements. Cultural SOR is robust to degradation, and imperfect replication. Zachar et al.'s simulation contains no RAFs, and does not model SOR.

Abstract: Learning shared structure across environments facilitates rapid learning and adaptive behavior in neural systems. This has been widely demonstrated and applied in machine learning to train models that are capable of generalizing to novel settings. However, there has been limited work exploiting the shared structure in neural activity during similar tasks for learning latent dynamics from neural recordings. Existing approaches are designed to infer dynamics from a single dataset and cannot be readily adapted to account for statistical heterogeneities across recordings. In this work, we hypothesize that similar tasks admit a corresponding family of related solutions and propose a novel approach for meta-learning this solution space from task-related neural activity of trained animals. Specifically, we capture the variabilities across recordings on a low-dimensional manifold which concisely parametrizes this family of dynamics, thereby facilitating rapid learning of latent dynamics given new recordings. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on few-shot reconstruction and forecasting of synthetic dynamical systems, and neural recordings from the motor cortex during different arm reaching tasks.

Abstract: This manuscript proposes a conceptual hypothesis regarding the ontology of information, which can serve as a foundation for future empirical exploration and theoretical development. Starting from the premise that information consists of a structural pattern of matter and analysing the current understanding of the evolution of structures and complexity in the universe, we propose to redefine information as a physical structure capable of evolving and driving complexity across multiple layers of self-organization - biological, cultural, civilizational, and cybernetic. The perspective highlights how information structures replicate, vary, and evolve across different domains, speculating on the emergence of a cybernetic layer where machines could evolve autonomously. This interdisciplinary framework challenges traditional views of information and encourages further research into its role in shaping the structures of the universe, offering a new perspective on the evolution of complexity across both natural and artificial systems.

                arXiv:2103.13860v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ability to plan ahead efficiently is key for both living organisms and artificial systems. Model-based planning and prospection are widely studied in cognitive neuroscience and artificial intelligence (AI), but from different perspectives--and with different desiderata in mind (biological realism versus scalability) that are difficult to reconcile. Here, we introduce a novel method to plan in POMDPs--Active Inference Tree Search (AcT)--that combines the normative character and biological realism of a leading planning theory in neuroscience (Active Inference) and the scalability of tree search methods in AI. This unification enhances both approaches. On the one hand, tree searches enable the biologically grounded, first principle method of active inference to be applied to large-scale problems. On the other hand, active inference provides a principled solution to the exploration-exploitation dilemma, which is often addressed heuristically in tree search methods. Our simulations show that AcT successfully navigates binary trees that are challenging for sampling-based methods, problems that require adaptive exploration, and the large POMDP problem 'RockSample'--in which AcT reproduces state-of-the-art POMDP solutions. Furthermore, we illustrate how AcT can be used to simulate neurophysiological responses (e.g., in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex) of humans and other animals that solve large planning problems. These numerical analyses show that Active Tree Search is a principled realisation of neuroscientific and AI planning theories, which offer both biological realism and scalability.

                arXiv:2405.16391v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Compositional generalization (the ability to respond correctly to novel combinations of familiar components) is thought to be a cornerstone of intelligent behavior. Compositionally structured (e.g. disentangled) representations are essential for this; however, the conditions under which they yield compositional generalization remain unclear. To address this gap, we present a general theory of compositional generalization in kernel models with fixed representations, a tractable framework for characterizing the impact of dataset statistics on generalization. We find that kernel models are constrained to adding up values assigned to each combination of components seen during training ("conjunction-wise additivity"). This imposes fundamental restrictions on the set of tasks these models can learn, in particular preventing them from transitively generalizing equivalence relations. Even for compositional tasks that kernel models can in principle learn, we identify novel failure modes in compositional generalization that arise from biases in the training data and affect important compositional building blocks such as symbolic addition and context dependence (memorization leak and shortcut bias). Finally, we empirically validate our theory, showing that it captures the behavior of deep neural networks (convolutional networks, residual networks, and Vision Transformers) trained on a set of compositional tasks with similarly structured data. Ultimately, this work provides a theoretical perspective on how statistical structure in the training data can affect compositional generalization, with implications for how to identify and remedy failure modes in deep learning models.

                arXiv:2406.01589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A wide range of empirical and theoretical works have shown that overparameterisation can amplify the performance of neural networks. According to the lottery ticket hypothesis, overparameterised networks have an increased chance of containing a sub-network that is well-initialised to solve the task at hand. A more parsimonious approach, inspired by animal learning, consists in guiding the learner towards solving the task by curating the order of the examples, i.e. providing a curriculum. However, this learning strategy seems to be hardly beneficial in deep learning applications. In this work, we undertake an analytical study that connects curriculum learning and overparameterisation. In particular, we investigate their interplay in the online learning setting for a 2-layer network in the XOR-like Gaussian Mixture problem. Our results show that a high degree of overparameterisation -- while simplifying the problem -- can limit the benefit from curricula, providing a theoretical account of the ineffectiveness of curricula in deep learning.

Abstract: We present a self-supervised framework that learns population-level codes for arbitrary ensembles of neural recordings at scale. We address two key challenges in scaling models with neural time-series data: sparse and variable electrode distribution across subjects and datasets. The Population Transformer (PopT) stacks on top of pretrained representations and enhances downstream decoding by enabling learned aggregation of multiple spatially-sparse data channels. The pretrained PopT lowers the amount of data required for downstream decoding experiments, while increasing accuracy, even on held-out subjects and tasks. Compared to end-to-end methods, this approach is computationally lightweight and more interpretable, while still retaining competitive performance. We further show how our framework is generalizable to multiple time-series embeddings and neural data modalities. Beyond decoding, we interpret the pretrained PopT and fine-tuned models to show how they can be used to extract neuroscience insights from massive amounts of data. We release our code as well as a pretrained PopT to enable off-the-shelf improvements in multi-channel intracranial data decoding and interpretability.

Abstract: We address the linguistic problem of the sequential arrangement of a head and its dependents from an information theoretic perspective. In particular, we consider the optimal placement of a head that maximizes the predictability of the sequence. We assume that dependents are statistically independent given a head, in line with the open-choice principle and the core assumptions of dependency grammar. We demonstrate the optimality of harmonic order, i.e., placing the head last maximizes the predictability of the head whereas placing the head first maximizes the predictability of dependents. We also show that postponing the head is the optimal strategy to maximize its predictability while bringing it forward is the optimal strategy to maximize the predictability of dependents. We unravel the advantages of the strategy of maximizing the predictability of the head over maximizing the predictability of dependents. Our findings shed light on the placements of the head adopted by real languages or emerging in different kinds of experiments.

                arXiv:2410.06232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Why do biological and artificial neurons sometimes modularise, each encoding a single meaningful variable, and sometimes entangle their representation of many variables? In this work, we develop a theory of when biologically inspired representations -- those that are nonnegative and energy efficient -- modularise with respect to source variables (sources). We derive necessary and sufficient conditions on a sample of sources that determine whether the neurons in an optimal biologically-inspired linear autoencoder modularise. Our theory applies to any dataset, extending far beyond the case of statistical independence studied in previous work. Rather, we show that sources modularise if their support is "sufficiently spread". From this theory, we extract and validate predictions in a variety of empirical studies on how data distribution affects modularisation in nonlinear feedforward and recurrent neural networks trained on supervised and unsupervised tasks. Furthermore, we apply these ideas to neuroscience data. First, we explain why two studies that recorded prefrontal activity in working memory tasks conflict on whether memories are encoded in orthogonal subspaces: the support of the sources differed due to a critical discrepancy in experimental protocol. Second, we use similar arguments to understand why preparatory and potent subspaces in RNN models of motor cortex are only sometimes orthogonal. Third, we study spatial and reward information mixing in entorhinal recordings, and show our theory matches data better than previous work. And fourth, we suggest a suite of surprising settings in which neurons can be (or appear) mixed selective, without requiring complex nonlinear readouts as in traditional theories. In sum, our theory prescribes precise conditions on when neural activities modularise, providing tools for inducing and elucidating modular representations in brains and machines.

                arXiv:2410.07174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning-based approaches to quadruped locomotion commonly adopt generic policy architectures like fully connected MLPs. As such architectures contain few inductive biases, it is common in practice to incorporate priors in the form of rewards, training curricula, imitation data, or trajectory generators. In nature, animals are born with priors in the form of their nervous system's architecture, which has been shaped by evolution to confer innate ability and efficient learning. For instance, a horse can walk within hours of birth and can quickly improve with practice. Such architectural priors can also be useful in ANN architectures for AI. In this work, we explore the advantages of a biologically inspired ANN architecture for quadruped locomotion based on neural circuits in the limbs and spinal cord of mammals. Our architecture achieves good initial performance and comparable final performance to MLPs, while using less data and orders of magnitude fewer parameters. Our architecture also exhibits better generalization to task variations, even admitting deployment on a physical robot without standard sim-to-real methods. This work shows that neural circuits can provide valuable architectural priors for locomotion and encourages future work in other sensorimotor skills.

Abstract: We introduce a model of randomly connected neural populations and study its dynamics by means of the dynamical mean-field theory and simulations. Our analysis uncovers a rich phase diagram, featuring high- and low-dimensional chaotic phases, separated by a crossover region characterized by low values of the maximal Lyapunov exponent and participation ratio dimension, but with high and rapidly changing values of the Lyapunov dimension. Counterintuitively, chaos can be attenuated by either adding noise to strongly modular connectivity or by introducing modularity into random connectivity. Extending the model to include a multilevel, hierarchical connectivity reveals that a loose balance between activities across levels drives the system towards the edge of chaos.

                arXiv:2410.05701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper presents a new balanced selection operator applied to the proposed Balanced Non-dominated Tournament Genetic Algorithm (B-NTGA) that actively uses archive to solve multi- and many-objective NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems with constraints. The primary motivation is to make B-NTGA more efficient in exploring Pareto Front Approximation (PFa), focusing on 'gaps' and reducing some PFa regions' sampling too frequently. Such a balancing mechanism allows B-NTGA to be more adaptive and focus on less explored PFa regions. The proposed B-NTGA is investigated on two benchmark multi- and many-objective optimization real-world problems, like Thief Traveling Problem and Multi-Skill Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem. The results of experiments show that B-NTGA has a higher efficiency and better performance than state-of-the-art methods.

                arXiv:2410.05759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: UAVs are increasingly becoming vital tools in various wireless communication applications including internet of things (IoT) and sensor networks, thanks to their rapid and agile non-terrestrial mobility. Despite recent research, planning three-dimensional (3D) UAV trajectories over a continuous temporal-spatial domain remains challenging due to the need to solve computationally intensive optimization problems. In this paper, we study UAV-assisted IoT data collection aimed at minimizing total energy consumption while accounting for the UAV's physical capabilities, the heterogeneous data demands of IoT nodes, and 3D terrain. We propose a matrix-based differential evolution with constraint handling (MDE-CH), a computation-efficient evolutionary algorithm designed to address non-convex constrained optimization problems with several different types of constraints. Numerical evaluations demonstrate that the proposed MDE-CH algorithm provides a continuous 3D temporal-spatial UAV trajectory capable of efficiently minimizing energy consumption under various practical constraints and outperforms the conventional fly-hover-fly model for both two-dimensional (2D) and 3D trajectory planning.

                arXiv:2410.05787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of dynamic multi-objective optimization problems (DMOPs), by demonstrating new approaches to change prediction strategies within an evolutionary algorithm paradigm. Because the objectives of such problems change over time, the Pareto optimal set (PS) and Pareto optimal front (PF) are also dynamic. To accurately track the changing PS and PF in the decision and objective spaces, we propose a novel adaptive prediction strategy, which utilizes the concept of second-order derivatives adaptively in different domains. %to deal with DMOPs. Firstly, the changes in both the PS and the PF are considered in this paper, which makes the proposed a dual-domain based method. Firstly, we propose a dual-domain method, which takes into account changes in both the PS and the PF simultaneously. An adaptive strategy is adopted to self-adjust the proportion of the search space. Secondly, a second-order derivative prediction strategy is proposed to predicatively re-initialize the population. We compare the performance of the proposed algorithm against four other state-of-the-art algorithms from the literature, using DMOPs benchmark problems. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the other algorithms on most of the test problems.

                arXiv:2410.07127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When the exact probability distribution of input conditions cannot be obtained in practical engineering problems, interval analysis methods are often used to analyze the upper and lower bounds of output responses. Essentially, this can be regarded as an optimization problem, solvable by optimization algorithms. This paper proposes a novel interval analysis method, i.e., multi-body dynamic evolution sequence-assisted PSO (abbreviated as DES-PSO), which combines a dynamical evolutionary sequence with the heterogeneous comprehensive learning particle swarm optimization algorithm (HCLPSO). By introducing the dynamical evolutionary sequence instead of the random sequence, the proposed method addresses the difficulty HCLPSO faces in covering the search space, making it suitable for interval analysis problems. To verify the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed DES-PSO method, this paper solves two case studies using both the DES-PSO and HCLPSO methods. The first case study employs an optimization algorithm to solve the solution domain of a linear interval equation system, and the second case study analyzes the collision and heat conduction of a smartwatch using an optimization method. The results of the case studies demonstrate that DES-PSO can significantly improve the computational speed of interval analysis while ensuring accuracy, providing a new approach to solving complex interval analysis problems.

                arXiv:2410.05278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have emerged as a promising class of targeted cancer therapeutics, but the design and optimization of their cytotoxic payloads remain challenging. This study introduces DumplingGNN, a novel hybrid Graph Neural Network architecture specifically designed for predicting ADC payload activity based on chemical structure. By integrating Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNN), Graph Attention Networks (GAT), and GraphSAGE layers, DumplingGNN effectively captures multi-scale molecular features and leverages both 2D topological and 3D structural information. We evaluate DumplingGNN on a comprehensive ADC payload dataset focusing on DNA Topoisomerase I inhibitors, as well as on multiple public benchmarks from MoleculeNet. DumplingGNN achieves state-of-the-art performance across several datasets, including BBBP (96.4\% ROC-AUC), ToxCast (78.2\% ROC-AUC), and PCBA (88.87\% ROC-AUC). On our specialized ADC payload dataset, it demonstrates exceptional accuracy (91.48\%), sensitivity (95.08\%), and specificity (97.54\%). Ablation studies confirm the synergistic effects of the hybrid architecture and the critical role of 3D structural information in enhancing predictive accuracy. The model's strong interpretability, enabled by attention mechanisms, provides valuable insights into structure-activity relationships. DumplingGNN represents a significant advancement in molecular property prediction, with particular promise for accelerating the design and optimization of ADC payloads in targeted cancer therapy development.

                arXiv:2410.05300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To enhance the accuracy of power load forecasting in wind farms, this study introduces an advanced combined forecasting method that integrates Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) with an Improved Particle Swarm Optimization (IPSO) algorithm to optimize the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). Initially, the VMD algorithm is employed to perform high-precision modal decomposition of the original power load data, which is then categorized into high-frequency and low-frequency sequences based on mutual information entropy theory. Subsequently, this research profoundly modifies the traditional multiverse optimizer by incorporating Tent chaos mapping, exponential travel distance rate, and an elite reverse learning mechanism, developing the IPSO-ELM prediction model. This model independently predicts the high and low-frequency sequences and reconstructs the data to achieve the final forecasting results. Simulation results indicate that the proposed method significantly improves prediction accuracy and convergence speed compared to traditional ELM, PSO-ELM, and PSO-ELM methods.

                arXiv:2410.05882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lung radiotherapy treatment systems are subject to a latency that leads to uncertainty in the estimated tumor location and high irradiation of healthy tissue. This work addresses future frame prediction in chest dynamic MRI sequences to compensate for that delay using RNNs trained with online learning algorithms. The latter enable networks to mitigate irregular movements, as they update synaptic weights with each new training example. Experiments were conducted using four publicly available 2D thoracic cine-MRI sequences. PCA decomposes the time-varying deformation vector field (DVF), computed with the Lucas-Kanade optical flow algorithm, into static deformation fields and low-dimensional time-dependent weights. We compare various algorithms to forecast the latter: linear regression, least mean squares (LMS), and RNNs trained with real-time recurrent learning (RTRL), unbiased online recurrent optimization, decoupled neural interfaces and sparse 1-step approximation (SnAp-1). That enables estimating the future DVFs and, in turn, the next frames by warping the initial image. Linear regression led to the lowest mean DVF error at a horizon h = 0.32s (the time interval in advance for which the prediction is made), equal to 1.30mm, followed by SnAp-1 and RTRL, whose error increased from 1.37mm to 1.44mm as h increased from 0.62s to 2.20s. Similarly, the structural similarity index measure (SSIM) of LMS decreased from 0.904 to 0.898 as h increased from 0.31s to 1.57s and was the highest among the algorithms compared for the latter horizons. SnAp-1 attained the highest SSIM for h $\geq$ 1.88s, with values of less than 0.898. The predicted images look similar to the original ones, and the highest errors occurred at challenging areas such as the diaphragm boundary at the end-of-inhale phase, where motion variability is more prominent, and regions where out-of-plane motion was more prevalent.

                arXiv:2410.05985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing size of deep learning models has created the need for more efficient alternatives to the standard error backpropagation algorithm, that make better use of asynchronous, parallel and distributed computing. One major shortcoming of backpropagation is the interlocking between the forward phase of the algorithm, which computes a global loss, and the backward phase where the loss is backpropagated through all layers to compute the gradients, which are used to update the network parameters. To address this problem, we propose a method that parallelises SGD updates across the layers of a model by asynchronously updating them from multiple threads. Furthermore, since we observe that the forward pass is often much faster than the backward pass, we use separate threads for the forward and backward pass calculations, which allows us to use a higher ratio of forward to backward threads than the usual 1:1 ratio, reducing the overall staleness of the parameters. Thus, our approach performs asynchronous stochastic gradient descent using separate threads for the loss (forward) and gradient (backward) computations and performs layer-wise partial updates to parameters in a distributed way. We show that this approach yields close to state-of-the-art results while running up to 2.97x faster than Hogwild! scaled on multiple devices (Locally-Partitioned-Asynchronous-Parallel SGD). We theoretically prove the convergence of the algorithm using a novel theoretical framework based on stochastic differential equations and the drift diffusion process, by modeling the asynchronous parameter updates as a stochastic process.

Abstract: The use of cryptocurrencies has led to an increase in illicit activities such as money laundering, with traditional rule-based approaches becoming less effective in detecting and preventing such activities. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to tackling this problem by applying graph attention networks with residual network-like architecture (GAT-ResNet) to detect illicit transactions related to anti-money laundering/combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) in blockchains. We train various models on the Elliptic Bitcoin Transaction dataset, implementing logistic regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, GCN, GAT, and our proposed GAT-ResNet model. Our results demonstrate that the GAT-ResNet model has a potential to outperform the existing graph network models in terms of accuracy, reliability and scalability. Our research sheds light on the potential of graph related machine learning models to improve efforts to combat financial crime and lays the foundation for further research in this area.

Abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has received increasing attention because of its exceptional merits in automating the design of Deep Neural Network (DNN) architectures. However, the performance evaluation process, as a key part of NAS, often requires training a large number of DNNs. This inevitably makes NAS computationally expensive. In past years, many Efficient Evaluation Methods (EEMs) have been proposed to address this critical issue. In this paper, we comprehensively survey these EEMs published up to date, and provide a detailed analysis to motivate the further development of this research direction. Specifically, we divide the existing EEMs into four categories based on the number of DNNs trained for constructing these EEMs. The categorization can reflect the degree of efficiency in principle, which can in turn help quickly grasp the methodological features. In surveying each category, we further discuss the design principles and analyze the strengths and weaknesses to clarify the landscape of existing EEMs, thus making easily understanding the research trends of EEMs. Furthermore, we also discuss the current challenges and issues to identify future research directions in this emerging topic. In summary, this survey provides a convenient overview of EEM for interested users, and they can easily select the proper EEM method for the tasks at hand. In addition, the researchers in the NAS field could continue exploring the future directions suggested in the paper.

                arXiv:2402.00411v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Compared to traditional Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Spiking Neural Network (SNN) has garnered widespread academic interest for its intrinsic ability to transmit information in a more energy-efficient manner. However, despite previous efforts to optimize the learning algorithm of SNNs through various methods, SNNs still lag behind ANNs in terms of performance. The recently proposed multi-threshold model provides more possibilities for further enhancing the learning capability of SNNs. In this paper, we rigorously analyze the relationship among the multi-threshold model, vanilla spiking model and quantized ANNs from a mathematical perspective, then propose a novel LM-HT model, which is an equidistant multi-threshold model that can dynamically regulate the global input current and membrane potential leakage on the time dimension. The LM-HT model can also be transformed into a vanilla single threshold model through reparameterization, thereby achieving more flexible hardware deployment. In addition, we note that the LM-HT model can seamlessly integrate with ANN-SNN Conversion framework under special initialization. This novel hybrid learning framework can effectively improve the relatively poor performance of converted SNNs under low time latency. Extensive experimental results have demonstrated that our model can outperform previous state-of-the-art works on various types of datasets, which promote SNNs to achieve a brand-new level of performance comparable to quantized ANNs.

                arXiv:2402.14603v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The resonate-and-fire (RF) neuron, introduced over two decades ago, is a simple, efficient, yet biologically plausible spiking neuron model, which can extract frequency patterns within the time domain due to its resonating membrane dynamics. However, previous RF formulations suffer from intrinsic shortcomings that limit effective learning and prevent exploiting the principled advantage of RF neurons. Here, we introduce the balanced RF (BRF) neuron, which alleviates some of the intrinsic limitations of vanilla RF neurons and demonstrates its effectiveness within recurrent spiking neural networks (RSNNs) on various sequence learning tasks. We show that networks of BRF neurons achieve overall higher task performance, produce only a fraction of the spikes, and require significantly fewer parameters as compared to modern RSNNs. Moreover, BRF-RSNN consistently provide much faster and more stable training convergence, even when bridging many hundreds of time steps during backpropagation through time (BPTT). These results underscore that our BRF-RSNN is a strong candidate for future large-scale RSNN architectures, further lines of research in SNN methodology, and more efficient hardware implementations.

Abstract: Spiking Transformers, which integrate Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) with Transformer architectures, have attracted significant attention due to their potential for energy efficiency and high performance. However, existing models in this domain still suffer from suboptimal performance. We introduce several innovations to improve the performance: i) We propose a novel spike-form Q-K attention mechanism, tailored for SNNs, which efficiently models the importance of token or channel dimensions through binary vectors with linear complexity. ii) We incorporate the hierarchical structure, which significantly benefits the performance of both the brain and artificial neural networks, into spiking transformers to obtain multi-scale spiking representation. iii) We design a versatile and powerful patch embedding module with a deformed shortcut specifically for spiking transformers. Together, we develop QKFormer, a hierarchical spiking transformer based on Q-K attention with direct training. QKFormer shows significantly superior performance over existing state-of-the-art SNN models on various mainstream datasets. Notably, with comparable size to Spikformer (66.34 M, 74.81%), QKFormer (64.96 M) achieves a groundbreaking top-1 accuracy of 85.65% on ImageNet-1k, substantially outperforming Spikformer by 10.84%. To our best knowledge, this is the first time that directly training SNNs have exceeded 85% accuracy on ImageNet-1K. The code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/zhouchenlin2096/QKFormer

                arXiv:2407.21189v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nowadays, as the ever-increasing demand for more powerful computing resources continues, alternative advanced computing paradigms are under extensive investigation. Significant effort has been made to deviate from conventional Von Neumann architectures. In-memory computing has emerged in the field of electronics as a possible solution to the infamous bottleneck between memory and computing processors, which reduces the effective throughput of data. In photonics, novel schemes attempt to collocate the computing processor and memory in a single device. Photonics offers the flexibility of multiplexing streams of data not only spatially and in time, but also in frequency or, equivalently, in wavelength, which makes it highly suitable for parallel computing. Here, we numerically show the use of time and wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) to solve four independent tasks at the same time in a single photonic chip, serving as a proof of concept for our proposal. The system is a time-delay reservoir computing (TDRC) based on a microring resonator (MRR). The addressed tasks cover different applications: Time-series prediction, waveform signal classification, wireless channel equalization, and radar signal prediction. The system is also tested for simultaneous computing of up to 10 instances of the same task, exhibiting excellent performance. The footprint of the system is reduced by using time-division multiplexing of the nodes that act as the neurons of the studied neural network scheme. WDM is used for the parallelization of wavelength channels, each addressing a single task. By adjusting the input power and frequency of each optical channel, we can achieve levels of performance for each of the tasks that are comparable to those quoted in state-of-the-art reports focusing on single-task operation...

                arXiv:2410.04992v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Long short-term memory (LSTM) has emerged as a definitive network for analyzing and inferring time series data. LSTM has the capability to extract spectral features and a mixture of temporal features. Due to this benefit, a similar feature extraction method is explored for the spiking counterparts targeting time-series data. Though LSTMs perform well in their spiking form, they tend to be compute and power intensive. Addressing this issue, this work proposes Multi-Compartment Leaky (MCLeaky) neuron as a viable alternative for efficient processing of time series data. The MCLeaky neuron, derived from the Leaky Integrate and Fire (LIF) neuron model, contains multiple memristive synapses interlinked to form a memory component, which emulates the human brain's Hippocampus region. The proposed MCLeaky neuron based Spiking Neural Network model and its quantized variant were benchmarked against state-of-the-art (SOTA) Spiking LSTMs to perform human stress detection, by comparing compute requirements, latency and real-world performances on unseen data with models derived through Neural Architecture Search (NAS). Results show that networks with MCLeaky activation neuron managed a superior accuracy of 98.8% to detect stress based on Electrodermal Activity (EDA) signals, better than any other investigated models, while using 20% less parameters on average. MCLeaky neuron was also tested for various signals including EDA Wrist and Chest, Temperature, ECG, and combinations of them. Quantized MCLeaky model was also derived and validated to forecast their performance on hardware architectures, which resulted in 91.84% accuracy. The neurons were evaluated for multiple modalities of data towards stress detection, which resulted in energy savings of 25.12x to 39.20x and EDP gains of 52.37x to 81.9x over ANNs, while offering a best accuracy of 98.8% when compared with the rest of the SOTA implementations.

Abstract: We present a unified representation of the most popular neural network activation functions. Adopting Mittag-Leffler functions of fractional calculus, we propose a flexible and compact functional form that is able to interpolate between various activation functions and mitigate common problems in training neural networks such as vanishing and exploding gradients. The presented gated representation extends the scope of fixed-shape activation functions to their adaptive counterparts whose shape can be learnt from the training data. The derivatives of the proposed functional form can also be expressed in terms of Mittag-Leffler functions making it a suitable candidate for gradient-based backpropagation algorithms. By training multiple neural networks of different complexities on various datasets with different sizes, we demonstrate that adopting a unified gated representation of activation functions offers a promising and affordable alternative to individual built-in implementations of activation functions in conventional machine learning frameworks.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18508">Scalable Event-by-event Processing of Neuromorphic Sensory Signals With Deep State-Space Models</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2404.18508v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Event-based sensors are well suited for real-time processing due to their fast response times and encoding of the sensory data as successive temporal differences. These and other valuable properties, such as a high dynamic range, are suppressed when the data is converted to a frame-based format. However, most current methods either collapse events into frames or cannot scale up when processing the event data directly event-by-event. In this work, we address the key challenges of scaling up event-by-event modeling of the long event streams emitted by such sensors, which is a particularly relevant problem for neuromorphic computing. While prior methods can process up to a few thousand time steps, our model, based on modern recurrent deep state-space models, scales to event streams of millions of events for both training and inference. We leverage their stable parameterization for learning long-range dependencies, parallelizability along the sequence dimension, and their ability to integrate asynchronous events effectively to scale them up to long event streams. We further augment these with novel event-centric techniques enabling our model to match or beat the state-of-the-art performance on several event stream benchmarks. In the Spiking Speech Commands task, we improve state-of-the-art by a large margin of 7.7% to 88.4%. On the DVS128-Gestures dataset, we achieve competitive results without using frames or convolutional neural networks. Our work demonstrates, for the first time, that it is possible to use fully event-based processing with purely recurrent networks to achieve state-of-the-art task performance in several event-based benchmarks.

Abstract: AI-enabled capabilities are reaching the requisite level of maturity to be deployed in the real world, yet do not always make correct or safe decisions. One way of addressing these concerns is to leverage AI control systems alongside and in support of human decisions, relying on the AI control system in safe situations while calling on a human co-decider for critical situations. We extend a methodology for adversarial explanations (AE) to state-of-the-art reinforcement learning frameworks, including MuZero. Multiple improvements to the base agent architecture are proposed. We demonstrate how this technology has two applications: for intelligent decision tools and to enhance training / learning frameworks. In a decision support context, adversarial explanations help a user make the correct decision by highlighting those contextual factors that would need to change for a different AI-recommended decision. As another benefit of adversarial explanations, we show that the learned AI control system demonstrates robustness against adversarial tampering. Additionally, we supplement AE by introducing strategically similar autoencoders (SSAs) to help users identify and understand all salient factors being considered by the AI system. In a training / learning framework, this technology can improve both the AI's decisions and explanations through human interaction. Finally, to identify when AI decisions would most benefit from human oversight, we tie this combined system to our prior art on statistically verified analyses of the criticality of decisions at any point in time.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become important tools for machine learning on graph-structured data. In this paper, we explore the synergistic combination of graph encoding, graph rewiring, and graph attention, by introducing Graph Attention with Stochastic Structures (GRASS), a novel GNN architecture. GRASS utilizes relative random walk probabilities (RRWP) encoding and a novel decomposed variant (D-RRWP) to efficiently capture structural information. It rewires the input graph by superimposing a random regular graph to enhance long-range information propagation. It also employs a novel additive attention mechanism tailored for graph-structured data. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that GRASS achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets, including a 20.3% reduction in mean absolute error on the ZINC dataset.

Abstract: We explore the emergence of intelligent behavior in artificial systems by investigating how the complexity of rule-based systems influences the capabilities of models trained to predict these rules. Our study focuses on elementary cellular automata (ECA), simple yet powerful one-dimensional systems that generate behaviors ranging from trivial to highly complex. By training distinct Large Language Models (LLMs) on different ECAs, we evaluated the relationship between the complexity of the rules' behavior and the intelligence exhibited by the LLMs, as reflected in their performance on downstream tasks. Our findings reveal that rules with higher complexity lead to models exhibiting greater intelligence, as demonstrated by their performance on reasoning and chess move prediction tasks. Both uniform and periodic systems, and often also highly chaotic systems, resulted in poorer downstream performance, highlighting a sweet spot of complexity conducive to intelligence. We conjecture that intelligence arises from the ability to predict complexity and that creating intelligence may require only exposure to complexity.

	<p>Objective: Research about the impact of acute stress on inhibitory control remains a contentious topic, with no consensus reached thus far. This study aims to investigate the effects of acute stress on an individual&amp;amp;rsquo;s inhibitory control abilities and to elucidate the underlying neural mechanisms by analyzing resting state electroencephalogram (EEG) data. Methods: We recruited 32 male college students through participant recruitment information to undergo within-subject experiments under stress and non-stress conditions. Physiological indicators (cortisol and heart rate), self-report questionnaires, and behavioral data from the Stroop task were collected before, during, and after the experiment. Additionally, a five-minute eyes closed resting state EEG data collection was conducted during the Stroop task before. Results: (1) Acute stress led to a reduction in the conflict effect during the participants&amp;amp;rsquo; Stroop task in individuals. (2) Stress resulted in an increase in the power of the beta in the resting state EEG. (3) Acute stress caused an increase in the duration of class D and an increase in the transition probabilities from classes C and B to class D in the microstates of the resting state EEG. (4) Acute stress leads to an increase in beta power values in individuals&amp;amp;rsquo; resting state EEGs, which is significantly negatively correlated with the reduction of the conflict effect in the Stroop task under stress. Conclusions: Acute stress can enhance individuals&amp;amp;rsquo; attentional level, thereby promoting inhibitory control performance.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/41/e0129232024?rss=1">Neuritin Controls Axonal Branching in Serotonin Neurons: A Possible Mediator Involved in the Regulation of Depressive and Anxiety Behaviors via FGF Signaling</a></h4>

              
                <p>Abnormal neuronal morphological features, such as dendrite branching, axonal branching, and spine density, are thought to contribute to the symptoms of depression and anxiety. However, the role and molecular mechanisms of aberrant neuronal morphology in the regulation of mood disorders remain poorly characterized. Here, we show that neuritin, an activity-dependent protein, regulates the axonal morphology of serotonin neurons. Male <I>neuritin</I> knock-out (KO) mice harbored impaired axonal branches of serotonin neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex and basolateral region of the amygdala (BLA), and male <I>neuritin</I> KO mice exhibited depressive and anxiety-like behaviors. We also observed that the expression of neuritin was decreased by unpredictable chronic stress in the male mouse brain and that decreased expression of neuritin was associated with reduced axonal branching of serotonin neurons in the brain and with depressive and anxiety behaviors in mice. Furthermore, the stress-mediated impairments in axonal branching and depressive behaviors were reversed by the overexpression of neuritin in the BLA. The ability of neuritin to increase axonal branching in serotonin neurons involves fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling, and neuritin contributes to FGF-2-mediated axonal branching regulation in vitro. Finally, the oral administration of an FGF inhibitor reduced the axonal branching of serotonin neurons in the brain and caused depressive and anxiety behaviors in male mice. Our results support the involvement of neuritin in models of stress-induced depression and suggest that neuronal morphological plasticity may play a role in controlling animal behavior.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/41/e0350242024?rss=1">Brief and Diverse Excitotoxic Insults Increase the Neuronal Nuclear Membrane Permeability in the Neonatal Brain, Resulting in Neuronal Dysfunction and Cell Death</a></h4>

              
                <p>Neuronal cytotoxic edema is implicated in neuronal injury and death, yet mitigating brain edema with osmotic and surgical interventions yields poor clinical outcomes. Importantly, neuronal swelling and its downstream consequences during early brain development remain poorly investigated, and new treatment approaches are needed. We explored Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent downstream effects after neuronal cytotoxic edema caused by diverse injuries in mice of both sexes using multiphoton Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging in vivo [Postnatal Day (P)12&ndash;17] and in acute brain slices (P8&ndash;12). After different excitotoxic insults, cytosolic GCaMP6s translocated into the nucleus after a few minutes in a subpopulation of neurons, persisting for hours. We used an automated morphology-detection algorithm to detect neuronal soma and quantified the nuclear translocation of GCaMP6s as the nuclear to cytosolic intensity (<I>N</I>/<I>C</I> ratio). Elevated neuronal <I>N</I>/<I>C</I> ratios occurred concurrently with persistent elevation in Ca<sup>2+</sup> loads and could also occur independently from neuronal swelling. Electron microscopy revealed that the nuclear translocation was associated with the increased nuclear pore size. The nuclear accumulation of GCaMP6s in neurons led to neocortical circuit dysfunction, mitochondrial pathology, and increased cell death. Inhibiting calpains, a family of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated proteases, prevented elevated <I>N</I>/<I>C</I> ratios and neuronal swelling. In summary, in the developing brain, we identified a calpain-dependent alteration of nuclear transport in a subpopulation of neurons after disease-relevant insults leading to long-term circuit dysfunction and cell death. The nuclear translocation of GCaMP6 and other cytosolic proteins after acute excitotoxicity can be an early biomarker of brain injury in the developing brain.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/41/e0591242024?rss=1">{gamma}1 GABAA Receptors in Spinal Nociceptive Circuits</a></h4>

              
                <p>GABAergic neurons and GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptors (GABA<SUB>A</SUB>Rs) are critical elements of almost all neuronal circuits. Most GABA<SUB>A</SUB>Rs of the CNS are heteropentameric ion channels composed of two &alpha;, two &beta;, and one  subunits. These receptors serve as important drug targets for benzodiazepine (BDZ) site agonists, which potentiate the action of GABA at GABA<SUB>A</SUB>Rs. Most GABA<SUB>A</SUB>R classifications rely on the heterogeneity of the &alpha; subunit (&alpha;1&ndash;&alpha;6) included in the receptor complex. Heterogeneity of the  subunits (1&ndash;3), which mediate synaptic clustering of GABA<SUB>A</SUB>Rs and contribute, together with &alpha; subunits, to the benzodiazepine (BDZ) binding site, has gained less attention, mainly because 2 subunits greatly outnumber the other  subunits in most brain regions. Here, we have investigated a potential role of non-2 GABA<SUB>A</SUB>Rs in neural circuits of the spinal dorsal horn, a key site of nociceptive processing. Female and male mice were studied. We demonstrate that besides 2 subunits, 1 subunits are significantly expressed in the spinal dorsal horn, especially in its superficial layers. Unlike global 2 subunit deletion, which is lethal, spinal cord-specific loss of 2 subunits was well tolerated. GABA<SUB>A</SUB>R clustering in the superficial dorsal horn remained largely unaffected and antihyperalgesic actions of HZ-166, a nonsedative BDZ site agonist, were partially retained. Our results thus suggest that the superficial dorsal horn harbors functionally relevant amounts of 1 subunits that support the synaptic clustering of GABA<SUB>A</SUB>Rs in this site. They further suggest that 1 containing GABA<SUB>A</SUB>Rs contribute to the spinal control of nociceptive information flow.</p>

                <p>Serotonin modulates diverse phenotypes and functions including depressive, aggressive, impulsive, and feeding behaviors, all of which have reward-related components. To date, research has focused on understanding these effects by measuring and manipulating dorsal raphe serotonin neurons and using single-receptor approaches. These studies have led to a better understanding of the heterogeneity of serotonin actions on behavior; however, they leave open many questions about the timing and location of serotonin's actions modulating the neural circuits that drive these behaviors. Recent advances in genetically encoded fluorescent biosensors, including the GPCR activation-based sensor for serotonin (GRAB-5-HT), enable the measurement of serotonin release in mice on a timescale compatible with a single rewarding event without corelease confounds. Given substantial evidence from slice electrophysiology experiments showing that serotonin influences neural activity of the striatal circuitry, and the known role of the dorsal medial striatal (DMS) in reward-directed behavior, we focused on understanding the parameters and timing that govern serotonin release in the DMS in the context of reward consumption, external reward value, internal state, and cued reward. Overall, we found that serotonin release is associated with each of these and encodes reward anticipation, value, approach, and consumption in the DMS.</p>

                <p>Emerging research in nonhuman animals implicates cerebellar projections to the ventral tegmental area (VTA) in appetitive behaviors, but these circuits have not been characterized in humans. Here, we mapped cerebello-VTA white matter connectivity in a cohort of men and women using probabilistic tractography on diffusion imaging data from the Human Connectome Project. We uncovered the topographical organization of these connections by separately tracking from parcels of cerebellar lobule VI, crus I/II, vermis, paravermis, and cerebrocerebellum. Results revealed that connections between the cerebellum and VTA predominantly originate in the right cerebellar hemisphere, interposed nucleus, and paravermal cortex and terminate mostly ipsilaterally. Paravermal crus I sends the most connections to the VTA compared with other lobules. We discovered a mediolateral gradient of connectivity, such that the medial cerebellum has the highest connectivity with the VTA. Individual differences in microstructure were associated with measures of negative affect and social functioning. By splitting the tracts into quarters, we found that the socioaffective effects were driven by the third quarter of the tract, corresponding to the point at which the fibers leave the deep nuclei. Taken together, we produced detailed maps of cerebello-VTA structural connectivity for the first time in humans and established their relevance for trait differences in socioaffective regulation.</p>

                <p>Recent visual experience heavily influences our visual perception, but how neuronal activity is reshaped to alter and improve perceptual discrimination remains unknown. We recorded from populations of neurons in visual cortical area V4 while two male rhesus macaque monkeys performed a natural image change detection task under different experience conditions. We found that maximizing the recent experience with a particular image led to an improvement in the ability to detect a change in that image. This improvement was associated with decreased neural responses to the image, consistent with neuronal changes previously seen in studies of adaptation and expectation. We found that the magnitude of behavioral improvement was correlated with the magnitude of response suppression. Furthermore, this suppression of activity led to an increase in signal separation, providing evidence that a reduction in activity can improve stimulus encoding. Within populations of neurons, greater recent experience was associated with decreased trial-to-trial shared variability, indicating that a reduction in variability is a key means by which experience influences perception. Taken together, the results of our study contribute to an understanding of how recent visual experience can shape our perception and behavior through modulating activity patterns in the mid-level visual cortex.</p>

                <p>Targeting altered expression and/or activity of GABA (-aminobutyric acid) transporters (GATs) provide therapeutic benefit for age-related impairments, including cognitive dysfunction. However, the mechanisms underlying the transcriptional regulation of GATs are unknown. In the present study, we demonstrated that the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) upregulates GAT1 and GAT3 expression in the brain, which resulted in cognitive dysfunction. Genetic and pharmacological intervention of STING suppressed the expression of both GAT1 and GAT3, increased the ambient GABA concentration, and therefore, enhanced tonic GABA<SUB>A</SUB> inhibition of principal hippocampal neurons, resulting in spatial learning and working memory deficits in mice in a type I interferon-independent manner. Stimulation of the STING-&gt;GAT pathway efficiently restored cognitive dysfunction in STING-deficient mice models. Our study uncovered for the first time that the STING signaling pathway regulates GAT expression in a cell autonomous manner and therefore could be a novel target for GABAergic cognitive deficits.</p>

                <p>&alpha;-Neurexins are essential and highly expressed presynaptic cell-adhesion molecules that are frequently linked to neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders. Despite their importance, how the elaborate extracellular sequences of &alpha;-neurexins contribute to synapse function is poorly understood. We recently characterized the presynaptic gain-of-function phenotype caused by a missense mutation in an evolutionarily conserved extracellular sequence of neurexin-3&alpha; (A687T) that we identified in a patient diagnosed with profound intellectual disability and epilepsy. The striking A687T gain-of-function mutation on neurexin-3&alpha; prompted us to systematically test using mutants whether the presynaptic gain-of-function phenotype is a consequence of the addition of side-chain bulk (i.e., A687V) or polar/hydrophilic properties (i.e., A687S). We used multidisciplinary approaches in mixed-sex primary hippocampal cultures to assess the impact of the neurexin-3&alpha;<sup>A687</sup> residue on synapse morphology, function and ligand binding. Unexpectedly, neither A687V nor A687S recapitulated the neurexin-3&alpha; A687T phenotype. Instead, distinct from A687T, molecular replacement with A687S significantly enhanced postsynaptic properties exclusively at excitatory synapses and selectively increased binding to neuroligin-1 and neuroligin-3 without changing binding to neuroligin-2 or LRRTM2. Importantly, we provide the first experimental evidence supporting the notion that the position A687 of neurexin-3&alpha; and the N-terminal sequences of neuroligins may contribute to the stability of &alpha;-neurexin&ndash;neuroligin-1 trans-synaptic interactions and that these interactions may specifically regulate the postsynaptic strength of excitatory synapses.</p>

                <p>As evidence mounts that the cardiac-sympathetic nervous system reacts to challenging cognitive settings, we ask if these responses are epiphenomenal companions or if there is evidence suggesting a more intertwined role of this system with cognitive function. Healthy male and female human participants performed an approach-avoidance paradigm, trading off monetary reward for painful electric shock, while we recorded simultaneous electroencephalographic and cardiac-sympathetic signals. Participants were reward sensitive but also experienced approach-avoidance "conflict" when the subjective appeal of the reward was near equivalent to the revulsion of the cost. Drift-diffusion model parameters suggested that participants managed conflict in part by integrating larger volumes of evidence into choices (wider decision boundaries). Late alpha-band (neural) dynamics were consistent with widening decision boundaries serving to combat reward sensitivity and spread attention more fairly to all dimensions of available information. Independently, wider boundaries were also associated with cardiac "contractility" (an index of sympathetically mediated positive inotropy). We also saw evidence of conflict-specific "collaboration" between the neural and cardiac-sympathetic signals. In states of high conflict, the alignment (i.e., product) of alpha dynamics and contractility were associated with a further widening of the boundary, independent of either signal's singular association. Cross-trial coherence analyses provided additional evidence that the autonomic systems controlling cardiac-sympathetics might influence the assessment of information streams during conflict by disrupting or overriding reward processing. We conclude that cardiac-sympathetic control might play a critical role, in collaboration with cognitive processes, during the approach-avoidance conflict in humans.</p>

                <p>During adolescence, cannabis experimentation is common, and its association with interindividual variations in brain maturation well studied. Cellular and molecular underpinnings of these system-level relationships are, however, unclear. We thus conducted a three-step study. First, we exposed adolescent male mice to -9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) or a synthetic cannabinoid WIN 55,212-2 (WIN) and assessed differentially expressed genes (DEGs), spine numbers, and dendritic complexity in their frontal cortex. Second, in human (male) adolescents, we examined group differences in cortical thickness in 34 brain regions, using magnetic resonance imaging, between those who experimented with cannabis before age 16 (<I>n</I> = 140) and those who did not (<I>n</I> = 327). Finally, we correlated spatially these group differences with gene expression of human homologs of mouse-identified DEGs. The spatial expression of 13 THC-related human homologs of DEGs correlated with cannabis-related variations in cortical thickness, and virtual histology revealed coexpression patterns of these 13 genes with cell-specific markers of astrocytes, microglia, and a type of pyramidal cells enriched in dendrite-regulating genes. Similarly, the spatial expression of 18 WIN-related human homologs of DEGs correlated with group differences in cortical thickness and showed coexpression patterns with the same three cell types. Gene ontology analysis indicated that 37 THC-related human homologs are enriched in neuron projection development, while 33 WIN-related homologs are enriched in processes associated with learning and memory. In mice, we observed spine loss and lower dendritic complexity in pyramidal cells of THC-exposed animals (vs controls). Experimentation with cannabis during adolescence may influence cortical thickness by impacting glutamatergic synapses and dendritic arborization.</p>

                <p>Decision bias influences estimates of the absolute visual threshold. However, most psychophysical estimates of the murine absolute visual threshold have not taken bias into account. Here we developed a one-alternative forced choice (1AFC) assay to assess the decision bias of mice at the absolute visual threshold via the theory of signal detection and compared our approach with the more conventional high-threshold theoretic approach. In the 1AFC assay, mice of both sexes were trained to signal whether they detected a flash stimulus. We directly measured both hit and false alarm rates, which were used to estimate <I>d'</I>. Using the theory of signal detection, we obtained absolute thresholds by interpolating the intensity where <I>d' </I>= 1 from <I>d'</I>-psychometric functions. This gave bias-independent estimates of the absolute visual threshold which ranged over sixfold, averaging ~1 R* in 1,000 rods (<I>n</I> = 7 mice). To obtain high-threshold theoretic estimates of the absolute visual threshold from the same mice, we estimated threshold intensities from the frequency of seeing curves, corrected for guessing. This gave us thresholds that were strongly correlated with decision bias, ranging over 13-fold and averaged ~1 R* in 2,500 rods. We conclude that the theory of signal detection uses false alarms to overcome decision bias and narrow the range of threshold estimates in mice, providing a powerful tool for understanding detection behavior near absolute visual threshold.</p>

                <p>Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a significant global health issue. Despite historically higher rates among men, AUD prevalence and negative alcohol-related outcomes in women are rising. Loneliness in humans has been associated with increased alcohol use, and traditional rodent drinking models involve single housing, presenting challenges for studying social enrichment. We developed LIQ PARTI (Lick Instance Quantifier with Poly-Animal RFID Tracking Integration), an open-source tool to examine home cage continuous access two-bottle choice drinking behavior in a group-housed setting, investigating the influence of sex and social isolation on ethanol consumption and bout microstructure in C57Bl/6J mice. LIQ PARTI, based on our previously developed single-housed LIQ HD system, accurately tracks drinking behavior using capacitive-based sensors and RFID technology. Group-housed female mice exhibited higher ethanol preference than males, while males displayed a unique undulating pattern of ethanol preference linked to cage changes, suggesting a potential stress or novelty-related response. Chronic ethanol intake distinctly altered bout microstructure between male and female mice, highlighting sex and social environmental influences on drinking behavior. Social isolation with the LIQ HD system amplified fluid intake and ethanol preference in both sexes, accompanied by sex- and fluid-dependent changes in bout microstructure. However, these effects largely reversed upon resocialization, indicating the plasticity of these behaviors in response to social context. Utilizing a novel group-housed home cage lickometer device, our findings illustrate the critical interplay of sex and housing conditions in voluntary alcohol drinking behaviors in C57Bl/6J mice, facilitating nuanced insights into the potential contributions to AUD etiology.</p>

                Background Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) were used or are being used in the manufacturing of products, including consumer-use products. The resulting environmental contamination has led to widespread human exposure. This review aimed to scope the characteristics of evidence covered and applied methodology of evidence to understand -- regardless of any results on the association of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and PFAS -- if a new systematic review would be justified. Methods We systematically identified reports investigating associations of PFAS with GDM following a pre-specified and pre-registered PECO framework and protocol. Results The previous systematic reviews included 8-11 reports and either conducted meta-analyses stratified by comparator, analyzed results based on only high and low exposure categories, or pooled results across comparators. Included 20 reports presented data on 24 PFAS with PFOA, PFOS, PFHxS, PFNA, and PFDA being examined in almost all. The comparators employed were heterogeneous across the reports. Conclusions Because data from at least one new report on GDM is available since the previous systematic reviews and heterogeneous comparators, an updated systematic review using SWiM could add value to the literature.

                Objective To determine whether economic factors are crucial in empowering women, guiding them towards growth and development opportunities, achieving empowerment, and contributing to two sustainable development goals of the 2030 development agenda: ending poverty and achieving gender equality. Methodology The research was foundational, with a phenomenological and hermeneutic design. The applied technique was in-depth interviews with 12 women who had started a business within the last five years in a region of Peru. Results It is evident that economic factors are decisive in business experiences and decisions, highlighting the necessity of having contingency funds to prevent operational impacts. Through entrepreneurship, women achieved economic independence, enabling them to support their families and impacting their empowerment. It concludes that to promote economic opportunity equality, addressing financing needs, encouraging economic independence, strengthening family empowerment, improving customer management, and facilitating access to government funds are essential. Conclusions The narrative of the participants provides a solid foundation for designing specific policies and support programs that boost the economic empowerment of women entrepreneurs and encourage their active participation in the business sphere.

                Introduction Developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE) is characterized by seizures that are difficult to control for a long time and affect development in children who are previously normal or delayed. Therefore, children with DEE should be diagnosed promptly because certain types of the disease respond well to specific medications. In developing countries with limited universal coverage for whole exome sequencing (WES), identifying key clinical features in this patient group will help us make more accurate selections for investigations. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of WES and its common clinical features in children with epileptic encephalopathy. Methods Ten volunteers aged 0-15 years were diagnosed with epilepsy with two or more symptoms of drug-resistant epilepsy, developmental delays, and abnormal nervous system/or dysmorphic features, and their electroencephalogram (EEG) showed abnormal background or specific patterns of epileptiform discharges. These were subjected to WES for the standard > 400 genes in the epilepsy panel. Results The established diagnosis was 4/10. Two known pathogenic variants, SCN2A and PCDH19. Two novel pathological variants, CHD2 and SCN1A. These are drug-resistant epilepsy, which is initially difficult to control and cannot stop antiseizure medications. Out of the 2/4 had moderate to severe intellectual disability. 3/4 had generalized epileptiform discharge activities. Conclusions This study showed a similar detection rate to that of a previous WES study. All the patients had difficult-to-treat epilepsy. For those who have not found abnormalities with the same clinical symptoms, further examinations using other methods should be conducted.

                <p>by Joshua G. Schraiber, Michael D. Edge, Matt Pennell</p>

In both statistical genetics and phylogenetics, a major goal is to identify correlations between genetic loci or other aspects of the phenotype or environment and a focal trait. In these 2 fields, there are sophisticated but disparate statistical traditions aimed at these tasks. The disconnect between their respective approaches is becoming untenable as questions in medicine, conservation biology, and evolutionary biology increasingly rely on integrating data from within and among species, and once-clear conceptual divisions are becoming increasingly blurred. To help bridge this divide, we lay out a general model describing the covariance between the genetic contributions to the quantitative phenotypes of different individuals. Taking this approach shows that standard models in both statistical genetics (e.g., genome-wide association studies; GWAS) and phylogenetic comparative biology (e.g., phylogenetic regression) can be interpreted as special cases of this more general quantitative-genetic model. The fact that these models share the same core architecture means that we can build a unified understanding of the strengths and limitations of different methods for controlling for genetic structure when testing for associations. We develop intuition for why and when spurious correlations may occur analytically and conduct population-genetic and phylogenetic simulations of quantitative traits. The structural similarity of problems in statistical genetics and phylogenetics enables us to take methodological advances from one field and apply them in the other. We demonstrate by showing how a standard GWAS technique—including both the genetic relatedness matrix (GRM) as well as its leading eigenvectors, corresponding to the principal components of the genotype matrix, in a regression model—can mitigate spurious correlations in phylogenetic analyses. As a case study, we re-examine an analysis testing for coevolution of expression levels between genes across a fungal phylogeny and show that including eigenvectors of the covariance matrix as covariates decreases the false positive rate while simultaneously increasing the true positive rate. More generally, this work provides a foundation for more integrative approaches for understanding the genetic architecture of phenotypes and how evolutionary processes shape it.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The introduction of disease-modifying therapies for multiple sclerosis (MS) has led to a deceleration of disease course over the years. Although decreased relapse rate constitutes a factor, the role of relapse-associated worsening (RAW) and progression independent of relapse activity (PIRA) in MS course deceleration is still unclear.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We retrospectively examined long-term Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) progression in patients referred to the MS Center of Montichiari (Italy) and diagnosed with relapsing–remitting MS from 1980 to 2022. To isolate PIRA, we deducted all EDSS changes associated with relapses from overall EDSS change. We compared the relative contribution of PIRA and RAW to EDSS progression in patients diagnosed in different periods using mixed-effects models.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 1,405 patients were included in the study, of whom 231 were diagnosed in 1980–1996 (pre-treatment era), 577 in 1997–2008 (injectable disease-modifying therapy era), and 597 after 2008 (oral drugs, monoclonal antibodies, and anti-CD20 era). Across ages, both PIRA and RAW were reduced in patients diagnosed in more recent periods as compared with earlier periods. The average contribution of PIRA to overall EDSS progression was already predominant in patients diagnosed in 1980–1996 (78%) and in 1997–2008 (76%), but it was significantly increased (<i>p</i> = 0.0009) in patients diagnosed in later years (87%).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The deceleration of MS course observed throughout the years is determined not only by fewer RAW events, but also by a reduction in PIRA. However, the shift toward a mostly relapse-independent progression highlights the importance of evaluating new therapies based on their effect on PIRA. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                Background The utility of synthetic data in benchmark studies depends on its ability to closely mimic real-world conditions and to reproduce results obtained from experimental data. Here, we evaluate the performance of differential abundance tests for 16S metagenomic data. Building on the benchmark study by Nearing et al. (1), who assessed 14 differential abundance tests using 38 experimental datasets in a case-control design, we validate their findings by generating synthetic datasets that mimics the experimental data. We will employ statistical tests to rigorously assess the similarity between synthetic and experimental data and to validate the conclusions on the performance of these tests drawn by Nearing et al. (1). This protocol adheres to the SPIRIT guidelines and is, to our knowledge, the first of its kind in computational benchmark studies. Methods We replicate Nearing et al.’s (1) methodology, incorporating synthetic data simulated using two distinct tools, mirroring each of the 38 experimental datasets. Equivalence tests will be conducted on 43 data characteristics comparing synthetic and experimental data, complemented by principal component analysis for overall similarity assessment. The 14 differential abundance tests will be applied to both synthetic and experimental datasets, evaluating the consistency of significant feature identification and the number of significant features per tool. Correlation analysis and multiple regression will explore how differences between synthetic and experimental data characteristics may affect the results. Conclusions Synthetic data enables the validation of findings through controlled experiments. We assess how well synthetic data replicates experimental data, validate previous findings and delineate the strengths and limitations of synthetic data in benchmark studies. Moreover, to our knowledge this is the first computational benchmark study to systematically incorporate synthetic data for validating differential abundance methods while strictly adhering to a pre-specified study protocol following SPIRIT guidelines, contributing significantly to transparency, reproducibility, and unbiased research.

                Abstract* Background Increased expression of signal peptide-CUB-EGF domain-containing protein 3 (SCUBE3) and Transforming Growth Factor-β1 (TGF-β1) has been thought to influence the fibrosis process in many tissues. However, increased expression of these two factors has never been assessed in pleural fibrosis. Pleural fibrosis is a disease that usually results from various infectious processes, such as empyema. Fibrosis formation is recently known to be prevented by Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), which is the most potent active substance found in Gambir (Uncaria gambir Roxb) leaves. Thus, further research is needed to determine the potential of EGCG to inhibit the process of pleural fibrosis caused by empyema. Methods An in vitro experimental study with post test-only controlled group was conducted on the pleural tissue of all patients who underwent decortication surgery due to empyema at Dr. M. Djamil Hospital, Padang, Indonesia between March 1st and April 30, 2024. Case samples were obtained by consecutive sampling, and three patients who met the inclusion criteria were obtained. Pleural tissue in each patient was then divided into several groups based on the treatment, namely the control group, 50 μg EGCG administration group, and 100 μg EGCG administration group. We used to determine SCUBE3 and TGF-β1 genes expression. Data were tested using ANOVA and Least Significant Difference (LSD) tests. Results There were significant differences in the SCUBE3 and TGF-β1 genes expression of 50 μg and 100 μg EGCG administration groups and the control groups in the 2 × 2 cm sample preparation (p=0.002) (p=0.014, respectively). Significant differences in TGF-β1 expression were also found between the groups treated with EGCG 50 μg and 100 μg and the control group in the 1 × 1 cm preparation (p=0.019). Conclusion EGCG can potentially decrease SCUBE3 and TGF-β1 expression in patients with pleural empyema.

                Background This study critically examines the dynamics of corruption within Ethiopia’s dam construction projects, focusing on the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD the Gilgel Gibe series, and Genale Dawa. The research highlights how weak management practices, insufficient oversight, and centralized decision-making, resulting in contribute to inflated costs, project delays, and compromised construction quality. A comprehensive understanding of these issues is crucial for addressing the challenges that impede Ethiopia’s infrastructure development. Methods A qualitative research approach was employed, integrating both primary and secondary data sources. The study utilized four theoretical frameworks—Principal-Agent Theory, Rent-Seeking Theory, Institutional Theory, and Neo-Patrimonialism—to analyze the structural and behavioral factors enabling corruption in Ethiopia’s dam construction projects. Results The study found that corruption is largely driven by weak management practices, insufficient oversight, and centralized decision-making. These factors contribute to inflated project costs, significant delays, and compromised construction quality. The lack of transparency and inadequate monitoring exacerbate these issues, leading to inefficient resource use and undermining the projects’ intended benefits. Economic impacts include increased public debt and strained financial resources. Socially, corruption erodes public trust and adversely affects the communities involved. The findings also highlight how information asymmetry and misaligned incentives contribute to corruption, with weak governance structures and informal networks further exacerbating the problem. These issues lead to cost overruns, increased debt, and diminished public confidence, which negatively impacts development outcomes. Conclusions While corruption in Ethiopia’s dam construction projects poses significant challenges, it is not insurmountable. Strengthening legal and regulatory frameworks, enhancing institutional capacity, promoting community participation, and leveraging international cooperation are crucial for mitigating these risks. Recommendations include implementing e-procurement systems, establishing independent oversight bodies, and promoting transparency to ensure these mega projects achieve their intended economic and social benefits.

                The year 2023 marked the ten-year anniversary of Chinese President Xi Jinping inaugurating the ambitious Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) during his state visit to Kazakhstan. This article discusses China’s approach towards Central Asian countries under the BRI and their responses. While China has evidently profited from expanding connectivity along the ancient silk road and meeting its strategic interests, it is essential to understand whether Central Asian states have equally benefited from this initiative. Furthermore, the concern of debt-trap diplomacy has been prevalent in low-income countries where BRI has been operational. In this context, the article seeks to locate Central Asia in BRI, evaluating its impact on the region to determine if the BRI is a win-win for both the parties involved as touted by China. This article argues that despite differing interests and concerns about potential debt-traps, the BRI has been largely beneficial for both China and Central Asia given that BRI investments and projects remain crucial for the growth and development of these states and the region.

                Background Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and Enterococcus faecalis are pathogenic bacteria of the oral cavity that cause various diseases such as periodontitis and endodontics. These bacteria are easily resistant to antibiotics. Photodynamic inactivation (PDI) is a method of inactivating microorganisms that utilizes light to activate a photosensitizer agent (PS) that produces reactive oxygen species causing cell lysis. Methods This study used the PDI method with a 405 nm diode laser at various energy density with the addition PS curcumin or chlorophyll Alfalfa, as much as 1.6 mg/ml on A. actinomycetemcomitans and E. faecalis bacteria. Results The study on E. faecalis bacteria showed that the energy density diode laser irradiation of 1.59 J/cm² gave the percentage of E. faecalis bacteria death 36.7% without PS, 69.30% with the addition of chlorophyll Medicago sativa L and 89.42% with the addition of curcumin. Meanwhile, the bacteria A. actinomycetemcomitans showed that the energy density diode laser irradiation of 1.59 J/cm² gave the percentage of bacterial death 35.81% without PS, 64.39% with the addition of chlorophyll Medicago sativa L and 89.82% with the addition of curcumin. PS was critical to the success of the PDI. Conclusions The addition of PS curcumin increased the effectiveness of reducing bacteria E. faecalis and A. actinomycetemcomitans compared to chlorophyll Medicago sativa L.

                Background New methods for processing ‘touch’ or trace biological samples is an ongoing priority for forensic caseworking laboratories. These samples often contain materials from multiple individuals in varying quantities and/or degrees of degradation. Rapid characterization of cellular material before DNA profiling can allow laboratories to screen samples for the presence of multiple contributors or the amount of biological material present. Methods This dataset contains autofluorescence and morphological profiles of epidermal cell populations analyzed using Imaging Flow Cytometry. The epidermal samples were aged for varying amounts of time prior to analysis. Multiple samples from the same individual were also collected to assess profile variations within and across the contributors. Conclusions This data set may be used to investigate variability in epidermal cell populations from different individuals and potential forensic signatures contained within the non-genetic components that comprise touch biological evidence.

                We developed a new time-calibrated tree incorporating primarily endemic along with some cryptic Ryukyu islands cicada data, following the recent publication of global cicada data by Marshall et al. (2018), Łukasik et al. (2018), Simon et al. (2019), Price et al. (2019), and Hill et al. (2021).  A total of 352 specimens were analyzed using BEAST v1. X software with a relaxed clock model. Fossil calibrations as old as Triassic were adopted largely following Johnson et al. (2018) and Moulds (2018), and a Quaternary geological event calibration was adopted following Osozawa et al. (2012, 2021b) and input into BEAST v1. X. Our timetree suggests that Tettigarctidae had a cicada basal lineage as old as 200.63 Ma, with Derotettiginae the next oldest lineage at 99.2 Ma. Tibicininae is a sister of the remaining subfamilies of Tettigomyiinae, Cicadettinae, and Cicadidae, and their species level differentiation and radiation began at 40.57 Ma. The Cicadinae clade consists of specific tribes with paraphyletic relationship, and the vicariance and adaptive radiation generated many cryptic species in each tribe. We estimated base substitution rate as a function of age, and the result strongly indicates an exponential increase of base substitution rate in recent geologic time. The consequent increase in cicada biodiversity, including generation of cryptic species in the Ryukyu Islands and surroundings, may have been driven by the generation and spreading of C4 grasses and coeval Quaternary climate change.

     alt="Fish That Fish for Fish—A Peculiar Location of “Fishing Motoneurons” in the Striated Frogfish Antennarius striatus"/>
<p>The first dorsal fin of frogfish is used to attract fish as prey and not involved in swimming. Motoneurons for the first dorsal fin (fishing motoneurons) are distributed in the dorsolateral zone of ventral horn, while those for the second, third, and fourth dorsal fins of frogfish, and first dorsal fin of filefish are present in the ventrolateral zone. Fishing motoneurons presumably assume this peculiar position in concert with the evolution of fishing behavior by the first dorsal fin. 

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>In lophiform teleosts, the first dorsal fin has evolved as a specialized structure called the “illicium” equipped with the esca, which is a modified skin flap used to attract small fish for predation. The motor control system of the illicium, however, remained unknown. The present study investigated the innervation of muscles for the illicium and morphology of motoneurons innervating them in the striated frogfish <i>Antennarius striatus</i>. We found that the dorsal ramus of occipital nerve innervates the muscles. Motoneurons for the illicium are present in the dorsolateral zone of ventral horn at the medullo-spinal boundary level, forming a cluster somewhat distinct from other motoneurons of the ventral horn. Motoneurons for the second to fourth dorsal fins and pectoral fin were located in the ventrolateral and ventromedial zones of ventral horn, respectively, whereas those of the dorsal trunk muscle in the dorsomedial zone of ventral horn. Motoneurons for the first dorsal spine of white-spotted pygmy filefish were also investigated for species comparison and were found to locate in the ventrolateral zone of ventral horn, similarly to the motoneurons for the second to fourth dorsal fins of the frogfish. These results suggest that motoneurons for the illicium have become segregated from other motoneurons to be situated in an unusual dorsal position for a motoneuron pool of a dorsal fin, in concert with the evolution of specialized “fishing behavior” performed by the illicium.</p>

<p>This study shows CART-expressing elements in the brain, spinal cord, and retina of a gecko, <i>Hemidactylus leschenaultii</i>. Two putative bioactive CART peptides in this gecko showed several similarities with the avian and mammalian CART. Arcuate nucleus CART neurons were organized into two distinct subdivisions, but only those in the dorsal part responded to NPY via Y<sub>1</sub>-receptor agonist treatment. Conserved neuroanatomy and interaction with NPY suggest CART as an essential molecule and a regulator of energy balance in <i>H. leschenaultii</i>. 

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Neuropeptide cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) is widely expressed in the brains of teleosts, amphibians, birds, and mammals and has emerged as a conserved regulator of energy balance across these vertebrate phyla. However, as yet, there is no information on CART in the reptilian brain. We characterized the cDNA encoding CART and mapped CART-containing elements in the brain of gecko, <i>Hemidactylus leschenaultii</i> (<i>hl</i>) using a specific anti-CART antiserum. We report a 683-bp <i>hlcart</i> transcript containing a 336-bp open reading frame, which encodes a putative 111-amino acid hl-preproCART. The 89-amino acid hl-proCART generated from hl-preproCART produced two putative bioactive hl-CART-peptides. These bioactive CART-peptides were &gt; 93% similar with those in rats/humans. Although reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) detected <i>hlcart</i>-transcript in the brain, CART-containing neurons/fibers were widely distributed in the telencephalon, diencephalon, mesencephalon, rhombencephalon, spinal cord, and retina. The mitral cells in olfactory bulb, neurons in the paraventricular, periventricular, arcuate (Arc), Edinger–Westphal, and brainstem nuclei were intensely CART-positive. In view of antagonistic roles of neuropeptide Y (NPY) and CART in energy balance in the framework of mammalian hypothalamus, we probed CART–NPY interaction in the hypothalamus of <i>H. leschenaultii</i>. Double immunofluorescence showed a dense NPY-innervation of Arc CART neurons. <i>Ex vivo</i> hypothalamic slices treated with NPY/NPY-Y<sub>1</sub>-receptor agonist significantly reduced <i>hlcart</i>-mRNA levels in the Arc-containing tissues and CART-ir in the dorsal-Arc. However, CART-ir in ventral-Arc was unaffected. NPY via Y<sub>1</sub>-receptors may regulate energy balance by inhibiting dArc CART neurons. This study on CART in a reptilian brain fills the current void in literature and underscores the conserved feature of the neuropeptide across the entire vertebrate phyla.</p>

<p>Comparison of anatomy and morphology of spinal cord of Wistar (W) and Dark Agouti (DA) rats. Top: an algorithm of the analysis of the neurochemical labeling on the spinal cord slices using NeuN-staining and a ration between the number of motor neurons and non-motor neurons in DA and W rats. Bottom: a ratio between an area of the gray matter and white matter in DA and W rats; and a ratio between the number of neurons expressing parvalbumin (PV) and calbindin (CB) in regions of interest (ROI) in DA and W rats.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Rat strains differ in physiology, behavior, and recovery after central nervous system injury. To assess these differences, we compared the gross and local anatomy and neuromorphology of the lumbar spinal cord of the Wistar and Dark Agouti (DA) strains. The key findings include (i) distinct spatial relationships between vertebrae and spinal segments in the two strains; (ii) Wistar rats have larger volumes of spinal cord gray and white matter; (iii) DA rats have smaller total neuronal populations, thus indicating an expectation of smaller local neuronal populations; (iv) this expectation was confirmed for interneurons expressing calbindin 28 kDa. But contrary to expectations, (v) DA rats had more numerous populations of the interneurons expressing parvalbumin and a population of α-motoneurons. Consequently, these strains displayed divergent ratios in specific spinal neuronal populations. Researchers should consider these inter-strain differences when comparing data across different strains.</p>

                Cellular senescence is a cell state characterized by resistance to apoptosis and stable cell cycle arrest. Senescence was first observed in mitotic cells in vitro. Recent evidence from in vivo studies and human tissue indicates that postmitotic cells, including neurons, may also become senescent. The quiescent cell state of neurons and inconsistent descriptions of neuronal senescence across studies, however, have caused confusion in this burgeoning field. We summarize evidence demonstrating that exit from G0 quiescence may protect neurons against apoptosis and predispose them toward senescence. Additionally, we propose the term ‘neurescent’ for senescent neurons and introduce the cell state, GX, to describe cell cycle arrest achieved by passing through G0 quiescence. Criteria are provided to identify neurescent cells, distinguish them from G0 quiescent neurons, and compare neurescent phenotypes with classic replicative senescence.

                Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), a collection of small proteins with important roles in classical innate immunity, have been extensively studied in multiple organisms, particularly in Drosophila melanogaster. Advances in CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing have allowed individual AMP functions to be dissected, revealing specific and selective roles in host defense. Recent findings have also revealed many unexpected contributions of endogenous AMPs to neuronal functions and neurodegenerative diseases, and have shed light on the intersections between innate immunity and neurobiology. We explore the intricate relationships between AMPs and sleep regulation, memory formation, as well as traumatic brain injury and several neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and Parkinson's disease (PD). Understanding the diverse functions of AMPs opens new avenues for neuroinflammation and neurodegenerative disease research and potential therapeutic development.

                The diverse etiologies of the genetic neurodegenerative disorder known as primary familial brain calcification have dimmed hopes for curative therapies. However, two new papers in Neuron provide a reason for optimism by identifying mechanisms involved in brain phosphate transport and a promising target for restoring phosphate balance in the brain.

                Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin sequencing (ATAC-Seq) is a widely used technique to explore gene regulatory mechanisms. For most ATAC-Seq data from healthy and diseased tissues such as tumors, chromatin accessibility measurement represents a mixed signal from multiple cell types. In this work, we derive reliable chromatin accessibility marker peaks and reference profiles for most non-malignant cell types frequently observed in the microenvironment of human tumors. We then integrate these data into the EPIC deconvolution framework (Racle et al., 2017) to quantify cell-type heterogeneity in bulk ATAC-Seq data. Our EPIC-ATAC tool accurately predicts non-malignant and malignant cell fractions in tumor samples. When applied to a human breast cancer cohort, EPIC-ATAC accurately infers the immune contexture of the main breast cancer subtypes.

                Stimulation of pancreatic beta cell regeneration could be a therapeutic lead to treat diabetes. Unlike humans, the zebrafish can efficiently regenerate beta cells, notably from ductal pancreatic progenitors. To gain insight into the molecular pathways involved in this process, we established the transcriptomic profile of the ductal cells after beta cell ablation in the adult zebrafish. These data highlighted the protein phosphatase calcineurin (CaN) as a new potential modulator of beta cell regeneration. We showed that CaN overexpression abolished the regenerative response, leading to glycemia dysregulation. On the opposite, CaN inhibition increased ductal cell proliferation and subsequent beta cell regeneration. Interestingly, the enhanced proliferation of the progenitors was paradoxically coupled with their exhaustion. This suggests that the proliferating progenitors are next entering in differentiation. CaN appears as a guardian which prevents an excessive progenitor proliferation to preserve the pool of progenitors. Altogether, our findings reveal CaN as a key player in the balance between proliferation and differentiation to enable a proper beta cell regeneration.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98363">Pathogenic Huntingtin aggregates alter actin organization and cellular stiffness resulting in stalled clathrin mediated endocytosis</a></h4>

              
                Aggregation of mutant forms of Huntingtin is the underlying feature of neurodegeneration observed in Huntington's disorder. In addition to neurons, cellular processes in non-neuronal cell types are also shown to be affected. Cells expressing neurodegeneration-associated mutant proteins show altered uptake of ligands, suggestive of impaired endocytosis, in a manner as yet unknown. Using live cell imaging, we show that clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) is affected in <i>Drosophila</i> hemocytes and mammalian cells containing Huntingtin aggregates. This is also accompanied by alterations in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton resulting in increased cellular stiffness. Further, we find that Huntingtin aggregates sequester actin and actin-modifying proteins. Overexpression of Hip1 or Arp3 (actin-interacting proteins) could restore CME and cellular stiffness in cells containing Huntingtin aggregates. Neurodegeneration driven by pathogenic Huntingtin was also rescued upon overexpression of either Hip1 or Arp3 in <i>Drosophila</i>. Examination of other pathogenic aggregates revealed that TDP-43 also displayed defective CME, altered actin organization and increased stiffness, similar to pathogenic Huntingtin. Together, our results point to an intimate connection between dysfunctional CME, actin misorganization and increased cellular stiffness caused by alteration in the local intracellular environment by pathogenic aggregates.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98949">Transcriptional responses in a mouse model of silicone wire embolization induced acute retinal artery ischemia and reperfusion</a></h4>

              
                Acute retinal ischemia and ischemia-reperfusion injury are the primary causes of retinal neural cell death and vision loss in retinal artery occlusion (RAO). The absence of an accurate mouse model for simulating the retinal ischemic process has hindered progress in developing neuroprotective agents for RAO. We developed a unilateral pterygopalatine ophthalmic artery occlusion (UPOAO) mouse model using silicone wire embolization combined with carotid artery ligation. The survival of retinal ganglion cells and visual function were evaluated to determine the duration of ischemia. Immunofluorescence staining, optical coherence tomography, and haematoxylin and eosin staining were utilized to assess changes in major neural cell classes and retinal structure degeneration at two reperfusion durations. Transcriptomics was employed to investigate alterations in the pathological process of UPOAO following ischemia and reperfusion, highlighting transcriptomic differences between UPOAO and other retinal ischemia-reperfusion models. The UPOAO model successfully replicated the acute interruption of retinal blood supply observed in RAO. 60 min of Ischemia led to significant loss of major retinal neural cells and visual function impairment. Notable thinning of the inner retinal layer, especially the ganglion cell layer, was evident post-UPOAO. Temporal transcriptome analysis revealed various pathophysiological processes related to immune cell migration, oxidative stress, and immune inflammation during the non-reperfusion and reperfusion periods. A pronounced increase in microglia within the retina and peripheral leukocytes accessing the retina was observed during reperfusion periods. Comparison of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the UPOAO and high intraocular pressure models revealed specific enrichments in lipid and steroid metabolism-related genes in the UPOAO model. The UPOAO model emerges as a novel tool for screening pathogenic genes and promoting further therapeutic research in RAO.

                The discrete events of our narrative experience are organized by the neural substrate that underlies episodic memory. This narrative process is segmented into discrete units by event boundaries. This permits a replay process that acts to consolidate each event into a narrative memory. High frequency oscillations (HFOs) are a potential mechanism for synchronizing neural activity during these processes. Here, we use intracranial recordings from participants viewing and freely recalling a naturalistic stimulus. We show that hippocampal HFOs increase following event boundaries and that coincident hippocampal-cortical HFOs (co-HFOs) occur in cortical regions previously shown to underlie event segmentation (inferior parietal, precuneus, lateral occipital, inferior frontal cortices). We also show that event-specific patterns of co-HFOs that occur during event viewing re-occur following the subsequent three event boundaries (in decaying fashion) and also during recall. This is consistent with models that support replay as a mechanism for memory consolidation. Hence, HFOs may coordinate activity across brain regions serving widespread event segmentation, encode naturalistic memory, and bind representations to assemble memory of a coherent, continuous experience.

                MID1 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase of the tripartite motif (TRIM) subfamily of RING-containing protein. MID1 is involved in many basic biological processes, especially during embryonic development. Mutation, truncation or complete deletion of MID1 gene is the cause of Opitz G/BBB syndrome (OS). OS is a rare genetic disease of nervous system, which is characterized by midline structural development defects during embryogenesis, including structural brain abnormalities, developmental retardation and mental retardation. Although the function of MID1 has been studied for many years, the effect and mechanism of complete deletion of MID1 gene on OS nervous system still need to be further explored. Here we find that Mid1 gene is necessary for the normal development of hippocampus (HPC), and Mid1 gene knockout (Mid1-/y) mice showed a significant decrease in alpha rhythm in HPC and abnormal synchronization of gamma rhythm in prefrontal cortex and hippocampus (PFC-HPC), showing decreased synaptic plasticity and learning and memory dysfunction.

">Loss of Flower/FLWR-1 induces an increase in neuronal excitability and causes defective recycling of synaptic vesicles</a></h4>

              
                The Flower protein is proposed to couple synaptic vesicle fusion to recycling in different model organisms. It is supposed to trigger activity-dependent bulk endocytosis by conducting Ca2+ at endocytic sites. However, this mode of action is debated. Here, we investigate the role of the nematode homolog (FLWR-1) in neurotransmission in Caenorhabditis elegans. Our results confirm that FLWR-1 facilitates the recycling of synaptic vesicles at the neuromuscular junction. Ultrastructural analysis of synaptic boutons after hyperstimulation surprisingly reveals an accumulation of endosomal structures in flwr-1 mutants. These findings do not support a role of FLWR-1 in the formation of bulk endosomes but rather a function in their breakdown following cleavage from the plasma membrane. Unexpectedly, loss of FLWR-1 conveys increased neuronal excitability which causes an excitation-inhibition imbalance. Finally, we obtained evidence that this increased transmission at the neuromuscular junction might be caused by deregulation of MCA-3, the nematode homolog of the plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPase (PMCA).

">Perinatal Reduction of Genetically Aberrant Neurons from Human Cerebral Cortex</a></h4>

              
                Since human neurons are postmitotic and long-lived, the regulation of their genomic content is crucial. Normal neuronal function is uniquely dependent on gene dosage, with diverse genome copy number alterations (CNA) associated with neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric conditions. In this study, we evaluated the landscape of CNA arising in normal human brains, focusing on prenatal and perinatal ages. We surveyed ~5,897 CNA in >1,200 single neurons from human postmortem brain of individuals without a neurological diagnosis, ranging in age from gestational week (GW) 14 to 90 years old. Using Tn5-based single-cell whole-genome amplification (scWGA) and informatic advances to validate CNAs in single neurons, we determined that a striking proportion of neurons (up to 45%) in human prenatal cortex showed aberrant genomes, characterized by large-scale CNAs in multiple chromosomes, which reduces significantly during the perinatal period (p<0.1). Furthermore, we identified micronuclei in the developing cortex, reflecting genetic instability reminiscent of that described in early embryonic development. The scale of CNA appeared to alter the trajectory of neuronal elimination, as subchromosomal CNAs were more slowly eliminated, over the course of a lifetime. CNAs were depleted for dosage-sensitive genes and genes involved in neurodevelopmental disorders (p<.05), and thus represent genomic quality control mechanisms that eliminate selectively those neurons with CNA involving critical genes. Perinatal elimination of defective neuronal genomes may in turn reflect a developmental landmark essential for normal cognitive function.

">Electrophysiological decoding captures the temporal trajectory of face categorization in infants</a></h4>

              
                The adult human brain rapidly distinguishes between faces at around 170 milliseconds after stimulus onset. In the developing brain, however, the time course of face discrimination is poorly understood. To shed light on this issue, we presented human and nonhuman primate faces to five to thirteen-month-old infants in an event-related electroencephalography experiment. Using time-resolved decoding based on logistic regression we detected above-chance discrimination of human faces from nonhuman faces in a time window starting at around 200 milliseconds, originating from occipito-temporal electrodes. There was no evidence, however, for above-chance discrimination of individual human or individual nonhuman faces. Moreover, using neural network-based decoding, we delivered the proof of principle that face categorization but not individuation can be detected even at the level of single participants. These results indicate that rapid face categorization emerges already in preverbal infants.

">Computational neurodevelopment: infant decision-making in changing environments</a></h4>

              
                In recognition of the fact that most psychiatric conditions have neurodevelopmental origins, there is an increasing interest in applying the methodological and conceptual approaches from computational psychiatry to developmental cohorts. However, the challenge of acquiring and modelling behavioural responses in very young infants has thus far proven difficult to overcome. To address this we developed a novel gaze-contingent, cued-reversal paradigm that allowed 6-10 month old infants to make overt behavioural responses to assess learning of expectations and updating of behaviour in response to change. We then fit computational models to infant behaviour and, for the first time, were able to validate the winning model to the same standards as would be expected of adults (e.g. good parameter recoverability, model identifiability and simulated behavioural responses). Similar to prior findings in adults, model-based prediction error measures correlated with post-switch increases in pupil size; consistent with noradrenaline's hypothesised role in learning about change. Data-driven clustering based on model parameters revealed two infant behavioural subtypes hidden within the data; one with a perseverating profile and the other with a more exploratory decision-making pattern. This approach sheds new light on the classic finding that all infants under 12 months tend to perseverate. Crucially, there were no significant differences in age between the clusters, but differences in terms of adaptive skills and temperament measured via gold-standard developmental assessments. These results prime the field for infant computational psychiatry, demonstrating that we can reliably fit models to infant data and that the parameters from such models can identify subgroups with distinct cognitive profiles that are superior to those derived from the behavioural data alone.

	<p>Background: Advances in diagnostic procedures have led to an increasing rate of diagnosis of autoimmune encephalitis or paraneoplastic neurological syndrome (AE/PNS) among patients with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP)-like manifestations. Methods: In this narrative review, we first discuss the clinical characteristics of AE/PNS in comparison to those of PSP, followed by a discussion of diagnosis and treatment. Results: The antibodies involved in these conditions include anti-IgLON5, -Ma2, and -Ri antibodies, each of which has a characteristic clinical presentation. The steps in the diagnosis of AE/PNS in patients with PSP-like manifestations include (i) suspicion of AE/PNS based on clinical presentations atypical of PSP and (ii) antibody detection measures. Methods used to identify antibodies include a combination of tissue-based assays and confirmatory tests. The primary confirmatory tests include cell-based assays and immunoblotting. Treatments can be divided into immunotherapy and tumor therapies, the former of which includes acute and maintenance therapies. Conclusions: One of the major challenges of diagnosis is that existing reports on PSP-like patients with AE/PNS include only case reports, with the majority discussing antibodies other than anti-IgLON5 antibody. As such, more patients need to be evaluated to establish the relationship between antibodies and PSP-like manifestations.</p>

                <p>by Yi Luo, Terry Lohrenz, Ellen A. Lumpkin, P. Read Montague, Kenneth T. Kishida</p>

Expectations shape our perception, profoundly influencing how we interpret the world. Positive expectations about sensory stimuli can alleviate distress and reduce pain (e.g., placebo effect), while negative expectations may heighten anxiety and exacerbate pain (e.g., nocebo effect). To investigate the impact of the (an)hedonic aspect of expectations on subjective experiences, we measured neurobehavioral responses to the taste of hot sauce among participants with heterogeneous taste preferences. By identifying participants who “liked” versus those who strongly “disliked” spicy flavors and by providing contextual cues about the spiciness of the sauce to be tasted, we dissociated the effects of positive and negative expectations from sensory stimuli (i.e., visual and gustatory stimuli), which were the same across all participants. Our results indicate that positive expectations lead to modulations in the intensity of subjective experience. These modulations were accompanied by increased activity in brain regions previously linked to information integration and the placebo effect, including the anterior insula, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, as well as a predefined “pleasure signature.” In contrast, negative expectations decreased hedonic experience and increased neural activity in the previously validated “Neurological Pain Signature” network. These findings demonstrate that hedonic aspects of one’s expectations asymmetrically shape how the brain processes sensory input and associated behavioral reports of one’s subjective experiences of intensity, pleasure, and pain. Our results suggest a dissociable impact of hedonic information: positive expectations facilitate higher-level information integration and reward processing, while negative expectations prime lower-level nociceptive and affective processes. This study demonstrates the powerful role of hedonic expectations in shaping subjective reality and suggests potential avenues for consumer and therapeutic interventions targeting expectation-driven neural processes.

                <p>by Ana María Triana, Juha Salmi, Nicholas Mark Edward Alexander Hayward, Jari Saramäki, Enrico Glerean</p>

Our behavior and mental states are constantly shaped by our environment and experiences. However, little is known about the response of brain functional connectivity to environmental, physiological, and behavioral changes on different timescales, from days to months. This gives rise to an urgent need for longitudinal studies that collect high-frequency data. To this end, for a single subject, we collected 133 days of behavioral data with smartphones and wearables and performed 30 functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans measuring attention, memory, resting state, and the effects of naturalistic stimuli. We find traces of past behavior and physiology in brain connectivity that extend up as far as 15 days. While sleep and physical activity relate to brain connectivity during cognitively demanding tasks, heart rate variability and respiration rate are more relevant for resting-state connectivity and movie-watching. This unique data set is openly accessible, offering an exceptional opportunity for further discoveries. Our results demonstrate that we should not study brain connectivity in isolation, but rather acknowledge its interdependence with the dynamics of the environment, changes in lifestyle, and short-term fluctuations such as transient illnesses or restless sleep. These results reflect a prolonged and sustained relationship between external factors and neural processes. Overall, precision mapping designs such as the one employed here can help to better understand intraindividual variability, which may explain some of the observed heterogeneity in fMRI findings. The integration of brain connectivity, physiology data and environmental cues will propel future environmental neuroscience research and support precision healthcare.

                Background Mucormycosis is a life-threatening fungal infection. Rhino-orbito-cerebral mucormycosis (ROCM) and pulmonary mucormycosis (PM) are the most common presentations. This systematic review focuses on the management of PM. Although the mortality from PM has improved over the last few decades, it is still high, at 49.8% (Muthu, Agarwal, et al., 2021). Objective The objective is to identify and map the management of PM. Design This review is designed for knowledge synthesis, with a systematic approach to identifying, synthesizing, and mapping treatment protocols for the management of PM. Methods This systematic review provides a clear, reproducible methodology. It is reported in accordance with PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses). Inclusion criteria were defined: peer-reviewed journal articles published in English from 2018 to 2023 relating to treatment protocols for PM, where the full text of the article was available. Exclusion criteria were also defined - articles that focus on limited treatment regimens, such as the use of amphotericin B only, or topics not relevant to the research question, such as fungal infections and pulmonary diseases unrelated to mucormycosis. Results The results span six years, from 2018 to 2023, with 355 articles identified. After removing duplicates, 227 papers remained. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied, with 202 articles excluded as a result. The remaining 19 articles were deemed relevant. In addition, seven relevant articles were identified via citation tracking and two articles identified by hand search. Thus, a total of 28 articles thus reviewed. The management of PM was mapped in tabular and diagrammatic form. Conclusion The results indicate that early diagnosis, early and aggressive surgery, and effective antifungals may improve survival. There is a shift away from using Am-B and a clear preference for L-AmB as a first-line antifungal. Posaconazole and Isavuconazole are the drugs of choice for stepdown, maintenance, and salvage therapy, and as alternative therapies. The control of co-morbidities is a crucial aspect of treatment. Cytokines and hyperbaric oxygen may be beneficial. The therapeutic value of iron chelators, zinc, and nebulized amphotericin B (NAB) merit further study.

                Despite the growing interest in social prescribing the diversification of health and social care strategies to support the well-being of patients has remained entrenched with a focus on the hospital setting within the Middle East. The United Arab Emirates has commenced progressing community mental health care to lead changes in how care and treatment are delivered within the United Arab Emirates. The authors adopted the use of the framework of Arksey and O’Malley (2005) to provide a systematic approach to searching the literature and creating a comprehensive foundation to guide the review. This scoping review provides a better understanding of the compatibility, content and outcomes of a selection of health models whilst also allowing further clarification before empirical studies. The scoping review findings will inform the proposed use of social prescribing as an actionable approach to create a focus on the need to include and empower the social determinants of mental health. This article proposes an evidence-based health strategy that supports and enhances recent additions to national legislation on the inclusion of the Mental Health Law within the United Arab Emirates to meditate and prevent inequities in addressing the mental health needs of citizens and residents within the nation’s diverse communities.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The hippocampus is important for social behavior and exhibits unusual structural plasticity in the form of continued production of new granule neurons throughout adulthood, but it is unclear how adult neurogenesis contributes to social interactions. In the present study, we suppressed neurogenesis using a pharmacogenetic mouse model and examined social investigation and aggression in adult male mice to investigate the role of hippocampal adult-born neurons in the expression of aggressive behavior. In simultaneous choice tests with stimulus mice placed in corrals, mice with complete suppression of adult neurogenesis in adulthood (TK mice) exhibited normal social investigation behaviors, indicating that new neurons are not required for social interest, social memory, or detection of and response to social olfactory signals. However, mice with suppressed neurogenesis displayed decreased offensive and defensive aggression in a resident-intruder paradigm, and less resistance in a social dominance test, relative to neurogenesis-intact controls, when paired with weight and strain-matched (CD-1) mice. During aggression tests, TK mice were frequently attacked by the CD-1 intruder mice, which never occurred with WTs, and normal CD-1 male mice investigated TK mice less than controls when corralled in the social investigation test. Importantly, TK mice showed normal aggression toward prey (crickets) and smaller, nonaggressive (olfactory bulbectomized) C57BL/6J intruders, suggesting that mice lacking adult neurogenesis do not avoid aggressive social interactions if they are much larger than their opponent and will clearly win. Taken together, our findings show that adult hippocampal neurogenesis plays an important role in the instigation of intermale aggression, possibly by weighting a cost–benefit analysis against confrontation in cases where the outcome of the fight is not clear.</p>

The EGFR-MYC axis promotes the transcription of STAMBPL1 and RNA splicing of EGFR. Inhibition of STAMBPL1 attenuates liver tumorigenesis and improves the antitumor activity of lenvatinib.

                Ubiquitination typically involves covalent linking of ubiquitin (Ub) to a lysine residue on a protein substrate. Recently, new facets of this process have emerged, including Ub modification of non-proteinaceous substrates like ADP-ribose by the DELTEX E3 ligase family. Here, we show that the DELTEX family member DTX3L expands this non-proteinaceous substrate repertoire to include single-stranded DNA and RNA. Although the N-terminal region of DTX3L contains single-stranded nucleic acid binding domains and motifs, the minimal catalytically competent fragment comprises the C-terminal RING and DTC domains (RD). DTX3L-RD catalyses ubiquitination of the 3’-end of single-stranded DNA and RNA, as well as double-stranded DNA with a 3’ overhang of two or more nucleotides. This modification is reversibly cleaved by deubiquitinases. NMR and biochemical analyses reveal that the DTC domain binds single-stranded DNA and facilitates the catalysis of Ub transfer from RING-bound E2-conjugated Ub. Our study unveils the direct ubiquitination of nucleic acids by DTX3L, laying the groundwork for understanding its functional implications.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92870">A novel bioinformatics pipeline for the identification of immune inhibitory receptors as potential therapeutic targets</a></h4>

              
                Despite major successes with inhibitory receptor blockade in cancer, the identification of novel inhibitory receptors as putative drug targets is needed due to lack of durable responses, therapy resistance, and side effects. Most inhibitory receptors signal via immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) and previous studies estimated that our genome contains over 1600 ITIM-bearing transmembrane proteins. However, testing and development of these candidates requires increased understanding of their expression patterns and likelihood to function as inhibitory receptor. Therefore, we designed a novel bioinformatics pipeline integrating machine learning-guided structural predictions and sequence-based likelihood models to identify putative inhibitory receptors. Using transcriptomics data of immune cells, we determined the expression of these novel inhibitory receptors, and classified them into previously proposed functional categories. Known and putative inhibitory receptors were expressed across different immune cell subsets with cell type-specific expression patterns. Furthermore, putative immune inhibitory receptors were differentially expressed in subsets of tumour infiltrating T cells. In conclusion, we present an inhibitory receptor pipeline that identifies 51 known and 390 novel human inhibitory receptors. This pipeline will support future drug target selection across diseases where therapeutic targeting of immune inhibitory receptors is warranted.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95285">LPS-induced systemic inflammation is suppressed by the PDZ motif peptide of ZO-1 via regulation of macrophage M1/M2 polarization</a></h4>

              
                The gram-negative bacterium lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is frequently administered to generate models of systemic inflammation. However, there are several side effects and no effective treatment for LPS-induced systemic inflammation. PEGylated PDZ peptide based on zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) was analyzed for its effects on systemic inflammation induced by LPS. PDZ peptide administration led to the restoration of tissue injuries (kidney, liver, and lung) and prevented alterations in biochemical plasma markers. The production of pro-inflammatory cytokines was significantly decreased in the plasma and lung BALF in the PDZ-administered mice. Flow cytometry analysis revealed the PDZ peptide significantly inhibited inflammation, mainly by decreasing the population of M1 macrophages, and neutrophils (immature and mature), and increasing M2 macrophages. Using RNA sequencing analysis, the expression levels of the NF-κB-related proteins were lower in PDZ-treated cells than in LPS-treated cells. In addition, wild-type PDZ peptide significantly increased mitochondrial membrane integrity and decreased LPS-induced mitochondria fission. Interestingly, PDZ peptide dramatically could reduce LPS-induced NF-κB signaling, ROS production, and the expression of M1 macrophage marker proteins, but increased the expression of M2 macrophage marker proteins. These results indicated that PEGylated PDZ peptide inhibits LPS-induced systemic inflammation, reducing tissue injuries and reestablishing homeostasis, and may be a therapeutic candidate against systemic inflammation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96190">A modified BPaL regimen for tuberculosis treatment replaces linezolid with inhaled spectinamides</a></h4>

              
                The Nix-TB clinical trial evaluated a new 6 month regimen containing three oral drugs; bedaquiline (B), pretomanid (Pa), and linezolid (L) (BPaL regimen) for the treatment of tuberculosis (TB). This regimen achieved remarkable results as almost 90% of the multidrug-resistant or extensively drug-resistant TB participants were cured but many patients also developed severe adverse events (AEs). The AEs were associated with the long-term administration of the protein synthesis inhibitor linezolid. Spectinamide 1599 is also a protein synthesis inhibitor of <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> with an excellent safety profile, but it lacks oral bioavailability. Here, we propose to replace L in the BPaL regimen with spectinamide (S) administered via inhalation and we demonstrate that inhaled spectinamide 1599, combined with BPa ––BPaS regimen––has similar efficacy to that of the BPaL regimen while simultaneously avoiding the L-associated AEs. The BPaL and BPaS regimens were compared in the BALB/c and C3HeB/FeJ murine chronic TB efficacy models. After 4-weeks of treatment, both regimens promoted equivalent bactericidal effects in both TB murine models. However, treatment with BPaL resulted in significant weight loss and the complete blood count suggested the development of anemia. These effects were not similarly observed in mice treated with BPaS. BPaL and BPa, but not the BPaS treatment, also decreased myeloid to erythroid ratio suggesting the S in the BPaS regimen was able to recover this effect. Moreover, the BPaL also increased concentration of proinflammatory cytokines in bone marrow compared to mice receiving BPaS regimen. These combined data suggest that inhaled spectinamide 1599 combined with BPa is an effective TB regimen without L-associated AEs.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92962">Alasemenia, the earliest ovule with three wings and without cupule</a></h4>

              
                The ovules or seeds (fertilized ovules) with wings are widespread and especially important for wind dispersal. However, the earliest ovules in the Famennian of the Late Devonian are rarely known about the dispersal syndrome and usually surrounded by a cupule. From Xinhang, Anhui, China, we now report a new taxon of Famennian ovules, <i>Alasemenia tria</i> gen. et sp. nov. Each ovule of this taxon possesses three integumentary wings evidently extending outwards, folding inwards along abaxial side and enclosing most part of nucellus. The ovule is borne terminally on smooth dichotomous branches and lacks a cupule. <i>Alasemenia</i> suggests that the integuments of the earliest ovules without a cupule evolved functions in probable photosynthetic nutrition and wind dispersal. It indicates that the seed wing originated earlier than other wind dispersal mechanisms such as seed plume and pappus, and that three- or four-winged seeds were followed by seeds with less wings. Mathematical analysis shows that three-winged seeds are more adapted to wind dispersal than seeds with one, two or four wings under the same condition.

">Modeling the Effects of Propofol on Brain Activity: Insights from Computational EEG Studies</a></h4>

              
                The effects of anesthetic agents like propofol on brain activity provide critical insights into how consciousness is altered during anesthesia. This article presents a computational approach to modeling the impact of propofol on the brain's electrical activity using the COALIA model, a large-scale neural mass model of human EEG designed for consciousness research. Propofol enhances GABA_A-mediated synaptic inhibition, leading to characteristic EEG signatures such as alpha oscillations (8-12 Hz) and slow-wave oscillations (0.1-1.5 Hz). We model these effects by modulating the parameters of postsynaptic potentials and synaptic strength, simulating the action of propofol at both the molecular and network levels. COALIA's detailed representation of thalamo-cortical and cortico-cortical networks provides realistic simulations of brain dynamics under anesthesia, closely replicating experimental EEG data. Our findings highlight the importance of network-level interactions in producing the distinctive EEG changes observed during propofol-induced unconsciousness. This research paves the way for future applications in personalized anesthesia monitoring and consciousness assessment through EEG modeling.

">Genetically-encoded markers for confocal visualization of single dense core vesicles</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal dense core vesicles (DCVs) store and release a diverse array of neuromodulators, trophic factors and bioamines. The analysis of single DCVs has largely been possible only using electron microscopy, which makes understanding cargo segregation and DCV heterogeneity difficult. To address these limitations, we developed genetically-encoded markers for DCVs that can be used in combination with standard immunohistochemistry and expansion microscopy, to enable single-vesicle resolution with confocal microscopy.

">Task relevance selectively modulates sensorimotor adaptation in the presence of multiple prediction errors.</a></h4>

              
                Adaptation to consistently occurring sensorimotor errors is considered obligatory in nature. We probed the robustness of this finding by asking if humans can selectively attenuate adaptation based on the task-relevance of error signals. Subjects made planar reaches to three different targets: an arc (Experiment 1), a bar (Experiment 2), and a point (Experiment 3). During the reach, perturbations in extent (visuomotor gain), direction (visuomotor rotation) or both simultaneously were employed. In Experiment 1, subjects showed robust adaptation to the rotation when reaching to the arc even though the presence of this perturbation was irrelevant for achievement of the task goal. Interestingly however, rotation adaptation was strongly attenuated when it was presented simultaneously with a task-relevant gain perturbation. In Experiment 2, which involved reaches to the bar, again, subjects successfully adapted to the task-irrelevant gain perturbation when it occurred in isolation. However, adaptation was attenuated when the gain co-occurred with a task-relevant rotation. Experiment 3 revealed that the attenuation observed in the first two experiments was not due to an inability to adapt to co-occurring rotation and gain perturbations. Collectively, our results suggest that the sensorimotor system selectively tunes learning in the presence of multiple error signals, a finding that can potentially be explained by a biased competition mechanism. That is, given limited processing capacity, a salient attribute - the relevance of the error to the task goal in this case - is prioritized for processing and drives subsequent adaptive changes in motor output.

">Cholecystokinin-expressing GABA neurons elicit long-term potentiation in the cortical inhibitory synapses and attenuate sound-shock associative memory</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal interactions between inhibitory and excitatory neurons play a pivotal role in regulating the balance of excitation and inhibition in the central nervous system (CNS). Consequently, the efficacy of inhibitory/excitatory synapses profoundly affects neural network processing and overall neuronal functions. Here, we describe a novel form of long-term potentiation (LTP) induced at cortical inhibitory synapses and its behavioral consequences. We show that high-frequency laser stimulation (HFLS) of GABAergic neurons elicit inhibitory LTP (i-LTP) in pyramidal neurons of the auditory cortex (AC). The selective activation of cholecystokinin-expressing GABA (GABACCK) neurons is essential for the formation of HFLS-induced i-LTP, rather than the classical parvalbumin (PV) neurons and somatostatin (SST) neurons. Intriguingly, i-LTP can be evoked in the AC by adding the exogenous neuropeptide CCK when PV neurons and SST neurons are selectively activated in PV-Cre and SST-Cre mice, respectively. Additionally, we discovered that low-frequency laser stimulation (LFLS) of PV neurons paired with HFLS of GABACCK neurons potentiates the inhibitory effect of PV interneurons on pyramidal neurons, thereby generating heterosynaptic i-LTP in the AC. Notably, light activation of GABACCK neurons in CCK-Cre mice significantly attenuates sound- shock associative memory, while stimulation of PV neurons does not affect this memory in PV-Cre mice. In conclusion, these results demonstrate a critical mechanism regulating the excitation-inhibition balance and modulating learning and memory in cortical circuits. This mechanism might serve as a potential target for the treatment of neurological disorders, including epilepsy and Alzheimer disease.

	<p>Objectives: One of the behavioral problems strongly associated with emotional dysregulation (ED) in ASD is emotional outbursts (EOs) characterized by a pattern of challenging behavior that varies across individuals and across time. Cultural factors can modulate the expression of EOs. This study aimed to characterize the profile of emotional outbursts (EOs) in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) across various countries in Latin America and to identify clinical, emotional, and contextual factors that contribute to the onset and frequency of EOs within this diverse sample. Methods: A cross-sectional and cross-cultural study was conducted between 2023 and 2024 comprising samples from five countries in the Latin American Network for Autism-REAL: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Uruguay, and the Dominican Republic. We studied 689 children with ASD (age x = 8.7 &amp;amp;plusmn; 2.6 years) using the Emotional Outburst Questionnaire (EOQ). Results: We identified different types of EO among children with ASD in our sample. The most frequent was the &amp;amp;lsquo;behavioral indicators of emotion&amp;amp;rsquo; (52.0%) followed by &amp;amp;lsquo;increased motor activity&amp;amp;rsquo; (28.3%), &amp;amp;lsquo;non-speech vocalizations&amp;amp;rsquo;, (27.6%), &amp;amp;lsquo;mild verbal aggression&amp;amp;rsquo; (23.8%), and &amp;amp;lsquo;avoidance&amp;amp;rsquo; (21.5%). Children in a bad mood or having a bad day or experiencing irritability were the most significant factors that increased the likelihood of EOs. Conclusions: Our results revealed that irritability is an important trigger for EOs and should not be disregarded or underestimated when monitoring the mental health of children with ASD.</p>

                Seed priming enhances germination and growth, which are important determinants of crop yield. This study was carried out to assess the effect of priming duration and metabolite concentration on the priming of five (5) crops using the metabolites of five (5) bacterial isolates. The crop seeds were treated in the cold-extracted metabolites of the five isolates at five (5) different priming durations (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 h) and then in five metabolite concentrations (200, 400, 600, 800, and 1000 mg/L) of the five extracted metabolites at the optimal priming duration determined in the first experiment. Characterization of the cold-extracted metabolites was also carried out using gas-chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Results revealed that priming cowpea and soybean seeds for longer durations (< 3 h) could hinder their growth and development. Lower concentrations were observed to be optimal for cowpea and soybean, but for sesame and okra, there was no detectable pattern with metabolite concentration. The GC-MS revealed the presence of some molecules (e.g. hexadecanoic acid) that have shown plant growth promotion potential in other studies. This study showed that seeds with large endosperms, such as those of cowpea and soybean, are more prone to the harmful effects of treatment for longer durations. Further experiments should be undertaken to isolate and purify the bioactive moieties for further studies and application.

                A cerebral arteriovenous malformation (cAVM) is an abnormal tangle of cerebral blood vessels. The consensus document by the Joint Writing Group (JWG) highlighted which cAVM features should be recorded. Subsequent publications have reported cAVM angioarchitecture, but it is unknown if all followed the JWG recommendations. The aim of this systematic review was to describe use of the JWG guidelines. A database search, using the PRISMA checklist, was performed. We describe the proportion of publications that used JWG reporting standards, which standards were used, whether the definitions used differed from the JWG, or if any additional angiographic features were reported. Out of 4306 articles identified, 105 were selected, and a further 114 from other sources. Thirty-three studies (33/219; 15%) specifically referred to using JWG standards. Since the JWG publication, few studies have used their standards to report cAVMs. This implies that the angioarchitecture of cAVMs are not routinely fully described.

                Background: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and its consequences are a serious global public health issue. By 2030, the number of people with type 2 diabetes is predicted to reach 439 million. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the plasma levels of glucose, HbA1c, insulin, and lipid profile in Sudanese T2DM patients. Methods: This case control study included 165 Sudanese patients with diabetic type 2 and a cardiovascular condition as cases and 165 diabetic type 2 volunteers without a cardiovascular disorder as controls. The concentrations of plasma glucose, HbA1c, and lipid profile were assessed using a Mindray BS-480 auto-chemistry analyzer, and insulin was analyzed using a Cobase 411 auto analyzer. The collected data were analyzed using statistical tools for social science computer programs (SPSS version 21). Results: According to the findings, (59.4%) of patients between the ages of (50-69). Females made up 50.9%. (38.2%) of patients had an illness duration of between (8-15 years). (41.8%) of individuals did not have hypertension. There was a substantial rise in BMI, FBG, HbA1c, HDL-C, and insulin among diabetics with cardiovascular disease compared to diabetics without cardiovascular disease (p-value = 0.001, 0.000, 0.018, and 0.000). Females had significantly higher blood TC, LDL-C, HDL-C, and BMI than males (p-values = 0.000, 0,001, and 0.000, respectively). There were significant positive correlation between FBS, HBA1c, insulin and duration of disease (r=0.155, p, value=0.005) (r=0.160, p, value=0.004)(r=0.103, p. value=0.061)respectively, while there were significant negative correlation between TC, TG,LDL-C, HDL-C and duration of disease (r=-0.152, p, value= 0.006)(r=-0.023, p, value=0.678)(r=-0.113, p, value= 0.040)(r=-0.145, p, value=0.008)respectively. Conclusion: When comparing diabetics with cardiovascular disease to diabetics without cardiovascular disease, there was a substantial rise in BMI, FBG, HbA1c, HDL-C, and insulin. FBS, HBA1c, insulin, and illness duration all had a strong positive connection.

                The psychosocial well-being of every individual is as important as the well-being of long-distance voyages, especially that they have to spend longer hours and days travelling to their destinations with all the experiences of adventure and adversities characterizing the journey. The aim of this systematic review is to explore the psychosocial well-being of long-distance travellers on board shipping vessels to gain an understanding of their psychological and social well-being with the objective of ameliorating the adversities associated with these travels. A systematic review will be conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (2020) statement. The databases to be searched for the data will be limited to Scopus, Web of Science, and Advanced Google Scholar using keywords selected by the reviewers. Meta-analysis, narrative synthesis, or both will be used depending on the extent of heterogeneity across eligible observational studies included in the review. Some specific countries will be selected for data extraction, and only data published in English will be included. It is expected that the findings from this review will bring to bear if these categories of travellers are prone to risks that affect their psychosocial wellbeing and if so discovered. This protocol was registered with the PROSPERO. PROSPERO registration number: CRD42024517277(08/03/2024)

                Background Methotrexate (MTX) is a classical folic acid antagonist widely used in the treatment of malignant and non-malignant disorders. However, its clinical application is often restricted by concomitant adverse effects, including renal damage. Numerous studies have highlighted the role of oxidative stress and inflammation in mediating MTX-related nephrotoxicity. Therefore, the current study aimed to explore the possible renoprotective action of Citronellol (CT), a natural compound with prominent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, against nephrotoxicity induced by MTX. Methods To fulfill our objective, 24 adult male Wistar rats were randomly allocated into four groups: control, MTX, 100 mg/kg CT plus MTX and 200 mg/kg CT plus MTX. At the end of the study, the experimental rats were anesthetized, blood samples were collected for biochemical assays, and the kidneys were surgically removed for biochemical and gene expression analyses, after which all rats were sacrificed by exsanguination. Results Compared to the MTX-treated group, our results revealed that pre-supplementation with 100 or 200 mg/kg CT remarkably ameliorated renal damage biomarkers, including serum urea, serum creatinine, and kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1). In addition, pre-treatment with 100 or 200 mg/kg CT enhanced the activity of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), diminished renal malondialdehyde (MDA) contents, and attenuated inflammation by suppressing renal nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling and diminishing tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) gene expression. Moreover, pre-treatment with 200 mg/kg CT markedly reduced interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) gene expression. Conclusion Our findings demonstrate, for the first time, that CT can serve as a new promising agent for mitigating nephrotoxicity induced by MTX through its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.

                Background Despite beneficial progress in policies, awareness and advocacy, accessibility gaps exist in public buildings in India. Challenges achieving full inclusivity still exist, due to a lack of clear guidance for implementing accessible solutions. Retrofitting older buildings, particularly in developing tier II cities is a major challenge. The authors of this paper aimed to address this issue using a four-round Delphi method to generate a Justice-Centered Best Practices (JCBPs) for accessibility provisions for individuals with mobility disabilities. Methods Conducted in Udupi, the study involved experts including administrators, policy implementers, auditors, advocates, healthcare professionals, individuals with disabilities and their caregivers. In the first round, a 117-item list was generated through triangulation of three methods. In subsequent rounds, experts rated each item using a 5-point Likert scale on feasibility, affordability and priority. Responses were considered valid if the agreement reached ≥80% on the total score. The prioritised list of JCBPs was finalised at a consensus meeting. Results Out of forty-eight experts who began the study, 16 participated in the final meeting. The Wilcoxon signed rank test (p value>0.05) of expert ranking indicated that the scoring of items remained consistent between the two rounds. A machine learning decision tree analysis identified items securing ≥ 80% agreement as the most reliable decision with an accuracy=71.43%. The McNemar’s Test p value=0.79 confirmed consistency of expert scoring on the items with high agreement rates. Conclusion Finally, 33 built and non-built environment items scored highest rank. Stakeholder engagement, use of low-cost technology solutions, coordination between public administrations, funding, good governance practice, awareness, and advocacy were few of the solutions that can help ensure accessibility is in place for individuals with mobility disabilities. The study methodology and findings create a robust foundation for evidence-based JCBPs for accessibility provisions for individuals with mobility disabilities.

                Introduction Current dietary assessment methods face challenges in accurately capturing individuals’ dietary habits, undermining the efficacy of public health strategies. The ‘Standardised and Objective Dietary Intake Assessment Tool’ (SODIAT)-1 study aims to assess the effectiveness of three emerging technologies (urine and capillary blood biomarkers, and wearable camera technology) and two online self-reporting dietary assessment tools to monitor dietary intake. Methods This randomised controlled crossover trial will recruit 30 participants (aged 18-70 years and BMI of 20-30 kg/m2) from Imperial College London and the University of Reading. Exclusion criteria include recent weight change, food allergies/intolerances, following restrictive diets, certain health conditions and medication use. Interested volunteers will be directed to an online screening questionnaire via REDCap and eligible participants will attend a pre-study visit. Volunteers will consume, in a random order, two highly-controlled diets (compliant and non-compliant with UK guidelines) for four days each. Each study arm will be separated by at least one-week. During each test period, dietary intake will be monitored continuously using wearable cameras and self-recorded using eNutri (food frequency questionnaire) and Intake24 (24-hour dietary recall). Urine and capillary blood samples will be collected for biomarker analysis. Data analysis will assess the accuracy of dietary reporting across these methods using Lin’s concordance correlation coefficient. Discussion and ethical considerations This study introduces a novel approach to dietary assessment, addressing the limitations of traditional methods by reducing misreporting and enhancing inclusivity, particularly for underrepresented populations with literacy or language barriers. However, challenges persist, such as variability in biomarker data due to failure to adhere to sample storage requirements and the practicalities of continuously wearing cameras. To protect privacy, participants will be instructed to remove cameras at inappropriate times, and artificial intelligence will be used to blur all images captured apart from food.

                Background Most people in third-world countries are impoverished and rely on small-holder farming as a source of income. Due to a lack of working capital to diversify their sources of income and acquire new sources, farmers are highly dependent on financial institutions to access microcredit. Method This study utilized logistic regression and propensity score matching methods to analyze the primary data collected from a sample of 385 household heads. Results The Estimation results of the study shows that Gender, age, family size, and education, access to irrigation, extension services, dependency ratio, and distance to credit sources were among the significant determinants of access to microcredit service. Conclusion Although microcredit led to an increase in household spending, real asset holdings did not improve. In addition to the need for supplementary interventions like financial literacy training and asset-building programs to encourage asset accumulation among these small-scale agrarian households, high interest rates and repayment burdens are blamed for this uneven result.

                Background When the brain is deprived of oxygen and nutrients due to stenosis or arterial rupture, neurons in the affected area suffer irreversible damage and cellular death. MicroRNA has been shown to regulate target genes implicated in arterial hypertension, atherosclerosis, and diabetes mellitus, all of which influence the risk of ischemic stroke through inflammation, oxidative stress, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. The study aims to determine the changes in miRNA expression, namely miRNA-21, between acute ischemic stroke patients and controls and their relationship to proinflammatory cytokines, clinical severity, and outcome. Methods Serum samples from tertiary hospitals and controls were used to evaluate miRNA-21 expression as well as cytokines TNF-α, IL-10, ICAM-1, and CCL5 levels within 7 days of stroke onset. The 30-day clinical severity and outcome were assessed using the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and modified Rankin Scale (mRS), respectively. Result A total of 64 acute ischemic stroke patients and 22 age-matched controls were recruited, with median ages of 56 and 55.5 years old, respectively. There were more male subjects than females (35 to 29). A statistically significant difference was observed in miRNA-21 expression between patients and controls (p<0.001). This finding implies that miRNA-21 expression may have a contribution in acute stroke patients. This was followed by an increase in proinflammatory markers TNF-α, IL-10, ICAM-1, and CCL5. However, no association was found between miRNA-21 and any pro-inflammatory cytokine. There was no significant correlation between miRNA-21 or cytokines markers with clinical severity or prognosis. Conclusion Our study demonstrated increased miRNA-21 expression and proinflammatory cytokine expression in acute ischemic stroke patients relative to controls. However, this was not related to clinical severity or clinical outcomes.

[version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has fomented a climate of fear worldwide due to its rapidly spreading nature, and high mortality rate. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared it as a global pandemic on 11th March, 2020. Many endeavors have been made to find appropriate medications to restrain the SARS CoV-2 infection from spreading but there is no specific antiviral therapy to date. However, a computer-aided drug design approach can be an alternative to identify probable drug candidates within a short time. SARS-CoV-2 main protease is a proven drug target, and it plays a pivotal role in viral replication and transcription. Methods: In this study, we identified a total of 114 essential oil compounds as a feasible anti-SARS-CoV-2 agent from several online reservoirs. These compounds were screened by incorporating ADMET profiling, molecular docking, and 50 ns of molecular dynamics simulation to identify potential drug candidates against the SARS-CoV-2 main protease. The crystallized SARS-CoV-2 main protease structure was collected from the RCSB PDB database (PDB ID 6LU7). Results: According to the results of the ADMET study, none of the compounds have any side effects that could reduce their druglikeness or pharmacokinetic properties. Out of 114 compounds, we selected bisabololoxide B, eremanthin, and leptospermone as our top drug candidates based on their higher binding affinity scores, and strong interaction with the Cys 145-His 41 catalytic dyad. Finally, the molecular dynamics simulation was implemented to evaluate the structural stability of the ligand-receptor complex. MD simulations disclosed that all the hits showed conformational stability compared to the positive control α-ketoamide. Conclusions: Our study showed that the top three hits might work as potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents, which can pave the way for discovering new drugs, but for experimental validation, they will require more in vivo trials.

                Purpose To explore how principles of social justice and equity are integrated into research concerning accessibility to public buildings for individuals with mobility disabilities. Methods Utilising a scoping review methodology to assess literature based on the criteria set by the Joanna Briggs Institute, seven databases were screened. Studies were selected using the framework: “persons with mobility disabilities” AND “accessibility” AND “public buildings”. A theoretical framework helped to extract codes and develop themes through an inductive-deductive analysis method. The results are presented descriptively. Results The examination of 84 studies uncovered a complex interplay between agencies, systemic challenges, discriminatory practices, and societal attitudes perpetuating marginalisation of individuals with mobility disabilities in their access to public buildings. The recommendations emphasize importance of practical measures, research imperatives, and policy developments to promote inclusivity. We present a ‘Ten-step approach’ to integrate social justice and equity into research on accessibility in public buildings for people with mobility disabilities. Conclusion Integrating diversity, active participation, and inclusive methodologies are essential to address systemic issues, discriminatory practices, and societal attitudes that hinder accessibility and inclusion. Collaborations with diverse stakeholders are crucial for policy changes, resource allocation, and advancing social justice and equity in accessibility research and practice.

                Objectives The primary objective of this systematic review was to identify the optimal timing for immunizing pregnant women to confer the most protection by reducing the incidence of laboratory-confirmed influenza or influenza-like illness in infants less than 6 months of age. Currently, there are gaps in research regarding the timing of administration during the gestational period to provide maximum immunogenicity to the infant. The research question being addressed is: ‘When considering immunization of pregnant mothers with the influenza vaccine, implementing a vaccination program during which trimester in pregnancy would optimize benefits for infants less than 6 months of age in terms of the incidence of laboratory-confirmed influenza and influenza-like illness?’ Design Systematic review/Meta-analysis Methods Randomized controlled trials (RCT’s) and observational studies comparing health outcomes of infants and children up to 6 months of age born to women who received inactivated influenza vaccine during pregnancy with mothers who did not receive the vaccine or received a control vaccine. The primary outcome was laboratory-confirmed influenza infection in infants. Secondary outcome measures included influenza –like illness diagnosed by a clinician and acute respiratory illness. Results 7 studies were included: 2 primary RCT’s and 5 observational studies (prospective and retrospective cohort studies).5 of the 7 studies were suitable to be included in the quantitative synthesis part and and were compared. Forrest plot analysis revealed that vaccinating pregnant mothers in the second and third trimester when compared with any trimester (1,2 and 3) (OR 0.18 vs. 0.65) conferred less protection, promoting vaccination in the first trimester. Conclusions Vaccinating pregnant mothers in the first trimester conferred greater protection to infants than any other trimester.

                Background: Secretomes have been gaining interest in treating several diseases due to their pharmaceutical effects, such as the immunomodulatory effect. This study aimed to determine the immunomodulatory effect of secretomes derived from human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and their safety. Methods: We conducted an in vivo immunomodulatory study using a carbon clearance assay. The safety of single-dose administration of secretome was done using fixed-dose methods of acute toxicity test. Results: The phagocytic index was higher in mice treated with secretome than in untreated mice. The acute toxicity study also showed that the administration of secretome derived from human umbilical cord MSCs did not change the mice’s body weight, physical examination results, organ weight, and gross anatomy examination. Conclusions: This study presents the potential of secretome derived from MSCs as a safe immunomodulatory agent.

                Background India’s National Policy for Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (NPSDE) was designed to capture the demographic dividend and upskill India’s youth, creating an ‘Athmanirbhar Bharat’ (self-reliant India) and in the process, also drive economic growth. Policy and Implications The NPSDE’s dual focus on skill development and entrepreneurship was intended to create a framework for empowering India’s workforce and fostering a culture of innovation. However, the policy has encountered several issues, including the ineffective functioning of Sector Skill Councils (SSCs), inadequate infrastructure, and insufficiently skilled trainers. Additionally, the policy’s efforts to include marginalized groups, particularly women, have fallen short due to entrenched social barriers and gender biases, impacting the effectiveness of training programs. Recommendations To improve the effectiveness of the NPSDE, we propose the following recommendations -adopt an entrepreneurial ecosystem approach to enhance coordination and support within the skill development framework; explicitly define ‘skill’ and ‘skilling’ to better align with socio-political realities and address barriers faced by marginalized individuals; and design training initiatives with an empowerment perspective, focusing on access to resources, agency, and social change. We feel these steps can help direct the NPSDE to create a more inclusive and impactful skilling environment. Conclusions While the NPSDE represents a significant effort towards upskilling India and fostering self-reliance and entrepreneurship, its implementation has revealed critical limitations. The policy’s progress has been insufficient, with persistent issues in meeting industry needs and addressing socio-economic barriers. Future revisions of the policy should focus on systemic improvements, adopting a more inclusive approach to skilling, and addressing the socio-political dimensions of skill valuation to better support India’s developmental aspirations.

                Background To gauge the impact of an interventional workshop conducted to measure the observation skills of 34 postgraduates during induction into an ophthalmology fellowship. Methods A seven-hour workshop was conducted with the ophthalmology trainees. Trainees from the 2022 batch of ophthalmology fellowships (21 females and 13 males) were included in the study. The pre-workshop assessment comprised two non-clinical images to spot the difference and five clinical images from various subspecialties of ophthalmology. This was followed by workshop and Post workshop assessment. The pre- and post-observation grades of participants were then compared by masked ophthalmologists. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare scores at two time points, with a p-value < 0.05 for statistical significance. Results Statistical analysis revealed that the observation skill score was significantly higher after the workshop intervention (Md = 4.00, n = 34) compared to the pre-workshop score (Md = 1.85, n = 34), p-value = 0.000. Conclusions Workshops on specific/selected foundational skills, such as observation skills and communication skills, must be integrated into the curricula of basic medical degree and specialty medicine to equip medical professionals with attentive observation and deep learning.

                Background This study aims to empirically test a comprehensive interrelationship between green supply chain management (GSCM), green technology innovation (GTI), waste management (WM), big data analytics capability powered by artificial intelligence (BDAC-AI), and their collective impact on sustainable performance (SP) in organizational contexts. Methods This study was conducted in Pakistan’s food processing sector. The respondents included 495 managers working in the food processing industry. A structural equation modelling (SEM) approach is used to examine direct and indirect relationships between the variables. The originality of this study lies in integration of the technology acceptance model (TAM) and dynamic capability theory (DCT) to understand sustainable practices in the context of the provided model. Results This study highlights that GSCM, GTI, WM, and BDAC-AI have positive, strong, and direct impacts on SP. Furthermore, GTI and WM only partially mediate the link between GSCM and SP, whereas the two moderate the link. In addition, BDAC-AI had a moderating effect on the relationship between GTI and SP. This study has managerial implications, including strategies that involve the use of theoretical frameworks for technological acceptance and dynamic capabilities to support sustainable initiatives. However, it is worth noting that the findings provide a practical contingency for managers and businesses interested in implementing green studies effectively, improving technologies, and strengthening sustainable performance capabilities. Conclusions The study extends the literature by establishing a model for operationalizing GSCM in the food processing sector. Furthermore, it adds value in that it first integrates TAM and DCT to explain sustainable operations and their impact on organizations. Furthermore, it extends the existing literature by establishing a relationship between GSCM and SC. It offers a model through which GSCM can be operationalized in the context of the FS sector.

Spatio-molecular data and microscopy images provide complementary information, essential to study structure and function of spatially organised multicellular systems such as healthy or diseased tissues. However, aligning these two types of data can be challenging due to distortions and differences in resolution, orientation, and position. Manual registration is tedious but may be necessary for challenging samples as well as for the generation of ground-truth data sets that enable benchmarking of existing and emerging automated alignment tools. To make the process of manual registration more convenient, efficient, and integrated, we created <i>BoReMi</i>, a python-based, Jupyter-integrated, visual tool that offers all the relevant functionalities for aligning and registering spatio-molecular data and associated microscopy images. We showcase <i>BoReMi’s</i> utility using publicly available data and images and make <i>BoReMi</i> as well as an interactive demo available on GitHub.

                <p>by Marta Mackowiak, Bartosz Adamczyk, Marta Szachniuk, Tomasz Zok</p>

RNA molecules, essential for viruses and living organisms, derive their pivotal functions from intricate 3D structures. To understand these structures, one can analyze torsion and pseudo-torsion angles, which describe rotations around bonds, whether real or virtual, thus capturing the RNA conformational flexibility. Such an analysis has been made possible by RNAtango, a web server introduced in this paper, that provides a trigonometric perspective on RNA 3D structures, giving insights into the variability of examined models and their alignment with reference targets. RNAtango offers comprehensive tools for calculating torsion and pseudo-torsion angles, generating angle statistics, comparing RNA structures based on backbone torsions, and assessing local and global structural similarities using trigonometric functions and angle measures. The system operates in three scenarios: single model analysis, model-versus-target comparison, and model-versus-model comparison, with results output in text and graphical formats. Compatible with all modern web browsers, RNAtango is accessible freely along with the source code. It supports researchers in accurately assessing structural similarities, which contributes to the precision and efficiency of RNA modeling.

                <p>by Fan Xia, Yanni Xiao, Junling Ma</p>

Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are effective in mitigating infections during the early stages of an infectious disease outbreak. However, these measures incur significant economic and livelihood costs. To address this, we developed an optimal control framework aimed at identifying strategies that minimize such costs while ensuring full control of a cross-regional outbreak of emerging infectious diseases. Our approach uses a spatial SEIR model with interventions for the epidemic process, and incorporates population flow in a gravity model dependent on gross domestic product (GDP) and geographical distance. We applied this framework to identify an optimal control strategy for the COVID-19 outbreak caused by the Delta variant in Xi’an City, Shaanxi, China, between December 2021 and January 2022. The model was parameterized by fitting it to daily case data from each district of Xi’an City. Our findings indicate that an increase in the basic reproduction number, the latent period or the infectious period leads to a prolonged outbreak and a larger final size. This indicates that diseases with greater transmissibility are more challenging and costly to control, and so it is important for governments to quickly identify cases and implement control strategies. Indeed, the optimal control strategy we identified suggests that more costly control measures should be implemented as soon as they are deemed necessary. Our results demonstrate that optimal control regimes exhibit spatial, economic, and population heterogeneity. More populated and economically developed regions require a robust regular surveillance mechanism to ensure timely detection and control of imported infections. Regions with higher GDP tend to experience larger-scale epidemics and, consequently, require higher control costs. Notably, our proposed optimal strategy significantly reduced costs compared to the actual expenditures for the Xi’an outbreak.

                <p>by Lianghong Chen, Zi Huai Huang, Yan Sun, Mike Domaratzki, Qian Liu, Pingzhao Hu</p>

This study addresses the heterogeneity of breast cancer (BC) by employing a Conditional Probabilistic Diffusion Model (CPDM) to synthesize Magnetic Resonance Images (MRIs) based on multi-omic data, including gene expression, copy number variation, and DNA methylation. The lack of paired medical images and genomics data in previous studies presented a challenge, which the CPDM aims to overcome. The well-trained CPDM successfully generated synthetic MRIs for 726 TCGA-BRCA patients, who lacked actual MRIs, using their multi-omic profiles. Evaluation metrics such as Frechet’s Inception Distance (FID), Mean Square Error (MSE), and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) demonstrated the CPDM’s effectiveness, with an FID of 2.02, MSE of 0.02, and SSIM of 0.59 based on the 15-fold cross-validation. The synthetic MRIs were used to predict clinical attributes, achieving an Area Under the Receiver-Operating-Characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.82 and an Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC) of 0.84 for predicting ER+/HER2+ subtypes. Additionally, the MRIs accurately predicted BC patient survival with a Concordance-index (C-index) score of 0.88, outperforming other baseline models. This research demonstrates the potential of CPDMs in generating MRIs based on BC patients’ genomic profiles, offering valuable insights for radiogenomic research and advancements in precision medicine. The study provides a novel approach to understanding BC heterogeneity for early detection and personalized treatment.

                <p>by Brandon J. Thio, Nathan D. Titus, Nicole A. Pelot, Warren M. Grill</p>

Unmyelinated C-fibers constitute the vast majority of axons in peripheral nerves and play key roles in homeostasis and signaling pain. However, little is known about their ion channel expression, which controls their firing properties. Also, because of their small diameters (~ 1 μm), it has not been possible to characterize their membrane properties using voltage clamp. We developed a novel library of isoform-specific ion channel models to serve as the basis functions of our C-fiber models. We then developed a particle swarm optimization (PSO) framework that used the isoform-specific ion channel models to reverse engineer C-fiber membrane properties from measured autonomic and cutaneous C-fiber conduction responses. Our C-fiber models reproduced experimental conduction velocity, chronaxie, action potential duration, intracellular threshold, and paired pulse recovery cycle. The models also matched experimental activity-dependent slowing, a property not included in model optimization. We found that simple conduction responses, characterizing the action potential, were controlled by similar membrane properties in both the autonomic and cutaneous C-fiber models, but complicated conduction response, characterizing the afterpotenials, were controlled by differential membrane properties. The unmyelinated C-fiber models constitute important tools to study autonomic signaling, assess the mechanisms of pain, and design bioelectronic devices. Additionally, the novel reverse engineering approach can be applied to generate models of other neurons where voltage clamp data are not available.

The placenta is crucial for a successful pregnancy, facilitating oxygen exchange and nutrient transport between mother and fetus. Complications like fetal growth restriction and pre-eclampsia are linked to placental vascular structure abnormalities, highlighting the need for early detection of placental health issues. Computational modelling offers insights into how vascular architecture correlates with flow and oxygenation in both healthy and dysfunctional placentas. These models use synthetic networks to represent the multiscale feto-placental vasculature, but current methods lack direct control over key morphological parameters like branching angles, essential for predicting placental dysfunction.
We introduce a novel generative algorithm for creating <i>in silico</i> placentas, allowing user-controlled customisation of feto-placental vasculatures, both as individual components (placental shape, chorionic vessels, placentone) and as a complete structure. The algorithm is physiologically underpinned, following branching laws (i.e. Murray’s Law), and is defined by four key morphometric statistics: vessel diameter, vessel length, branching angle and asymmetry. Our algorithm produces structures consistent with <i>in vivo</i> measurements and <i>ex vivo</i> observations. Our sensitivity analysis highlights how vessel length variations and branching angles play a pivotal role in defining the architecture of the placental vascular network. Moreover, our approach is stochastic in nature, yielding vascular structures with different topological metrics when imposing the same input settings. Unlike previous volume-filling algorithms, our approach allows direct control over key morphological parameters, generating vascular structures that closely resemble real vascular densities and allowing for the investigation of the impact of morphological parameters on placental function in upcoming studies.

Formation of functional organs requires cell–cell communication between different cell lineages and failure in this communication can result in severe developmental defects. Hundreds of possible interacting pairs of proteins are known, but identifying the interacting partners that ensure a specific interaction between 2 given cell types remains challenging. Here, we use the <i>Drosophila</i> leg model and our cell type-specific transcriptomic data sets to uncover the molecular mediators of cell–cell communication between tendon and muscle precursors. Through the analysis of gene expression signatures of appendicular muscle and tendon precursor cells, we identify 2 candidates for early interactions between these 2 cell populations: <i>Amalgam (Ama</i>) encoding a secreted protein and <i>Neurotactin (Nrt)</i> known to encode a membrane-bound protein. Developmental expression and function analyses reveal that: (i) Ama is expressed in the leg myoblasts, whereas Nrt is expressed in adjacent tendon precursors; and (ii) in Ama and Nrt mutants, myoblast-tendon cell–cell association is lost, leading to tendon developmental defects. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Ama acts downstream of the FGFR pathway to maintain the myoblast population by promoting cell survival and proliferation in an Nrt-independent manner. Together, our data pinpoint Ama and Nrt as molecular actors ensuring early reciprocal communication between leg muscle and tendon precursors, a prerequisite for the coordinated development of the appendicular musculoskeletal system.

                Introduction Pharamcological treatment for acute low back pain (ALBP) typically involves opioid drugs, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Methocarbamol is utilized primarily for managing muscle spasms and pain. This systematic review aims to provide an updated synthesis of published literature on the effects of Methocarbamol on pain outcomes in ALBP. Methods This systematic review adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Original articles published until December 2023 were sourced from PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library. Articles focusing on the impact of Methocarbamol on pain outcomes in ALBP patients were included. Results Three studies met the inclusion criteria, published between 2018 and 2023. The total study population comprised 405 ALBP patients, with 163 receiving Methocarbamol. Compared to patients not receiving Methocarbamol, those in the Methocarbamol group showed pain improvement at one week. However, at 30 and 60 minutes after intravenous administration, Methocarbamol was less effective than Diazepam. The primary reported adverse event was nausea. Conclusion When administered in combination with Indomethacin or Naproxen, Methocarbamol shows potential for improving pain outcomes at one week in ALBP patients. However, its efficacy appears inferior to Diazepam in the short-term management of pain

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Visceral feedback from the body is often subconscious, but plays an important role in guiding motivated behaviors. Vagal sensory neurons relay “gut feelings” to noradrenergic (NA) neurons in the caudal nucleus of the solitary tract (cNTS), which in turn project to the anterior ventrolateral bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (vlBNST) and other hypothalamic-limbic forebrain regions. Prior work supports a role for these circuits in modulating memory consolidation and extinction, but a potential role in retrieval of conditioned avoidance remains untested. To examine this, adult male rats underwent passive avoidance conditioning. We then lesioned gut-sensing vagal afferents by injecting cholecystokinin-conjugated saporin toxin (CSAP) into the vagal nodose ganglia (Experiment 1), or lesioned NA inputs to the vlBNST by injecting saporin toxin conjugated to an antibody against dopamine-beta hydroxylase (DSAP) into the vlBNST (Experiment 2). When avoidance behavior was later assessed, rats with vagal CSAP lesions or NA DSAP lesions displayed significantly increased conditioned passive avoidance. These new findings support the view that gut vagal afferents and the cNTS<sup>NA</sup>-to-vlBNST circuit play a role in modulating the expression/retrieval of learned passive avoidance. Overall, our data suggest a dynamic modulatory role of vagal sensory feedback to the limbic forebrain in integrating interoceptive signals with contextual cues that elicit conditioned avoidance behavior.</p>

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The hippocampus (HC) is recognized for its pivotal role in memory-related plasticity and facilitating adaptive behavioral responses to reward shifts. However, the nature of its involvement in the response to reward downshifts remains to be determined. To bridge this knowledge gap, we explored the HC's function through a series of experiments in various tasks involving reward downshifts and using several neural manipulations in rats. In Experiment 1, complete excitotoxic lesions of the HC impaired choice performance in a modified T-maze after reducing the quantity of sugar pellet rewards. In Experiment 2, chemogenetic inhibition of the dorsal HC (dHC) disrupted anticipatory behavior following a food-pellet reward reduction. Experiments 3–5 impaired HC function by using peripheral lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration. This treatment, which induces peripheral inflammation affecting HC function, significantly increased cytokine levels in the dHC (Experiment 3) and impaired anticipatory choice behavior (Experiment 4). None of these dorsal hippocampal manipulations affected consummatory responses in animals experiencing sucrose downshifts. Accordingly, we found no evidence of increased neural activation in either the dorsal or ventral HC, as measured by c-Fos expression, after a sucrose downshift task involving consummatory suppression (Experiment 6). The results highlight the HC's pivotal role in adaptively modulating anticipatory behavior in response to a variety of situations involving frustrative nonreward, while having no effect on adjustments on consummatory behavior. The data supporting this conclusion were obtained under heterogeneous experimental conditions derived from a multi-laboratory collaboration, ensuring the robustness and high reproducibility of our findings. Spatial orientation, memory update, choice of reward signals of different values, and anticipatory versus consummatory adjustments to reward downshift are discussed as potential mechanisms that could account for the specific effects observed from HC manipulations.</p>

                Introduction ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) poses significant challenges in cardiovascular care, necessitating rapid and effective reperfusion strategies. The present study assesses the angiographic outcomes of pre-dilatation and thrombus aspiration (PD+TA) versus conventional treatment without thrombus aspiration (NOTA) in patients undergoing PPCI for STEMI. Methods This prospective cohort study included a total of 155 patients, with 78 assigned to the PD+TA group and 77 to the NOTA group. Baseline demographics, cardiovascular risk factors, and angiographic assessments including TIMI flow, TMPG flow, corrected TIMI frame count (CTFC), ST segment changes, and ejection fraction were compared between the groups. Results The PD+TA group exhibited significantly lower systolic (p-value: 0.021) and diastolic blood pressures (p-value: 0.046), better glucose control (p-value: 0.015), and a more pronounced reduction in ST segment elevation (p-value: 0.027) compared to the NOTA group. Although ejection fraction at presentation was similar between groups, the PD+TA group (52.29±8.80%) demonstrated a statistically significant improvement at one-month follow-up from NOTA (49.14±8.20%). TIMI 3 and TMPG 3 flow rates were comparable between groups before and after drug administration, with significant improvements in CTFC observed in the PD+TA group. Conclusion Pre-dilatation and TA during PPCI for STEMI patients may lead to improved acute angiographic outcomes, including enhanced myocardial reperfusion and reduced ischemic burden. The significant improvement in ejection fraction at one-month follow-up further supports the potential benefits of PD+TA in cardiac function recovery. Larger studies with longer-term follow-up are needed to validate these findings and determine the broader clinical implications of TA in STEMI management.

                Background Female breast cancer remains the most common malignant disease and a leading cause of death worldwide. We aim to follow up on the annual dynamics of its incidence, prevalence and mortality rates in the region of Varna, Bulgaria. Methods Data for the recent retrospective analyses was accessed through the information system of Marko Markov Specialized Hospital for Oncological Diseases of Varna for 2017-2021 and two most recent publications for 2013-2017, in accordance with the Medical University-Varna Ethical committee guidelines. Results The total number of newly registered cases of breast cancer in women aged between 24 and 95 years amounted to 1,341. Mean crude incidence rate in 2017-2021 was 108.83 per 100,000, ranging from 119.89 to 105.25 per 100,000 in 2017 and 2020, respectively. The age group of 61-70 years was most affected (26.55% of the cases). Mean crude prevalence rate during this period was 1496.32 per 100,000, varying from 1447.75 to 1549.71 per 100 000 in 2017 and 2020, respectively. The total number of deaths until the end of 2022 reached 310 with 2018 being the greatest in mortality rate (30.22% of the cases). In 2017-2021, bilateral breast cancer was diagnosed as synchronous in 15 women and metachronous in 9 women. Conclusions The regular regional epidemiological investigations could contribute to the enhancement of the effectiveness and quality of prevention, timely diagnosis and adequate complex treatment.

                Yang et al. reveal that the transcriptional corepressor CDYL is essential for human cortical neurogenesis, with its deficiency causing an increase in GABAergic neurons in cortical organoids. CDYL regulates neuronatin (NNAT), influencing the fate commitment of cortical neural stem cells, highlighting CDYL’s critical role in human cortex development.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99052">Single turnover transient state kinetics reveals processive protein unfolding catalyzed by Escherichia coli ClpB</a></h4>

              
                <i>Escherichia coli</i> ClpB and <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> Hsp104 are AAA+ motor proteins essential for proteome maintenance and thermal tolerance. ClpB and Hsp104 have been proposed to extract a polypeptide from an aggregate and processively translocate the chain through the axial channel of its hexameric ring structure. However, the mechanism of translocation and if this reaction is processive remains disputed. We reported that Hsp104 and ClpB are non-processive on unfolded model substrates. Others have reported that ClpB is able to processively translocate a mechanically unfolded polypeptide chain at rates over 240 amino acids (aa) per second. Here, we report the development of a single turnover stopped-flow fluorescence strategy that reports on processive protein unfolding catalyzed by ClpB. We show that when translocation catalyzed by ClpB is challenged by stably folded protein structure, the motor enzymatically unfolds the substrate at a rate of ~0.9 aa s<sup>−1</sup> with a kinetic step-size of ~60 amino acids at sub-saturating [ATP]. We reconcile the apparent controversy by defining enzyme catalyzed protein unfolding and translocation as two distinct reactions with different mechanisms of action. We propose a model where slow unfolding followed by fast translocation represents an important mechanistic feature that allows the motor to rapidly translocate up to the next folded region or rapidly dissociate if no additional fold is encountered.
