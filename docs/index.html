	<p>Cerebral vascular angiography, or digital subtraction angiography (DSA), is essential for diagnosing neurological conditions but poses radiation risks. This study aims to analyze the impact of examination parameters and patient characteristics on the radiation dose received during DSA to optimize safety and minimize exposure. A retrospective analysis of 251 DSA procedures using the GE Innova IGS 630 dual-plane instrument was conducted. Data on dose area product (DAP) and air kerma (KERMA), along with patient and examination details, were collected. Statistical analyses, including Mann&amp;amp;ndash;Whitney, Kruskal&amp;amp;ndash;Wallis, and Spearman rank correlation tests, assessed the relationships between variables and radiation dose outcomes. Significant correlations were found between the sides examined (left, right, or both) and DAP (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001) and KERMA (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001) values, with bilateral studies showing the highest values. The post hoc Dunn tests showed that the &amp;amp;lsquo;L + P&amp;amp;rsquo; group significantly differs from both the right group (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001 and the left group (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0001). There is no significant difference between the &amp;amp;lsquo;P&amp;amp;rsquo; group and the &amp;amp;lsquo;L&amp;amp;rsquo; group (p-value = 0.53). These results suggest that the right and left (both) group have unique KERMA mGy values compared to the other two groups. A strong correlation (rS = 0.87) existed between DAP and KERMA. The number of projections significantly impacted radiation dose (rS = 0.61). Tube parameters (kV and mA) and skull size had low correlations with DAP and KERMA. Optimizing imaging protocols and individualizing parameters can significantly enhance patient safety and diagnostic efficacy while also reducing occupational exposure for medical staff.</p>

	<p>Background: Augmenting auditory feedback through an error-augmentation paradigm could facilitate the perception and correction of gait asymmetry in stroke survivors, but how such a paradigm should be tailored to individual asymmetry profiles remains unclear. Before implementing the paradigm in rehabilitation, we need to investigate the instantaneous effects of distorted footstep sound feedback on gait symmetry in healthy young adults. Methods: Participants (n = 12) walked on a self-paced treadmill while listening to their footstep sounds, which were distorted unilaterally according to five conditions presented randomly: small delay; small advance; large delay; large advance; or unmodified (control). The primary outcomes were swing time ratio (SWR) and step length ratio (SLR). Secondary outcomes included walking speed, bilateral swing time, step length, and maximum toe height, as well as hip, knee, and ankle angle excursions. Results: SWR (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) but not SLR (p &amp;amp;ge; 0.05) was increased in all distorted feedback conditions compared to the control condition. Increased swing time on the perturbed side ipsilateral to feedback distortion was observed in the advanced conditions (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), while swing time increased bilaterally in the delayed conditions (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) but to a larger extent on the unperturbed side contralateral to feedback distortion. Increases in swing time were accompanied by larger maximum toe height as well as larger hip and knee joint excursions (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05 to p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). No differences in any outcomes were observed between small and large feedback distortion magnitudes. Conclusions: Distorted footstep sound feedback successfully elicits adaptation in temporal gait symmetry (SWR), with distinct modulation patterns for advanced vs. delayed footstep sounds. Spatial symmetry (SLR) remains unaltered, likely because auditory feedback primarily conveys temporal information. This research lays the groundwork to implement personalized augmented auditory feedback in neurorehabilitation.</p>

	<p>Hyperacusis is a condition that is characterized by hypersensitivity to normal everyday sounds or reduced sound tolerance and can affect patients in distressing ways. Sound therapy is a treatment intervention that is used to desensitize patients. However, as yet, there is a lack of understanding on how it is used in clinical practice, the different types of devices, or how to use them. The aim of this scoping review was to establish the current use of sound therapy in adults with hyperacusis and identify any factors that may influence treatment. Methodology: An established methodological framework was used to formulate the research question and guide the search strategy and reporting. The inclusion criteria were studies reporting adult (&amp;amp;gt;18 years) populations with hyperacusis and sound therapy treatments which were published in any language. Searches of electronic databases (CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Medline (EBSCO), Scopus, PsycINFO) identified 31 studies that met the inclusion criteria (completed in April 2024). Data from included records were collated and summarized descriptively.</p>

	<p>The purpose of this study was to analyze the cross-linguistic influence of previously learned languages and working memory capacities on the vocabulary performance of two different typological languages. The objectives of this study were (1) to compare the working memory capacities of bilingual adults in relation to the vocabulary performance of two different languages never learned by the participants, and (2) to analyze to what extent the typology of previously learned languages influences working memory capacities in relation to the vocabulary performance of French and Nahuatl. A group of 43 Mexican Spanish college students participated in this experimental study. The participants completed a series of working memory tasks in Nahuatl and French. The results showed that working memory capacities were lower in Nahuatl than in French. Thus, a correlation was found between their first and second language and vocabulary performance in French. We can consider the influence of previously learned languages as a significant factor in vocabulary acquisition in accordance with the participants&amp;amp;rsquo; working memory capacities.</p>

                <p>Recent neurophysiological studies provide inconsistent results of frontoparietal network (FPN) stimulation for altering working memory (WM) capacity. This study aimed to boost WM capacity by manipulating the activity of the FPN via dual-site high&ndash;definition transcranial direct current stimulation. Forty-eight participants were randomly assigned to three stimulation groups, receiving either simultaneous anodal stimulation of the frontal and parietal areas (double stimulation), or stimulation of the frontal area only (single stimulation), or the placebo stimulation (sham) to frontal and parietal areas. After the stimulation, we used an operation span task to test memory accuracy, mathematical accuracy, time of calculation and memorizing, and recall response time across the three groups. The results revealed an enhancement of memory accuracy and a reduction of time of calculation in the double stimulation group compared with that in others. In addition, recall response time was significantly decreased in the double and single stimulation groups compared with that in sham. No differences in mathematical accuracy were observed. Our results confirm the pivotal role of the FPN in WM and suggest its functional dissociation, with the frontal component more implicated in the retrieval stage and the parietal component in the processing and retention stages.</p>

                <p>Single-unit (SU) activity&mdash;action potentials isolated from one neuron&mdash;has traditionally been employed to relate neuronal activity to behavior. However, recent investigations have shown that multiunit (MU) activity&mdash;ensemble neural activity recorded within the vicinity of one microelectrode&mdash;may also contain accurate estimations of task-related neural population dynamics. Here, using an established model-fitting approach, we compared the spatial codes of SU response fields with corresponding MU response fields recorded from the frontal eye fields (FEFs) in head-unrestrained monkeys (<I>Macaca mulatta</I>) during a memory-guided saccade task. Overall, both SU and MU populations showed a simple visuomotor transformation: the visual response coded target-in-eye coordinates, transitioning progressively during the delay toward a future gaze-in-eye code in the saccade motor response. However, the SU population showed additional secondary codes, including a predictive gaze code in the visual response and retention of a target code in the motor response. Further, when SUs were separated into regular/fast spiking neurons, these cell types showed different spatial code progressions during the late delay period, only converging toward gaze coding during the final saccade motor response. Finally, reconstructing MU populations (by summing SU data within the same sites) failed to replicate either the SU or MU pattern. These results confirm the theoretical and practical potential of MU activity recordings as a biomarker for fundamental sensorimotor transformations (e.g., target-to-gaze coding in the oculomotor system), while also highlighting the importance of SU activity for coding more subtle (e.g., predictive/memory) aspects of sensorimotor behavior.</p>

                Background SARS-CoV-2 first appeared in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Looking at the prevalence data in the world and in Indonesia, the highest mortality rate due to COVID-19 involves age, gender and comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus. Severity of the condition also refers to coagulation abnormalities, such as abnormal prothrombin time values. Methods This systematic review study and meta-analysis used online literature sourced from PubMed, Science Direct, EBSCO, Cochrane and Google Scholar. The literature used here is literature that has data on age, sex and prothrombin time of COVID-19 patients with diabetes mellitus whose quality is assessed by the NOS (Newcastle-Ottawa Scale) criteria and processing data using Review Manager 5.4. Results Out of 8711 literatures that were traced from various search sources, there were 45 literatures that were included in this study. The results of the analysis on age showed the Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) value of 0.45 and P <0.0001 (95% CI: 0.23–0.68), the gender analysis showed an Odds Ratio (OR) value of 3.28 and P = 0.01 (95% CI: 1.26–8.52) and the prothrombin time analysis showed SMD values of 0.41 and P = 0.07 (95%CI = -0.03–0.85). Conclusion Patients with COVID-19 who have DM have a higher risk compared to those without DM. Among COVID-19 patients with DM admitted to hospitals, they were older compared to those without DM and prothrombin time values similar but slightly higher in COVID-19 patients with DM.

                Background To ensure the validity and therapeutic utility of the Neck disability index (NDI) scale, translations, cultural adaptations and psychometric evidence is necessary. This study aimed to address the absence of a suitable and validated Hindi version of the NDI for the rural population. The specific objectives were to translate, adapt, and evaluate the psychometric properties of the newly developed Hindi version of the NDI. Methods Following guidelines provided by the American Association of Orthopedic Surgeons, the original English NDI scale was cross-culturally adapted into Hindi. The adaptation process included translations (forward and backward), expert committee review, pre-testing and cognitive debriefing with 30 individuals experiencing chronic non-specific neck pain. The outcome of this process was the creation of the Hindi version of the NDI, termed NDI-Hi. Subsequently, NDI-Hi was administered to 211 participants with neck pain from multiple centers for psychometric testing. The evaluation involved test-retest reliability over a 48-hour interval, factor analysis, assessment of internal reliability measures, and criterion-related validity by comparing it with the NPAD-Hindi version. Results The NDI-Hi version exhibited favorable psychometric properties, including good test-retest reliability with an intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.87. Internal consistency of the scale was high, indicated by Cronbach’s alpha coefficient (α) of 0.96. The standard error of measurement (SEM) was determined to be 2.58, and the minimal detectable change (MDC) was calculated to be 7.15. Furthermore, the NDI-Hi showed significant correlation with the NPAD-Hindi version, with a correlation coefficient (rho) of 0.86, and a p-value of less than 0.001. Conclusions The NDI-Hi demonstrated validity and reliability as an outcome tool for assessing neck disability. It can be effectively utilized in clinical practice and research settings involving Hindi-speaking individuals with chronic non-specific neck pain. The adapted scale is particularly well-suited for the rural Northern Indian Hindi-speaking population.

                Introduction Antiphospholipids syndrome is a rare autoimmune whose Clinical manifestations are very wide and different. Vaso-occlusive manifestations are the most frequent ones. Vessels of all organs can be involved. Ocular involvement is among the rarest. We report a case of retinal arterial thrombosis in the context of APS. Case report A 46-year-old patient with no previous medical history was admitted to the ophthalmology department for visual field amputation of the right eye without other associated signs. On the fundus, the left side was without abnormality and the right side was the site of a mixed arterial and superior temporal venous occlusion. Retinal angiography revealed a retinal focus in the superior temporal region with mixed occlusion of arterial and venous branches with ischemia of the superior temporal quadrant on the right and a retinal focus in the superficial inferior temporal region without occlusion on the left. Optical coherence tomography revealed ischemia of the superficial layers with alteration of the macular microvascularization in the right superior temporal quadrant. Immunological work-up showed antinuclear antibodies to be positive at 160 and anti-bgp1 positive with an IgG level of 118 IgM higher than 118 IgA at 101. The patient was put on effective anticoagulation with good clinical evolution. Conclusion Ocular involvement is rare in APS and associated with poor prognosis, it seems to be difficult to diagnose but also to manage. Larger studies are required to establish guidelines on how and when to screen asymptomatic APS patients for ocular damage, but also on how to prevent and treat it.

                ‘Research capacity strengthening’ (RCS) is an umbrella term that can be used to describe a wide variety of activities conducted in support of diverse objectives premised upon distinct, potentially opposing, views. Despite this, the ultimate objective of RCS activities is rarely made explicit which can be problematic when diverse objectives are possible. By ‘ultimate’ objective we are referring to the overarching (often long-term) goal an RCS initiative is intended to contribute towards (e.g. better population health) as opposed to the more immediate ‘proximate’ (often short-term) objectives of any such activity (e.g. improved capacity to undertake infectious disease research). We argue a need for those funding, designing and implementing RCS initiatives to make clear statements as to the ultimate objective that they foresee their respective initiative contributing towards as well as the proposed pathway and associated assumptions that underlie their approach. Examples of distinct ultimate objectives for RCS initiatives are presented alongside fictitious examples of how they may be transparently reported from both a funder and implementor perspective. Such transparency should be routine within the scope of funding calls for RCS activities (even when such activities are only a minor component of the call), subsequent applications to those calls and any description of an applied RCS activity/ies and/or the associated outcomes thereof. The process of determining one’s ultimate objective will further cause funders and actors to think through their respective initiatives more thoroughly and make informed choices and better designed RCS projects. Doing so would reduce any ambiguity associated with the use of the term ‘research capacity strengthening’ and would provide a stronger foundation for robust programme evaluation.

                Background Dental caries is a common chronic oral disease, posing a serious public health issue. By analyzing large datasets, machine learning shows potential in addressing this problem. This study employs bibliometric analysis to explore emerging topics, collaborations, key authors, and research trends in Southeast Asia related to the application of machine learning in dental caries management. Methods A comprehensive selection using the Scopus database to obtain relevant research, covering publications from inception to July 2024 was done. We employed the Bibliometric approaches, including co-authorship networks, yearly publishing trends, institutional and national partnerships, keyword co-occurrence analysis, and citation analysis, for the collected data. To explore the visualization and network analysis, we employed the tools such as VOSviewer and Bibliometrix in R package. Results The final bibliometric analysis included 246 papers. We found that Malaysia became the top contributor with 59 publications, followed by Indonesia (37) and Thailand (29). Malaysia had the highest Multiple Country Publications (MCP) ratio at 0.407. Top institutions including the Universiti Sains Malaysia led with 39 articles, followed by Chiang Mai University (36) and the National University of Singapore (30) became the leader. Co-authorship analysis using VOSviewer revealed six distinct clusters. A total of 1220 scholars contributed to these publications. The top 10 keywords, including ‘human’ and ‘dental caries,’ indicated research hotspots. Conclusion We found growing evidence of machine learning applications to address dental caries in Southeast Asia. The bibliometric analysis highlights key authors, collaborative networks, and emerging topics, revealing research trends since 2014. This study underscores the importance of bibliometric analysis in tackling this public health issue.

                <p>by Keyvan Mahjoory, Andreas Bahmer, Molly J. Henry</p>

Human listeners have the ability to direct their attention to a single speaker in a multi-talker environment. The neural correlates of selective attention can be decoded from a single trial of electroencephalography (EEG) data. In this study, leveraging the source-reconstructed and anatomically-resolved EEG data as inputs, we sought to employ CNN as an interpretable model to uncover task-specific interactions between brain regions, rather than simply to utilize it as a black box decoder. To this end, our CNN model was specifically designed to learn pairwise interaction representations for 10 cortical regions from five-second inputs. By exclusively utilizing these features for decoding, our model was able to attain a median accuracy of 77.56% for within-participant and 65.14% for cross-participant classification. Through ablation analysis together with dissecting the features of the models and applying cluster analysis, we were able to discern the presence of alpha-band-dominated inter-hemisphere interactions, as well as alpha- and beta-band dominant interactions that were either hemisphere-specific or were characterized by a contrasting pattern between the right and left hemispheres. These interactions were more pronounced in parietal and central regions for within-participant decoding, but in parietal, central, and partly frontal regions for cross-participant decoding. These findings demonstrate that our CNN model can effectively utilize features known to be important in auditory attention tasks and suggest that the application of domain knowledge inspired CNNs on source-reconstructed EEG data can offer a novel computational framework for studying task-relevant brain interactions.

                <p>by Yunfeng Xiong, Chuntian Wang, Yuan Zhang</p>

Human behaviors have non-negligible impacts on spread of contagious disease. For instance, large-scale gathering and high mobility of population could lead to accelerated disease transmission, while public behavioral changes in response to pandemics may effectively reduce contacts and suppress the peak of the outbreak. In order to understand how spatial characteristics like population mobility and clustering interplay with epidemic outbreaks, we formulate a stochastic-statistical environment-epidemic dynamic system (SEEDS) via an agent-based biased random walk model on a two-dimensional lattice. The “popularity” and “awareness” variables are taken into consideration to capture human natural and preventive behavioral factors, which are assumed to guide and bias agent movement in a combined way. It is found that the presence of the spatial heterogeneity, like social influence locality and spatial clustering induced by self-aggregation, potentially suppresses the contacts between agents and consequently flats the epidemic curve. Surprisedly, disease responses might not necessarily reduce the susceptibility of informed individuals and even aggravate disease outbreak if each individual responds independently upon their awareness. The disease control is achieved effectively only if there are coordinated public-health interventions and public compliance to these measures. Therefore, our model may be useful for quantitative evaluations of a variety of public-health policies.

                <p>by Yuqing Qian, Quan Zou, Mengyuan Zhao, Yi Liu, Fei Guo, Yijie Ding</p>

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has emerged as a powerful tool in genomics research, enabling the analysis of gene expression at the individual cell level. However, scRNA-seq data often suffer from a high rate of dropouts, where certain genes fail to be detected in specific cells due to technical limitations. This missing data can introduce biases and hinder downstream analysis. To overcome this challenge, the development of effective imputation methods has become crucial in the field of scRNA-seq data analysis. Here, we propose an imputation method based on robust and non-negative matrix factorization (scRNMF). Instead of other matrix factorization algorithms, scRNMF integrates two loss functions: <i>L</i><sub>2</sub> loss and C-loss. The <i>L</i><sub>2</sub> loss function is highly sensitive to outliers, which can introduce substantial errors. We utilize the C-loss function when dealing with zero values in the raw data. The primary advantage of the C-loss function is that it imposes a smaller punishment for larger errors, which results in more robust factorization when handling outliers. Various datasets of different sizes and zero rates are used to evaluate the performance of scRNMF against other state-of-the-art methods. Our method demonstrates its power and stability as a tool for imputation of scRNA-seq data.

Although depolymerization of complex carbohydrates is a growth-limiting bottleneck for microbial decomposers, we still lack understanding about how the production of different types of extracellular enzymes affect individual microbes and in turn the performance of whole decomposer communities. In this work we use a theoretical model to evaluate the potential trade-offs faced by microorganisms in biopolymer decomposition which arise due to the varied biochemistry of different depolymerizing enzyme classes. We specifically consider two broad classes of depolymerizing extracellular enzymes, which are widespread across microbial taxa: exo-enzymes that cleave small units from the ends of polymer chains and endo-enzymes that act at random positions generating degradation products of varied sizes. Our results demonstrate a fundamental trade-off in the production of these enzymes, which is independent of system’s complexity and which appears solely from the intrinsically different temporal depolymerization dynamics. As a consequence, specialists that produce either exo- or only endo-enzymes limit their growth to high or low substrate conditions, respectively. Conversely, generalists that produce both enzymes in an optimal ratio expand their niche and benefit from the synergy between the two enzymes. Finally, our results show that, in spatially-explicit environments, consortia composed of endo- and exo-specialists can only exist under oligotrophic conditions. In summary, our analysis demonstrates that the (evolutionary or ecological) selection of a depolymerization pathway will affect microbial fitness under low- or high substrate conditions, with impacts on the ecological dynamics of microbial communities. It provides a possible explanation why many polysaccharide degraders in nature show the genetic potential to produce both of these enzyme classes.

                <p>by Ioana Bouros, Edward M. Hill, Matt J. Keeling, Sam Moore, Robin N. Thompson</p>

The rapid development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 altered the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. In most countries, vaccinations were initially targeted at high-risk populations, including older individuals and healthcare workers. Now, despite substantial infection- and vaccine-induced immunity in host populations worldwide, waning immunity and the emergence of novel variants continue to cause significant waves of infection and disease. Policy makers must determine how to deploy booster vaccinations, particularly when constraints in vaccine supply, delivery and cost mean that booster vaccines cannot be administered to everyone. A key question is therefore whether older individuals should again be prioritised for vaccination, or whether alternative strategies (e.g. offering booster vaccines to the individuals who have most contacts with others and therefore drive infection) can instead offer indirect protection to older individuals. Here, we use mathematical modelling to address this question, considering SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a range of countries with different socio-economic backgrounds. We show that the population structures of different countries can have a pronounced effect on the impact of booster vaccination, even when identical booster vaccination targeting strategies are adopted. However, under the assumed transmission model, prioritising older individuals for booster vaccination consistently leads to the most favourable public health outcomes in every setting considered. This remains true for a range of assumptions about booster vaccine supply and timing, and for different assumed policy objectives of booster vaccination.

<i>In silico</i> clinical trials (ISCTs) are an emerging method in modeling and simulation where medical interventions are evaluated using computational models of patients. ISCTs have the potential to provide cost-effective, time-efficient, and ethically favorable alternatives for evaluating the safety and effectiveness of medical devices. However, ensuring the credibility of ISCT results is a significant challenge. This paper aims to identify unique considerations for assessing the credibility of ISCTs and proposes an ISCT credibility assessment workflow based on recently published model assessment frameworks. First, we review various ISCTs described in the literature, carefully selected to showcase the range of methodological options available. These studies cover a wide variety of devices, reasons for conducting ISCTs, patient model generation approaches including subject-specific versus ‘synthetic’ virtual patients, complexity levels of devices and patient models, incorporation of clinician or clinical outcome models, and methods for integrating ISCT results with real-world clinical trials. We next discuss how verification, validation, and uncertainty quantification apply to ISCTs, considering the range of ISCT approaches identified. Based on our analysis, we then present a hierarchical workflow for assessing ISCT credibility, using a general credibility assessment framework recently published by the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. Overall, this work aims to promote standardization in ISCTs and contribute to the wider adoption and acceptance of ISCTs as a reliable tool for evaluating medical devices.

In life sciences, tracking objects from movies enables researchers to quantify the behavior of single particles, organelles, bacteria, cells, and even whole animals. While numerous tools now allow automated tracking from video, a significant challenge persists in compiling, analyzing, and exploring the large datasets generated by these approaches. Here, we introduce CellTracksColab, a platform tailored to simplify the exploration and analysis of cell tracking data. CellTracksColab facilitates the compiling and analysis of results across multiple fields of view, conditions, and repeats, ensuring a holistic dataset overview. CellTracksColab also harnesses the power of high-dimensional data reduction and clustering, enabling researchers to identify distinct behavioral patterns and trends without bias. Finally, CellTracksColab also includes specialized analysis modules enabling spatial analyses (clustering, proximity to specific regions of interest). We demonstrate CellTracksColab capabilities with 3 use cases, including T cells and cancer cell migration, as well as filopodia dynamics. CellTracksColab is available for the broader scientific community at https://github.com/CellMigrationLab/CellTracksColab.

                <p>by Wade R. Roberts, Adam M. Siepielski, Andrew J. Alverson</p>

A principal goal in ecology is to identify the determinants of species abundances in nature. Body size has emerged as a fundamental and repeatable predictor of abundance, with smaller organisms occurring in greater numbers than larger ones. A biogeographic component, known as Bergmann’s rule, describes the preponderance, across taxonomic groups, of larger-bodied organisms in colder areas. Although undeniably important, the extent to which body size is the key trait underlying these patterns is unclear. We explored these questions in diatoms, unicellular algae of global importance for their roles in carbon fixation and energy flow through marine food webs. Using a phylogenomic dataset from a single lineage with worldwide distribution, we found that body size (cell volume) was strongly correlated with genome size, which varied by 50-fold across species and was driven by differences in the amount of repetitive DNA. However, directional models identified temperature and genome size, not cell size, as having the greatest influence on maximum population growth rate. A global metabarcoding dataset further identified genome size as a strong predictor of species abundance in the ocean, but only in colder regions at high and low latitudes where diatoms with large genomes dominated, a pattern consistent with Bergmann’s rule. Although species abundances are shaped by myriad interacting abiotic and biotic factors, genome size alone was a remarkably strong predictor of abundance. Taken together, these results highlight the cascading cellular and ecological consequences of macroevolutionary changes in an emergent trait, genome size, one of the most fundamental and irreducible properties of an organism.

                Background To evaluate the NETosis biomarkers citrullinated histone H3 (citH3), neutrophil elastase (ELA), calprotectin (CALPRO), and myeloperoxidase (MPO) as indicators of inflammation in the severe stages of periodontitis III and IV in both (smokers and nonsmokers) patients, and to determine the correlation between NETosis biomarkers and clinical periodontal parameters. Methods This study recruited male subjects with an age range of (20-60) years; 60 were stage III and stage IV periodontitis patients, 30 were cigarette smoker, and 30 were nonsmokers. After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria to evaluate their eligibility for recruitment, 25 control subjects with a healthy periodontal status and good oral hygiene maintenance were included. Unstimulated saliva was obtained and evaluated using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and the following periodontal parameters were documented: [plaque index, bleeding on probing, periodontal pocket depth, and clinical attachment loss]. Results The mean levels of all salivary NETosis biomarkers citH3, ELA, CALPRO, and MPO were elevated in the periodontitis groups (smokers and nonsmokers) than in controls. Moreover, the mean NETosis biomarker‘s mean levels were significantly higher in smoker than in nonsmokers. In addition, the correlations were significant between CALPRO and CitH3 in smokers and between ELA and CitH3 in nonsmokers. Conclusions The results of this study showed that the chosen salivary biomarkers of NETosis revealed elevated clinical accuracy in differentiating the studied periodontitis groups (smokers and nonsmokers) from controls. In addition, cigarette smoking increases the risk of periodontitis, and neutrophils in smokers with periodontitis exhibited more susceptibility to form neutrophil extracellular traps when compared with nonsmokers.

                The Neuroscientist, Ahead of Print. <br/>Complex mechanisms govern the transport and action of oxytocin (Oxt), a neuropeptide and hormone that mediates diverse physiologic processes. While Oxt exerts site-specific and rapid effects in the brain via axonal and somatodendritic release, volume transmission via CSF and the neurovascular interface can act as an additional mechanism to distribute Oxt signals across distant brain regions on a slower timescale. This review focuses on modes of Oxt transport and action in the CNS, with particular emphasis on the roles of perivascular spaces, the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and circumventricular organs in coordinating the triadic interaction among circulating blood, CSF, and parenchyma. Perivascular spaces, critical conduits for CSF flow, play a pivotal role in Oxt diffusion and distribution within the CNS and reciprocally undergo Oxt-mediated structural and functional reconstruction. While the BBB modulates the movement of Oxt between systemic and cerebral circulation in a majority of brain regions, circumventricular organs without a functional BBB can allow for diffusion, monitoring, and feedback regulation of bloodborne peripheral signals such as Oxt. Recognition of these additional transport mechanisms provides enhanced insight into the systemic propagation and regulation of Oxt activity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94842">Differential conformational dynamics in two type-A RNA-binding domains drive the double-stranded RNA recognition and binding</a></h4>

              
                Trans-activation response (TAR) RNA-binding protein (TRBP) has emerged as a key player in the RNA interference pathway, wherein it binds to different pre-microRNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), each varying in sequence and/or structure. We hypothesize that TRBP displays dynamic adaptability to accommodate heterogeneity in target RNA structures. Thus, it is crucial to ascertain the role of intrinsic and RNA-induced protein dynamics in RNA recognition and binding. We have previously elucidated the role of intrinsic and RNA-induced conformational exchange in the double-stranded RNA-binding domain 1 (dsRBD1) of TRBP in shape-dependent RNA recognition. The current study delves into the intrinsic and RNA-induced conformational dynamics of the TRBP-dsRBD2 and then compares it with the dsRBD1 study carried out previously. Remarkably, the two domains exhibit differential binding affinity to a 12-bp dsRNA owing to the presence of critical residues and structural plasticity. Furthermore, we report that dsRBD2 depicts constrained conformational plasticity when compared to dsRBD1. Although, in the presence of RNA, dsRBD2 undergoes induced conformational exchange within the designated RNA-binding regions and other residues, the amplitude of the motions remains modest when compared to those observed in dsRBD1. We propose a dynamics-driven model of the two tandem domains of TRBP, substantiating their contributions to the versatility of dsRNA recognition and binding.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/80687">BRCA1/BRC-1 and SMC-5/6 regulate DNA repair pathway engagement during C. elegans meiosis</a></h4>

              
                The preservation of genome integrity during sperm and egg development is vital for reproductive success. During meiosis, the tumor suppressor BRCA1/BRC-1 and structural maintenance of chromosomes 5/6 (SMC-5/6) complex genetically interact to promote high fidelity DNA double strand break (DSB) repair, but the specific DSB repair outcomes these proteins regulate remain unknown. Using genetic and cytological methods to monitor resolution of DSBs with different repair partners in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>, we demonstrate that both BRC-1 and SMC-5 repress intersister crossover recombination events. Sequencing analysis of conversion tracts from homolog-independent DSB repair events further indicates that BRC-1 regulates intersister/intrachromatid noncrossover conversion tract length. Moreover, we find that BRC-1 specifically inhibits error prone repair of DSBs induced at mid-pachytene. Finally, we reveal functional interactions of BRC-1 and SMC-5/6 in regulating repair pathway engagement: BRC-1 is required for localization of recombinase proteins to DSBs in <i>smc-5</i> mutants and enhances DSB repair defects in <i>smc-5</i> mutants by repressing theta-mediated end joining (TMEJ). These results are consistent with a model in which some functions of BRC-1 act upstream of SMC-5/6 to promote recombination and inhibit error-prone DSB repair, while SMC-5/6 acts downstream of BRC-1 to regulate the formation or resolution of recombination intermediates. Taken together, our study illuminates the coordinate interplay of BRC-1 and SMC-5/6 to regulate DSB repair outcomes in the germline.

">Reduced gene dosage of the psychiatric risk gene Cacna1c is associated with impairments in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity in rats</a></h4>

              
                Common and rare variation in CACNA1C gene expression has been consistently associated with neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depression, however the underlying biological pathways that cause this association have yet to be fully determined. In this study, we present evidence that rats with a reduced gene dosage of Cacna1c have increased basal corticosterone levels in the periphery and reduced Nr3c1 gene expression in the hippocampus and hypothalamus. These results are consistent with an effect of Cacna1c dosage on hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function. We also show that the reduction of Nr3c1 in the hippocampus may be caused by epigenetic modification of exon 17 of Nr3c1, including the reduced interaction with the histone modifying markers H3K4me3 and H3K27ac. Heterozygous Cacna1c rats additionally show increased anxiety behaviours. These results support an association of Cacna1c heterozygosity with the altered activity of the HPA axis and function in the resting state and this may be a predisposing mechanism that contributes to the increased risk of psychiatric disorders with stress.

">Deletion of endocannabinoid synthesizing enzyme DAGLα from cerebellar Purkinje cells decreases social preference and elevates anxiety</a></h4>

              
                The endocannabinoid (eCB) signaling system is robustly expressed in the cerebellum starting from the embryonic developmental stages to adulthood. There it plays a key role in regulating cerebellar synaptic plasticity and excitability, suggesting that impaired eCB signaling will lead to deficits in cerebellar adjustments of ongoing behaviors and cerebellar learning. Indeed, human mutations in DAGL are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. In this study, we show that selective deletion of the eCB synthesizing enzyme diacylglycerol lipase alpha (Dagl) from mouse cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) alters motor and social behaviors, disrupts short-term synaptic plasticity in both excitatory and inhibitory synapses, and reduces Purkinje cell activity during social exploration. Our results provide the first evidence for cerebellar-specific eCB regulation of social behaviors and implicate eCB regulation of synaptic plasticity and PC activity as the neural substrates contributing to these deficits.

">Astrocyte Regulation of Synaptic Plasticity Balances Robustness and Flexibility of Cell Assemblies</a></h4>

              
                Cell assemblies are believed to represent the substrate of memory. Although long-term plasticity likely enables the formation of cell assemblies, how other factors, such as astrocytes and short-term plasticity (STP), affect their properties is poorly understood. To close this gap, we investigated cell assembly dynamics in a recurrent network model mimicking the hippocampal area CA3. As shown in experiment, recurrent connections in our model obey a symmetric spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), in which weight change may or may not depend on the releasable amount of neurotransmitter. The former case involves an interplay between STDP and STP. In addition, we implicitly modeled the effect of astrocyte NMDA receptors by manipulating the breadth of the distribution of neurotransmitter release probability in STP. Both STP-dependent and STP-independent STDP enabled spontaneous cell assembly formation. Under the former, however, cell assemblies tend to be smaller and more responsive to external stimulation, improving the network's memory capacity and enabling flexible network restructuring. Furthermore, astrocyte regulation of the STP-dependent STDP facilitates stimulus-driven reorganization of neural networks without destroying existing assembly structure, thus balancing cell assemblies' flexibility and robustness. Our findings elucidate the computational advantages of interaction between STP and STDP and highlight astrocytes' possible regulatory role in memory formation.

">A sticky Poisson Hidden Markov Model for spike data</a></h4>

              
                Fitting a hidden Markov Model (HMM) to neural data is a powerful method to segment a spatiotemporal stream of neural activity into sequences of discrete hidden states. Application of HMM has allowed to uncover hidden states and signatures of neural dynamics that seem relevant for sensory and cognitive processes. This has been accomplished especially in datasets comprising ensembles of simultaneously recorded cortical spike trains. However, the HMM analysis of spike data is involved and requires a careful handling of model selection. Two main issues are: (i) the cross-validated likelihood function typically increases with the number of hidden states; (ii) decoding the data with an HMM can lead to very rapid state switching due to fast oscillations in state probabilities. The first problem is related to the phenomenon of over-segmentation and leads to overfitting. The second problem is at odds with the empirical fact that hidden states in cortex tend to last from hundred of milliseconds to seconds. Here, we show that we can alleviate both problems by regularizing a Poisson-HMM during training so as to enforce large self-transition probabilities. We call this algorithm the "sticky Poisson-HMM" (sPHMM). When used together with the Bayesian Information Criterion for model selection, the sPHMM successfully eliminates rapid state switching, outperforming an alternative strategy based on an HMM with a large prior on the self-transition probabilities. The sPHMM also captures the ground truth in surrogate datasets built to resemble the statistical properties of the experimental data.

">Microsaccade direction reveals the variation in auditory selective attention processes</a></h4>

              
                Selective spatial attention plays a critical role in perception in the daily environment where multiple sensory stimuli exist. Even covertly directing attention to a specific location facilitates the brain's information processing of stimuli at the attended location. Previous behavioral and neurophysiological studies have shown that microsaccades, tiny involuntary saccadic eye movements, reflect such a process in terms of visual space and can be a marker of spatial attention. However, it is unclear whether auditory spatial attention processes that are supposed to interact with visual attention processes influence microsaccades and vice versa. Here, we examine the relationship between microsaccade direction and auditory spatial attention during dichotic oddball sound detection tasks. The results showed that the microsaccade direction was generally biased contralateral to the ear to which the oddball sound was presented or that to which sustained auditory attention was directed. The post-oddball modulation of microsaccade direction was associated with the behavioral performance of the detection task. The results suggest that the inhibition of stimulus-directed microsaccade occurs to reduce erroneous orientation of ocular responses during selective detection tasks. We also found that the correlation between microsaccade direction and neural response to the tone originated from the auditory brainstem (frequency-following response: FFR). Overall, the present study suggests that microsaccades can be a marker of auditory spatial attention and that the auditory neural activity fluctuates over time with the states of attention and the oculomotor system, also involving the auditory subcortical processes.

">SARM1 orthosteric base exchange inhibitors cause subinhibitory SARM1 activation</a></h4>

              
                SARM1, an octameric NADase, is a key regulator of axon degeneration and an emerging target in small molecule drug discovery to treat a wide range of neurodegenerative diseases. Recently, a structurally diverse series of adduct-forming, orthosteric SARM1 inhibitors have been discovered. Here, we show that subinhibitory concentrations of these orthosteric inhibitors, under mildly SARM1 activating conditions, cause sustained SARM1 activation. This synergistic adverse effect leads to increased nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) consumption, neurodegeneration and release of the biomarker neurofilament-light (NfL) in cultured cortical neurons. In two distinct animal models, we found that low-dose treatment with these orthosteric SARM1 inhibitors results in increased plasma NfL and adverse events when combined with cellular stress or injury conditions. This may present a critical liability for orthosteric SARM1 inhibitors in certain patient populations.

">Adenosine signaling in glia modulates metabolic state-dependent behavior in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                An animal's metabolic state strongly influences its behavior. Hungry animals prioritize food seeking and feeding behaviors, while sated animals suppress these behaviors to engage in other activities. Additionally, neuronal activity and synaptic transmission are among the most energy expensive processes. Yet neurons do not uptake nutrients from the circulation. Instead, glia fulfill this highly evolutionary conserved function. Recent studies have shown that glia can modulate neuronal activity and behavior. However, how different glia subtypes sense metabolic state and modulate neurons and behavior is incompletely understood. Here, we unravel two types of glia-mediated modulation of metabolic state-dependent behavior. In food-deprived flies, astrocyte-like and perineurial glia promote foraging and feeding, respectively, while cortex glia suppress these behaviors. We further show that adenosine and adenosine receptor modulate intracellular calcium levels in these glia subtypes, which ultimately controls behavior. This study reveals a new mechanism how different glia subtypes sense the metabolic state of the animal and modulate its behavior accordingly.

">Thermally-induced neuronal plasticity that mediates heat tolerance</a></h4>

              
                Heat acclimation is an adaptive process that improves physiological performance and supports survival in the face of increasing environmental temperatures. Understanding the underlying mechanisms holds potential to mitigate health risks and reduces the steadily increasing number of heat-related casualties associated with global warming. Here we report the identification of a discrete group of hypothalamic preoptic neurons that transform to rheostatically increase their activity over the course of heat acclimation, a property required for mice to become heat tolerant. Peripheral thermo-afferent pathways via the parabrachial nucleus activate preoptic neurons and mediate acute heat-defense mechanisms in non-acclimated animals. However, long-term heat exposure promotes the preoptic neurons to gain intrinsically warm-sensitive activity, independent of thermo-afferent parabrachial input. Our data shows that their newly gained cell-autonomous warm-sensitivity is required to recruit peripheral heat tolerance mechanisms in acclimated animals. Mechanistically, we find a combination of increased sodium leak current and enhanced utilization of the Nav1.3 ion channel to drive their pacemaker-like, warm-sensitive activity. We propose a salient neuronal plasticity mechanism, adaptively driving acclimation to promote heat tolerance.

">Stochastic Wiring of Cell Types Enhances Fitness by Generating Phenotypic Variability</a></h4>

              
                The development of neural connectivity is a crucial biological process that gives rise to diverse brain circuits and behaviors. Neural development is a stochastic process, but this stochasticity is often treated as a nuisance to overcome rather than as a functional advantage. Here we use a computational model, in which connection probabilities between discrete cell types are genetically specified, to investigate the benefits of stochasticity in the development of neural wiring. We show that this model can be viewed as a generalization of a powerful class of artificial neural networks---Bayesian neural networks---where each network parameter is a sample from a distribution. Our results reveal that stochasticity confers a greater benefit in large networks and variable environments, which may explain its role in organisms with larger brains. Surprisingly, we find that the average fitness over a population of agents is higher than a single agent defined by the average connection probability. Our model reveals how developmental stochasticity, by inducing a form of non-heritable phenotypic variability, can increase the probability that at least some individuals will survive in rapidly changing, unpredictable environments. Our results suggests how stochasticity may be an important feature rather than a bug in neural development.

">Neural mechanisms of credit assignment for delayed outcomes during contingent learning</a></h4>

              
                Adaptive behavior in complex environments critically relies on the ability to appropriately link specific choices or actions to their outcomes. However, the neural mechanisms that support the ability to credit only those past choices believed to have caused the observed outcomes remain unclear. Here, we leverage multivariate pattern analyses of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data and an adaptive learning task to shed light on the underlying neural mechanisms of such specific credit assignment. We find that the lateral orbitofrontal cortex (lOFC) and hippocampus (HC) code for the causal choice identity when credit needs to be assigned for choices that are separated from outcomes by a long delay, even when this delayed transition is punctuated by interim decisions. Further, we show when interim decisions must be made, learning is additionally supported by lateral frontopolar cortex (FPl). Our results indicate that FPl holds previous causal choices in a "pending" state until a relevant outcome is observed, and the fidelity of these representations predicts the fidelity of subsequent causal choice representations in lOFC and HC during credit assignment. Together, these results highlight the importance of the timely reinstatement of specific causes in lOFC and HC in learning choice-outcome relationships when delays and choices intervene, a critical component of real-world learning and decision making.

">Therapeutic potential of red blood cell-derived extracellular vesicles in reducing neuroinflammation and protecting against retinal degeneration.</a></h4>

              
                Neuroinflammation is a pathological process mediated through immune cell activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine release, resulting in neuronal cell death. In the central nervous system (CNS), neuroinflammation is a characteristic feature underlying the onset and progression of retinal and neurodegenerative diseases. Targeting neuroinflammation to reduce neuronal cell death and protect against visual and cognitive declines is therefore a key therapeutic strategy. However, due to the complex and multi-faceted nature of these diseases, to date there has been little therapeutic success with single target approaches insufficient to tackle widespread and multi-pathway inflammatory cascades. Furthermore, as the retina and brain reside within immune-privileged environments, a major challenge in treating these diseases is producing and delivering a therapeutic that, in itself, does not exacerbate inflammation. Extracellular vesicles (EV), derived from red blood cells (RBC EV), present a promising solution to overcome these hurdles, due to their innate ability to cross blood-tissue barriers, biocompatible nature, and their broad anti-inflammatory properties to modulate complex neuroinflammatory pathways. This study therefore investigated the therapeutic potential of RBC EV in mediating neuroinflammation using an in-vivo photo-oxidative damage model of retinal degeneration as a model for CNS neuroinflammation. In this work, we developed a novel incubation pipeline using N1 medium supplement and superoxide dismutase (SOD) supplementation to promote the production of safe, neuroprotective, and anti-inflammatory RBC EV. Delivery of RBC EV in vivo, was shown to be safe with strong penetration across all retinal layers. Further, therapeutic administration of RBC EV via local intravitreal injection significantly reduced inflammation and cell death and preserved retinal function. Notably, strong safety and therapeutic efficacy was also demonstrated in the retina following systemic (intraperitoneal) administration, highlighting a potential game-changing approach for less-invasive therapeutic delivery to the CNS. Finally, multi-omic analyses and in vitro findings supported an anti-inflammatory mechanism-of-action, with RBC EV modulating pro-inflammatory cytokine release, including those known to be involved in the pathogenesis of retinal and neurodegenerative diseases. Taken together, these findings highlight the broad applicability of RBC EV in treating neuroinflammation in the CNS, presenting a scalable and effective treatment approach for these currently untreatable diseases.

A key feature of this model system is that following priming, stimuli that do not normally cause hyperalgesia now readily provoke this state. We hypothesized that hyperalgesic priming occurs due to reorganization of translation of mRNA in nociceptors. To test this hypothesis, we used paclitaxel treatment as the priming stimulus and translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) to measure persistent changes in mRNA translation in Nav1.8+ nociceptors. TRAP sequencing revealed 161 genes with persistently altered mRNA translation in the primed state. We identified Gpr88 as upregulated and Metrn as downregulated. We confirmed a functional role for these genes, wherein a GPR88 agonist causes pain only in primed mice and established hyperalgesic priming is reversed by Meteorin. Our work demonstrates that altered nociceptor translatomes are causative in producing hyperalgesic priming.

">Nervous system-wide analysis of all C. elegans cadherins reveals neuron-specific functions across multiple anatomical scales</a></h4>

              
                Differential expression of cell adhesion proteins is a hallmark of cell type diversity across the animal kingdom. Gene family-wide characterization of their organismal expression and function are, however, lacking. We established an atlas of expression of the entire set of 12 cadherin gene family members in the nematode C. elegans, testing the hypothesis that members of this gene family define combinatorial expression codes that may drive nervous system assembly. This atlas reveals differential expression of genomically tagged cadherin genes across neuronal classes, a dichotomy between broadly- and narrowly-expressed cadherins, and several context-dependent temporal transitions in expression across development. Engineered mutant null alleles of cadherins were analyzed for defects in morphology, behavior, neuronal soma positions, neurite neighborhood topology and fasciculation, and localization of synapses in many parts of the nervous system. This analysis revealed a restricted pattern of neuronal differentiation defects at discrete subsets of anatomical scales, including a novel role of cadherins in experience-dependent electrical synapse formation. In total, our analysis results in novel perspectives on cadherin deployment and function.

">Turning microglia neuroprotective: Towards connexin43-specific therapy of Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the major cause of senile dementia without effective therapeutic strategies. The fundamental role of microglia in AD pathology, particularly in the early stages, is well acknowledged, although cell-specific therapeutic targets were not identified. Here we show that microglial connexin 43 (Cx43) hemichannels controls microglial reactivity in AD, thus being a promising therapeutic target. We discovered a marked increase in Cx43 protein in the periplaque microglia in the post-mortem tissue from AD patients. Subsequently, using the APPswe/PS1dE9 mouse model of AD, we demonstrated that microglial Cx43 operating as hemichannels influences microglial function, which in turn affects {beta}-amyloid pathology. Ablation of microglial Cx43 hemichannels by genetic knockout shifted microglia to neuroprotective phenotype, which promoted the microglia-plaque interaction while suppressing the neurotoxic microglial signature, thereby mitigating the progression of AD. Following this lead, we developed a novel formulation of a small molecule peptide, lipid nanoparticle-delivered molecule TAT-Cx43266-283 (TAT-CX43@LNPs), which selectively blocks Cx43 hemichannels. Our preclinical trial demonstrated its efficacy in delaying and rescuing {beta}-amyloid-related neuropathology and cognitive impairment in AD mice. This study provides strong evidence to progress our novel drug into clinical trials and translate it to disease-preventing (when administered in the early disease stages) and disease-modifying agents.

">Prefrontal Cortex subregions provide distinct visual and behavioral feedback modulation to the Primary Visual Cortex</a></h4>

              
                The mammalian Prefrontal Cortex (PFC) has been suggested to modulate sensory information processing across multiple cortical regions via long-range axonal projections. These axonal projections arise from PFC subregions with unique brain-wide connectivity and functional repertoires, which may provide the architecture for modular feedback intended to shape sensory processing. Here, we used axonal tracing, axonal and somatic 2-photon calcium imaging, and chemogenetic manipulations in mice to delineate how projections from the Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACA) and ventrolateral Orbitofrontal Cortex (ORB) of the PFC modulate sensory processing in the primary Visual Cortex (VISp) across behavioral states. Structurally, we found that ACA and ORB have distinct patterning of projections across both cortical regions and layers. ACA axons in VISp had a stronger representation of visual stimulus information than ORB axons, but both projections showed non-visual, behavior-dependent activity. ACA input to VISp enhanced the encoding of visual stimuli by VISp neurons, and modulation of visual responses scaled with arousal. On the other hand, ORB input shaped movement and arousal related modulation of VISp visual responses, but specifically reduced the encoding of high-contrast visual stimuli. Thus, ACA and ORB feedback have separable projection patterns and encode distinct visual and behavioral information, putatively providing the substrate for their unique effects on visual representations and behavioral modulation in VISp. Our results offer a refined model of cortical hierarchy and its impact on sensory information processing, whereby distinct as opposed to generalized properties of PFC projections contribute to VISp activity during discrete behavioral states.

                High-frequency brain oscillations in humans are currently categorized into beta (13-30 Hz) and gamma (>30 Hz). Here, I introduce a new class of oscillations between 25 and 35 Hz, which I propose to call "iota." Iota oscillations have low amplitudes but can still be measured with surface electroencephalography (EEG). Within an individual, iota has a narrow spectral bandwidth of 2-4 Hz, thus distinguishing it from broadband beta and gamma. Iota oscillations occur as sustained bursts during both wakefulness and REM sleep but do not appear during NREM sleep. They are only found in a minority of individuals, more in children than in adults. Overall, iota oscillations are challenging to detect but could serve as a marker of both brain development and states of vigilance.

                Evidence points to a role for microglia in Alzheimers disease (AD) risk, although their position in the pathological cascade is incompletely understood, prompting us to generate a model of beta-amyloidopathy lacking microglia. We find evidence that microglia promote plaque formation and creation of an A-beta fibril-rich zone surrounding the plaque core. However, plaque-proximal reactive astrogliosis, synapse loss, and neurite dystrophy are still observed in the absence of microglia.

                We demonstrate the dual role of microglia in Alzheimer's disease (AD), initially harmful, by seeding amyloid plaques, and protective in later stages by compacting amyloid plaques. Early microglial depletion using pharmacological or genetic blockage of CSF1R reduces plaque load and associated neuritic dystrophy, while human microglia transplantation restores plaque formation, confirming their seeding role. Transplanted TREM2R47H/R47H microglia exacerbate plaque pathology, highlighting microglia as key initiators of the amyloid pathology cascade.

">Repeated activation of preoptic area-recipient neurons in posterior paraventricular nucleus mediates chronic heat-induced negative emotional and hyperarousal states</a></h4>

              
                Mental and behavioral disorders are associated with extended period of hot weather as found in heatwaves, but the underlying neural circuit mechanism is poorly known. The posterior paraventricular thalamus (pPVT) is a hub for emotional processing and receives inputs from the hypothalamic preoptic area (POA), the well-recognized thermoregulation center. The present study was designed to explore whether chronic heat exposure leads to aberrant activities in POA recipient pPVT neurons and subsequent changes in emotional states. By devising an air heating paradigm mimicking the condition of heatwaves and utilizing emotion-related behavioral tests, viral track tracing, in vivo calcium recordings, optogenetic manipulations and electrophysiological recordings, we found that chronic heat exposure for 3 weeks led to negative emotional and hyperarousal states in mice. The pPVT neurons receive monosynaptic excitatory and inhibitory innervations from the POA. These neurons exhibited a persistent increase in neural activity following chronic heat exposure, which was essential for chronic heat-induced emotional changes. Notably, these neurons were also prone to display stronger neuronal activities associated with anxiety responses to stressful situations. Furthermore, we observed saturated neuroplasticity in the POA-pPVT excitatory pathway after chronic heat exposure that occluded further potentiation. Taken together, long-term aberration in the POA to pPVT pathway offers a neurobiological mechanism of emotional and behavioral changes seen in extended period of hot weather like heatwaves.

">Sertad1 is elevated and plays a necessary role in synaptic loss, neuron death and cognitive impairment in a model of Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                Dysfunctional autophagy is a primary characteristic of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. How autophagic impairment leads to cellular changes that contributes to AD pathogenesis remains unclear. To study this further, we assessed levels of autophagy related proteins in 5xFAD mice brain at different ages and found their robust upregulation in cortex and hippocampus suggesting increased induction of autophagy with disease progression but failed clearance. We have identified a transcriptional coregulator Sertad1, as a key mediator of dysfunctional autophagy in AD mice. We found a progressive elevation in Sertad1 levels in 5xFAD mice with age compared to wild-type (WT) mice. Sertad1 knockdown in 5xFAD mice brain lowered levels of autophagy related proteins and lysosome marker, LAMP1 suggesting its role in autophagy flux modulation. FoxO3a is an important transcriptional regulator of the autophagy network and lies at the nexus of autophagy-apoptosis cross-talk. We found that Sertad1 knockdown blocked nuclear translocation of FoxO3a along with a restoration in Akt activity. Further, we showed that knockdown of Sertad1 in 5xFAD mice brain improved cognitive functions along with a remarkable restoration in synaptic health and dendritic spine density. Taken together, our results demonstrated that autophagy is robustly induced with disease progression but it is impaired; Sertad1 knockdown restored autophagy defects, synaptic loss and improved learning and memory in AD models. Thus, we propose that Sertad1 acts in a multimodal manner regulating crucial cell death pathways including apoptosis and autophagy and could be an excellent target for therapeutic intervention to combat a multifactorial disorder such as AD.

">Touch inhibits cold: non-contact cooling reveals a novel thermotactile gating mechanism</a></h4>

              
                Skin stimuli reach the brain via multiple neural channels specific for different stimulus types. These channels interact in the spinal cord, typically through inhibition. Inter-channel interactions can be investigated by selectively stimulating one channel and comparing the sensations that result when another sensory channel is or is not concurrently stimulated. Applying this logic to thermal-mechanical interactions proves difficult, because most existing thermal stimulators involve skin contact. We used a novel non-tactile stimulator for focal cooling (9mm2) by using thermal imaging of skin temperature as a feedback signal to regulate exposure to a dry ice source. We could then investigate how touch modulates cold sensation by delivering cooling to the human hand dorsum in either the presence or absence of light touch. Across three signal detection experiments, we found that sensitivity to cooling was significantly reduced by touch. This reduction was specific to touch, since it did not occur when presenting auditory signals instead of the tactile input, making explanations based on distraction or attention unlikely. Our findings suggest that touch inhibits cold perception, recalling interactions of touch and pain previously described by Pain Gate Theory. We show, for the first time, a thermotactile gating mechanism between mechanical and cooling signals.

">Somatosensory stimulation in moving mice</a></h4>

              
                Somatosensation connects animals to their immediate environment, shaping critical behaviours essential for adaptation, learning, and survival. The investigation of somatosensation in mice presents significant challenges, primarily due to the practical difficulties of delivering somatosensory stimulation to their skin as they are in motion. To address this problem, we have developed a method for precise delivery of somatosensory stimuli in mice as they are moving through environments. The approach employs real-time keypoint tracking and targeted optical stimulation, offering precision while preserving the naturalistic context of the behaviours studied to overcome the traditional trade-offs between experimental control and natural behaviour. We demonstrate the method across nociceptive testing to unrestrained behaviour in different environments. We observed that minimal nociceptive inputs can evoke rapid behaviours and these modify movements when stimuli are applied during motion. This method provides a way to explore the diverse roles of somatosensation, from reflexes to decision-making, in naturalistic settings.

                Purpose. To date, no non-invasive imaging modality has been employed to profile the structural intricacies of the hippocampal arterial microvasculature in humans. We hypothesised that synchrotron-based imaging of the human hippocampus would enable precise characterisation of the arterial microvasculature. Methods. Two preserved human brains from, a 69-year-old female and a 63-year-old male body donors were imaged using hierarchical phase-contrast tomography (HiP-CT) with synchrotron radiation at multiple voxel resolutions from 25.08 um down to 2.45 um. Subsequent manual and semi-automatic artery segmentation were performed followed by morphometric analyses. These data were compared to published data from alternative methodologies. Results. HiP-CT made it possible to segment in context the arterial architecture of the human hippocampus. Our analysis identified anterior, medial and posterior hippocampal arteries arising from the P2 segment of the posterior cerebral artery on the image slices. We mapped arterial branches with external diameters greater than 50 m in the hippocampal region. We visualised vascular asymmetry and quantified arterial structures with diameters as small as 7 um. Conclusions. Through the application of HiP-CT, we have provided the first imaging visualisation and quantification of the arterial system of the human hippocampus at high resolution in the context of whole brain imaging. Our results bridge the gap between anatomical and histological scales.

">Neural basis of concurrent deliberation toward a choice and degree of confidence</a></h4>

              
                Decision confidence plays a key role in flexible behavior, but exactly how and when it arises in the brain remains unclear. Theoretical accounts suggest that confidence can be inferred from the same evidence accumulation process that governs choice and response time (RT), implying that a provisional confidence assessment could be updated in parallel with decision formation. We tested this using a novel RT task in nonhuman primates that measures choice and confidence with a single eye movement on every trial. Monkey behavior was well fit by a 2D bounded accumulator model instantiating parallel processing of evidence, rejecting a serial model in which choice is resolved first followed by post-decision accumulation for confidence. Neural activity in area LIP reflected concurrent accumulation, exhibiting within-trial dynamics consistent with parallel updating at near zero time lag, and significant covariation in choice and confidence signals across the population. The results demonstrate that monkeys concurrently process a single stream of evidence to arrive at a choice and level of confidence, and illuminate a candidate neural mechanism for this ability.

">Differential Contributions of CA3 and Entorhinal Cortex Inputs to Ripple Patterns in the Hippocampus Under Cannabidiol</a></h4>

              
                Cannabidiol (CBD), increasingly recognized for its potential to treat insomnia, notably extends NonREM sleep phases and modifies sleep-associated ripple dynamics. Utilizing a threshold-based approach, our study differentiated distinct ripple types in rats, clarifying the contributions of intra-hippocampal (CA3) and cortical (mEC) regions to these events. The findings reveal that CBD primarily influences the CA3's input to the CA1, resulting in an increased occurrence of short ripples predominantly induced by cortical (mEC) activity and a corresponding decrease in long, intra-hippocampal sharp-wave-ripples. This study highlights the critical interplay between the CA3 and entorhinal cortex dynamics in shaping the characteristics of hippocampal ripples under the influence of CBD.

">Diminished social memory and hippocampal correlates of social interactions in chronic social defeat stress susceptibility</a></h4>

              
                Background: The susceptibility to chronic stress has been associated with depression, a mood disorder which highly implicates the hippocampus. Hippocampal contribution to stress susceptibility has been supported by findings in mice following chronic social defeat stress (CSDS). However, little is known of the role of hippocampal activity in determining the development of stress susceptibility. Methods: We used the UCLA miniscope to longitudinally measure the activity of dorsal CA1 hippocampal neurons across CSDS. Apart from examining the representation of social information by these neurons, we also compared social memory in mice that were susceptible or resilient to CSDS. Results: We observed more stable dCA1 correlates of social interaction and social memory in CSDS resilience. Such changes were absent in CSDS susceptible mice and accompanied by greater social memory impairments. Conclusions: CSDS susceptibility may be supported by hippocampal social cognitive processes, reflected in diminished hippocampal representations of social information and a greater impairment in social memory.

">Repetitive sensory stimulation potentiates and recruits sensory-evoked cortical population activity</a></h4>

              
                Sensory experience and learning are thought to be associated with plasticity of neocortical circuits. Repetitive sensory stimulation can induce long-term potentiation (LTP) of cortical excitatory synapses in anesthetized mice; however, it is unclear if these phenomena are associated with sustained changes in activity during wakefulness. Here we used time-lapse, calcium imaging of layer (L) 2/3 neurons in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1), in awake male mice, to assess the effects of a bout of rhythmic whisker stimulation (RWS) at a frequency by which rodents sample objects. We found that RWS induced a 1h-increase in whisker-evoked L2/3 neuronal activity. This was not observed for whiskers functionally connected to distant cortical columns. We also found that RWS altered whether individual neurons encoded subsequent stimulus representation by either being recruited or suppressed. Vasoactive intestinal-peptide-expressing (VIP) interneurons, which promote plasticity through disinhibition of pyramidal neurons, were found to exclusively elevate activity during RWS. These findings indicate that cortical neurons representation of sensory input can be modulated over hours through repetitive sensory stimulation, which may be gated by activation of disinhibitory circuits.

">Synaptic cell adhesion molecule Cdh6 identifies a class of sensory neurons with novel functions in colonic motility</a></h4>

              
                Intrinsic sensory neurons are an essential part of the enteric nervous system (ENS) and play a crucial role in gastrointestinal tract motility and digestion. Neuronal subtypes in the ENS have been distinguished by their electrophysiological properties, morphology, and expression of characteristic markers, notably neurotransmitters and neuropeptides. Here we investigated synaptic cell adhesion molecules as novel cell type markers in the ENS. Our work identifies two Type II classic cadherins, Cdh6 and Cdh8 specific to sensory neurons in the mouse colon. We show that Cdh6+ neurons demonstrate all other distinguishing classifications of enteric sensory neurons including marker expression of Calcb and Nmu, Dogiel type II morphology and AH-type electrophysiology and IH current. Optogenetic activation of Cdh6+ sensory neurons in distal colon evokes retrograde colonic motor complexes (CMCs), while pharmacologic blockade of rhythmicity-associated current IH disrupts the spontaneous generation of CMCs. These findings provide the first demonstration of selective activation of a single neurochemical and functional class of enteric neurons, and demonstrate a functional and critical role for sensory neurons in the generation of CMCs.

">Magnetoelectric Microrobots for Spinal Cord Injury Regeneration</a></h4>

              
                Regenerative medicine continually seeks effective methods to address spinal cord injuries (SCI), which are known for their limited regenerative potential. Despite advances in neural progenitor cell (NPC) transplants for spinal cord injuries, challenges related to graft survival, reliable in vivo differentiation, and neural integration significantly hinder real functional recovery and limit clinical outcomes. This study introduces 'NPCbots', biohybrid microrobots engineered by integrating human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived NPCs with magnetoelectric nanoparticles composed of cobalt ferrite-barium titanate. These enable magnetic navigation and neuronal stimulation, enhancing targeted therapeutic interventions. Our lab-on-a-chip system allows for the mass production of NPCbots, ensuring their differentiation and biocompatibility. Remarkably, in a zebrafish model of SCI, NPCbots stimulated by an alternating magnetic field demonstrated rapid in vivo differentiation and integration into damaged neural pathways, significantly enhancing neural regeneration. Within three days, injured zebrafish treated with NPCbots exhibited almost normal swimming behavior and significantly improved exploratory behavior, showcasing the potential of NPCbots to swiftly repair neural structures and restore the central nervous system's functionality in spinal cord injury models through non-invasive means. Additionally, precise in vitro and in vivo manipulation of NPCbots indicates their broader application in various neurodegenerative disorders, offering a promising route for effective spinal cord and neurological recovery.

">Local lateral connectivity is sufficient for replicating cortex-like topographical organization in deep neural networks</a></h4>

              
                Across the primate cortex, neurons that perform similar functions tend to be spatially grouped together. In the high-level visual cortex, this biological principle manifests itself as a modular organization of neuronal clusters, each tuned to a specific object category. The tendency toward short connections is widely believed to explain the existence of such an organization in the brains of many animals. However, the neural mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain unclear. Here, we use artificial deep neural networks as test beds to demonstrate that a topographical organization akin to that in the primary, intermediate, and high-level human visual cortex emerges when units in these models are locally laterally connected and their weight parameters are tuned by top-down credit assignment (i.e. backpropagation of error). The emergence of modular organization without explicit topography-inducing learning rules or objective functions challenges their necessity and suggests that local lateral connectivity alone may suffice for the formation of topographic organization across the cortex. Furthermore, the incorporation of lateral connections in deep convolutional networks enhances their robustness to small input perturbations, indicating an additional role for these connections in learning robust representations.

	<p>Bodily self-consciousness (BSC), a subject of interdisciplinary interest, refers to the awareness of one&amp;amp;rsquo;s bodily states. Previous studies have noted the existence of individual differences in BSC, while neglecting the underlying factors and neural basis of such individual differences. Considering that BSC relied on integration from both internal and external self-relevant information, we here review previous findings on individual differences in BSC through a three-level-self model, which includes interoceptive, exteroceptive, and mental self-processing. The data show that cross-level factors influenced individual differences in BSC, involving internal bodily signal perceptibility, multisensory processing principles, personal traits shaped by environment, and interaction modes that integrate multiple levels of self-processing. Furthermore, in interoceptive processing, regions like the anterior cingulate cortex and insula show correlations with different perceptions of internal sensations. For exteroception, the parietal lobe integrates sensory inputs, coordinating various BSC responses. Mental self-processing modulates differences in BSC through areas like the medial prefrontal cortex. For interactions between multiple levels of self-processing, regions like the intraparietal sulcus involve individual differences in BSC. We propose that diverse experiences of BSC can be attributed to different levels of self-processing, which moderates one&amp;amp;rsquo;s perception of their body. Overall, considering individual differences in BSC is worth amalgamating diverse methodologies for the diagnosis and treatment of some diseases.</p>

	<p>Aggression is a fundamental behavior with essential roles in dominance assertion, resource acquisition, and self-defense across the animal kingdom. However, dysregulation of the aggression circuitry can have severe consequences in humans, leading to economic, emotional, and societal burdens. Previous inconsistencies in aggression research have been due to limitations in techniques for studying these neurons at a high spatial resolution, resulting in an incomplete understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying aggression. Recent advancements in optogenetics, pharmacogenetics, single-cell RNA sequencing, and in vivo electrophysiology have provided new insights into this complex circuitry. This review aims to explore the aggression-provoking stimuli and their detection in rodents, particularly through the olfactory systems. Additionally, we will examine the core regions associated with aggression, their interactions, and their connection with the prefrontal cortex. We will also discuss the significance of top-down cognitive control systems in regulating atypical expressions of aggressive behavior. While the focus will primarily be on rodent circuitry, we will briefly touch upon the modulation of aggression in humans through the prefrontal cortex and discuss emerging therapeutic interventions that may benefit individuals with aggression disorders. This comprehensive understanding of the neural substrates of aggression will pave the way for the development of novel therapeutic strategies and clinical interventions. This approach contrasts with the broader perspective on neural mechanisms of aggression across species, aiming for a more focused analysis of specific pathways and their implications for therapeutic interventions.</p>

                <p>NMDA-type glutamate receptors (NMDARs) are widely recognized as master regulators of synaptic plasticity, most notably for driving long-term changes in synapse size and strength that support learning. NMDARs are unique among neurotransmitter receptors in that they require binding of both neurotransmitter (glutamate) and co-agonist (e.g., <scp>d</scp>-serine) to open the receptor channel, which leads to the influx of calcium ions that drive synaptic plasticity. Over the past decade, evidence has accumulated that NMDARs also support synaptic plasticity via ion flux-independent (non-ionotropic) signaling upon the binding of glutamate in the absence of co-agonist, although conflicting results have led to significant controversy. Here, we hypothesized that a major source of contradictory results might be attributed to variable occupancy of the co-agonist binding site under different experimental conditions. To test this hypothesis, we manipulated co-agonist availability in acute hippocampal slices from mice of both sexes. We found that enzymatic scavenging of endogenous co-agonists enhanced the magnitude of long-term depression (LTD) induced by non-ionotropic NMDAR signaling in the presence of the NMDAR pore blocker MK801. Conversely, a saturating concentration of <scp>d</scp>-serine completely inhibited LTD and spine shrinkage induced by glutamate binding in the presence of MK801 or Mg<sup>2+</sup>. Using a Fo&#x0308;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based assay in cultured neurons, we further found that <scp>d</scp>-serine completely blocked NMDA-induced conformational movements of the GluN1 cytoplasmic domains in the presence of MK801. Our results support a model in which <scp>d</scp>-serine availability serves to modulate NMDAR signaling and synaptic plasticity even when the NMDAR is blocked by magnesium.</p>

                <p>Recent work demonstrated that activation of spinal D1 and D5 dopamine receptors (D1/D5Rs) facilitates non-Hebbian long-term potentiation (LTP) at primary afferent synapses onto spinal projection neurons. However, the cellular localization of the D1/D5Rs driving non-Hebbian LTP in spinal nociceptive circuits remains unknown, and it is also unclear whether D1/D5R signaling must occur concurrently with sensory input in order to promote non-Hebbian LTP at these synapses. Here we investigate these issues using cell-type&ndash;selective knockdown of D1Rs or D5Rs from lamina I spinoparabrachial neurons, dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, or astrocytes in adult mice of either sex using Cre recombinase-based genetic strategies. The LTP evoked by low-frequency stimulation of primary afferents in the presence of the selective D1/D5R agonist SKF82958 persisted following the knockdown of D1R or D5R in spinoparabrachial neurons, suggesting that postsynaptic D1/D5R signaling was dispensable for non-Hebbian plasticity at sensory synapses onto these key output neurons of the superficial dorsal horn (SDH). Similarly, the knockdown of D1Rs or D5Rs in DRG neurons failed to influence SKF82958-enabled LTP in lamina I projection neurons. In contrast, SKF82958-induced LTP was suppressed by the knockdown of D1R or D5R in spinal astrocytes. Furthermore, the data indicate that the activation of D1R/D5Rs in spinal astrocytes can either retroactively or proactively drive non-Hebbian LTP in spinoparabrachial neurons. Collectively, these results suggest that dopaminergic signaling in astrocytes can strongly promote activity-dependent LTP in the SDH, which is predicted to significantly enhance the amplification of ascending nociceptive transmission from the spinal cord to the brain.</p>

                <p>MicroRNAs are emerging as crucial regulators within the complex, dynamic environment of the synapse, and they offer a promising new avenue for the treatment of neurological disease. These small noncoding RNAs modify gene expression in several ways, including posttranscriptional modulation via binding to complementary and semicomplementary sites on target mRNAs. This rapid, finely tuned regulation of gene expression is essential to meet the dynamic demands of the synapse. Here, we provide a detailed review of the multifaceted world of synaptic microRNA regulation. We discuss the many mechanisms by which microRNAs regulate gene expression at the synapse, particularly in the context of neuronal plasticity. We also describe the various factors, such as age, sex, and neurological disease, that can influence microRNA expression and activity in neurons. In summary, microRNAs play a crucial role in the intricate and quickly changing functional requirements of the synapse, and context is essential in the study of microRNAs and their potential therapeutic applications.</p>

                <p>During natural behavior, an action often needs to be suddenly stopped in response to an unexpected sensory input&mdash;referred to as reactive stopping. Reactive stopping has been mostly investigated in humans, which led to hypotheses about the involvement of different brain structures, in particular the hyperdirect pathway. Here, we directly investigate the contribution and interaction of two key regions of the hyperdirect pathway, the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and subthalamic nucleus (STN), using dual-area, multielectrode recordings in male rats performing a stop-signal task. In this task, rats have to initiate movement to a go-signal, and occasionally stop their movement to the go-signal side after a stop-signal, presented at various stop-signal delays. Both the OFC and STN show near-simultaneous field potential reductions in the beta frequency range (12&ndash;30&nbsp;Hz) compared with the period preceding the go-signal and the movement period. These transient reductions (~200&nbsp;ms) only happen during reactive stopping, which is when the stop-signal was received after action initiation, and are well timed after stop-signal onset and before the estimated time of stopping. Phase synchronization analysis also showed a transient attenuation of synchronization between the OFC and STN in the beta range during reactive stopping. The present results provide the first direct quantification of local neural oscillatory activity in the OFC and STN and interareal synchronization specifically timed during reactive stopping.</p>

                <p>The mechanisms utilized by neurons to regulate the efficacy of phasic and tonic inhibition and their impacts on synaptic plasticity and behavior are incompletely understood. Cleft lip and palate transmembrane protein 1 (Clptm1) is a membrane-spanning protein that interacts with multiple -aminobutyric acid type A receptor (GABA<SUB>A</SUB>R) subunits, trapping them in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi network. Overexpression and knock-down studies suggest that Clptm1 modulates GABA<SUB>A</SUB>R-mediated phasic inhibition and tonic inhibition as well as activity-induced inhibitory synaptic homeostasis in cultured hippocampal neurons. To investigate the role of Clptm1 in the modulation of GABA<SUB>A</SUB>Rs in vivo, we generated Clptm1 knock-out (KO) mice. Here, we show that genetic KO of Clptm1 elevated phasic and tonic inhibitory transmission in both male and female heterozygous mice. Although basal excitatory synaptic transmission was not affected, Clptm1 haploinsufficiency significantly blocked high-frequency stimulation-induced long&ndash;term potentiation (LTP) in hippocampal CA3-&gt;CA1 synapses. In the hippocampus-dependent contextual fear-conditioning behavior task, both male and female Clptm1 heterozygous KO mice exhibited impairment in contextual fear memory. In addition, LTP and contextual fear memory were rescued by application of L-655,708, a negative allosteric modulator of the extrasynaptic GABA<SUB>A</SUB>R &alpha;5 subunit. These results suggest that haploinsufficiency of Clptm1 contributes to cognitive deficits through altered synaptic transmission and plasticity by elevation of inhibitory neurotransmission, with tonic inhibition playing a major role.</p>

                <p>Activity of central amygdala (CeA) PKC expressing neurons has been linked to appetite regulation, anxiety-like behaviors, pain sensitivity, and addiction-related behaviors. Studies of the role that CeA PKC+ neurons play in these behaviors have largely been carried out in mice, and genetic tools that would allow selective manipulation of PKC+ cells in rats have been lacking. Here, we used a CRISPR/Cas9 strategy to generate a transgenic <I>Prkcd</I>-cre knock-in rat and characterized this model using anatomical, electrophysiological, and behavioral approaches in both sexes. In the CeA, Cre was selectively expressed in PKC+ cells. Anterograde projections of PKC+ neurons to cortical regions, subcortical regions, several hypothalamic nuclei, the amygdala complex, and midbrain dopaminergic regions were largely consistent with published mouse data. In a behavioral screen, we found no differences between Cre<sup>+</sup> rats and Cre<sup>&ndash;</sup> wild-type littermates. Optogenetic stimulation of CeA PKC+ neurons in a palatable food intake assay resulted in an increased latency to first feeding and decreased total food intake, once again replicating published mouse findings. Lastly, using a real-time place preference task, we found that stimulation of PKC+ neurons promoted aversion, without affecting locomotor activity. Collectively, these findings establish the novel <I>Prkcd</I>-Cre rat line as a valuable tool that complements available mouse lines for investigating the functional role of PKC+ neurons.</p>

                <p>Studies using magnetic brain stimulation indicate the involvement of somatosensory regions in the acquisition and retention of newly learned movements. Recent work found an impairment in motor memory when retention was tested shortly after the application of continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS) to the primary somatosensory cortex, compared with stimulation of the primary motor cortex or a control zone. This finding that the somatosensory cortex is involved in motor memory retention whereas the motor cortex is not, if confirmed, could alter our understanding of human motor learning. It would indicate that plasticity in sensory systems underlies newly learned movements, which is different than the commonly held view that adaptation learning involves updates to a motor controller. Here we test this idea. Participants were trained in a visuomotor adaptation task, with visual feedback gradually shifted. Following adaptation, cTBS was applied either to M1, S1, or an occipital cortex control area. Participants were tested for retention 24&nbsp;h later. It was observed that S1 stimulation led to reduced retention of prior learning, compared with stimulation of M1 or the control area (with no significant difference between M1 and control). In a further control, cTBS was applied to S1 following training with unrotated feedback, in which no learning occurred. This had no effect on movement in the retention test indicating the effects of S1 stimulation on movement are learning specific. The findings are consistent with the S1 participation in the encoding of learning-related changes to movements and in the retention of human motor memory.</p>

                <p>Sleep slow waves are the hallmark of deeper non-rapid eye movement sleep. It is generally assumed that gray matter properties predict slow-wave density, morphology, and spectral power in healthy adults. Here, we tested the association between gray matter volume (GMV) and slow-wave characteristics in 27 patients with moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury (TBI, 32.0 &plusmn; 12.2&nbsp;years old, eight women) and compared that with 32 healthy controls (29.2 &plusmn; 11.5&nbsp;years old, nine women). Participants underwent overnight polysomnography and cerebral MRI with a 3&nbsp;Tesla scanner. A whole-brain voxel&ndash;wise analysis was performed to compare GMV between groups. Slow-wave density, morphology, and spectral power (0.4&ndash;6&nbsp;Hz) were computed, and GMV was extracted from the thalamus, cingulate, insula, precuneus, and orbitofrontal cortex to test the relationship between slow waves and gray matter in regions implicated in the generation and/or propagation of slow waves. Compared with controls, TBI patients had significantly lower frontal and temporal GMV and exhibited a subtle decrease in slow-wave frequency. Moreover, higher GMV in the orbitofrontal cortex, insula, cingulate cortex, and precuneus was associated with higher slow-wave frequency and slope, but only in healthy controls. Higher orbitofrontal GMV was also associated with higher slow-wave density in healthy participants. While we observed the expected associations between GMV and slow-wave characteristics in healthy controls, no such associations were observed in the TBI group despite lower GMV. This finding challenges the presumed role of GMV in slow-wave generation and morphology.</p>

                <p>Neuroticism/negative emotionality (N/NE)&mdash;the tendency to experience anxiety, fear, and other negative emotions&mdash;is a fundamental dimension of temperament with profound consequences for health, wealth, and well-being. Elevated N/NE is associated with a panoply of adverse outcomes, from reduced socioeconomic attainment to psychiatric illness. Animal research suggests that N/NE reflects heightened reactivity to uncertain threat in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BST) and central nucleus of the amygdala (Ce), but the relevance of these discoveries to humans has remained unclear. Here we used a novel combination of psychometric, psychophysiological, and neuroimaging approaches to test this hypothesis in an ethnoracially diverse, sex-balanced sample of 220 emerging adults selectively recruited to encompass a broad spectrum of N/NE. Cross-validated robust-regression analyses demonstrated that N/NE is preferentially associated with heightened BST activation during the uncertain anticipation of a genuinely distressing threat (aversive multimodal stimulation), whereas N/NE was unrelated to BST activation during certain-threat anticipation, Ce activation during either type of threat anticipation, or BST/Ce reactivity to threat-related faces. It is often assumed that different threat paradigms are interchangeable assays of individual differences in brain function, yet this has rarely been tested. Our results revealed negligible associations between BST/Ce reactivity to the anticipation of threat and the presentation of threat-related faces, indicating that the two tasks are nonfungible. These observations provide a framework for conceptualizing emotional traits and disorders; for guiding the design and interpretation of biobank and other neuroimaging studies of psychiatric risk, disease, and treatment; and for refining mechanistic research.</p>

                <p>Overexpression of the agouti-signaling protein (<I>asip1</I>), an endogenous melanocortin antagonist, under the control of a constitutive promoter in zebrafish [Tg(Xla.Eef1a1:Cau.Asip1]iim4] (<I>asip1</I>-Tg) increases food intake by reducing sensitivity of the central satiety systems and abolish circadian activity rhythms. The phenotype also shows increased linear growth and body weight, yet no enhanced aggressiveness in dyadic fights is observed. In fact, <I>asip1</I>-Tg animals choose to flee to safer areas rather than face a potential threat, thus suggesting a potential anxiety-like behavior (ALB). Standard behavioral tests, i.e., the open field test (OFT), the novel object test (NOT), and the novel tank dive test (NTDT), were used to investigate thigmotaxis and ALB in male and female zebrafish. Results showed that the <I>asip1</I>-Tg strain exhibited severe ALB in every test, mainly characterized by pronounced freezing behavior and increased linear and angular swimming velocities. <I>asip1</I>-Tg animals exhibited low central serotonin (5-HT) and dopamine (DA) levels and high turnover rates, thus suggesting that central monoaminergic pathways might mediate melanocortin antagonist-induced ALB. Accordingly, the treatment of <I>asip1</I>-Tg animals with fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), reversed the ALB phenotype in NTDT as well as 5-HT turnover. Genomic and anatomical data further supported neuronal interaction between melanocortinergic and serotonergic systems. These results suggest that inhibition of the melanocortin system by ubiquitous overexpression of endogenous antagonist has an anxiogenic effect mediated by serotonergic transmission.</p>

                <p>Little is known about the electrophysiologic activity of the intact human spinal cord during volitional movement. We analyzed epidural spinal recordings from a total of five human subjects of both sexes during a variety of upper extremity movements and found that these spinal epidural electrograms contain spectral information distinguishing periods of movement, rest, and sensation. Cervical epidural electrograms also contained spectral changes time-locked with movement. We found that these changes were primarily associated with increased power in the theta (4&ndash;8&nbsp;Hz) band and feature increased theta phase to gamma amplitude coupling, and this increase in theta power can be used to topographically map distinct upper extremity movements onto the cervical spinal cord in accordance with established myotome maps of the upper extremity. Our findings have implications for the development of neurostimulation protocols and devices focused on motor rehabilitation for the upper extremity, and the approach presented here may facilitate spatiotemporal mapping of naturalistic movements.</p>

                <p>Serial dependence has shown seemingly contradictory effects on visual perception and working memory. While serial dependence promotes perpetual and mnemonic stability, it biases behavioral reports toward prior information. The neural mechanisms that drive both biasing and adaptive stabilizing effects are not well understood. We proposed and tested a reactivation and integration mechanism that can account for these contradictory effects. We used multivariate pattern analyses of EEG data (26 human participants, 17 females, 9 males) to examine the reactivation of prior reported orientation during the delay period of a visual working memory task. The reactivation strength of prior reports, but not prior sensory items, was predictive of the magnitude of serial dependency biases. These reactivated representations integrated with the representation of the current memory item and improved the ability to decode the current contents of memory. Overall, our data provide convergent evidence suggesting that prior reports in a visual working memory task are reactivated on the subsequent trial and become integrated with current memory representations. This similarity-dependent reactivation mechanism drives both report biasing and stabilization effects attributed to serial dependence in working memory.</p>

                <p>It has long been assumed that activity patterns persist in neuronal circuits after they are first experienced, as part of the process of information processing and storage by the brain. However, these "reverberations" of current activity have not been directly observed on a single-neuron level in a mammalian system. Here we demonstrate that specific induced activity patterns are retained in mature cultured hippocampal neuronal networks. Neurons within the network are induced to fire at a single frequency or in a more complex pattern containing two distinct frequencies. After the stimulation was stopped, the subsequent neuronal activity of hundreds of neurons in the network was monitored. In the case of single-frequency stimulation, it was observed that many of the neurons continue to fire at the same frequency that they were stimulated to fire at. Using a recurrent neural network trained to detect specific, more complex patterns, we found that the multiple-frequency stimulation patterns were also retained within the neuronal network. Moreover, it appears that the component frequencies of the more complex patterns are stored in different populations of neurons and neuron subtypes.</p>

                Background Polypharmacy is common among hospitalized patients with infectious infections owing to comorbidities or concomitant illnesses. This raises the likelihood of drug-drug interactions and creates uncertainty for healthcare providers. This study aimed to assess the potential drug-drug interactions (pDDIs) among hospitalized patients with infectious diseases in a secondary care hospital. Methods A prospective observational study was conducted in the internal medicine ward for six months after the ethics committee’s approval. Data were collected from patient case records, and prescriptions were screened for pDDIs from a portable electronic physician information database (PEPID) resource analyzed using SPSS, version 27.0. Results In total, 148 patient case records were analyzed, and 549 pDDIs were identified, with 66.8% having at least one or more DDIs. The mean number of drug interactions was 3.70 ± 4.58 per prescription. The most frequently encountered drug interactions were drug combinations such as bisoprolol with atorvastatin and aspirin with tazobactam/piperacillin. Bivariate analysis showed that age, comorbidities, length of hospital stay, and the number of drugs prescribed were risk factors associated with DDIs (p<0.05). In the multiple binary logistic regression analysis, DDIs were significantly associated with comorbidities and the number of prescribed medications (p<0.0001). Conclusions This study observed the prevalence of DDIs in hospitalized patients with infectious diseases of ‘moderate’ severity. Prescription screening using a drug information database assists in early identification and prevention of DDIs, enhancing drug safety and quality of patient-centered care.

                <p>by Vasyl V. Mykuliak, Rolle Rahikainen, Neil J. Ball, Giovanni Bussi, Benjamin T. Goult, Vesa P. Hytönen</p>

Vinculin binds to specific sites of mechanically unfolded talin rod domains to reinforce the coupling of the cell’s exterior to its force generation machinery. Force-dependent vinculin–talin complexation and dissociation was previously observed as contraction or extension of the unfolded talin domains respectively using magnetic tweezers. However, the structural mechanism underlying vinculin recognition of unfolded vinculin binding sites (VBSs) in talin remains unknown. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that a VBS dynamically refolds under force, and that vinculin can recognize and bind to partially unfolded VBS states. Vinculin binding enables refolding of the mechanically strained VBS and stabilizes its folded α-helical conformation, providing resistance against mechanical stress. Together, these results provide an understanding of a recognition mechanism of proteins unfolded by force and insight into the initial moments of how vinculin binds unfolded talin rod domains during the assembly of this mechanosensing meshwork.

                <p>by Lies Zandberg, Veronica Morfi, Julia M. George, David F. Clayton, Dan Stowell, Robert F. Lachlan</p>

Our understanding of bird song, a model system for animal communication and the neurobiology of learning, depends critically on making reliable, validated comparisons between the complex multidimensional syllables that are used in songs. However, most assessments of song similarity are based on human inspection of spectrograms, or computational methods developed from human intuitions. Using a novel automated operant conditioning system, we collected a large corpus of zebra finches’ (<i>Taeniopygia guttata</i>) decisions about song syllable similarity. We use this dataset to compare and externally validate similarity algorithms in widely-used publicly available software (Raven, Sound Analysis Pro, Luscinia). Although these methods all perform better than chance, they do not closely emulate the avian assessments. We then introduce a novel deep learning method that can produce perceptual similarity judgements trained on such avian decisions. We find that this new method outperforms the established methods in accuracy and more closely approaches the avian assessments. Inconsistent (hence ambiguous) decisions are a common occurrence in animal behavioural data; we show that a modification of the deep learning training that accommodates these leads to the strongest performance. We argue this approach is the best way to validate methods to compare song similarity, that our dataset can be used to validate novel methods, and that the general approach can easily be extended to other species.

                <p>by Hiroto Murata, Kazuma Toko, George Chikenji</p>

A protein superfold is a type of protein fold that is observed in at least three distinct, non-homologous protein families. Structural classification studies have revealed a limited number of prevalent superfolds alongside several infrequent occurring folds, and in <i>α</i>/<i>β</i> type superfolds, the C-terminal <i>β</i>-strand tends to favor the edge of the <i>β</i>-sheet, while the N-terminal <i>β</i>-strand is often found in the middle. The reasons behind these observations, whether they are due to evolutionary sampling bias or physical interactions, remain unclear. This article offers a physics-based explanation for these observations, specifically for pure parallel <i>β</i>-sheet topologies. Our investigation is grounded in several established structural rules that are based on physical interactions. We have identified “frustration-free topologies” which are topologies that can satisfy all the rules simultaneously. In contrast, topologies that cannot are termed “frustrated topologies.” Our findings reveal that frustration-free topologies represent only a fraction of all theoretically possible patterns, these topologies strongly favor positioning the C-terminal <i>β</i>-strand at the edge of the <i>β</i>-sheet and the N-terminal <i>β</i>-strand in the middle, and there is significant overlap between frustration-free topologies and superfolds. We also used a lattice protein model to thoroughly investigate sequence-structure relationships. Our results show that frustration-free structures are highly designable, while frustrated structures are poorly designable. These findings suggest that superfolds are highly designable due to their lack of frustration, and the preference for positioning C-terminal <i>β</i>-strands at the edge of the <i>β</i>-sheet is a direct result of frustration-free topologies. These insights not only enhance our understanding of sequence-structure relationships but also have significant implications for de novo protein design.

Understanding the dynamic evolution of <i>Salmonella</i> is vital for effective bacterial infection management. This study explores the role of the flexible genome, organised in regions of genomic plasticity (RGP), in shaping the pathogenicity of <i>Salmonella</i> lineages. Through comprehensive genomic analysis of 12,244 <i>Salmonella</i> spp. genomes covering 2 species, 6 subspecies, and 46 serovars, we uncover distinct integration patterns of pathogenicity-related gene clusters into RGP, challenging traditional views of gene distribution. These RGP exhibit distinct preferences for specific genomic spots, and the presence or absence of such spots across <i>Salmonella</i> lineages profoundly shapes strain pathogenicity. RGP preferences are guided by conserved flanking genes surrounding integration spots, implicating their involvement in regulatory networks and functional synergies with integrated gene clusters. Additionally, we emphasise the multifaceted contributions of plasmids and prophages to the pathogenicity of diverse <i>Salmonella</i> lineages. Overall, this study provides a comprehensive blueprint of the pathogenicity potential of <i>Salmonella</i>. This unique insight identifies genomic spots in nonpathogenic lineages that hold the potential for harbouring pathogenicity genes, providing a foundation for predicting future adaptations and developing targeted strategies against emerging human pathogenic strains.

                Previous research has indicated that individual differences play a role in group creativity. Group creativity activities have different outcomes, leading to numerous ways to assess the effectiveness of these creative activities. To date, no meta-analysis has been performed on the relationship between the outcomes of the creative activity and personal factors of the group members. In this Registered Report, we conducted a meta-analysis (n = 11, k = 72) on the relationship between personal factors and group creativity outcomes. We found weak support for a positive correlation between self-efficacy and group creativity outcomes, between r = .04 and r = .67. We found weak support for a moderation effect of time constraint, with stronger relationships for conditions limited to 20 minutes as opposed to 10 minutes. Finally, we found that only a few studies could be included in the meta-analysis, because many studies (1) did not directly measure creativity, or (2) measured other, less common personal factors. We call for a more systematic and direct approach to measuring creativity and an improvement of open science practices in the field. Data and analysis can be found at https://osf.io/xwph9.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94070">Chromosome structure in Drosophila is determined by boundary pairing not loop extrusion</a></h4>

              
                Two different models have been proposed to explain how the endpoints of chromatin looped domains (‘TADs’) in eukaryotic chromosomes are determined. In the first, a cohesin complex extrudes a loop until it encounters a boundary element roadblock, generating a stem-loop. In this model, boundaries are functionally autonomous: they have an intrinsic ability to halt the movement of incoming cohesin complexes that is independent of the properties of neighboring boundaries. In the second, loops are generated by boundary:boundary pairing. In this model, boundaries are functionally non-autonomous, and their ability to form a loop depends upon how well they match with their neighbors. Moreover, unlike the loop-extrusion model, pairing interactions can generate both stem-loops and circle-loops. We have used a combination of MicroC to analyze how TADs are organized, and experimental manipulations of the <i>even skipped</i> TAD boundary, <i>homie</i>, to test the predictions of the ‘loop-extrusion’ and the ‘boundary-pairing’ models. Our findings are incompatible with the loop-extrusion model, and instead suggest that the endpoints of TADs in flies are determined by a mechanism in which boundary elements physically pair with their partners, either head-to-head or head-to-tail, with varying degrees of specificity. Although our experiments do not address how partners find each other, the mechanism is unlikely to require loop extrusion.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94114">Stem-loop and circle-loop TADs generated by directional pairing of boundary elements have distinct physical and regulatory properties</a></h4>

              
                The chromosomes in multicellular eukaryotes are organized into a series of topologically independent loops called TADs. In flies, TADs are formed by physical interactions between neighboring boundaries. Fly boundaries exhibit distinct partner preferences, and pairing interactions between boundaries are typically orientation-dependent. Pairing can be head-to-tail or head-to-head. The former generates a stem-loop TAD, while the latter gives a circle-loop TAD. The TAD that encompasses the <i>Drosophila even skipped</i> (<i>eve</i>) gene is formed by the head-to-tail pairing of the <i>nhomie</i> and <i>homie</i> boundaries. To explore the relationship between loop topology and the physical and regulatory landscape, we flanked the <i>nhomie</i> boundary region with two attP sites. The attP sites were then used to generate four boundary replacements: <i>λ DNA</i>, <i>nhomie forward</i> (WT orientation), <i>nhomie reverse</i> (opposite of WT orientation), and <i>homie forward</i> (same orientation as WT <i>homie</i>). The <i>nhomie forward</i> replacement restores the WT physical and regulatory landscape: in MicroC experiments, the <i>eve</i> TAD is a ‘volcano’ triangle topped by a plume, and the <i>eve</i> gene and its regulatory elements are sequestered from interactions with neighbors. The <i>λ DNA</i> replacement lacks boundary function: the endpoint of the ‘new’ <i>eve</i> TAD on the <i>nhomie</i> side is ill-defined, and <i>eve</i> stripe enhancers activate a nearby gene, <i>eIF3j</i>. While <i>nhomie reverse</i> and <i>homie forward</i> restore the <i>eve</i> TAD, the topology is a circle-loop, and this changes the local physical and regulatory landscape. In MicroC experiments, the <i>eve</i> TAD interacts with its neighbors, and the plume at the top of the <i>eve</i> triangle peak is converted to a pair of ‘clouds’ of contacts with the next-door TADs. Consistent with the loss of isolation afforded by the stem-loop topology, the <i>eve</i> enhancers weakly activate genes in the neighboring TADs. Conversely, <i>eve</i> function is partially disrupted.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91359">Enkephalin-mediated modulation of basal somatic sensitivity by regulatory T cells in mice</a></h4>

              
                CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells (Treg) have been implicated in pain modulation in various inflammatory conditions. However, whether Treg cells hamper pain at steady state and by which mechanism is still unclear. From a meta-analysis of the transcriptomes of murine Treg and conventional T cells (Tconv), we observe that the proenkephalin gene (<i>Penk</i>), encoding the precursor of analgesic opioid peptides, ranks among the top 25 genes most enriched in Treg cells. We then present various evidence suggesting that <i>Penk</i> is regulated in part by members of the Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor (TNFR) family and the transcription factor Basic leucine zipper transcription faatf-like (BATF). Using mice in which the promoter activity of <i>Penk</i> can be tracked with a fluorescent reporter, we also show that <i>Penk</i> expression is mostly detected in Treg and activated Tconv in non-inflammatory conditions in the colon and skin. Functionally, Treg cells proficient or deficient for <i>Penk</i> suppress equally well the proliferation of effector T cells in vitro and autoimmune colitis in vivo. In contrast, inducible ablation of <i>Penk</i> in Treg leads to heat hyperalgesia in both male and female mice. Overall, our results indicate that Treg might play a key role at modulating basal somatic sensitivity in mice through the production of analgesic opioid peptides.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94948">Insights into early animal evolution form the genome of the xenacoelomorph worm Xenoturbella bocki</a></h4>

              
                The evolutionary origins of Bilateria remain enigmatic. One of the more enduring proposals highlights similarities between a cnidarian-like planula larva and simple acoel-like flatworms. This idea is based in part on the view of the Xenacoelomorpha as an outgroup to all other bilaterians which are themselves designated the Nephrozoa (protostomes and deuterostomes). Genome data can provide important comparative data and help to understand the evolution and biology of enigmatic species better. Here we assemble and analyse the genome of the simple, marine xenacoelomorph <i>Xenoturbella bocki</i>, a key species for our understanding of early bilaterian evolution. Our highly contiguous genome assembly of <i>X. bocki</i> has a size of ~111 Mbp in 18 chromosome like scaffolds, with repeat content and intron, exon and intergenic space comparable to other bilaterian invertebrates. We find <i>X. bocki</i> to have a similar number of genes to other bilaterians and to have retained ancestral metazoan synteny. Key bilaterian signalling pathways are also largely complete and most bilaterian miRNAs are present. Overall, we conclude that <i>X. bocki</i> has a complex genome typical of bilaterians, which does not reflect the apparent simplicity of its body plan that has been so important to proposals that the Xenacoelomorpha are the simple sister group of the rest of the Bilateria.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/83320">Syntaxin-6 delays prion protein fibril formation and prolongs presence of toxic aggregation intermediates</a></h4>

              
                Prions replicate via the autocatalytic conversion of cellular prion protein (PrP<sup>C</sup>) into fibrillar assemblies of misfolded PrP. While this process has been extensively studied in vivo and in vitro, non-physiological reaction conditions of fibril formation in vitro have precluded the identification and mechanistic analysis of cellular proteins, which may alter PrP self-assembly and prion replication. Here, we have developed a fibril formation assay for recombinant murine and human PrP (23-231) under near-native conditions (NAA) to study the effect of cellular proteins, which may be risk factors or potential therapeutic targets in prion disease. Genetic screening suggests that variants that increase syntaxin-6 expression in the brain (gene: STX6) are risk factors for sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). Analysis of the protein in NAA revealed, counterintuitively, that syntaxin-6 is a potent inhibitor of PrP fibril formation. It significantly delayed the lag phase of fibril formation at highly sub-stoichiometric molar ratios. However, when assessing toxicity of different aggregation time points to primary neurons, syntaxin-6 prolonged the presence of neurotoxic PrP species. Electron microscopy and super-resolution fluorescence microscopy revealed that, instead of highly ordered fibrils, in the presence of syntaxin-6 PrP formed less-ordered aggregates containing syntaxin-6. These data strongly suggest that the protein can directly alter the initial phase of PrP self-assembly and, uniquely, can act as an 'anti-chaperone', which promotes toxic aggregation intermediates by inhibiting fibril formation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/86042">Actin networks modulate heterogenous NF-κB dynamics in response to TNFα</a></h4>

              
                The canonical NF-κB transcription factor RELA is a master regulator of immune and stress responses and is upregulated in PDAC tumours. In this study, we characterised previously unexplored endogenous RELA-GFP dynamics in PDAC cell lines through live single cell imaging. Our observations revealed that TNFα stimulation induces rapid, sustained, and non-oscillatory nuclear translocation of RELA. Through Bayesian analysis of single cell datasets with variation in nuclear RELA, we predicted that RELA heterogeneity in PDAC cell lines is dependent on F-actin dynamics. RNA-seq analysis identified distinct clusters of RELA-regulated gene expression in PDAC cells, including TNFα-induced RELA upregulation of the actin regulators NUAK2 and ARHGAP31. Further, siRNA-mediated depletion of ARHGAP31 and NUAK2 altered TNFα-stimulated nuclear RELA dynamics in PDAC cells, establishing a novel negative feedback loop that regulates RELA activation by TNFα. Additionally, we characterised the NF-κB pathway in PDAC cells, identifying how NF-κB/IκB proteins genetically and physically interact with RELA in the absence or presence of TNFα. Taken together, we provide computational and experimental support for interdependence between the F-actin network and the NF-κB pathway with RELA translocation dynamics in PDAC.

	<p>Paper-based or IT tools can be used in telerehabilitation mode to improve the skills of children with developmental dyslexia (DD), seeking to increase reading speed and reduce errors. Telerehabilitation is the provision of remote treatments in which the patient works autonomously in a familiar environment under the remote monitoring, through telecommunication means, of an expert operator. Through telerehabilitation, children with DD can receive treatments outside the specialist clinic, at home or school, via internet connections, and through advanced technological platforms. These procedures allow adequate communication with the family, intensity of treatment, self-adaptivity of exercises, and child engagement; these factors are crucial for a high intervention efficacy. Recent studies have supported the effectiveness of the telerehabilitation of reading in children with DD, with some studies reporting no differences in efficacy between remote and in-person methods. Nevertheless, many points remain to be clarified about the procedures and methods required by telerehabilitation, the variables linked to its effectiveness (e.g., the impact of the intensity of the training and the neuropsychological profile of the child), and the comparative validity of different tele-treatment paths. These aspects are discussed in the present paper.</p>

	<p>Ongoing neural oscillations reflect cycles of excitation and inhibition in local neural populations, with individual neurons being more or less likely to fire depending upon the oscillatory phase. As a result, the oscillations could determine whether or not a sound is perceived and/or whether its neural representation enters into later processing stages. While empirical support for this idea has come from sound detection studies, large gaps in knowledge still exist regarding memory for sound events. In the current study, it was investigated how sensory entrainment impacts the fidelity of working memory representations for pitch. In two separate experiments, an 8 Hz amplitude modulated (AM) entraining stimulus was presented prior to a multitone complex having an f0 between 270 and 715 Hz. This &amp;amp;ldquo;target&amp;amp;rdquo; sound could be presented at phases from 0 to 2&amp;amp;pi; radians in relation to the previous AM. After a retention interval of 4 s (Experiment 1; n = 26) or 2 s (Experiment 2; n = 28), listeners were tasked to reproduce the target sound&amp;amp;rsquo;s pitch by moving their finger along the horizontal axis of a response pad. It was hypothesized that if entrainment modulates auditory working memory fidelity, reproductions of a target&amp;amp;rsquo;s pitch would be more accurate and precise when targets were presented in phase with the entrainment. Cosine fits of the average data for both experiments showed a significant entrainment &amp;amp;ldquo;echo&amp;amp;rdquo; in the accuracy of pitch matches. There was no apparent echo in the matching precision. Fitting of the individual data accuracy showed that the optimal phase was consistent across individuals, aligning near the next AM peak had the AM continued. The results show that sensory entrainment modulates auditory working memory in addition to stimulus detection, consistent with the proposal that ongoing neural oscillatory activity modulates higher-order auditory processes.</p>

                Lutein, a plant-derived xanthophyl-carotenoid, is an exceptional antioxidant and anti-inflammatory constituent found in food. High dietary intake of lutein is beneficial against eye disease, improves cardiometabolic health, protects from neurodegenerative diseases, and is beneficial for liver, kidney, and respiratory health. Lutein protects against oxidative and nitrosative stress, both of which play a major role in post-COVID and mRNA vaccination injury syndromes. Lutein is an important natural agent for therapeutic use against oxidative and nitrosative stress in chronic illnesses such as cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. It can also potentially inhibit spike protein-induced inflammation. Rich dietary supplementation of lutein, naturally derived in non-biodegradable Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO), can most optimally be used against oxidative and nitrosative stress during post-COVID and mRNA vaccination injury syndromes. Due to its high oleic acid (OA) content, EVOO supports optimal absorption of dietary lutein. The main molecular pathways by which the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein induces pathology, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer activated B cells (NF-κB) and activated protein (AP)-1, can be suppressed by lutein. Synergy with other natural compounds for spike protein detoxification is likely.

                Background when family planning methods not use, there is a higher chance of high fertility, which raises health risks for both mother and infant and lowers quality of life by limiting access to jobs employment, education, and nutrition. Unsatisfactory needs and poor family planning use can be explained by fear of negative impacts, rejection from couples, limits in knowledge, and social condemnation. Objectives To understanding the Middle East women’s barriers about make decisions and use of family planning methods Methodology A descriptive and analytic (cross sectional) study, conducted at six Arabic countries includes a non-probability (purposive sample) consist of (198) women. Which were selected according to inclusion criteria that are women in reproductive age, primiparous and multiparous mothers, and mothers who attended primary healthcare centers. Results Women are with average age of 32.23±7.9 years in which the highest percentage is seen with age group of 30-39 (40.4%). women have high affective barrier to avoid family planning methods (total grand mean= 2.60); have high behavioral barriers to avoid family planning methods (total grand mean= 2.56); and have high cognitive barriers to avoid family planning methods (total grand mean= 2.56). So, the mean scores indicate high among most of affective, behavioral, and cognitive barriers. Conclusions There are many potential barriers which can negatively impact the Middle East women’s decision about their reproductive life (affective, behavioral and cognitive) barriers. Despite the fact that family planning faces several challenges in the Middle East, governments and civil society organizations are working to find solutions to improve access to family planning services, promote education, hold candid conversations about reproductive health with local communities. Empowering the role of nurse in family planning to educate the couples about contraceptive methods and how to help them to choice the appropriate method.

                Background Medical imaging has seen significant advancements through machine learning, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs). These technologies have transformed the analysis of pathological images, enhancing the accuracy of diagnosing and classifying cellular anomalies. Digital pathology methodologies, including image analysis, have improved cervical cancer diagnostics. However, existing commercial platforms are often costly and restrictive, limiting customization and scalability. Methods CINNAMON-GUI is an open-source digital pathology tool based on CNNs for classifying Pap smear images. Transitioning to a Shiny app in Python, it offers enhanced user interface and interactivity. The application supports dynamic web interactions, advanced features for image analysis, and state-of-the-art CNN models tailored for digital pathology. Key features include intuitive UI components, real-time image and plot generation, memory-efficient data handling, and robust training capabilities with customizable CNN architectures. The tool also integrates with Labelme for defining regions of interest and allows testing on external biospecimens. Results Model A (seed 42, 100 epochs) and Model B (same architecture with adjusted augmentation parameters) were compared. Model A stabilized with training accuracy around 0.88 and validation accuracy around 0.913. Model B showed improved performance with training accuracy around 0.91 and validation accuracy around 0.95. Feature mapping highlighted critical morphological aspects, improving classification accuracy. Model B reduced misclassification errors significantly compared to Model A. Conclusions CINNAMON-GUI demonstrates the potential of an open-source platform in digital pathology, providing transparency and collaborative opportunities. The tool enhances diagnostic accuracy through feature map analysis and optimized CNN training. Future development aims to extend its application to other cancer types, leveraging its dynamic and user-friendly interface for broader use in diagnostics.

                <p>by Jiaping Liu, Zhenglun Cai, Paul Gustafson, Daniel J. McDonald</p>

To understand the transmissibility and spread of infectious diseases, epidemiologists turn to estimates of the instantaneous reproduction number. While many estimation approaches exist, their utility may be limited. Challenges of surveillance data collection, model assumptions that are unverifiable with data alone, and computationally inefficient frameworks are critical limitations for many existing approaches. We propose a discrete spline-based approach that solves a convex optimization problem—Poisson trend filtering—using the proximal Newton method. It produces a locally adaptive estimator for instantaneous reproduction number estimation with heterogeneous smoothness. Our methodology remains accurate even under some process misspecifications and is computationally efficient, even for large-scale data. The implementation is easily accessible in a lightweight R package rtestim.

                Background The acquisition and development of prosodic aspects of vocal intonation are of special interest within the larger context of language acquisition. Method The present study explored the developmental trajectories of infant prosodic abilities from 4 to 16 months of life with an intensive time points assessment. Several aspects were considered: an acoustic analysis of infant vocal productions with specific software, the analyses of all the prosodic variables associated with the fundamental frequency (F0 mean, F0 range, and F0 final contours), the individual variability and the complexity of the vocal productions of the infants. Results The multi-level analysis evidenced specific prosodic developmental trajectories that differ for the different kind of vocal productions since the first months of life. Conclusions The findings suggest that in the second half of the first year of life infants show an intonational repertoire that may help manage interactions with their caregiver and that individual variability has to be taken in consideration when assessing infants’ prosody.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Using anti-neurofilament H non-phosphorylated antibodies (SMI-32) as markers for the neuronal maturation level and Y channel responsible for motion processing, we investigated early postnatal development of the primary visual areas 17 and 18 in cats aged 0, 10, 14, and 34 days and in adults. Two analyzed parameters of SMI-32-immunolabeling were used: the total proportion of SMI-32-labeling and the density of labeled neurons. (i) The developmental time course of the total proportion of SMI-32-labeling shows the general increase in the accumulation of heavy-chain neurofilaments. This parameter showed a different time course for cortical layer development; the maximal increment in the total labeling in layer V occurred between the second and fifth postnatal weeks and in layers II–III and VI after the fifth postnatal week. In addition, the delay in accumulation of SMI-32-labeling was shown in layer V of the area 17 periphery representation during the first two postnatal weeks. (ii) The density of SMI-32-labeled neurons decreased in all layers of area 18, but was increased, decreased, or had a transient peak in layers II–III, V, and VI of area 17, respectively. The transient peak is in good correspondence with some transient neurochemical features previously revealed for different classes of cortical and thalamic neurons and reflects the time course of the early development of the thalamocortical circuitry. Some similarities between the time courses for the development of SMI-32-labeling in areas 17/18 and in A- and C-laminae of the LGNd allow us to propose heterochronous postnatal development of two Y sub-channels.</p>

                Background The growing importance of emotional intelligence in academic and professional contexts has generated a need to explore its linkage with psychological well-being. Furthermore, understanding how various demographic and academic factors can influence students' emotional perception and management is crucial for optimizing educational and intervention strategies. In this context, the primary purpose of this study was to analyze the existing relationship between emotional education and psychological well-being in graduate students. Methods The objective was to conduct a comparative analysis of perceived emotional intelligence (PEI) in different study programs offered at a specific university. The methodology, framed within a positivist paradigm, was based on a quantitative approach and examines the responses of 1,522 university students using the Trait Meta-Mood Scale (TMMS-24). Results This tool, which is divided into three dimensions (emotional attention, emotional clarity, and emotional repair), was analyzed using descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and ANOVA tests to determine demographic and academic influences on the scores. The findings indicate deficiencies in the areas of Emotional Attention and Emotional Repair, contrasting with a marked prevalence in Emotional Clarity. Variables such as sex, age, and field of study demonstrated an influence on the dimensions of PEI. Notably, significant differences in emotional perception were found between sex and academic fields. Conclusions Specifically, training directed towards empathy proved to be a prominent factor in the perception of emotional competencies. This study highlights the influence of demographic and academic variables on emotional competencies, underscoring the need to adapt strategies in education and therapy.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The hippocampus is considered essential for several forms of declarative memory, including spatial and social memory. Despite the extensive research of the classic subfields of the hippocampus, the fasciola cinerea (FC)—a medially located structure within the hippocampal formation—has remained largely unexplored. In the present study, we performed a morpho-functional characterization of principal neurons in the mouse FC. Using in vivo juxtacellular recording of single neurons, we found that FC neurons are distinct from neighboring CA1 pyramidal cells, both morphologically and electrophysiologically. Specifically, FC neurons displayed non-pyramidal morphology and granule cell-like apical dendrites. Compared to neighboring CA1 pyramidal neurons, FC neurons exhibited more regular in vivo firing patterns and a lower tendency to fire spikes at short interspike intervals. Furthermore, tracing experiments revealed that the FC receives inputs from the lateral but not the medial entorhinal cortex and CA3, and it provides a major intra-hippocampal projection to the septal CA2 and sparser inputs to the distal CA1. Overall, our results indicate that the FC is a morphologically and electrophysiologically distinct subfield of the hippocampal formation; given the established role of CA2 in social memory and seizure initiation, the unique efferent intra-hippocampal connectivity of the FC points to possible roles in social cognition and temporal lobe epilepsy.</p>

                Background The response of heart rate to changes in exercise intensity is comprised of several dynamic modes with differing magnitudes and temporal characteristics. Investigations of empirical identification of dynamic models of heart rate showed that second-order models gave substantially and significantly better model fidelity compared to the first order case. In the present work, we aimed to reanalyse data from previous studies to more closely consider the effect of including a zero and a pure delay in the model. Methods This is a retrospective analysis of 22 treadmill (TM) and 54 cycle ergometer (CE) data sets from a total of 38 healthy participants. A linear, time-invariant plant model structure with up to two poles, a zero and a dead time is considered. Empirical estimation of the free parameters was performed using least-squares optimisation. The primary outcome measure is model fit, which is a normalised root-mean-square model error. Results A model comprising parallel connection of two first-order transfer functions, one with a dead time and one without, was found to give the highest fit (56.7 % for TM, 54.3 % for CE), whereby the non-delayed component appeared to merely capture initial transients in the data and the part with dead time likely represented the true dynamic response of heart rate to the excitation. In comparison, a simple first-order model without dead time gave substantially lower fit than the parallel model (50.2 % for TM, 47.9 % for CE). Conclusions This preliminary analysis points to a linear first-order system with dead time as being an appropriate model for heart rate response to exercise using treadmill and cycle ergometer modalities. In order to avoid biased estimates, it is vitally important that, prior to parameter estimation and validation, careful attention is paid to data preprocessing in order to eliminate transients and trends.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Neural progenitor cells (NPCs) reside in the brain and participate in the mechanism of neurogenesis that permits the brain to generate the building blocks for enhancement of cognitive abilities and acquisition of new skills. The existence of NPCs in brain has opened a novel dimension of research to explore their potential for treatment of various neurodegenerative disorders. The present study provides novel insights into the intracellular mechanisms in neuronal cells proliferation, maturation and differentiation regulated by Quinic acid (QA). Furthermore, this study might help in discovery and development of lead molecule that can overcome the challenges in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. The growth supporting effect of QA was studied using MTT assay. For that purpose, hippocampal cell cultures of neonatal rats were treated with different concentrations of QA and incubated for 24, 48 and 72 h. Gene and protein expressions of the selected molecular markers nestin, neuron-specific class III beta-tubulin (Tuj-1), neuronal nuclear protein (NeuN), neuronal differentiation 1 (NeuroD1), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), neuroligin (NLGN) and vimentin were analyzed. QA-induced cell proliferation and differentiation of hippocampal progenitor cells was also accompanied by significantly increased expression of progenitor and immature neuronal marker, mature neuronal marker and differentiating factor, that is, nestin, Tuj-1, NeuN and NeuroD1, respectively. On the other hand, vimentin downregulation and constant GFAP expression were observed following QA treatment. Additionally, the effects of QA on the recovery of stressed cells was studied using in vitro model of oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD). It was observed that hippocampal cells were able to recover from OGD following the treatment with QA. These findings suggest that QA treatment promotes hippocampal neurogenesis by proliferating and differentiating of NPCs and recovers neurons from stress caused by OGD. Thus, the neurogenic potential of QA can be explored for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.</p>

                Background B vitamins play a crucial role in the balance and metabolism of energy. Energy metabolism mainly benefits from the B-complex vitamins. Specifically, decarboxylation, transamination, acylation, oxidation, and reduction of substrates that are ultimately employed in energy intake require thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, and vitamin B6. Vitamin deficiency could lead to chronic disease occurrence. Objectives To assess the impact of energy-releasing B-vitamins intake (B1, B2, B3, and B6) on selected indices of obesity and cardiac function. Methods A cross-sectional study was performed on 491 apparently healthy adults (18-64 years old) between January and May 2019 at Hashemite University, Jordan. Anthropometric measurements were taken, lipid profiles were analyzed, and indices of obesity and cardiac function were calculated. The typical dietary intake of B1, B2, B3, and B6 vitamins was calculated. Results Conicity index (CI) and abdominal volume index (AVI) scores significantly decreased with the increased adjusted vitamin B1 and B6 intake. Also, body roundness index (BRI), weight-adjusted-waist index (WWI), lipid accumulation product (LAP), and atherogenic index of plasma (AIP) scores were decreased with the increase of adjusted B6 intake (p<0.05). The total sample showed a significant inverse weak correlation between energy-adjusted intake of B1 and AVI (r= -0.156, p=0.001) and BRI (r= 0.111, p=0.014). Similar correlations were detected among male participants between energy-adjusted B1 intake and BAI, AVI, and BRI. Female participants had a significant weak inverse correlation between BAI and energy-adjusted B2 (r= -0.180, p=0.029) and B6 intake (r= -0.212, p=0.010). Only B1, the vitamin, significantly explained 2.43 and 1.24% of changes observed in the AVI and BRI scores, respectively (p<0.05). Conclusions Increasing the consumption of B1, B2, and B6 may significantly lower values of indices of obesity and cardiac function regardless of sex differences. Thus reducing the occurrence of obesity and related coronary heart diseases.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-893/v1?src=rss">Dataset of a national survey on online gambling activities among young people in Portugal. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Abstract* Background Recent advancements in online gambling have significantly increased the popularity and participation in gambling activities among the general population, specifically the young generations. These changes are reshaping gambling behaviors, attracting a growing number of enthusiasts. This paper describes a dataset that maps online gambling activities among young individuals in Portugal, providing insights into their gambling prevalence, habits, behaviors, preferences, and potential antecedents and consequences of these activities. Methods A survey was conducted with a representative sample of 1,993 young people in Portugal, aged between 18 and 34, to gather data on their activities. This methodology involved a quantitative telephone survey conducted in March and April 2023, utilizing quota sampling to ensure representation across various regions. The data collection process employed Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI) and involved rigorous quality control measures to ensure accuracy and reliability. Conclusion The dataset generated from this survey provides valuable insights into the patterns of online gambling activities among young Portuguese individuals. It allows researchers to explore potential risk factors, including gambling-related harm, and to understand the sociodemographic factors influencing gambling behaviors. The findings can inform interventions and policies aimed at mitigating the negative consequences of online gambling among youth.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-892/v1?src=rss">A Revolutionary Device for Endovascular Aortic Repair of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm: A Pilot Study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Endovascular repair for abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) has been the gold standard since it was established in 1991. Various graft configurations have been developed to overcome the limitations of endovascular aortic repair (EVAR), including contralateral gate cannulation (CGC). We propose a new device and technique intended to simplify endovascular AAA repair, along with reports of its application in six patients. Intervention The Taofan and Kang (T&K) bidirectional endovascular aortic repair (B-EVAR (B-EVAR) device uses a main-body stent graft, two-limb extensions, and bare metal stent. The procedure involved accessing the right and left femoral arteries, followed by standard aortography evaluation using a pigtail catheter through the contralateral femoral access. The main body stent graft is deployed through ipsilateral femoral access using a balloon catheter, while the contralateral gate is cannulated with a hydrophilic coated wire. Both balloons were inflated simultaneously to ensure that the wires were in different lumens. Contralateral and ipsilateral extensions were deployed using a limb extension stent graft. Standard aortography evaluation was repeated. Result T&K B-EVAR pilot procedures proved successful in various cases, from simple to complex anatomy, and even with varied graft stent deployment strategies. None of the patients had complications or prolonged length of stay (LOS). Follow-up CT did not reveal any high-pressure endoleaks. Conclusion T&K B-EVAR has been proven to simplify endovascular AAA repair in six patients with excellent results. It is also reproducible, potentially universally applicable, and can offer operators ease of use, faster procedure times, reduced fluoroscopy times, and reduced contrast usage.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-891/v1?src=rss">Case Report: The Sausage Technique using Anorganic Bovine Bone Mineral for Horizontal Bone Augmentation at the Crestal Part of a Posterior Mandibular Ridge: A Case Report. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Following tooth extraction, the alveolar bone goes through a natural remodeling process resulting in a significant bone resorption which may complicate dental implant placement without prior bone augmentation treatment. The sausage technique is a modified guided bone regeneration (GBR) method that has been successfully used for horizontal bone augmentation. This technique was developed to increase the bone growth at the alveolar crest. Although the sausage technique uses a combination of autograft chips and xenograft particles with a native collagen membrane, several studies have questioned whether adding autograft chips is essential for bone formation with guided bone regeneration. Moreover, harvesting the bone graft may increase the donor site morbidity and patient discomfort. This case report aimed to investigate the bone gain radiologically when the sausage technique was applied to treat a healthy, thirty-year-old patient with a horizontal defect in the posterior mandibular region using anorganic bovine bone mineral (ABBM) particles with Jason membrane, assess the implant primary stability in the augmented ridge, and present the surgical procedure steps in details. After nine months of healing, the cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) revealed approximately 4.32 mm of bone gain at the alveolar crest in the buccal-lingual direction. The graft particles were well integrated into the newly formed bone. Two implants were inserted with an insertion torque of 35 N/cm. The ISQ values were 76 for the most anterior implant and 78 for the posterior implant. Within the limitations of this case report, the sausage technique using ABBM particles without autograft chips was an effective approach in achieving the prerequisite bone width at the crest in cases with horizontal bone defects.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-890/v1?src=rss">Discrepancy in efficiency scores due to sampling error in data envelopment analysis methodology: evidence from the banking sector [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) methodology is considered the most suitable approach for relative performance efficiency calculation for banks as it is believed to be superior to traditional ratio-based analysis and other conventional performance evaluations. This study provides statistical evidence on the sampling error that can creep into performance evaluation studies using the DEA methodology. Inferences are drawn based on samples, and various preventive measures must be taken to eliminate or avoid sampling errors and misleading results. This study demonstrates the possibility of sampling error in DEA with the secondary data available in financial statements and reports from a sample set of banks. Methods The samples included 15 public sectors and five leading private sector banks in India based on their market share, and the data for calculating efficiencies were retrieved from the published audited reports. The sample data was collected from 2014 to 2017 because the banking sector in India witnessed a series of mergers of public sector banks post-2017, and the data after that would be skewed and not comparable due to the demonetization policy implementation and merger process-related consolidation implemented by the Government of India. The efficiency measures thus computed are further analyzed using non-parametric statistical tests. Results We found statistically significant discrepancies in the efficiency score calculations using DEA approach when specific outlier values. Evidence is provided on statistically significant differences in the efficiencies due to the inclusion and exclusion of particular samples in the DEA. Conclusion The study offers a novel contribution along with statistical evidence on the possible sampling error that can creep into the performance evaluation of organizations while applying the DEA methodology.
