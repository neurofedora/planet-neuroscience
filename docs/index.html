Here, the authors show that serum proteomics identifies protein signatures associated with disease severity, enabling improved risk prediction and stratified management.

                <p>by Lucie Laplane, Anaïs Lamoureux, Harley I. Richker, Gissel Marquez Alcaraz, Angelo Fortunato, Zachary Shaffer, Athena Aktipis, Paul S. Mischel, Anya Plutynski, Jeffrey P. Townsend, Carlo C. Maley</p>

Natural selection occurs at multiple levels of organization in cancer. At an organismal level, natural selection has led to the evolution of diverse tumor suppression mechanisms, while at a cellular level, it favors traits that promote cellular proliferation, survival and cancer. Natural selection also occurs at a subcellular level, among collections of cells and even among collections of organisms; selection at these levels could influence the evolution of cancer and cancer suppression mechanisms, affecting cancer risk and treatment strategies. There may also be cancer-like processes happening at different levels of organization, in which uncontrolled proliferation at lower levels may disrupt a higher level of organization. This Essay examines how selection operates across levels, highlighting how we might leverage this understanding to improve cancer research, prevention and treatment.

                Jain et al. profiled 41 classical psychedelics across 318 GPCRs, revealing activity at serotonin, dopamine, and adrenergic receptors. All compounds activated multiple 5-HT2AR signal transduction pathways which are linked to their in vivo effects. These findings demonstrate the polypharmacology underlying psychedelic actions and their engagement with diverse molecular signaling pathways.

                Martínez et al. identify a set of ccRCC tumors with high levels of intron retention (IR) and poison exon (PE) inclusion, producing transcripts normally targeted by the NMD pathway. These tumors have altered mTOR signaling, are associated with poor prognosis, and have unique signatures of immune cell infiltration.

                Potiri et al. uncover how the splicing factor SRRM3 drives tumor progression in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PanNETs) via neural microexon inclusion. Aberrant splicing disrupts insulin secretion and calcium signaling, revealing a novel link between neuroendocrine dysfunction and cancer. Therapeutic redirection using splice-switching ASOs can effectively impair tumor growth in preclinical models.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100574">Effective population size does not explain long-term variation in genome size and transposable element content in animals</a></h4>

              
                Animal genomes exhibit a remarkable variation in size, but the evolutionary forces responsible for such variation are still debated. As the effective population size (Ne<sub>e</sub>) reflects the intensity of genetic drift, it is expected to be a key determinant of the fixation rate of nearly-neutral mutations. Accordingly, the Mutational Hazard Hypothesis postulates lineages with low Ne<sub>e</sub> to have bigger genome sizes due to the accumulation of slightly deleterious transposable elements (TEs), and those with high Ne<sub>e</sub> to maintain streamlined genomes as a consequence of a more effective selection against TEs. However, the existence of both empirical confirmation and refutation using different methods and different scales precludes its general validation. Using high-quality public data, we estimated genome size, TE content, and rate of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions (dN/dS) as Ne<sub>e</sub> proxy for 807 species including vertebrates, molluscs, and insects. After collecting available life-history traits, we tested the associations among population size proxies, TE content, and genome size, while accounting for phylogenetic non-independence. Our results confirm TEs as major drivers of genome size variation, and endorse life-history traits and dN/dS as reliable proxies for Ne<sub>e</sub>. However, we do not find any evidence for increased drift to result in an accumulation of TEs across animals. Within more closely related clades, only a few isolated and weak associations emerge in fishes and birds. Our results outline a scenario where TE dynamics vary according to lineage-specific patterns, lending no support for genetic drift as the predominant force driving long-term genome size evolution in animals.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93200">Mediodorsal thalamic nucleus mediates resistance to ethanol through Cav3.1 T-type Ca2+ regulation of neural activity</a></h4>

              
                Thalamocortical activity is known to orchestrate sensory gating and consciousness switching. The precise thalamic regions involved, or the firing patterns related to the unconsciousness, remain unclear. Interestingly, the highly -expressed thalamic T-type calcium currents have been considered as a candidate for the ionic mechanism for the generation of thalamocortically driven change in conscious state. Here, we tested the hypothesis that Ca<sub>v</sub>3.1 T-type channels in the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus (MD) might control neuronal firing during unconsciousness using Ca<sub>v</sub>3.1 T-type channel knockout (KO) and knockdown (KD) mice under natural sleep and ethanol-induced unconsciousness. During natural sleep, the MD neurons in KO mice showed general characteristics of sustained firing across sleep stages. We found that KO and MD-specific KD mice showed enhanced resistance to ethanol. During the ethanol-induced unconscious state, wild-type (WT) MD neurons showed a significant reduction in neuronal firing from baseline with increased burst firing, whereas Ca<sub>v</sub>3.1 KO neurons showed well-sustained neural firing, within the level of wakefulness, and no burst firing. Further, 20 Hz optogenetic and electrical activation of MD neurons mimicked the ethanol resistance behavior in WT mice. These results suggest that maintaining MD neural firing at a wakeful level is sufficient to induce resistance to ethanol-induced hypnosis in WT mice. This work has important implications for the design of treatments for consciousness disorders using thalamic stimulation of deeper nuclei, including the targeting of the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus.

">Cortex-wide laminar dynamics diverge during learning</a></h4>

              
                Learning to link sensory information to motor actions involves dynamic coordination across cortical layers and regions. However, the involvement of a particular layer in learning, especially from a cortex-wide perspective, is relatively unknown. Using wide-field calcium imaging in mice as they learn a whisker-based go/no-go task, we tracked activity in layers 2/3 or 5 (L2/3 or L5) across 25 cortical areas. A surprising initial effect of learning was that activity in L5 but not in L2/3 was globally suppressed at auditory cue onset. As the texture comes into touch, we found that L2/3 displayed learning-related enhancements in higher order association areas rostrolateral (RL) and secondary somatosensory (S2), whereas L5 in these areas oppositely decreased. During texture touch, the barrel cortex (BC) displayed similar learning-related enhancement in both layers. As sensory information is transformed into a motor action, there was a frontal/posterior divergence that emerges after learning, in which L5 was enhanced in the frontal cortex and L2/3 was suppressed in the posterior cortex. In general, learning related correlations were often stronger between distant cortical layers than within the same column, suggesting that learning drives laminar interactions that transcend traditional columnar organization. Together, these results reveal that learning orchestrates a dynamic interplay of activity across space, time and cortical layers. Our findings emphasize the critical role of laminar architecture in shaping cortical plasticity and support the view that layer-specific circuits are fundamental to sensorimotor learning.

">Multiple Routes to Metacognitive Judgments of Working Memory in the Macaque Prefrontal Cortex</a></h4>

              
                The ability to evaluate one' s own memory is known as metamemory. Whether metamemory is inherent to memory strength or requires additional computation in the brain remains largely unknown. We investigated the metacognitive mechanism of working memory (WM) using two-photon calcium imaging in the prefrontal cortex of macaque monkeys, who were trained to memorize spatial sequences of varying difficulties. In some trials, after viewing the sequence, monkeys could opt out of retrieval for a smaller reward, reflecting their confidence in WM (meta-WM). We discovered that PFC neurons encoded WM strength by jointly representing the remembered locations through population coding and their associated uncertainties. This WM strength faithfully predicted the monkeys' recall performance and opt-out decisions. In addition to memory strength, other factors--trial history and arousal--encoded in baseline activity predicted opt-out decisions, serving as cues for meta-WM. We identified a code of meta-WM itself that integrated WM strength and these cues. Importantly, WM strength, cues, and meta-WM were represented in different subspaces within the same PFC population. The dynamics and geometry of PFC activity implement metacognitive computations, integrating WM strength with cues into a meta-WM signal that guides behavior.

">Optogenetic inhibition reveals distinct contributions of medial prefrontal cortex to intertemporal choice in young and aged rats</a></h4>

              
                The ability to choose adaptively between rewards differing in magnitude and delay (intertemporal choice) is critical for numerous life outcomes. Compared to younger adults, older adults tend to exhibit greater preference for large, delayed over small, immediate rewards (i.e., less delay discounting), which could lead to missed opportunities to obtain resources necessary for quality of life. Intertemporal choice is mediated by the prefrontal cortex, but how this is impacted by advanced age is not well understood. We used optogenetic inactivation to investigate contributions of medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) during distinct components of an intertemporal choice task in young and aged rats. mPFC inactivation during deliberation (during decisions between small, immediate vs. large, delayed rewards) increased preference for large, delayed rewards in both age groups. In contrast, inactivation during delays prior to large reward delivery increased preference for large, delayed rewards only in aged rats. Choices were unaffected by inactivation during other task phases. Results suggest that mPFC integrates information regarding anticipated outcomes into the decision process across the whole lifespan, but that only in aging is mPFC critical for consolidating information regarding reward delays into the decision structure in order to modulate choice behavior.

">Impaired Spatiotemporal Encoding of Social Behavior and Anxiety in the Prefrontal Cortex of Mice Lacking ASD-Risk Gene Shank3.</a></h4>

              
                The prefrontal cortex is a central regulator of complex behaviors, including social interaction and anxiety-related behaviors. The prefrontal cortex encodes these behaviors using heterogeneous groups of neurons, or ensembles, which collectively process inputs and communicate with distributed brain regions. We examined whether loss of the Autism-risk gene Shank3 alters the recruitment of neurons encoding socioemotional behavior collectively, or if abnormal activity during specific behaviors might affect functionally or anatomically defined populations of neurons. To do this, we combined spatially-resolved microendoscopic calcium imaging across the prefrontal microcircuit with functionally defined labeling of neurons as control and mutant mice engaged in social interaction or anxiety-provoking behaviors. We then utilized a non-biased transcriptomic method to identify neurons activated by social interactions. We show that the recruitment of heterogeneous neuronal populations are altered in a cell type and spatially dependent manner by loss of Shank3, with impaired recruitment of behavior-specific activity patterns within superficial, but not deeper aspects of the prefrontal cortex.

">Benchmarking the Impact of Anatomical Segmentation on In Vivo Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy</a></h4>

              
                Purpose: Estimation of metabolite concentrations in brain magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) requires correction for differences in tissue water content, relaxation properties, and the proportions of gray matter (GM), white matter (WM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Accurate knowledge of the relative proportions of these tissue classes within the volume of interest is therefore essential for reliable quantification. Commonly used brain segmentation tools differ in their algorithms, priors, and implementation, potentially introducing variability in MRS-derived concentration estimates. This study investigates the impact of segmentation software on estimated absolute concentrations. Methods: Three segmentation software tools, ANTs, FSL, and SPM, were evaluated. Segmentations were applied to an in vivo test-retest MR dataset to assess (1) differences in estimated tissue fractions, and (2) how these differences propagate into tissue-corrected metabolite concentrations. As an additional validity check and biological benchmark of segmentation performance, age-related associations with GM and total creatine (tCr) were examined. Results: Significant differences (p < 0.0001) were observed in tissue fraction estimates between segmentation tools, leading to differences in metabolite concentration estimates of up to 9% under identical acquisition and modeling conditions. Although the strength of the correlation varied between segmentation methods, no statistically significant differences were found. Conclusion: The choice of segmentation methodology contributed substantially to variability in MRS 'absolute' metabolite concentration estimates. These results underscore the need for transparent segmentation reporting to ensure reproducibility and cross-study comparability in MRS research. Quantifying the segmentation-driven variability allows researchers to contextualize cross-study differences, helping determine whether observed effects are methodological or biologically meaningful.

">AAV delivery of RNA editing machinery rescues SUDEP and seizure phenotype in a mouse model of Dravet Syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Dravet syndrome (DS) is a severe childhood genetic epilepsy, caused by de novo heterozygous mutations in the SCN1A gene, resulting in a loss of function of the voltage-gated sodium ion channel, Nav1.1. Nav1.1 is expressed in the brain and at a lower level, in the heart. The disease manifests in the first year of life. Patients exhibit tonic-clonic seizures, febrile seizures, cognitive decline, development delays, ataxia, and in some cases sudden unexpected death from epilepsy (SUDEP). Here we have developed a novel AAV-F mediated CRISPR-Cas-inspired RNA targeting system (CIRTS) pre-clinical treatment to increase endogenous Scn1a to ameliorate the disease phenotype in a clinically relevant heterozygous loss of function mouse model of DS. We designed novel guide RNAs (gRNAs) to target the long non-coding RNA, (or natural antisense transcript) of Scn1a to increase the expression of Scn1a mRNA in DS mice. We show that intracerebroventricular and intravenous administration of AAV-F-CIRTS-gRNA9 to target the brain and the heart to neonatal Scn1a+/- mice resulted significant increase in survival and a reduction in SUDEP and spontaneous seizures. Furthermore, we have shown increased expression of endogenous Scn1a in treated AAV-F-CIRTS-gRNA9 Scn1a+/- mice. These findings provide proof of concept evidence that an AAV-F-CIRTS mediated therapy hold promise as a potential long-term treatment for DS.

">Genotype-Phenotype Distinctions in Spastic Paraplegia 4 Reveal HDAC6 as a Therapeutic Target</a></h4>

              
                Spastic Paraplegia 4 (SPG4) is the most prevalent form of Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia (HSP), a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive lower limb spasticity and debilitating gait impairment, primarily driven by axonal degeneration of corticospinal motor neurons (CSMNs). Caused by mutations in the SPAST gene encoding spastin, an AAA-ATPase involved in microtubule severing and intracellular organelle function, SPG4 accounts for 40-50% of autosomal dominant HSP cases, yet without effective treatments. Although reduced microtubule acetylation has emerged as a key pathological mechanism, whether and how distinct mutations lead to microtubule deacetylation and subsequent neurodegeneration remains unclear. To address this, we generated isogenic human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) lines with two distinct heterozygous SPAST mutations - SPASTWT/C448Y (missense) and SPASTWT/S245X (truncation). Employing an innovative differentiation protocol, we created human motor cortical organoids enriched in CSMNs, providing a robust platform to study SPG4 pathophysiology. These organoids revealed striking genotype-phenotype distinctions, with mutation-specific variations in CSMN loss, axonal degeneration and neuronal activities, mirroring clinical heterogeneity. Mechanistic studies identified aberrant activation of histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6), a major neuronal microtubule deacetylase, as a key driver of SPG4 pathology. This dysregulation was specifically attributed to mutant M1-spastin, the longer isoform of spastin. Remarkably, pharmacological inhibition of HDAC6 with Tubastatin A restored microtubule acetylation status and mitigated axonal degeneration in both SPAST-mutant organoids, with corresponding improvements in corticospinal tract integrity and gait deficits validated in SPG4-transgenic mice. Collectively, our study establishes isogenic hiPSC-derived motor cortical organoids as a robust human model for corticospinal motor neuron degeneration and identifies HDAC6 hyperactivation as a central pathogenic mechanism and viable therapeutic target in SPG4.

">Situation Models in the Brain are Used to Resolve Word References</a></h4>

              
                Resolving the meaning of a pronoun requires retrieving information about a unique individual (a referent) from many remembered experiences and inferences throughout sensory and cognitive modalities, from vision and audition to episodic memory and social cognition. Here, we hypothesize that the functional neuroanatomy of pronoun interpretation involves interaction across distributed neural networks, during which each referent activates its own unique sensorimotor neural fingerprint associated with these experiences. To test this hypothesis, we collected fMRI data from 20 people watching a full-length movie, and developed a 3D branched convolutional neural network to distinguish movie characters from the fMRI signal across distributed sensorimotor regions. The same model distinguished the characters referenced by pronouns, using these same sensorimotor regions, supplemented by the hippocampus, precuneus, and medial prefrontal cortices. This work has far-reaching implications for understanding the relations among the many domains and modalities of neural representation required for ecological language comprehension. In particular, the demonstration that situation models, implemented in distributed sensory-motor and association cortices, are involved in resolving reference, suggests a whole brain distribution for language processing.

">Impaired BDNF-TrkB trafficking and signalling in Down syndrome basal forebrain neurons</a></h4>

              
                Brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptor tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) play crucial roles in neuronal development, synaptic transmission, and neuroplasticity. Deficits in BDNF/TrkB signalling and trafficking have been identified in several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Individuals with Down syndrome (DS) are at an increased risk of developing AD compared to the general population. Basal forebrain neurons (BFNs) are among the first to degenerate in AD and DS, but the mechanisms underlying their vulnerability remain unclear. Using BFNs derived from the Dp1Tyb mouse model of DS, we investigated neurotrophic signalling and trafficking deficits in AD-DS. We found enlarged early endosomes and elevated levels of active Rab5, a GTPase critical for early endosome formation, in Dp1Tyb BFNs. These abnormalities were associated with impaired transport of internalised TrkB from axon terminals to the soma. Using microfluidic devices, we demonstrated that axonal BDNF stimulation enhanced signalling endosome dynamics in wild-type but not Dp1Tyb BFNs, which is likely due to impaired axonal ERK1/2 signalling. Our findings establish a link between Rab5 hyperactivation, endosomal dysfunction, and impaired ERK1/2 signalling, highlighting the interplay between trafficking and neurotrophic signalling, and underscore the importance of targeting endolysosomal and signalling pathways to mitigate neuronal dysfunction in AD-DS.

">Compatibility of a competition model for explaining eyefixation durations during free viewing</a></h4>

              
                Intersaccadic times or eye fixation durations (EFD) are relatively stable at around 250ms, equivalent to 4 saccades by second. However, the mean and standard deviation are not sufficient to describe the frequency histogram distribution of EFD. The exgaussian has been proposed for fitting the EFD histograms. Present report tries to adjust a competition model (C model) between the saccadic and the fixation network to the EFD histograms. This model is at a rather conceptual level (computational level in Marr classification). Both models were adjusted to EFD from an open database with data of 179473 eye fixations. The C model showed to be able, along with exgaussian model, to be compatible for explaining the EFD distributions. The two parameters of the C model can be ascribed to (i) a refractory period for new saccades modeled by a sigmoid equation (A parameter), while (ii) the ps parameter would be related to the continuous competition between the saccadic network related to the saliency map and the eye fixation network, and would be modeled through a geometric probability density function. The model suggests that competition between neural networks would be an organizational property of brain neural networks to facilitate the decision process for action and perception. In the visual scene scanning the C model dynamic justifies the early post-saccadic stability of the foveated image, and the subsequent exploration of a broad space in the observed image.

">Context-Dependent Modulation of Astrocytic Ca2+ Signals by Mitochondria - A Computational Study</a></h4>

              
                Mitochondria are one of the major regulators of intracellular Ca2+ in the cells, uptaking this ion through the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter (MCU) and releasing by the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP). Astrocytes respond to neurotransmitters and other stimuli by increasing the intracellular Ca2+ concentration, a process called 2+ signaling. However, it is not clear how mitochondria interact with the neurotransmitter-triggered Ca2+ responses in astrocytes. To explore this mechanisms, we expanded a previous compartmental model of astrocytes developed by our group including the mitochondrial MCU and mPTP mechanisms controlling the Ca2+ response. We simulate glutamatergic and dopaminergic inputs, modeled as Poisson processes, that promote the synthesis of IP3 through the PLC pathway. Here, we used a unipolar and a bifurcated-terminal morphology models and, with exception for the distal compartments, every other compartment have mitochondria. Simulations revealed that mitochondria modulate the Ca2+ response in a context-dependent manner. For weak glutamatergic input, they reduce the frequency of Ca2+ oscillations and the distance these signals propagate from the terminal regions. However, for strong glutamatergic input and in the presence of dopamine, mitochondria enhance the Ca2+ response by reducing the Ca2+-dependent IP3 degradation. Our findings provide computational evidence that mitochondria have a critical role in shaping the spatial organization of Ca2+ singling in astrocytes.

">Reliability and signal comparison of OPM-MEG, fMRI & iEEG in a repeated movie viewing paradigm</a></h4>

              
                Optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) offer a promising advancement in noninvasive neuroimaging via magnetoencephalography (MEG), but establishing their reliability and comparability to existing methods remains an ongoing endeavor. Here, we evaluated OPM recordings by assessing their test-retest reliability and comparing them to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings in a repeated movie viewing paradigm. In 7 frequency bands ({delta}: 0.5-4 Hz, {theta}: 4-8 Hz, : 8-12 Hz, {beta}: 12-28 Hz, {gamma}1: 28-46 Hz, {gamma}2: 55-70 Hz, and HF: 64-116 Hz) we quantified the signal consistency (1) within individuals, (2) across subjects, and (3) across modalities. OPM exhibited widespread reliability, particularly in lower frequency bands; spatial patterns resembled those of fMRI and iEEG in visual and auditory regions. Cross-modal analyses revealed robust OPM-fMRI correspondence, including inverse correlations at low frequencies and positive correlations at higher frequencies, consistent with known relationships between oscillatory power and BOLD responses. Comparisons of signal-to-noise (SNR) estimates further revealed that in some regions, the SNR of cross-modal alignment exceeded within-modality reliability, suggesting that bridging between modalities can sometimes enhance SNR by attenuating reliably shared noise. Our findings demonstrate that OPM consistently captures stimulus-locked neural dynamics that converge with established modalities.

">Transcriptomic and pathological analysis of the hnRNP network reveals glial involvement in FTLD pathological subtypes</a></h4>

              
                Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with a strong heritable component. Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) refers to the pathological changes seen in FTD, characterised by atrophy of the frontal and temporal lobes and the presence of abnormal protein inclusions. In the case of FTLD with hyperphosphorylated TDP-43 positive inclusions (FTLD-TDP), five pathological subtypes (A, B, C, D, and E) are observed based on the types and distribution of inclusions found in the brain. In all subtypes, there tends to be a large variability in the number of pathological inclusions observed between cases, with limited correlation to clinical manifestations. TDP-43 is an RNA binding protein belonging to the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) family which along with other hnRNPs modulates multiple aspects of RNA processing. HnRNPs other than TDP-43 have been implicated in several neurological diseases, including ALS, FTLD-TDP, FTLD-FUS and Alzheimer's disease. Multiple hnRNPs have been found in pathological inclusions in specific subtypes of FTLD-TDP, suggesting potential roles in the disease process. The role of the hnRNP network in FTLD disease pathogenesis, however, has not yet been investigated. This study aimed to comprehensively evaluate the presence and expression of hnRNP proteins in two pathological subtypes of sporadic FTLD-TDP (A and C) as well as the genetic form FTLD-TDP A C9orf72 using immunohistochemistry and gene expression analysis by single-nuclei RNA-sequencing. We found that there was great variability in frequency of TDP-43 pathology across and within FTLD-TDP pathological subtypes. Finally, our findings suggest that distinct global transcriptomic profiles may underlie the different pathological subtypes of FTLD-TDP. The most prominent transcriptomic changes were observed in oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, involving multiple hnRNPs across FTLD subtypes compared to controls. Transcriptomic co-expression analysis further revealed that glial clusters were more strongly associated with RNA processing dysfunction and contribute to disease classification. Together, these findings highlight the involvement of the hnRNP network and glial-specific RNA processing alterations in FTLD-TDP pathophysiology, offering new insight into the molecular distinctions between pathological subtypes and potential targets for future investigation.

">Neural processing of natural speech by children with developmental language disorder (DLD): EEG speech decoding, power and classifier investigations</a></h4>

              
                The sensory/neural Temporal Sampling (TS) theory of developmental language disorder (DLD) is based on the sensory and linguistic impairments in rhythm processing that are found in children with both developmental dyslexia (DD) and DLD. These sensory/linguistic impairments include decreased sensitivity to amplitude rise times (ARTs), syllable stress patterns and speech rhythm. They are explained via a neural oscillatory speech processing framework drawn from the adult literature. Notably, at the neural level TS theory predicts impairments in the cortical tracking of different rates of amplitude modulation (AM) in the speech signal <10Hz. To date, the accuracy of low-frequency cortical tracking in natural continuous speech has not been measured in children with DLD. Here, EEG was recorded during story listening from children with and without DLD aged around 9 years, and decoding analyses in the delta, theta and alpha (control) bands were carried out. EEG power was computed in the delta, theta and gamma bands, as was phase-amplitude versus phase-phase coupling (PAC, PPC) between bands. The expectation that the accuracy of low-frequency decoding (delta, theta) of the speech signal would be impaired in DLD was not supported. Further, theta-delta and theta-gamma PAC were not atypical, contrary to prediction. EEG power in all bands was elevated for the DLD group, however. Receiving-operator-characteristic (ROC) curves estimated using support vector machine and logistic regression showed that these simple band power measures provided classifier models with the highest areas under the curves (AUC). The data are discussed using TS theory.

                Targeting Endoplasmic Reticulum Oxidoreductase 1 Alpha (ERO1A) offers therapeutic potential for ER stress-related conditions, including motor neurone diseases and congenital muscle disorders. However, selective ERO1A inhibitors remain unavailable. Here, we developed a multi-modal discovery pipeline combining molecular docking with in vitro and in vivo assays, screening 401,824 natural products from the COCONUT database. We identified two compounds, S88 and geniposide, that inhibited ERO1A in vitro, reduced tunicamycin-induced ER stress markers in human neurons, and improved locomotion and neuromuscular junctions in UBQLN2ALS Drosophila. S88 maintained efficacy in late-stage disease and extended lifespan in a D-galactose aging model. In fly brains, S88 selectively reduced phosphorylated eIF2a; without lowering its downstream effector ATF4, suggesting engagement of alternative mechanisms preserving ATF4 homeostasis. These findings highlight S88 as a promising lead for treating ER stress-associated neuromuscular disorders and demonstrate the utility of this integrative discovery pipeline for identifying bioactive natural compounds with disease-modifying potential.

">NeuroSuite for Long-term Functional and Structural Studies of Air-Liquid Interface Cerebral Organoids</a></h4>

              
                Over the past decade, air-liquid interface cerebral organoids (ALI-COs) have emerged as powerful in vitro models that capture essential structural and functional traits of the human brain, offering an exciting alternative to traditional animal models in neuroscience. Yet, the full potential of these systems has remained untapped due to the lack of non-invasive, long-term electrophysiological tools capable of preserving organoid integrity. Existing techniques, ranging from patch clamping to rigid and 3D microelectrode arrays, often compromise organoid growth and disrupt delicate cytoarchitecture. Here, we present NeuroSuite, an innovative bioelectronic platform designed to overcome these challenges. At its core is Neuroweb, a perforated, ultra-thin, and conformable organic microelectrode array engineered for minimal disruption of nutrient and oxygen exchange. Neuroweb is reusable and supports stable recordings for over six months, making it uniquely suited for longitudinal studies. Coated with poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS), a high-performance mixed ionic-electronic conductor, Neuroweb delivers exceptional signal-to-noise ratio recordings with high spatial precision. By pairing Neuroweb with NeuroMaps, an intuitive software for interactive analysis and visualisation, NeuroSuite enables long-term, non-invasive tracking and spatial mapping of electrical activity from brain organoids and ex vivo brain slices at the air-liquid interface. Following rigorous validation, we demonstrate that NeuroSuite can capture both high- and low-frequency throughout maturation. Our pipeline reveals evolving network connectivity, including the development of GABA-ergic interneurons, and concurrent shifts in high-frequency spiking and low-frequency oscillations indicative of a refinement in the excitatory-inhibitory balance. Finally, automated data acquisition and spatial spike mapping highlight local activity changes in response to media composition, a factor often overlooked in conventional recordings. NeuroSuite thus opens a new frontier in organoid neuroscience, enabling precise, long-term monitoring essential for modelling neurological diseases, understanding human brain development, and accelerating drug discovery.

">Functional network architecture and dynamics of the somato-cognitive action network</a></h4>

              
                The somato-cognitive-action-network (SCAN) is a recently discovered brain network. SCAN interdigitates somatomotor networks and is functionally connected to the cingulo-opercular/action-mode network. SCAN is therefore thought to play a role in motor/action planning. This view of SCAN, however, is based on its "static" functional connectivity--i.e. FC estimated using data pooled over an entire scan session or dataset. However, this approach necessarily overlooks changes in network activity and connectivity that occurs over shorter timescales. In this report, we extend analyses of SCAN's static architecture, demonstrating that, at the whole-brain level, SCAN vertices exhibit overlapping network membership, such that, while they form a cohesive sub-network, they may also couple transiently and dynamically with other networks. We examine these potential co-activations by focusing on SCAN dynamics and through the identification of distinct coupling modes -- co-activation patterns (CAPs). We show that CAPs differentially contribute to SCAN's static architecture and that their frequency varies across following limb immobilization.

">Formic acid impairs α-synuclein seeding activity in human and mouse brains</a></h4>

              
                -Synuclein (-syn) is an abundant monomeric protein that can aggregate into fibrils and form neuropathological inclusions in the brains of patients with synucleinopathies. New evidence suggests that the mouse-human transmission barrier of -syn is lower than previously reported, emphasizing the need for improved biosafety procedures when working with -syn aggregates. Histopathology of -syn-infected brain represents a significant potential source of occupational exposure, and current methods for tissue fixation do not inactivate the ability of pathologic -syn to seed the conversion of endogenous, monomeric -syn into fibrils. In this study, we tested whether 96% formic acid treatment could reduce the seeding activity of -syn aggregates in paraformaldehyde-fixed brain samples from dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) patients and -syn pre-formed fibrils (PFF)-injected mouse brains. Using real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC), we found that formic acid treatment reduced -syn seeding dose (picograms of -syn seeds per ml of brain homogenate) in DLB and mouse brain by 6 and 8 logarithms, respectively. RT-QuIC reactions seeded with formic acid-treated brain homogenates showed significantly longer lag phase, and decreased total thioflavin T fluorescence compared to untreated samples, indicating that formic acid treatment impairs the ability of pathological -syn to seed monomeric -syn. Importantly, the -syn pathologic features and the immunostaining quality were preserved in formic acid-treated tissues. Our results demonstrate that formic acid treatment is a quick and efficient procedure for reducing -syn seeding activity in fixed brain samples, thereby lowering the risk of accidental exposure in laboratories without compromising the quality of histopathological analysis.

">A novel interoceptive subfornical organ to infralimbic cortex circuit relays airway inflammation effects on fear extinction</a></h4>

              
                There is growing interest in the impact of internal body states on the brain and behavior. The detrimental effects of chronic lung inflammation on mental health are well recognized, however, underlying mechanisms are not known. Here, using a murine model of allergic asthma we report compromised fear extinction in mice with severe but not mild airway inflammation (AI); an effect abolished by anti-interleukin-17A (IL-17A) antibodies. Investigation of innate immune cells, microglia as-well-as transcriptomic signatures in the subfornical organ (SFO), a brain interoceptive node lacking a traditional blood-brain-barrier, revealed significant alterations in severe AI mice. IL-17 Receptor A (IL-17RA) was expressed in SFO microglia and upregulated in severe AI mice. Notably, ablation of microglial IL-17RA improved fear extinction in severe AI mice. Furthermore, we identified direct SFO projections to the infralimbic (IL) cortex, a key area regulating extinction. Importantly, chemogenetic inhibition of the SFO-IL circuit led to improved fear extinction in severe AI mice. Collectively, we report a unique body-to-brain interoceptive mechanism engaging the SFO and an SFO-to-IL circuit, through which airway inflammatory mediators compromise fear extinction. Beyond asthma, our findings are relevant to other pulmonary pathologies (e.g. bacterial pneumonia, ARDS, COVID-19) highlighting a risk for cortical dysfunction and fear pathologies such as PTSD.

">Pupil dilation as a marker of attention/effort in aging and mild cognitive impairment</a></h4>

              
                Pupil dilation (PD) can be easily measured and reflects responses to subjectively salient or cognitively demanding events. It therefore holds promise as a cognitive marker especially for individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or other neurodegenerative conditions with restricted abilities to respond in cognitive assessments. We assessed PD during two tasks, an oddball task for investigating attentional allocation and a Simon task which additionally allows for investigating cognitive effort in younger adults (YAs), older adults (OAs), and patients with MCI. PD is a useful marker for investigating attention and cognitive effort in MCI, as suggested by elevated PD to salient stimuli in particular of individuals with better attentional control in MCI patients, as well as YAs and OAs. Measurement of PD may serve as an easy-to-administer measure to assess changes in cognitive function in healthy aging and MCI.

">Neural Convergence of Graded Belief and Binary Belief Uncertainty</a></h4>

              
                Belief was defined by William James as "the psychological process or function of cognizing reality", and the recent philosophical literature has emphasized that there are two types of belief: categorical and graded. The relationship between these two belief types is complex, and it is often assumed that the degrees of graded belief reflect confidence. However, this claim has not yet been addressed empirically. In this functional magnetic resonance imaging study we let N=29 young healthy participants rate their graded belief in 16 propositions from the conspiracy theory spectrum and estimated certainty scores from the ratings that we associated with brain activation during the presentation of the propositions. We found associations of uncertainty (i.e. negative associations with certainty scores) with brain activation in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), and posterior parietal cortex. The clusters in the dmPFC and dlPFC replicated associations with explicit ratings of uncertainty in binary belief decisions we identified in a prior study on domain-general belief. These results provide empirical evidence for a link between graded belief and uncertainty in human cognition and emphasize the role of doubt as a relevant process to take into account in concepts of graded belief.

">Gradient scheme optimization for PRESS-localized edited MRS using weighted pathway suppression</a></h4>

              
                This study aimed to design and implement an optimized gradient scheme for PRESS-localized edited magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to enhance suppression of out-of-voxel (OOV) artifacts. These artifacts, which originate from insufficient crushing of unwanted coherence transfer pathways (CTPs), are particularly challenging in editing schemes for metabolites like gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutathione (GSH). To address this, a volume-based likelihood model was developed to guide gradient scheme optimization, prioritizing suppression of CTPs based on likelihood. A volume-based likelihood model for CTP weighting was integrated into a Dephasing optimization through coherence order pathway selection (DOTCOPS) gradient optimization. Using a genetic algorithm with a new dual-penalty cost function, gradient schemes were optimized to maximize pathway-specific suppression. Hardware and sequence constraints, maximum gradient amplitudes and delay durations respectively, informed the optimization. Validation of the optimized scheme was performed with simulations and in vivo using an edited sequence in three brain regions (posterior cingulate cortex PCC, thalamus, and medial prefrontal cortex mPFC), with particular focus on OOV artifact reduction and spectral quality improvements. The optimized gradient scheme demonstrated improved k-space crushing efficiency (by an average of 197%). OOV artifacts were reduced in all brain regions, particularly in highly OOV-susceptible regions (thalamus and mPFC). Improvements were most notable around 4.3 ppm with significant OOV amplitude reductions (p < 0.001). By using a volume-based likelihood model for CTP prioritization, the optimized scheme ensures robust and region-agnostic performance in reducing OOV artifacts.

">Microsaccades track shifting but not necessarily maintaining covert visual-spatial attention</a></h4>

              
                Covert attention enables the brain to prioritise relevant visual information without directly looking at it. Ample studies have linked covert visual-spatial attention to the direction of small fixational eye movements called microsaccades, offering researchers and clinicians a potential non-invasive tool to track internal states of covert attention. However, other studies have reported only a weak link or no link at all. We now show that the link between covert visual-spatial attention and microsaccades critically depends on the stage of attentional deployment. Across two experiments--each employing a distinct but widely adopted approach to fixational control--we show that spatial microsaccade biases were more pronounced (Experiment 1) or even exclusively present (Experiment 2) during the initial stage of shifting covert spatial attention, even when covert attention was subsequently maintained as testified by enhanced visual discrimination. This shows that the involvement of the brain's oculomotor system in covert visual-spatial attention qualitatively changes over the course of attentional deployment, and how its peripheral fingerprint in the form of microsaccades reliably indexes shifting but not necessarily maintaining covert visual-spatial attention.

">Facilitating analysis of open neurophysiology data on the DANDI Archive using large language model tools</a></h4>

              
                The DANDI Archive has become a key resource for open neurophysiology data, now hosting over 400 datasets in the Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) format. While these datasets hold tremendous potential for reanalysis and discovery, many researchers face barriers to reuse, including unfamiliarity with data access methods and difficulty identifying relevant content. To address these challenges, we introduce an AI-powered, agentic chat assistant and a semi-automated notebook generation pipeline. The chat assistant serves as an interactive tool for exploring and understanding neurophysiology datasets in the DANDI Archive. It leverages large language models (LLMs) and integrates with agentic tools to guide users through data access, visualization, and preliminary analysis. The notebook generator autonomously analyzes a the internal structure of a dataset with minimal human supervision, executing inspection scripts and generating visualizations. Based on this exploration, a second LLM agent then produces an introductory instructional Python notebook tailored to the dataset. We applied this system to 12 recently published datasets. Review by neurophysiology and data science specialists found that the generated notebooks were generally accurate and well-structured, with most notebooks rated as "very helpful". This work illustrates how AI can reduce barriers to scientific data reuse and foster broader engagement with complex neurophysiology datasets.

">Temporal windows of perceptual organization: Evidence from crowding and uncrowding</a></h4>

              
                Organizing visual input into coherent percepts requires dynamic grouping and segmentation mechanisms that operate across both spatial and temporal domains. While crowding disrupts target perception when nearby elements fall within the same spatial pooling window, specific flanker configurations can alleviate this effect through Gestalt-based grouping, a phenomenon known as uncrowding. Here, we examined the temporal dynamics underlying these spatial organization processes using a Vernier discrimination task. In Experiment 1, we varied stimulus duration and found that uncrowding emerged only after 160 ms, suggesting a time-consuming process. In Experiment 2, we manipulated the stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) between the target and flankers. We found that presenting good-Gestalt flankers briefly before the target (as little as 32 ms) significantly boosted uncrowding, even in the absence of temporal overlap between the two stimuli. This effect was specific to conditions in which flankers preceded the target, ruling out pure temporal integration and masking accounts. These findings suggest that spatial segmentation can be dynamically facilitated when the temporal order of presentation allows grouping mechanisms to engage prior to target processing. Moreover, the observed time course indicates that segmentation is not purely feedforward, particularly for stimuli that are likely to recruit higher-level visual areas, pointing instead to the involvement of recurrent or feedback processes.

">Structural Validation of the Intermediate Leptomeningeal Layer in the Human Central Nervous System</a></h4>

              
                Traditionally, the human central nervous system (CNS) is described as having three meningeal layers, from outer to inner: dura mater, arachnoid mater, and pia mater. The arachnoid and pia mater are called the leptomeninges, and the space between them is filled with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Using gross dissection, light microscopy, and ultrastructural methods on fresh postmortem and cadaveric fetal to adult age CNS specimens (N=61), we demonstrate the presence of a fibro-cellular intermediate leptomeningeal layer (ILL) in the human CNS along the entire neural axis, from the cortex to the caudal end of the spinal cord. ILL divides the subarachnoid space (SAS) into two distinct structural compartments, traversed by vessels and nerves. The ILL shows unique structural features, such as dips into the sulci and fissures of the brain as a double-fold membrane carrying the vessels, bears intra-layer trabeculae, and creates the perivascular sheath. In the spinal cord, ILL shows the presence of distinct meningothelial cells with macrophage-like properties. Moreover, throughout the neural axis, it appears to be a non-sieved barrier, characterized by the presence of tight and adherens junctions.

">Social Anxiety Increases Autonomic and Visuocortical Generalization of Conditioned Aversive Responses to Faces</a></h4>

              
                Aversive generalization learning is an adaptive trait that is necessary for survival in a dynamic environment. However, this process is exaggerated in persons with anxiety disorders, leading to overgeneralization of learned threat associations, hyperreactive fight-or-flight responses, and persistent avoidance. Patients with social anxiety disorder (SAD) exhibit impaired conditioned threat discrimination particularly with respect to social stimuli, such as faces. The present study examined the relationship between social anxiety and generalization of visuocortical and pupil dilation responses to a series of facial morphs, one of which was always paired with a noxious sound. Steady-state visual evoked potentials (ssVEPs; N = 65) increasingly fit a model of generalization, and pupil dilation responses (N = 62) also decreasingly discriminated the CS+ as a function of social anxiety. These results contribute to a growing body of work suggesting that SAD dysregulates the ability of autonomic responses to specifically target social threat. The finding of widened visuocortical tuning in SAD implicates a role of the visual system in driving attentional biases in anxiety disorders, including increased visual processing of safety signals similar to threat cues.

">Beyond Threat: Changes in Visuocortical Engagement and Oscillatory Brain Activity during Non-Aversive Associative Learning</a></h4>

              
                Aversive conditioning produces selectively heightened visuocortical responses to conditioned stimuli stimulus (CS) that predict aversive unconditioned events (US). However, it is unclear whether similar neural signatures emerge as a consequence of mere association formation between a CS-US pair, i.e., when a CS predicts a neutral event. To address this, we paired a soft tone (65 dB) with one of two high-contrast circular gratings (15 or 75 degrees; CS+; counterbalanced), while two intermediate orientations (35, 55 degrees) were never paired with the neutral tone, serving as generalization stimuli (GS). A sample of 22 participants viewed each grating for 3000 ms, with the tone presented during the last 1000 ms of each grating presentation. Gratings were flickered (turned on and off) at a temporal rate of 15 Hz, to evoked steady-state Visual Evoked Potentials (ssVEPs), a metric of visuocortical engagement. Time-frequency decomposition via Morlet wavelets quantified changes in the amplitude of alpha-band (8-13 Hz) oscillations - an additional electrophysiological index that has been shown to be sensitive to aversive conditioning. Contrary to findings observed during aversive conditioning, alpha amplitude increased, rather than decreased, during CS+ trials relative to GSs. Likewise, ssVEP amplitude was higher for GSs than for the CS+, which again is the opposite of what is found during aversive conditioning. These findings suggest that a CS paired with non-aversive outcomes engages mechanisms consistent with working memory, anticipation, or imagery processes, reflected in heightened alpha amplitude and attenuated ssVEP, rather than the defensive potentiation observed during aversive conditioning.

">Speed Vascular Patterns in the Spatial Navigation System</a></h4>

              
                The hippocampal formation is central to spatial navigation, hosting neurons that encode position, direction, and speed. Yet, the brain-wide vascular dynamics supporting these processes remain poorly understood, especially during naturalistic behaviors. Here, we improved functional ultrasound (fUS) imaging to examine how cerebral blood volume (CBV) changes relate to behavioral parameters in rats during free exploration. High-resolution imaging of hippocampal-parahippocampal regions during open-field exploration reveals strong correlations between CBV dynamics and animal speed, with distinct regional activation patterns and temporal delays. Lagged general linear modeling uncovers information flow from the thalamus to parahippocampal regions, including the medial entorhinal cortex, and to hippocampal subfields (dentate gyrus, CA1 - CA3), consistent with a hierarchical processing framework. The analysis also links CBV with angular head speed and the dorsal thalamus. Decoding analyses show that CBV signals not only encode speed precisely but also capture spatial features like proximity to walls and corners, even when univariate analyses do not. This decoding remains robust across animals, underscoring the universality of speed encoding in vascular dynamics. We also identify slow CBV oscillations in the hippocampus aligned with minute-scale speed fluctuations, suggesting a neurovascular signature of exploratory behavior. These findings reveal a hemodynamic signature of speed representation in the navigation system, arising from energy demands in a continuous attractor network model for path integration, where population activity and synaptic currents increase quadratically with animal speed as both peak firing rates and neuronal recruitment scale linearly with animal speed. Moreover, they highlight functional ultrasound imaging as a powerful approach for probing the hemodynamic basis of navigation.

">Bright Light Exposure Reduces Negative Affect and Modulates EEG Activity in Sleep-Deprived and Well-Rested Adolescents</a></h4>

              
                This study investigated whether a single morning session of bright light exposure modulates alertness, cognition, mood, and EEG activity in well-rested and partially sleep-deprived adolescents. Forty-seven subjects were assigned to a well-rested (8 h sleep) or a sleep-deprived group (4 h sleep). All underwent 30 minutes of morning bright light exposure, with EEG, cognitive testing, and ratings of sleepiness and affect conducted pre- and post-intervention. Behavioral and electrophysiological changes were compared within and between groups. Associations between changes in EEG activity and behavioral outcomes were explored using correlation analyses. Bright light significantly reduced negative affect and improved Digit Span Forward task performance. No changes were observed in positive affect, subjective sleepiness, or Digit Span Backward scores. EEG analysis revealed decreased delta activity in the anterior cingulate and increased beta activity in the right insula and fronto-parietal regions. Behavioral and EEG effects were similar across groups; however, only in the sleep-deprived group changes in beta activity significantly correlated with reduced negative affect. These results suggest that bright light may acutely enhance emotional state, cognitive performance, and cortical arousal in adolescents. The link between beta activity and affective improvement under sleep deprivation suggests a potential mechanism by which light supports emotional regulation.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Currently, bipolar disorder diagnosis is primarily based on clinical interviews. Magnetoencephalography signals reflect changes in the brain’s magnetic field induced by neuronal activity. As a result, the combination of magnetoencephalography and network science holds great promise for identifying bipolar disorder biomarkers. However, the existing methods remain limited in capturing the complexity of nodes and their connections within resting-state brain networks, making it difficult to fully reveal underlying pathological mechanisms. In this work, we measured the uncertainty associated with a subgraph, an information-theoretic metric called “subgraph entropy,” and used it to identify individuals with bipolar disorder. This method enabled a more accurate characterization of brain network complexity, facilitating the identification of regions closely associated with disease states. The results showed that subgraph entropy features significantly contributed to the classification of bipolar disorder, particularly within the beta frequency band. In addition, two special forms of subgraph entropy, namely node entropy and edge entropy, were examined to identify important brain regions and functional connectivity in bipolar disorder patients across multiple frequency bands. Notably, in the beta frequency band, the method based on edge entropy achieved 0.8462 accuracy, 0.7308 specificity, and 0.9231 sensitivity through leave-one-out cross-validation, effectively distinguishing individuals with bipolar disorder from healthy controls.</span>

<p>This study reveals that the loss of MeCP2 in Rett syndrome model mice disrupts prefrontal connectivity. Although early environmental enrichment helps mitigate behavioral deficits and restores hippocampal BDNF levels, it fails to reverse the altered prefrontal connectivity or prevent the prefrontal-specific decline in BDNF.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Rett syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by loss-of-function mutations in the <i>MECP2</i> gene, is characterized by severe motor, cognitive, and emotional impairments. Some of the deficits may result from changes in cortical connections, especially downstream projections of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), which may also be targets of restoration following rearing conditions such as environmental enrichment that alleviate specific symptoms. Here, using a heterozygous <i>Mecp2<sup>+/−</sup>
</i> female mouse model closely analogous to human Rett syndrome, we investigated the impact of early environmental enrichment on behavioral deficits and PFC connectivity. Behavioral analyses revealed that enriched housing rescued fine motor deficits and reduced anxiety, with enrichment-housed <i>Mecp2<sup>+/−</sup>
</i> mice performing comparably to wild-type (WT) controls in rotarod and open field assays. Anatomical mapping of top-down anterior cingulate cortex (ACA) projections demonstrated altered PFC connectivity in <i>Mecp2<sup>+/−</sup>
</i> mice, with increased axonal density in the somatosensory cortex and decreased density in the motor cortex compared to WT controls. ACA axons revealed shifts in hemispheric distribution, particularly in the medial network regions, with <i>Mecp2<sup>+/−</sup>
</i> mice exhibiting reduced ipsilateral dominance. These changes were unaffected by enriched housing, suggesting that structural abnormalities in PFC connectivity persist despite behavioral improvements. Enriched housing rescued brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels in the hippocampus but failed to restore BDNF levels in the PFC, consistent with the persistent deficits observed in prefrontal axonal projections. These findings highlight the focal nature of changes induced by reduction of MeCP2 and by exposure to environmental enrichment and suggest that environmental enrichment starting in adolescence can alleviate behavioral deficits in <i>Mecp2<sup>+/−</sup>
</i> mice without reversing abnormalities in large-scale cortical connectivity.</p>

The increasing availability of big data and adoption of sophisticated computational techniques in biomedical research has exciting implications for our scientific understanding of human health. However, researchers report struggling to find data science education that meets their needs, despite the fact that many training programs and online resources exist. There is a lack of evidence on the strengths and weaknesses of various training options, making selecting an educational path daunting. We created a new data science training program focused on rigorous, reproducible methods for biomedical research, making use of tightly scoped modular content that can be flexibly arranged to provide a curriculum tailored to a researcher’s specific needs and skill level. Moreover, we ran a study testing the program’s effectiveness, providing not only another option for data science training but also a model for collecting and sharing relevant data on data science education programs. We ran two waves of research participants, adjusting our materials in between to improve both the training program and our research design. For both waves, we pre-registered hypotheses that learners’ self-reported data science ability and level of agreement with important tenets of open science would increase over the course of the program. Indeed, learners showed significant improvement in data science ability (Wave 1: <i>t</i>(47) = 10.18, <i>p</i> < .001, Wave 2: <i>t</i>(238) = 17.12, <i>p</i> < .001) and grea<i>t</i>er agreement with open science values (Wave 1: <i>t</i>(47) = 3.56, <i>p</i> < .001, Wave 2: <i>t</i>(238) = 7.95, <i>p</i> < .001). Follow up analyses underscore <i>t</i>he robustness of improvemen<i>t</i> in data science ability. The improvement in open science values was more moderate and was significant only in some of our pre-registered hypothesis tests, likely due to a ceiling effect as most learners reported high agreement with open science values at pretest.

                <p>by Richard M. Gunner, Flavio Quintana, Mariano H. Tonini, Mark D. Holton, Ken Yoda, Margaret C. Crofoot, Rory P. Wilson</p>

Animals navigating in fluid environments often face forces from wind or water currents that challenge travel efficiency and route accuracy. We investigated how 27 Magellanic penguins (<i>Spheniscus magellanicus</i>) adapt their navigation strategies to return to their colony amid regional tidal ocean currents. Using GPS-enhanced dead-reckoning loggers and high-resolution ocean current data, we reconstructed penguin travel vectors during foraging trips to assess their responses to variable currents during their colony-bound movements. By integrating estimates of energy costs and prey pursuits, we found that birds balanced direct navigation with current-driven drift: in calm currents, they maintained precise line-of-sight headings to their colony. In stronger currents, they aligned their return with lateral flows, which increased travel distance, but at reduced energy costs, and provided them with increased foraging opportunities. Since the lateral tidal currents always reversed direction over the course of return paths, the penguins’ return paths were consistently S-shaped but still resulted in the birds returning efficiently to their colonies. These findings suggest that Magellanic penguins can sense current drift and use it to enhance energy efficiency by maintaining overall directional accuracy while capitalizing on foraging opportunities.

<p><b>Serotonin receptors in areas of the emotion regulation network in human and rat brains a comparative autoradiographic study</b>. Our systematic comparative analysis revealed significant differences of 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2</sub> receptor distributions and of their balance within and across components of the human emotion regulation network and homolog areas in rats. The data contribute to validate the rat as an appropriate model in the translational research of human mood disorders and provide reference data for comparisons to disorder related alterations.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Serotonergic neurotransmission is crucial for emotion processing and is dysregulated in mood disorders. To analyze the pathophysiology of disease and develop effective pharmacological treatments, the suitability of the rat as a model for translational research must be continuously validated. In vitro receptor autoradiography was used to characterize (dis)similarities of regional and laminar serotonergic 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2</sub> receptor distributions between components of the human emotion regulation network and homologous rat areas, including areas of the lateral prefrontal, orbitofrontal anterior and midcingulate cortices, hippocampal cornu Ammonis (CA) and dentate gyrus (DG), and the accumbens, central amygdaloid, and mediodorsal thalamic nuclei. In both species, mean 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> densities were highest in cingulate area 25/infralimbic cortex and the hippocampus, and lowest in the accumbens. Whereas human CA presented significantly higher 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> density than DG, the opposite was found in rats. Across the cortical depth, in humans, layers I–III and V contained the highest and lowest 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> densities, respectively. In rats, layers I–II contained the lowest and layers V–VI the highest 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> values. Mean 5-HT<sub>2</sub> densities were lower than 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> densities in all areas of both species, whereby layers III and VI contained the highest and lowest 5-HT<sub>2</sub> densities, respectively. Rats presented a more widespread range of significant differences concerning the ratio between 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2</sub> receptors across examined areas than did humans. Concluding, this comparative study reveals species differences in 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2</sub> receptor densities in components of the emotion regulation network, which should be considered when using the rat as a model in the translational research of mood disorders.</p>

                Morillo et al. generated a single-nucleus RNA sequencing atlas of adult Caenorhabditis elegans male neurons. Compared with hermaphrodite neurons, they identified neuronal markers, sex-biased features, and regulators of male-specific behavior. These data expand the transcriptional landscape of the C. elegans nervous system, providing a foundation for studies on sex differences.

                Wei et al. demonstrate that a ketogenic diet induces oxidative stress and cellular senescence in an estrogen-dependent manner, with effects seen in male, but not female, mice. A similar response was observed with a high-fat diet, suggesting that elevated fatty acid oxidation may contribute to senescence under specific metabolic conditions.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102701">A whole-organism landscape of X-inactivation in humans</a></h4>

              
                As females are mosaic for X-inactivation, direct determination of X-linked allelic expression in bulk tissues is typically unfeasible. Using females that are non-mosaic (completely skewed) for X-inactivation (nmXCI) has proven a powerful and natural genetic system for profiling X-inactivation in humans. By combining allele-resolution data for one previously reported and two newly identified nmXCI females, we directly determined X-inactivation status of 380 X-linked genes across 30 normal tissues, including 198 genes for which XCI status is directly determined for the first time. Our findings represent a substantial advance in our understanding of human X-inactivation and will serve as a reference for dissecting the genetic origin of sex bias in human traits. In addition, our study reveals nmXCI as a common feature of the human female population, with profound consequences for the penetrance and expressivity of X-linked traits in humans.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105788">Pu.1/Spi1 dosage controls the turnover and maintenance of microglia in zebrafish and mammals</a></h4>

              
                Microglia are brain-resident macrophages playing pivotal roles in central nervous system (CNS) development and homeostasis. Yet, the cellular and molecular basis governing microglia maintenance remains largely unknown. Here, by utilizing a visible conditional knockout allele of <i>pu.1/spi1b</i> gene (the master regulator for microglia/macrophage lineage development) to generate mosaic microglia populations in adult zebrafish, we show that while <i>pu.1</i>-deficient microglia are immediately viable, they are less competitive, and chronically eliminated through Tp53-mediated cell competition. Interestingly, when conditionally inactivating Pu.1 in adult <i>spi-b</i> (the orthologue of mouse <i>Spi-b</i>) null mutants, microglia are rapidly depleted via apoptosis, suggesting that Pu.1 and Spi-b regulate microglia maintenance in a dosage-dependent manner. The dosage-dependent regulation of microglia maintenance by PU.1/SPI1 is evolutionarily conserved in mice, as shown by conditionally inactivating single and both <i>Spi1</i> alleles in microglia, respectively. Collectively, our study reveals the conserved cellular and molecular mechanisms controlling microglia turnover and maintenance in teleosts and mammals.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105565">Interpretable protein-DNA interactions captured by structure-sequence optimization</a></h4>

              
                Sequence-specific DNA recognition underlies essential processes in gene regulation, yet methods for simultaneous predictions of genomic DNA recognition sites and their binding affinity remain lacking. Here, we present the Interpretable protein-DNA Energy Associative (IDEA) model, a residue-level, interpretable biophysical model capable of predicting binding sites and affinities of DNA-binding proteins. By fusing structures and sequences of known protein-DNA complexes into an optimized energy model, IDEA enables direct interpretation of physicochemical interactions among individual amino acids and nucleotides. We demonstrate that this energy model can accurately predict DNA recognition sites and their binding strengths across various protein families. Additionally, the IDEA model is integrated into a coarse-grained simulation framework that quantitatively captures the absolute protein-DNA binding free energies. Overall, IDEA provides an integrated computational platform that alleviates experimental costs and biases in assessing DNA recognition and can be utilized for mechanistic studies of various DNA-recognition processes.

                An animal’s behaviour is the result of multiple neural pathways acting in parallel, receiving information across and within sensory modalities at the same time. How these pathways are integrated, particularly when their individual outputs are in conflict, is key to understanding complex natural behaviours. We investigated this question in the visually guided flight of the hummingbird hawkmoth <i>Macroglossum stellatarum</i>. These insects were recently shown to partition their visual field, using ventrolateral optic flow cues to guide their flight like most insects, while the same stimuli in the dorsal visual field evoke a novel directional response. Using behavioural experiments which set the two pathways into conflict, we tested whether and how the ventrolateral and dorsal pathway integrate to guide hawkmoth flight. Combined with environmental imaging, we demonstrate that the partitioning of the visual field followed the prevalence of visual cues in the hawkmoths’ natural habitats, while the integration hierarchy of the two pathways matched the relevance of these cues for the animals’ flight safety, rather than their magnitude in the experimental setup or in natural habitats. These results provide new mechanistic insights into the vision-based flight control of insects and link these to their natural context. We anticipate our findings to be the starting point for comparative investigations into parallel pathways for flight guidance in insects from differently structured natural habitats.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104255">Decoding protein phosphorylation during oocyte meiotic divisions using phosphoproteomics</a></h4>

              
                Oocyte meiotic divisions represent a critical process in sexual reproduction, as a diploid non-dividing oocyte is transformed into a haploid fertilizable egg, as a prelude for the subsequent embryonic divisions and differentiation. Although cell differentiation and proliferation are governed by transcription, oocyte maturation and early embryonic divisions depend entirely on changes in protein abundance and post-translational modifications. Here, we analyze the abundance and phosphorylation of proteins during <i>Xenopus</i> oocyte meiotic maturation. We reveal significant shifts in protein stability, related to spindle assembly, DNA replication, and RNA-binding. Our analysis pinpoints broad changes in phosphorylation correlating with key cytological meiotic milestones, noteworthy changes in membrane trafficking, nuclear envelope disassembly, and modifications in microtubule dynamics. Additionally, specific phosphorylation events target regulators of protein translation, Cdk1 and the Mos/MAPK pathway, thereby providing insight into the dynamics of Cdk1 activity, as related to the meiotic cell cycle. This study sheds light on the orchestration of protein dynamics and phosphorylation events during oocyte meiotic divisions, providing a rich resource for understanding the molecular pathways orchestrating meiotic progression in the frog, and most likely applicable to other vertebrate species.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100722">POMC neurons control fertility through differential signaling of MC4R in kisspeptin neurons</a></h4>

              
                Inactivating mutations in the melanocortin 4 receptor (<i>MC4R</i>) gene cause monogenic obesity. Interestingly, female patients also display various degrees of reproductive disorders, in line with the subfertile phenotype of Mc4r KO female mice. However, the cellular mechanisms by which MC4R regulates reproduction are unknown. Kiss1 neurons directly stimulate gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) release through two distinct populations: the Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons, controlling GnRH pulses, and the sexually dimorphic Kiss1<sup>AVPV/PeN</sup> neurons controlling the preovulatory luteinizing hormone (LH) surge. Here, we show that <i>Mc4r</i> expressed in Kiss1 neurons regulates fertility in females. In vivo, deletion of <i>Mc4r</i> from Kiss1 neurons in female mice replicates the reproductive impairments of Mc4r KO mice without inducing obesity. Conversely, re-insertion of <i>Mc4r</i> in Kiss1 neurons of Mc4r null mice restores estrous cyclicity and LH pulsatility without reducing their obese phenotype. In vitro, we dissect the specific action of Mc4r on Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> versus Kiss1<sup>AVPV/PeN</sup> neurons and show that Mc4r activation excites Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons through direct synaptic actions. In contrast, Kiss1<sup>AVPV/PeN</sup> neurons are normally inhibited by MC4R activation except under elevated estradiol levels, thus facilitating the activation of Kiss1<sup>AVPV/PeN</sup> neurons to induce the LH surge driving ovulation in females. Our findings demonstrate that POMC<sup>ARH</sup> neurons acting through MC4R directly regulate reproductive function in females by stimulating the ‘pulse generator’ activity of Kiss1<sup>ARH</sup> neurons and restricting the activation of Kiss1<sup>AVPV/PeN</sup> neurons to the time of the estradiol-dependent LH surge, and thus unveil a novel pathway of the metabolic regulation of fertility by the melanocortin system.

                <p>Crows, renowned for advanced cognitive abilities and vocal communication, rely on intricate auditory systems. While the neuroanatomy of corvid auditory pathways is partially explored, the underlying neurophysiological mechanisms are largely unknown. This study used functional ultrasound imaging (fUSi) to investigate sound-induced cerebral blood volume (CBV) changes in the Field L complex of the auditory telencephalon in two female crows. fUSi revealed frequency-specific CBV responses, showing a tonotopic organization within the Field L complex, with low frequencies in the posterior dorsal region and high frequencies in the anterior ventral region. Machine learning analyses showed fUSi signals could be used to classify sound types accurately, in both awake and anesthetized states. Variable CBV responses to longer sound stimuli suggest a delineation of subregions within the Field L complex. Together, these findings highlight the potential of fUSi for providing high-resolution insights into functional systems in corvids, enabling future exploration of experimental task-related cognitive dynamics.</p>

                <p>Evidence suggests that the neurotransmitter norepinephrine may play an important role in Parkinson disease (PD). The norepinephrine transporter (NET) regulates noradrenergic signaling and can serve as an index of noradrenergic innervation in neuroimaging studies. The <I>Pink1-/-</I> rat model, which exhibits many signs similar to PD, notably in the nonmotor domain, exhibits abnormal noradrenergic markers. Here, we sought to (1) implement reference region pharmacokinetic modeling of positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with the novel NET ligand [<sup>18</sup>F]NS12137, (2) validate the resulting indices of NET concentration, and (3) characterize NET in the <I>Pink1-/-</I> model. Long&ndash;Evans <I>Pink1-/-</I> male rats were imaged by PET with [<sup>18</sup>F]NS12137 at 9 and 11&nbsp;months and compared with wild-type (WT) controls. An additional group of WT rats of both sexes were imaged with [<sup>18</sup>F]NS12137 PET after pretreatment with the specific and selective NET ligand nisoxetine. Binding in locus coeruleus (LC), thalamus (Thal), and prelimbic area (PrL), regions rich in NET, was analyzed by a two-tissue compartment reversible binding model using a cerebellar reference region. [<sup>18</sup>F]NS12137 binding exhibited moderate test&ndash;retest reproducibility in LC, Thal, and PrL. Nisoxetine blockade yielded substantial reductions of [<sup>18</sup>F]NS12137 binding in LC. Compared with WT controls, <I>Pink1-/-</I> rats exhibited reduced binding in Thal and PrL. Pharmacokinetic analysis of [<sup>18</sup>F]NS12137 PET provides a reproducible and specific measure of NET binding and indicates reduced NET in PD-related brain regions in <I>Pink1-/-</I> rats. Noninvasive in vivo [<sup>18</sup>F]NS12137 PET imaging is therefore a promising method for the study of potential therapies in the <I>Pink1-/-</I> rat.</p>

                <p>Chronic neuropathic pain is a persistent and debilitating outcome of traumatic central nervous system injury, affecting up to 80% of individuals. Postinjury pain is refractory to treatments due to the limited understanding of the brain&ndash;spinal cord circuits that underlie pain signal processing. The corticospinal tract (CST) plays critical roles in sensory modulation during skilled movements and tactile sensation; however, a direct role for the CST in injury-associated neuropathic pain is unclear. Here we show that complete, selective CST transection at the medullary pyramids leads to hyperexcitability within lumbar deep dorsal horn and hindlimb allodynia-like behavior in chronically injured adult male and female mice. Chemogenetic regulation of CST-targeted lumbar spinal interneurons demonstrates that dysregulation of activity in this circuit underlies the development of tactile allodynia in chronic injury. Our findings shed light on an unrecognized circuit mechanism implicated in CNS injury-induced neuropathic pain and provide a novel target for therapeutic intervention.</p>

                <p>Spinal interneurons shape motor neuron activity. Gata3<sup>+</sup> V2b neurons are a major inhibitory spinal population. These neurons are present at multiple spinal levels in mice, suggesting an important function in motor control. In zebrafish, our previous work showed that V2b neurons are evenly distributed along the spinal cord, where they act to slow down locomotion. However, the timing of V2b activity during locomotion, their postsynaptic targets other than motor neurons, and their recruitment across different behaviors remain unknown. In this study, we address these questions using larval zebrafish. First, via optogenetic mapping of output in the rostrocaudal axis, we demonstrate that V2b neurons robustly inhibit motor neurons and other major spinal populations, including V2a, V1, commissural neurons, and other V2b neurons. V2b inhibition is patterned along the rostrocaudal axis, providing long-range inhibition to motor and V2a neurons but more localized inhibition of V1 neurons. Next, by recording V2b activity during different visually and electrically evoked movements, we show that V2b neurons are specifically recruited for forward swims and turns, but not for fast escape movements. Furthermore, a subset of V2b neurons also exhibited short-latency sensory-evoked activity preceding motor initiation. Finally, we show that V2b inhibition occurs in phase with the leading edge of the motor burst, in contrast to V1 inhibition which occurs in phase with the falling edge of the motor burst. Taken together, these data show that in axial motor networks, V2b neurons act via multiple targets to produce in phase, leading inhibition during locomotion.</p>

                <p>Long-term memory (LTM) formation is negatively regulated by histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3), a transcriptional repressor. Emerging evidence suggests that posttranslational phosphorylation of HDAC3 at its serine 424 (S424) residue is critical for its deacetylase activity in transcription. However, it remains unknown if HDAC3 S424 phosphorylation regulates the ability of HDAC3 to modulate LTM formation. To examine the functionality of S424, we expressed an HDAC3-S424D phospho-mimic mutant (constitutively active form) or an HDAC3-S424A phospho-null mutant (phospho-dead form) in the dorsal hippocampus of mice. We assessed the functional consequence of these mutants on LTM formation and long-term potentiation (LTP) in young adult male mice. We also assessed whether the HDAC3-S424A mutant could ameliorate age-related deficits in LTM and LTP in aging male and female mice. Results demonstrate that young adult male mice expressing the HDAC3-S424D phospho-mimic mutant in the dorsal hippocampus exhibit significantly impaired LTM and LTP. In contrast, the HDAC3-S424A phospho-null mutant expressed in the hippocampus of young adult male mice enabled the transformation of subthreshold learning into robust LTM and enhanced LTP. Similarly, expression of the HDAC3-S424A mutant enabled LTM formation and enhanced LTP in aging male and aging female mice. Overall, these findings demonstrate that HDAC3 S424 is a pivotal residue that has the ability to bidirectionally regulate synaptic plasticity and LTM formation in the adult and aging brain.</p>

                <p>Evoked responses in the mouse primary visual cortex can be modulated by the temporal context in which visual inputs are presented. Oddball stimuli embedded in a sequence of regularly repeated visual elements have been shown to drive relatively large deviant responses, a finding that is generally consistent with the theory that cortical circuits implement a form of predictive coding. These results can be confounded by short-term adaptation effects, however, that make interpretation difficult. Here we use various forms of the oddball paradigm to disentangle temporal and ordinal components of the deviant response, showing that it is a complex phenomenon affected by temporal structure, ordinal expectation, and event frequency. Specifically, we use visually evoked potentials to show that deviant responses occur over a large range of time in male and female mice, cannot be explained by a simple adaptation model, scale with predictability, and are modulated by violations of both first- and second-order sequential expectations. We also show that visual sequences can lead to long-term plasticity in some circumstances.</p>

                <p>Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a chronic disease of the brain, and it currently continues at crisis proportions in the United States. Opioid physical withdrawal is a major driver of compulsive drug-taking behavior, triggering short-term relapse of opioid addiction. Early pharmacological evidence shows that midbrain periaqueductal gray (PAG) plays an important role in morphine withdrawal (MW). However, we still know few details about the underlying molecular mechanisms. Improving our understanding of such mechanisms will enable increasingly safe and effective treatments for patients with OUD. Here, MW was induced by the naloxone precipitation after chronic intraperitoneal administration of morphine for a period of 5&nbsp;d in Sprague Dawley male rats. MW increased phosphorylation of cAMP response element binding protein (pCREB, a primary marker of CREB functional activation), NMDA glutamate receptor 2B subunit (NR2B), and mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) within the ventrolateral PAG (vlPAG). Inhibition of pCREB, NR2B, or MCU within this brain region reduced the severity of MW. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay and luciferase report assay demonstrated that pCREB mediated the transcription of the <I>Grin2b</I> (glutamate ionotropic receptor NMDA type subunit 2B, encoding NR2B) and <I>Ccdc109a</I> (encoding MCU) genes. These findings describe the role of pCREB in <I>Grin2b</I> and <I>Ccdc109a</I> <I>gene</I> transcription levels in the vlPAG during MW. The study may provide a novel therapeutic approach for OUD.</p>

                <p>Juvenile zebra finches learn to sing by imitating conspecific songs of adults during a sensitive period early in life. Area X is a basal ganglia nucleus of the song control circuit specialized for song-related sensory&ndash;motor learning during song development. The structural plasticity and the molecular mechanisms regulating neuronal structure in Area X during song development and maturation are unclear. In this study, we examined the structure of spiny neurons, the main neuron type in Area X, at key stages of song development in male zebra finches. We report that dendritic arbor of spiny neurons expands during the sensitive period for song learning, and this initial growth is followed by pruning of dendrites and spines accompanied by changes in spine morphology as the song circuit matures. Previously, we showed that overexpression of miR-9 in Area X impairs song learning and performance and alters the expression of many genes that have important roles in neuronal structure and function (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B59">Shi et al., 2018</cross-ref>). As an extension of that study, we report here that overexpression of miR-9 in spiny neurons in juvenile zebra finches reduces dendritic arbor complexity and spine density in a developmental stage-specific manner. We also show that miR-9 regulates the structural maintenance of spiny neurons in adulthood. Together, these findings reveal dynamic microstructural changes in the song circuit during the sensitive period of song development and provide evidence that miR-9 regulates neuronal structure during song development and maintenance.</p>

                <p>Humans use multiple sensory systems to estimate body orientation in space. Sensory contributions change depending on context. A predominant concept for the underlying multisensory integration (MSI) is the linear summation of weighted inputs from individual sensory systems. Changes of sensory contributions are typically attributed to some mechanism explicitly adjusting weighting factors. We provide evidence for a conceptually different mechanism that performs a multisensory correction if the reference of a sensory input moves in space without the need to explicitly change sensory weights. The correction is based on a reconstruction of the sensory reference frame motion (RFM) and automatically corrects erroneous inputs, e.g., when looking at a moving train. The proposed RFM estimator contains a nonlinear dead zone that blocks corrections at slow velocities. We first demonstrate that this mechanism accounts for the apparent changes in sensory contributions. Second, using a balance control model, we show predictions of specific distortions in body sway responses to perturbations caused by this nonlinearity. Experiments measuring sway responses of 24 subjects (13 female, 11 male) to visual scene movements confirmed these predictions. The findings indicate that the central nervous system resolves sensory conflicts by an internal reconstruction of the cause of the conflict. Thus, the mechanism links the concept of causal inference to shifts in sensory contributions, providing a cohesive picture of the MSI for the estimation of body orientation in space.</p>

                <p>Endosomal system dysfunction within neurons is a prominent early feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. Multiple AD risk factors are regulators of endocytosis and known to cause hyperactivity of the early endosome small GTPase rab5, resulting in neuronal endosomal pathway disruption and cholinergic neurodegeneration. Adaptor protein containing Pleckstrin homology domain, Phosphotyrosine binding domain, Leucine zipper motif (APPL1), an important rab5 effector protein and signaling molecule has been shown in vitro to interface between endosomal and neuronal dysfunction through a rab5-activating interaction with the BACE1-generated C-terminal fragment of amyloid precursor protein (APP-&beta;CTF), a pathogenic APP fragment generated within endosomal compartments. To understand the contribution of APPL1 to AD-related endosomal dysfunction in vivo, we generated a transgenic mouse model overexpressing human APPL1 within neurons (Thy1-APPL1). Strongly supporting the important endosomal regulatory roles of APPL1 and their relevance to AD etiology, Thy1-APPL1 mice (both sexes) develop enlarged neuronal early endosomes and increased synaptic endocytosis due to increased rab5 activation. We demonstrated pathophysiological consequences of APPL1 overexpression, including functional changes in hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), degeneration of large projection cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain, and impaired hippocampal-dependent memory. Our evidence shows that neuronal APPL1 elevation modeling its functional increase in the AD brain induces a cascade of AD-related pathological effects within neurons, including early endosome anomalies, synaptic dysfunction, and selective neurodegeneration. Our in vivo model highlights the contributions of APPL1 to the pathobiology and neuronal consequences of early endosomal pathway disruption and its potential value as a therapeutic target.</p>

                <p>by Pan Li, Sangbo Lee, Kwang-Yeon Choi, Jonathan E. Rubin, Jae Kyoung Kim</p>

Seizure-induced cardiac arrhythmias, such as ictal (during seizure) or postictal (post-seizure) sinus arrhythmias, are potential triggers for sudden unexpected death in epilepsy. Traditionally, these arrhythmias have been attributed to changes in autonomic balance during ictal or postictal phases, as per the neurogenic mechanism. However, it remains unclear if these arrhythmias may involve intrinsic cardiogenic mechanisms. Furthermore, while circadian and sleep-wake patterns influence both neurogenic and cardiogenic mechanisms, a direct mechanistic link to seizure-induced arrhythmias remains to be established. In this study, we utilized a mathematical model of mouse sinoatrial nodal cell pacemaking and an autonomic clamping protocol, to dissect neurocardiogenic mechanisms in seizure-induced sinus arrhythmias and to test the hypothesis that circadian and sleep-wake rhythms directly modulate cellular susceptibility to these arrhythmias. Our simulations revealed that, in the context of altered autonomic levels associated with seizure progression, diverse seizure-induced sinoatrial nodal cell firing patterns during ictal or postictal phases can be triggered directly by intrinsic cardiac dynamics, without the need for dynamical changes in within-phase autonomic activities. This finding highlights the distinct roles of neurogenic and cardiogenic mechanisms in shaping sinoatrial nodal cell firing patterns, challenging the predominance of the neurogenic mechanism. This neurocardiogenic framework also successfully captures distinct circadian and vigilance state patterns of seizure-induced arrhythmias. Specifically, while daytime sleep predisposed sinoatrial nodal cells to postictal sinus arrhythmias, nighttime wakefulness promoted ictal sinus arrhythmias. However, these circadian patterns can be disrupted when sleep-wake cycles are decoupled from circadian rhythms, supporting the hypothesis that sleep-wake patterns can directly be a key determinant of seizure-induced sinus arrhythmias. Our findings may potentially facilitate the development of novel therapeutic strategies for managing the risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy.

Ubiquitination is critical in biomedical research. Predicting ubiquitination sites based on deep learning model have advanced the study of ubiquitination. However, traditional supervised model limits in the scenarios where labels are scarcity across species. To address this issue, we introduce EUP, an online webserver for ubiquitination prediction and model interpretation for multi-species. EUP is constructed by extracting lysine site-dependent features from pretrained language model ESM2. Then, utilizing conditional variational inference to reduce the ESM2 features to a lower-dimensional latent representation. By constructing downstream models built on this latent feature representation, EUP exhibited superior performance in predicting ubiquitination sites across species, while maintaining low inference latency. Furthermore, key features for predicting ubiquitination sites were identified across animals, plants, and microbes. The identification of shared key features that capture evolutionarily conserved traits enhances the interpretability of the EUP model for ubiquitination prediction. EUP is free and available at (https://eup.aibtit.com/).

The vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFRs) bind to cognate ligands to facilitate signaling pathways critical for angiogenesis, the growth of new capillaries from existing vasculature. Intracellular trafficking regulates the availability of receptors on the cell surface to bind ligands, which regulate activation, and the movement of activated receptors between the surface and intracellular pools, where they can initiate different signaling pathways. Using experimental data and computational modeling, we recently demonstrated and quantified the differential trafficking of three VEGF receptors, VEGFR1, VEGFR2, and coreceptor Neuropilin-1 (NRP1). Here, we expand that approach to quantify how the binding of different VEGF ligands alters the trafficking of these VEGF receptors and demonstrate the consequences of receptor localization and ligand binding on the localization and dynamics of signal initiation complexes. We include simulations of four different splice isoforms of VEGF-A and PLGF, each of which binds to different combinations of the VEGF receptors, and we use new experimental data for two of these ligands to parameterize and validate our model. We show that VEGFR2 trafficking is altered in response to ligand binding, but that trafficking of VEGFR1 is not; we also show that the altered trafficking can be explained by a single mechanistic process, increased internalization of the VEGFR2 receptor when bound to ligand; other processes are unaffected. We further show that even though the canonical view of receptor tyrosine kinases is of activation on the cell surface, most of the ligand-receptor complexes for both VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 are intracellular. We also explore the competition between the receptors for ligand binding, the so-called ‘decoy effect’, and show that while <i>in vitro</i> on the cell surface minimal such effect would be observed, inside the cell the effect can be substantial and may influence signaling. We term this location dependence the ‘reservoir effect’ as the size of the local ligand reservoir (large outside the cell, small inside the cell) plays an integral role in the receptor-receptor competition. These results expand our understanding of receptor-ligand trafficking dynamics and are critical for the design of therapeutic agents to regulate ligand availability to VEGFR1 and hence VEGF receptor signaling in angiogenesis.

Amino acid infusion (AAI) is a technique used in radiopharmaceutical therapy (RPT) to reduce toxicity in kidney and increase clearance rate of radiopharmaceuticals from body. In this study our aim is to evaluate its effect in personalized RPT considering kidney and salivary glands as dose limiting organs using a multiscale modeling framework. We developed a Physiologically-Based Pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model consisting of 19 compartments, personalized it for four prostate cancer patients using data derived from gamma camera imaging. This model was used to investigate the influence of AAI on the absorbed dose to tumors and organs at risk. We then computed the maximum safe injected activity based on the PBPK model. To address the effects of interstitial fluid pressure (IFP) and tumor heterogeneity, we coupled the PBPK model with convection-diffusion-reaction (CDR) equations. To compare the effectiveness of our modeling approaches, we calculated absorbed doses to the tumors with and without AAI, using both the standalone PBPK model and the coupled PBPK-CDR model. Our findings revealed a relative error (RE) of 9.6% ± 2.2% (mean ± SD) in total tumor absorbed dose calculation between PBPK and CDR equations, attributable to the consideration of IFP. Moreover, AAI proved beneficial for RPT when the kidney was designated as the organ-at-risk. It enabled an increase in radiopharmaceutical injection from 12.3 ± 6.32 MBq (mean ± SD) to 15.45 ± 6.95 MBq (RE: 28.5% ± 15.7%), resulting in a corresponding increase in tumor absorbed dose from 67.8 ± 47.45 Gy to 72.43 ± 51.03 Gy (RE: 8.6% ± 5.4%), while maintaining critical kidney absorbed dose limits. However, this was not observed when the salivary gland was considered the dose-limiting organ. Although, AAI allowed for increased therapeutic injection ranging from 4.22 ± 2.23 MBq to 5.25 ± 3.14 MBq (RE: 19.2% ± 9.9%), it results in a minimal increase in tumor absorbed dose of 0.22 ± 0.04 (RE: 1.4% ± 1.3%). Statistical analysis using the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test revealed significant effects of AAI on administered activity and tumor absorbed dose (p-value = 0.007 < 0.05). Finally, a local sensitivity analysis was performed on selected radiation and tumor transportation parameters individually to evaluate their impact on the tumor absorbed dose. In conclusion, selection of organ-at-risk in personalized RPT is critical, as it determines the injected activity amount and the efficacy of delivery-enhancing techniques.

The genomic RNAs of influenza A viruses (IAVs) are replicated in the nucleus of infected cells in the form of viral ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs) before being exported to the cytoplasm. The small GTPase RAB11A is involved in the transport of vRNPs to the sites of viral assembly at the plasma membrane, but the molecular mechanisms involved remain largely unknown. Here we show that IAV infection remodels the architecture of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) sheets, where vRNPs tend to accumulate in the absence of RAB11A. To decipher the interplay between RAB11A, vRNPs, and the ER, we investigated viral-induced perturbations of RAB11A proximity interactome. To this end, we generated cells stably expressing a TurboID-RAB11A fusion protein and performed biotin-based proximity labeling upon viral infection. We found that cellular regulators of phophatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI4P) homeostasis, including the autophagic and stress response protein ATG16L1, are significantly enriched at the vicinity of RAB11A in infected cells. Infection induces an increase in cellular PI4P levels in an ATG16L1-dependent manner, while ATG16L1 relocalizes to ER membranes upon infection. Depletion of ATG16L1 decreases the co-distribution of vRNPs with PI4P punctae on ER membranes, and reduces the accumulation of vRNPs at the plasma membrane as well as the production of IAV infectious particles. Our data extend to IAVs the notion that viruses can modulate the metabolism and localization of phosphoinositides to control host membrane dynamics and point to the ER as an essential platform for vRNP transport. They provide evidence for a pivotal role of ATG16L1 in regulating the identity of endomembranes and coordinating RAB11A and PI4P-enriched membranes to ensure delivery of vRNPs to the plasma membrane.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Overactivity of muscles is thought to be involved in postural abnormalities (PA) in Parkinson's disease (PD). Here, we investigated the relationship between muscle activity and postural parameters to explore the peripheral mechanisms of PA.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A total of 90 PD patients and 19 healthy controls were enrolled. Posture features (F1–F8) and the index for PA were collected. Surface electromyography was acquired from cervical and thoracolumbar muscles during lying, sitting, standing, and walking, respectively. Follow-up was completed for a subset of PD patients.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Root mean square (RMS) amplitudes of the sternocleidomastoid muscle (SCM) and external oblique muscle, were higher in PD patients with PA (PD_PA) than PD patients without PA (PD_NPA) and healthy controls during lying and standing. Extensor activity in PD_PA patients increased only in the antigravity position compared with PD_NPA patients. Spearman's correlation showed that RMS amplitude of SCM in the lying position was associated with index for PA and forward flexion angles including F3–F8, whereas RMS amplitude of the external oblique muscle in the lying position was correlated with F5 alone. Longitudinal analysis showed that changes in F3, F4, and index for PA were significantly correlated with changes in RMS amplitude of the SCM in the lying position. Additionally, PD_NPA patients with SCM overactivity had a significantly higher risk of progressing to PA than those with normal SCM activity.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The SCM and external oblique muscle are involved in forward trunk flexion in PD patients, while extensors may play a compensatory role. SCM may be the key muscle in PA for PD patients, participating in the pathogenesis of PA. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>
