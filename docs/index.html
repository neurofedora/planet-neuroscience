<p>A detailed structural analysis of the juvenile swine ventricular–subventricular zone reveals four distinct cellular layers and diverse neuroblast migration routes, including pathways toward the olfactory bulb and cortical regions. These features underscore the swine brain's value as a translational model for studying postnatal neurogenesis in large-brained, gyrencephalic mammals.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The ventricular–subventricular zone (V-SVZ), lining the lateral walls of the lateral ventricles, is a major neurogenic region in the adult brain of many mammals. This study investigates the structural organization and cellular composition of the V-SVZ in the juvenile swine brain (3–5 months), providing novel insights into neuroblast migration in gyrencephalic species. Using immunohistochemistry combined with transmission and scanning electron microscopy, we redefined the cytoarchitecture of the swine V-SVZ, identifying four distinct cellular layers. Layer 1 consists of a pseudostratified epithelium of glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive ependymal cells, whose cilia and microvilli extend into the ventricular lumen, frequently surrounding supraependymal axons. Beneath it, layer 2 is composed of astrocytic and radial glia processes and contains occasional clusters of doublecortin (DCX)-positive cells with prominent microtubules and elongated cytoplasm, indicative of a migratory phenotype. Layer 3 is further subdivided into a low-cell-density sublayer 3a, enriched with myelinated axons and scattered DCX<sup>+</sup> clusters, and a high-cell-density sublayer 3b, characterized by large groups of DCX<sup>+</sup> migratory cells. In sagittal sections, these cells form long chains oriented parallel to the ventricular surface. Neuroblasts emerging from the dorsal V-SVZ migrate caudorostrally through the rostral migratory stream toward the olfactory bulb. The layered organization of the swine V-SVZ resembles that of humans, where DCX<sup>+</sup> chains persist up to 18 months of age, positioning the swine as a valuable model for investigating postnatal plasticity and neurogenic potential in gyrencephalic brains. The persistence of immature neurons in the V-SVZ of gyrencephalic mammals, including infant humans, underscores the relevance of this region for neurogenesis and plasticity in large-brained species.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01411">Age Sensitive Hippocampal Functional Connectivity: New Insights from 3D CNNs and Saliency Mapping</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.01411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grey matter loss in the hippocampus is a hallmark of neurobiological aging, yet understanding the corresponding changes in its functional connectivity remains limited. Seed-based functional connectivity (FC) analysis enables voxel-wise mapping of the hippocampus's synchronous activity with cortical regions, offering a window into functional reorganization during aging. In this study, we develop an interpretable deep learning framework to predict brain age from hippocampal FC using a three-dimensional convolutional neural network (3D CNN) combined with LayerCAM saliency mapping. This approach maps key hippocampal-cortical connections, particularly with the precuneus, cuneus, posterior cingulate cortex, parahippocampal cortex, left superior parietal lobule, and right superior temporal sulcus, that are highly sensitive to age. Critically, disaggregating anterior and posterior hippocampal FC reveals distinct mapping aligned with their known functional specializations. These findings provide new insights into the functional mechanisms of hippocampal aging and demonstrate the power of explainable deep learning to uncover biologically meaningful patterns in neuroimaging data.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01433">Reduced Efficiency in the Right Fronto-Parietal Attentional Network During Distractor Suppression in Mild Cognitive Impairment</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.01433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is a critical transitional stage between normal cognitive aging and dementia, making its early detection essential. This study investigates the neural mechanisms of distractor suppression in MCI patients using EEG and behavioral data during an attention-cueing Eriksen flanker task. A cohort of 56 MCIs and 26 healthy controls (HCs) performed tasks with congruent and incongruent stimuli of varying saliency levels. During these tasks, EEG data were analyzed for alpha band coherence's functional connectivity, focusing on Global Efficiency (GE), while Reaction Time (RT) and Hit Rate (HR) were also collected.
  Our findings reveal significant interactions between congruency, saliency, and cognitive status on GE, RT, and HR. In HCs, congruent conditions resulted in higher GE (p = 0.0114, multivariate t-distribution correction, MVT), faster RTs (p < 0.0001, MVT), and higher HRs (p < 0.0001, MVT) compared to incongruent conditions. HCs also showed increased GE in salient conditions for incongruent trials (p = 0.0406, MVT). MCIs exhibited benefits from congruent conditions with shorter RTs and higher HRs (both p < 0.0001, MVT) compared to incongruent conditions but showed reduced adaptability in GE, with no significant GE differences between conditions.
  These results highlight the potential of alpha band coherence and GE as early markers for cognitive impairment. By integrating GE, RT, and HR, this study provides insights into the interplay between neural efficiency, processing speed, and task accuracy. This approach offers valuable insights into cognitive load management and interference effects, indicating benefits for interventions aimed at improving attentional control and processing speed in MCIs.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01098">Proof of a perfect platonic representation hypothesis</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.01098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note, we elaborate on and explain in detail the proof given by Ziyin et al. (2025) of the "perfect" Platonic Representation Hypothesis (PRH) for the embedded deep linear network model (EDLN). We show that if trained with SGD, two EDLNs with different widths and depths and trained on different data will become Perfectly Platonic, meaning that every possible pair of layers will learn the same representation up to a rotation. Because most of the global minima of the loss function are not Platonic, that SGD only finds the perfectly Platonic solution is rather extraordinary. The proof also suggests at least six ways the PRH can be broken. We also show that in the EDLN model, the emergence of the Platonic representations is due to the same reason as the emergence of progressive sharpening. This implies that these two seemingly unrelated phenomena in deep learning can, surprisingly, have a common cause. Overall, the theory and proof highlight the importance of understanding emergent "entropic forces" due to the irreversibility of SGD training and their role in representation learning. The goal of this note is to be instructive and avoid lengthy technical details.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01651">A Dynamical Cartography of the Epistemic Diffusion of Artificial Intelligence in Neuroscience</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.01651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neuroscience and AI have an intertwined history, largely relayed in the literature of both fields. In recent years, due to the engineering orientations of AI research and the monopoly of industry for its large-scale applications, the mutual expansion of neuroscience and AI in fundamental research seems challenged. In this paper, we bring some empirical evidences that, on the contrary, AI and neuroscience are continuing to grow together, but with a pronounced interest in the fields of study related to neurodegenerative diseases since the 1990s. With a temporal knowledge cartography of neuroscience drawn with advanced document embedding techniques, we draw the dynamical shaping of the discipline since the 1970s and identified the conceptual articulation of AI with this particular subfield mentioned before. However, a further analysis of the underlying citation network of the studied corpus shows that the produced AI technologies remain confined in the different subfields and are not transferred from one subfield to another. This invites us to discuss the genericity capability of AI in the context of an intradisciplinary development, especially in the diffusion of its associated metrology.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01946">Characterizing control between interacting subsystems with deep Jacobian estimation</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.01946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biological function arises through the dynamical interactions of multiple subsystems, including those between brain areas, within gene regulatory networks, and more. A common approach to understanding these systems is to model the dynamics of each subsystem and characterize communication between them. An alternative approach is through the lens of control theory: how the subsystems control one another. This approach involves inferring the directionality, strength, and contextual modulation of control between subsystems. However, methods for understanding subsystem control are typically linear and cannot adequately describe the rich contextual effects enabled by nonlinear complex systems. To bridge this gap, we devise a data-driven nonlinear control-theoretic framework to characterize subsystem interactions via the Jacobian of the dynamics. We address the challenge of learning Jacobians from time-series data by proposing the JacobianODE, a deep learning method that leverages properties of the Jacobian to directly estimate it for arbitrary dynamical systems from data alone. We show that JacobianODEs outperform existing Jacobian estimation methods on challenging systems, including high-dimensional chaos. Applying our approach to a multi-area recurrent neural network (RNN) trained on a working memory selection task, we show that the "sensory" area gains greater control over the "cognitive" area over learning. Furthermore, we leverage the JacobianODE to directly control the trained RNN, enabling precise manipulation of its behavior. Our work lays the foundation for a theoretically grounded and data-driven understanding of interactions among biological subsystems.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18439">Strong, but not weak, noise correlations are beneficial for population coding</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2406.18439v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural correlations play a critical role in sensory information coding. They are of two kinds: signal correlations, when neurons have overlapping sensitivities, and noise correlations from network effects and shared noise. In experiments from early sensory systems and cortex, many pairs of neurons typically show both types of correlations to be positive and large, especially between nearby neurons with similar stimulus sensitivity. However, theoretical arguments have suggested that stimulus and noise correlations should have opposite signs to improve coding, at odds with experimental observations. We analyze retinal recording in response to a large variety of stimuli, and show that, contrary to common belief, large noise correlations are beneficial for coding, even if aligned with signal correlations. To understand this result, we develop a theory of visual information coding by correlated neurons, which resolves that paradox. We show that noise correlations are always beneficial if they are strong enough, unless neurons are perfectly correlated by the stimulus. Finally, using neuronal recordings and modeling, we show that for high dimensional stimuli noise correlation benefits the encoding of fine-grained details of visual stimuli, at the expense of large-scale features, which are already well encoded.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13467">How Metacognitive Architectures Remember Their Own Thoughts: A Systematic Review</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2503.13467v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: Metacognition has gained significant attention for its potential to enhance autonomy and adaptability of artificial agents but remains a fragmented field: diverse theories, terminologies, and design choices have led to disjointed developments and limited comparability across systems. Existing overviews remain at a conceptual level that is undiscerning to the underlying algorithms, representations, and their respective success.
  Methods: We address this gap by performing an explorative systematic review. Reports were included if they described techniques enabling Computational Metacognitive Architectures (CMAs) to model, store, remember, and process their episodic metacognitive experiences, one of Flavell's (1979a) three foundational components of metacognition. Searches were conducted in 16 databases, consulted between December 2023 and June 2024. Data were extracted using a 20-item framework considering pertinent aspects.
  Results: A total of 101 reports on 35 distinct CMAs were included. Our findings show that metacognitive experiences may boost system performance and explainability, e.g., via self-repair. However, lack of standardization and limited evaluations may hinder progress: only 17% of CMAs were quantitatively evaluated regarding this review's focus, and significant terminological inconsistency limits cross-architecture synthesis. Systems also varied widely in memory content, data types, and employed algorithms.
  Discussion: Limitations include the non-iterative nature of the search query, heterogeneous data availability, and an under-representation of emergent, sub-symbolic CMAs. Future research should focus on standardization and evaluation, e.g., via community-driven challenges, and on transferring promising principles to emergent architectures.

Abstract: The organization and connectivity of the arcuate fasciculus (AF) in nonhuman primates remain contentious, especially concerning how its anatomy diverges from that of humans. Here, we combined cross-scale single-neuron tracing - using viral-based genetic labeling and fluorescence micro-optical sectioning tomography in macaques (n = 4; age 3 - 11 years) - with whole-brain tractography from 11.7T diffusion MRI. Complemented by spectral embedding analysis of 7.0T MRI in humans, we performed a comparative connectomic analysis of the AF across species. We demonstrate that the macaque AF originates in the temporal-parietal cortex, traverses the auditory cortex and parietal operculum, and projects into prefrontal regions. In contrast, the human AF exhibits greater expansion into the middle temporal gyrus and stronger prefrontal and parietal operculum connectivity - divergences quantified by Kullback-Leibler analysis that likely underpin the evolutionary specialization of human language networks. These interspecies differences - particularly the human AF's broader temporal integration and strengthened frontoparietal linkages - suggest a connectivity-based substrate for the emergence of advanced language processing unique to humans. Furthermore, our findings offer a neuroanatomical framework for understanding AF-related disorders such as aphasia and dyslexia, where aberrant connectivity disrupts language function.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01524">Diversity-Preserving Exploitation of Crossover</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.01524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crossover is a powerful mechanism for generating new solutions from a given population of solutions. Crossover comes with a discrepancy in itself: on the one hand, crossover usually works best if there is enough diversity in the population; on the other hand, exploiting the benefits of crossover reduces diversity. This antagonism often makes crossover reduce its own effectiveness.
  We introduce a new paradigm for utilizing crossover that reduces this antagonism, which we call diversity-preserving exploitation of crossover (DiPEC). The resulting Diversity Exploitation Genetic Algorithm (DEGA) is able to still exploit the benefits of crossover, but preserves a much higher diversity than conventional approaches.
  We demonstrate the benefits by proving that the (2+1)-DEGA finds the optimum of LeadingOnes with $O(n^{5/3}\log^{2/3} n)$ fitness evaluations. This is remarkable since standard genetic algorithms need $\Theta(n^2)$ evaluations, and among genetic algorithms only some artificial and specifically tailored algorithms were known to break this runtime barrier. We confirm the theoretical results by simulations. Finally, we show that the approach is not overfitted to Leadingones by testing it empirically on other benchmarks and showing that it is also competitive in other settings. We believe that our findings justify further systematic investigations of the DiPEC paradigm.

                arXiv:2507.01629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining the number of algorithm runs is a critical aspect of experimental design, as it directly influences the experiment's duration and the reliability of its outcomes. This paper introduces an empirical approach to estimating the required number of runs per problem instance for accurate estimation of the performance of the continuous single-objective stochastic optimization algorithm. The method leverages probability theory, incorporating a robustness check to identify significant imbalances in the data distribution relative to the mean, and dynamically adjusts the number of runs during execution as an online approach. The proposed methodology was extensively tested across two algorithm portfolios (104 Differential Evolution configurations and the Nevergrad portfolio) and the COCO benchmark suite, totaling 5748000 runs. The results demonstrate 82% - 95% accuracy in estimations across different algorithms, allowing a reduction of approximately 50% in the number of runs without compromising optimization outcomes. This online calculation of required runs not only improves benchmarking efficiency, but also contributes to energy reduction, fostering a more environmentally sustainable computing ecosystem.

Abstract: We present an analysis of landscape features for predicting the performance of multi-objective combinatorial optimization algorithms. We consider features from the recently proposed compressed Pareto Local Optimal Solutions Networks (C-PLOS-net) model of combinatorial landscapes. The benchmark instances are a set of rmnk-landscapes with 2 and 3 objectives and various levels of ruggedness and objective correlation. We consider the performance of three algorithms -- Pareto Local Search (PLS), Global Simple EMO Optimizer (GSEMO), and Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) - using the resolution and hypervolume metrics. Our tailored analysis reveals feature combinations that influence algorithm performance specific to certain landscapes. This study provides deeper insights into feature importance, tailored to specific rmnk-landscapes and algorithms.

Abstract: The field of numerical optimization has recently seen a surge in the development of "novel" metaheuristic algorithms, inspired by metaphors derived from natural or human-made processes, which have been widely criticized for obscuring meaningful innovations and failing to distinguish themselves from existing approaches. Aiming to address these concerns, we investigate the applicability of statistical tests for comparing algorithms based on their search behavior. We utilize the cross-match statistical test to compare multivariate distributions and assess the solutions produced by 114 algorithms from the MEALPY library. These findings are incorporated into an empirical analysis aiming to identify algorithms with similar search behaviors.

                arXiv:2507.01052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study we introduce a novel energy functional for long-sequence memory, building upon the framework of dense Hopfield networks which achieves exponential storage capacity through higher-order interactions. Building upon earlier work on long-sequence Hopfield memory models, we propose a temporal kernal $K(m, k)$ to incorporate temporal dependencies, enabling efficient sequential retrieval of patterns over extended sequences. We demonstrate the successful application of this technique for the storage and sequential retrieval of movies frames which are well suited for this because of the high dimensional vectors that make up each frame creating enough variation between even sequential frames in the high dimensional space. The technique has applications in modern transformer architectures, including efficient long-sequence modeling, memory augmentation, improved attention with temporal bias, and enhanced handling of long-term dependencies in time-series data. Our model offers a promising approach to address the limitations of transformers in long-context tasks, with potential implications for natural language processing, forecasting, and beyond.

                arXiv:2402.11322v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Embedded AI systems are expected to incur low power/energy consumption for solving machine learning tasks, as these systems are usually power constrained (e.g., object recognition task in autonomous mobile agents with portable batteries). These requirements can be fulfilled by Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), since their bio-inspired spike-based operations offer high accuracy and ultra low-power/energy computation. Currently, most of SNN architectures are derived from Artificial Neural Networks whose neurons' architectures and operations are different from SNNs, and/or developed without considering memory budgets from the underlying processing hardware of embedded platforms. These limitations hinder SNNs from reaching their full potential in accuracy and efficiency. Toward this, we propose SpikeNAS, a novel fast memory-aware neural architecture search (NAS) framework for SNNs that quickly finds an appropriate SNN architecture with high accuracy under the given memory budgets from targeted embedded systems. To do this, our SpikeNAS employs several key steps: analyzing the impacts of network operations on the accuracy, enhancing the network architecture to improve the learning quality, developing a fast memory-aware search algorithm, and performing quantization. The experimental results show that our SpikeNAS improves the searching time and maintains high accuracy compared to state-of-the-art while meeting the given memory budgets (e.g., 29x, 117x, and 3.7x faster search for CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and TinyImageNet200 respectively, using an Nvidia RTX A6000 GPU machine), thereby quickly providing the appropriate SNN architecture for the memory-constrained embedded AI systems.

                arXiv:2505.21717v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present LrcSSM, a $\textit{nonlinear}$ recurrent model that processes long sequences as fast as today's linear state-space layers. By forcing the state-transition matrix to be diagonal and learned at every step, the full sequence can be solved in parallel with a single prefix-scan, giving $\mathcal{O}(TD)$ time and memory and only $\mathcal{O}(\log T)$ sequential depth, for input-sequence length $T$ and a state dimension $D$. Moreover, LrcSSM offers a formal gradient-stability guarantee that other input-varying systems such as Liquid-S4 and Mamba do not provide. Lastly, for network depth $L$, as the forward and backward passes cost $\Theta(T\,D\,L)$ FLOPs, with its low sequential depth and parameter count $\Theta(D\,L)$, the model follows the compute-optimal scaling law regime ($\beta \approx 0.42$) recently observed for Mamba, outperforming quadratic-attention Transformers at equal compute while avoiding the memory overhead of FFT-based long convolutions. We show that on a series of long-range forecasting tasks, LrcSSM outperforms LRU, S5 and Mamba.

                arXiv:2506.03602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rule representations significantly influence the search capabilities and decision boundaries within the search space of Learning Classifier Systems (LCSs), a family of rule-based machine learning systems that evolve interpretable models through evolutionary processes. However, it is very difficult to choose an appropriate rule representation for each problem. Additionally, some problems benefit from using different representations for different subspaces within the input space. Thus, an adaptive mechanism is needed to choose an appropriate rule representation for each rule in LCSs. This article introduces a flexible rule representation using a four-parameter beta distribution and integrates it into a fuzzy-style LCS. The four-parameter beta distribution can form various function shapes, and this flexibility enables our LCS to automatically select appropriate representations for different subspaces. Our rule representation can represent crisp/fuzzy decision boundaries in various boundary shapes, such as rectangles and bells, by controlling four parameters, compared to the standard representations such as trapezoidal ones. Leveraging this flexibility, our LCS is designed to adapt the appropriate rule representation for each subspace. Moreover, our LCS incorporates a generalization bias favoring crisp rules where feasible, enhancing model interpretability without compromising accuracy. Experimental results on real-world classification tasks show that our LCS achieves significantly superior test accuracy and produces more compact rule sets. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/YNU-NakataLab/Beta4-UCS.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Nonhuman primates, particularly rhesus macaques, have served as crucial animal models for investigating complex brain functions. While previous studies have explored neural activity features in macaques, the gyro-sulcal functional dissociation characteristics are largely unknown. In this study, we employ a deep learning model named one-dimensional convolutional neural network to differentiate resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging signals between gyri and sulci in macaque brains, and further investigate the frequency-specific dissociations between gyri and sulci inferred from the power spectral density of resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging. Experimental results based on a large cohort of 440 macaques from two independent sites demonstrate substantial frequency-specific dissociation between gyral and sulcal signals at both whole-brain and regional levels. The magnitude of gyral power spectral density is significantly larger than that of sulcal power spectral density within the range of 0.01 to 0.1 Hz, suggesting that gyri and sulci may play distinct roles as the global hubs and local processing units for functional activity transmission and interaction in macaque brains. In conclusion, our study has established one of the first power spectrum maps of gyro-sulcal functional activity dissociation in macaque brains, providing a novel perspective for systematically exploring the neural mechanism of functional dissociation in mammalian brains.</span>

However, its underlying neural mechanisms remain unclear. Using a novel shyness-induction paradigm and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we investigated brain activation and connectivity patterns associated with state shyness in 41 healthy adults (25 females; M<sub>age</sub> = 21.41 ± 2.56). State shyness elicited increased activity in social processing regions, including the bilateral superior temporal, left middle temporal, and medial superior frontal regions. On the network level state shyness decreased connectivity within a regulatory frontal network encompassing dorsomedial prefrontal, anterior cingulate, superior, and inferior frontal systems. No effect on amygdala activation or connectivity was observed. These findings highlight distinct neural correlates of state shyness, emphasizing its reliance on prefrontal and temporal regions for immediate emotion regulation and social cognitive control. Moreover, the results differentiate state shyness from trait shyness, with the latter more closely linked to sustained interactions between the prefrontal cortex and limbic system, especially the amygdala. By elucidating the neural underpinnings of state shyness, this study contributes to a deeper understanding of the situational and transient nature of shy responses in dynamic social contexts.</span>

However, the mediating role of this affective component in declining TP in MCI and the influence of structural brain alterations on reduced TP via affect warrant further investigation. We conducted multiple mediation analyses to assess whether differences in TP between MCI and normal healthy controls (NHCs) were mediated by affect, motivation, executive function, and social cognition. Whole-brain mediation analyses identified neural substrates and moderated mediation analyses examined whether structural brain changes influenced TP via affect differently between the two groups. Our results revealed a significant mediating effect of affect on the group difference in TP. Atrophy within the thalamus and anterior insula (AI) in the MCI group was found to contribute to their diminished TP. Furthermore, moderated mediation analysis showed that the influence of the thalamus and AI on TP was mediated by affect within the MCI group but not NHCs.

                <p>The altered function of peripheral sensory neurons is an emerging mechanism for symptoms of autism spectrum disorders. Visual sensitivities are common in autism, but whether differences in the retina might underlie these sensitivities is not well understood. This includes fragile X syndrome (FXS), which is the most common syndromic cause of autism. We explored retinal function in the <I>Fmr1</I> knock-out mouse model of FXS. We focused on a specific type of retinal neuron homologous with primate ganglion cells, the "sustained On alpha" retinal ganglion cell, which plays roles in contrast sensing and binocular vision in mice. We found that these cells exhibit changes in dendritic structure and dampened responses to light in male <I>Fmr1</I> knock-out mice. We show that decreased light sensitivity is due to increased inhibitory input and reduced E&ndash;I balance. The change in E&ndash;I balance supports the maintenance of circuit excitability similar to what has been observed in the cortex. However, this maintenance also reshapes the tuning of this retinal ganglion cell type. These results show that loss of <I>Fmr1</I> in the mouse retina affects the sensory function of one retinal neuron type. As other retinal cell types also express Fmr1, FXS may affect the tuning of retinal cells more broadly. Our findings suggest that the retina may be relevant for understanding visual function in FXS.</p>

                <p>Cocaine is an addictive psychostimulant, and the risk of developing cocaine use disorder (CUD) is highly heritable. Little is known about the specific genes and mechanisms that lead to the development of CUD, and there are currently no FDA-approved pharmacotherapies that can treat it. <I>Drosophila</I> has proven an effective model organism to identify genes and mechanisms underlying addiction, especially alcohol use disorder. While flies exposed to cocaine display features of acute intoxication like those observed in mammals, including hyperactivity and reduced sleep, to date, there is no model of preferential cocaine self-administration in flies. Here, we assayed cocaine consumption in <I>Drosophila</I> males, as well as preference in a two-choice paradigm. We also investigated mechanisms involved in cocaine taste sensing using genetic and imaging tools. We show that cocaine is innately aversive to flies and that this avoidance depends on bitter sensing. Gustatory sensory neurons expressing the Gr66a bitter receptor are activated upon exposure to cocaine. Silencing of these bitter-sensing neurons or mutation of <I>Gr66a</I> reduces cocaine avoidance. In a longitudinal choice assay, these flies develop preference for cocaine-containing solutions within 12&ndash;18&nbsp;h, whereas control flies do not. Our findings show that bitter sensation protects flies from developing cocaine self-administration preference. Conversely, silencing bitter perception enables us to use <I>Drosophila</I> as a model for experience-dependent cocaine self-administration preference. This opens the door to testing human variants associated with CUD for their causative role in cocaine self-administration in this highly tractable model organism.</p>

                <p>Ventral tegmental area (VTA) glutamatergic neurons participate in reward, aversion, drug-seeking, and stress. Subsets of these neurons cotransmit glutamate and GABA (VGluT2<sup>+</sup>VGaT<sup>+</sup> neurons), transmit glutamate without GABA (VGluT2<sup>+</sup>VGaT<sup>&ndash;</sup> neurons), or cotransmit glutamate and dopamine (VGluT2<sup>+</sup>TH<sup>+</sup> neurons), but whether these molecularly distinct subpopulations show behavior-related differences is not wholly understood. We identified in male and female mice that VGluT2<sup>+</sup> subpopulations are sensitive to the reward value in unique ways. VGluT2<sup>+</sup>VGaT<sup>+</sup> neurons increased maximum activity with increased sucrose concentration, whereas VGluT2<sup>+</sup>VGaT<sup>&ndash;</sup> neurons increased maximum and sustained activity with increased sucrose concentration, and VGluT2<sup>+</sup>TH<sup>+</sup> neurons increased sustained but not maximum activity with increased sucrose concentration. VGluT2<sup>+</sup> subpopulations also uniquely signaled consumption of sweet/noncaloric (saccharine) and nonsweet/high-calorie rewards (fat). VGluT2<sup>+</sup>VGaT<sup>+</sup> neurons uniquely signaled lower-calorie sucrose over fat, whereas both VGluT2<sup>+</sup>VGaT<sup>&ndash;</sup> neurons and VGluT2<sup>+</sup>TH<sup>+</sup> neurons showed a signaling preference for higher-calorie fat over sucrose but in temporally distinct ways. Further experiments suggested that VGluT2<sup>+</sup>VGaT<sup>+</sup> consummatory reward-related activity was related to sweetness, partially modulated by prefeeding, and not dependent on caloric content. Additionally, aversive stimuli increased activity for each VGluT2<sup>+</sup> subpopulation, but VGluT2<sup>+</sup>VGaT<sup>+</sup> neurons uniquely scaled their magnitude and sustained activity with footshock intensity. Optogenetic activation of VGluT2<sup>+</sup>VGaT<sup>+</sup> neurons during low-intensity footshock enhanced fear-related behavior without inducing place preference or aversion. About half of VGluT2<sup>+</sup>VGaT<sup>+</sup> sucrose-sensitive neurons were transcriptionally activated by footshock. We interpret these data such that VTA glutamatergic subpopulations signal different elements of rewarding and aversive experiences and highlight the unique role of VTA VGluT2<sup>+</sup>VGaT<sup>+</sup> neurons in salience signaling. </p>

                <p>Early dorsal telencephalon development is coordinated by an interplay of transcription factors that exhibit a graded expression pattern in neural progenitors. How they function together to orchestrate cortical development remains largely unknown. The <I>Emx2</I> and <I>Dmrta2</I> genes encode transcription factors that are expressed in a similar caudomedial<sup>high</sup>/rostrolateral<sup>low</sup> gradient in the ventricular zone of the developing dorsal telencephalon with, in the medial pallium, <I>Dmrta2</I> but not <I>Emx2</I> expressed in the developing choroid plexus (ChP). Their constitutive loss has been shown to impart similar cortical abnormalities, and their combined deletion exacerbates the phenotypes, suggesting possible cooperation during cortex development. In this study, using embryos of both sexes, we utilized molecular and genetic approaches to dissect how Emx2 functions with Dmrta2 during mouse cortical development. Our results show that while they regulate a similar set of genes, their common direct targets are limited but include key regulators of cortical development. The identification of the interaction partners of Emx2 suggests that it coordinates with the LIM domain-binding protein Ldb1 to execute the activation and repression of some of its downstream targets. Finally, while <I>Emx2</I> is known to suppress ChP development, we also provide evidence that <I>Dmrta2</I> is, in contrast, required for ChP since in its absence in medial telencephalic progenitors, mice develop hydrocephalus postnatally, a phenotype that appears to be due to a compromised cytoarchitecture. Together, these data indicate that Emx2 and Dmrta2 have similar but also distinct functions in telencephalon development and provide the first insights into Emx2 mechanism of action.</p>

                <p>Aberrant signaling within cortical inhibitory microcircuits has been identified as a common signature of neuropsychiatric disorders. Interneuron (IN) activity is precisely regulated by neuromodulatory systems that evoke widespread changes in synaptic transmission and principal cell output. Cortical interneurons express high levels of opioid receptors, positioning opioid signaling as a critical regulator of inhibitory transmission; however, we lack a complete understanding of how classical opioid receptor systems regulate prefrontal cortex (PFC) microcircuitry. Here, we combine whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology, optogenetics, and viral tools to provide an extensive characterization of how the Mu opioid receptor (MOR), Delta opioid receptor (DOR), and Kappa opioid receptor (KOR) regulate inhibitory transmission in male and female mice. We show that across these receptor systems, DOR activation is more effective at suppressing spontaneous inhibitory transmission in layer 2/3 of the prelimbic PFC, while MOR causes a greater acute suppression of electrically evoked GABA release, and KOR plays a minor role in inhibitory transmission. Cell type-specific optogenetics revealed that MOR and DOR differentially regulate inhibitory transmission from parvalbumin, somatostatin, cholecystokinin, and vasoactive intestinal peptide-expressing INs. Finally, we demonstrate that DOR regulates inhibitory transmission through simultaneous pre- and postsynaptic modifications to IN physiology, whereas MOR function varies between somato-dendritic or presynaptic signaling depending on cell type.</p>

                <p>Although domestic dogs were the first domesticated species, the nature of dog domestication remains a topic of ongoing debate. In particular, brain and behavior changes associated with different stages of the domestication process have been difficult to disambiguate. Most modern Western breed dogs possess highly derived physical and behavioral traits because of intense artificial selection for appearance and function within the past 200&nbsp;years. In contrast, premodern dogs, including primitive/ancient breeds, village dogs, and New Guinea Singing Dogs, have undergone less intensive artificial selection and retain more ancestral characteristics. Consequently, comparisons between modern and premodern dogs can shed light on brain and behavior changes that have occurred recently in the domestication process. Here, we addressed this question using a voxel-based morphometry analysis of structural MRI images from 72 modern breed dogs and 13 premodern dogs (32 females). Modern breed dogs show widespread expansions of neocortex and reductions in the amygdala and other subcortical regions. Furthermore, cortical measurements significantly predicted individual variation in trainability, while amygdala measurements significantly predicted fear scores. These results contrast with the long-standing view that domestication consistently involves reduction in brain size and cognitive capacity. Rather, our results suggest that recent artificial selection has targeted higher-order brain regions in modern breed dogs, perhaps to facilitate behavioral flexibility and close interaction and cooperation with humans.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/27/e2084242025?rss=1">Neurophysiological Evidence of Sensory Prediction Errors Driving Speech Sensorimotor Adaptation</a></h4>

              
                <p>The human sensorimotor system has a remarkable ability to learn movements from sensory experience. A prominent example is sensorimotor adaptation, learning that characterizes the sensorimotor system's response to persistent sensory errors by adjusting future movements to compensate for those errors. A component of sensorimotor adaptation is implicit (i.e., the learner is unaware of the learning) which has been suggested to result from sensory prediction errors&mdash;discrepancies between predicted sensory consequences of motor commands and actual sensory feedback. However, neurophysiological evidence that sensory prediction errors drive adaptation has never been directly demonstrated. Here, we examined prediction errors via magnetoencephalography imaging of the auditory cortex during sensorimotor adaptation of speech to altered auditory feedback, an entirely implicit adaptation task. Specifically, we measured how speaking-induced suppression (SIS)&mdash;a neural representation of auditory prediction errors&mdash;changed over the trials of the adaptation experiment. In both male and female speakers, reduction in SIS (reflecting larger prediction errors) during the early learning phase compared with the initial unaltered feedback phase positively correlated with behavioral adaptation extents, suggesting larger prediction errors were associated with more learning. In contrast, such a reduction in SIS was not found in a control experiment in which participants heard unaltered feedback and thus did not adapt. In addition, in some participants who reached a plateau in the late learning phase, SIS increased, demonstrating that prediction errors were minimal when there was no further adaptation. Together, these findings provide the first direct neurophysiological evidence for the hypothesis that prediction errors drive sensorimotor adaptation.</p>

                <p>Stress profoundly affects sleep and memory processes. Stress impairs memory consolidation and, similarly, disruptions in sleep compromise memory functions. Yet, the neural circuits underlying stress-induced sleep and memory disturbances are still not fully understood. Here, we show that activation of corticotropin-releasing hormone neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (CRH<sup>PVN</sup>), similar to acute restraint stress, decreases sleep and impairs memory in a spatial object recognition task in male mice. Conversely, inhibiting CRH<sup>PVN</sup> neurons during stress reduces stress-induced memory deficits while slightly increasing the amount of sleep. We found that both stress and stimulation of CRH<sup>PVN</sup> neurons activate neurons in the lateral hypothalamus (LH) and that CRH<sup>PVN</sup> projections to the LH regulate stress-induced memory deficits and sleep disruptions. Our results suggest that CRH<sup>PVN</sup> neuronal pathways regulate the adverse effects of stress on memory and sleep&mdash;an important step toward improving sleep and ameliorating cognitive deficits associated with stress-related disorders.</p>

                <p>Autapses are self-synapses formed by a single neuron. They selectively form in a subpopulation of neocortical glutamatergic pyramidal cells (PCs) where autaptic transmission provides strong feedback regulation of self-activity in individual neurons. PCs in the hippocampal formation (HPF) possess morphological and electrophysiological characteristics similar to neocortical PCs; it remains unclear, however, whether they form functional autapses. We performed whole-cell recording from HPF PCs in acute slices obtained from mice of either sex and found surprisingly that none of the recorded PCs in CA1&ndash;3 show autaptic responses; only a subpopulation of PCs (~50%) in the subiculum forms functional autapses, particularly those targeting to the nucleus accumbens. Further experiments reveal that the autaptic responses in subicular PCs are mediated solely by AMPA receptors but not NMDA receptors and occur much earlier than those of the medial prefrontal cortex during early development. Together, the results indicate that functional autapses selectively form in a considerable subset of subicular PCs but are completely absent from PCs in the hippocampus proper, suggesting a key role of autapses in regulating the self-activity of subicular PCs and thus the main output signals of the hippocampus.</p>

                <p>by Albert J. Qü, Lung-Hao Tai, Christopher D. Hall, Emilie M. Tu, Maria K. Eckstein, Karyna Mishchanchuk, Wan Chen Lin, Juliana B. Chase, Andrew F. MacAskill, Anne G. E. Collins, Samuel J. Gershman, Linda Wilbrecht</p>

Dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens has been hypothesized to signal the difference between observed and predicted reward, known as reward prediction error, suggesting a biological implementation for reinforcement learning. Rigorous tests of this hypothesis require assumptions about how the brain maps sensory signals to reward predictions, yet this mapping is still poorly understood. In particular, the mapping is non-trivial when sensory signals provide ambiguous information about the hidden state of the environment. Previous work using classical conditioning tasks has suggested that reward predictions are generated conditional on probabilistic beliefs about the hidden state, such that dopamine implicitly reflects these beliefs. Here we test this hypothesis in the context of an instrumental task (a two-armed bandit), where the hidden state switches stochastically. We measured choice behavior and recorded dLight signals that reflect dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens core. Model comparison among a wide set of cognitive models based on the behavioral data favored models that used Bayesian updating of probabilistic beliefs. These same models also quantitatively matched mesolimbic dLight measurements better than non-Bayesian alternatives. We conclude that probabilistic belief computation contributes to instrumental task performance in mice and is reflected in mesolimbic dopamine signaling.

                <p>by Seth R. Berke, Kanika Kanchan, Mary L. Marazita, Eric Tobin, Ingo Ruczinski</p>

As the biomedical data ecosystem increasingly embraces the findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) data principles to publish multimodal datasets to the cloud, opportunities for cloud-based research continue to expand. Besides the potential for accelerated and diverse biomedical discovery that comes from a harmonized data ecosystem, the cloud also presents a shift away from the standard practice of duplicating data to computational clusters or local computers for analysis. However, despite these benefits, researcher migration to the cloud has lagged, in part due to insufficient educational resources to train biomedical scientists on cloud infrastructure. There exists a conceptual lack especially around the crafting of custom analytic pipelines that require software not pre-installed by cloud analysis platforms. We here present three fundamental concepts necessary for custom pipeline creation in the cloud. These overarching concepts are workflow and cloud provider agnostic, extending the utility of this education to serve as a foundation for any computational analysis running any dataset in any biomedical cloud platform. We illustrate these concepts using one of our own custom analyses, a study using the case-parent trio design to detect sex-specific genetic effects on orofacial cleft (OFC) risk, which we crafted in the biomedical cloud analysis platform CAVATICA.

                <p>by Probir Kumar Ghosh, Md. Aminul Islam, Md. Ahshanul Haque, Md. Tariqujjaman, Novel Chandra Das, Mohammad Ali, Md. Rasel Uddin, Md. Golam Dostogir Harun</p>
Background <p>Hypertension poses a significant public health challenge in low- and middle-income countries. In Bangladesh, the Health Population and Nutrition Sector Development Program has shown effectiveness in resource-limited settings. Estimating causal relationships on hypertension while adjusting for nonlinear observed confounders in adult population is complex. This study aims to identify predictors of hypertension, and explore observational causal inference on hypertension.</p> Methods <p>The hypertension data was analyzed using Bangladesh Demographic and Health surveys data from the 2011 and 2022. We used 11,815 individuals aged 34 years and above. Hypertension was defined as a systolic blood pressure of > 140 mm Hg and/or a diastolic blood pressure of > 90 mm Hg and/or having a history of hypertension. We used logistic regression, Random forest model, Double Machine Learning (DML), and Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) based on a pre-defined causal structure.</p> Results <p>The dataset included 11,815 individuals, and the prevalence of hypertension was 38.40%. The average age of individuals was 52.76 years (SD: 12.97), and 6826 (58.77%) were male. The Random forest model achieved 93% accuracy, with evaluation f1-scores of 95% for non-hypertension and 91% for hypertension, and identified older age, female gender, urban residency, workers, wealthier, self-awareness, and excessive body weight as key predictors of hypertension. The individual conditional expectation and SHAP plots reveal that age, and body mass index (BMI) are nonlinear relation with hypertension. The crude OR between excessive body weight and hypertension was 2.24 (95%CI: 2.07 – 2.42). Adjusted for age, sex, socioeconomic status (SES), and self-awareness, the OR was 1.97 (95%CI: 1.79 – 2.17), and using de-biased method, it was 1.30 (95%CI: 1.17 – 1.43).</p> Conclusion <p>The study highlights important predictors of hypertension, including age, sex, residency, and socioeconomic status (SES), self-awareness and body weight. The machine learning model achieved an accuracy of 93% in predicting hypertension. The de-biased methods provided a more refined risk estimate. Age and excessive body weight were found to significantly contributed to hypertension, demonstrating complex interactions and varying marginal effects across different levels of these factors. Awareness programs and targeted interventions are vital to effectively reduce excessive body weight and prevent hypertension.</p>

                Background Recently, prosthodontic utilization of zirconia-based materials has increased. There is insufficient research on the impact of MDP primers on zirconia bonding. This research was conceptualized to understand the impact of various surface preparation techniques, utilizing different abrasive powders and MDP primers, on the adhesive strength offered by zirconia copings. Methods Discs composed of 3Y-TZP zirconia measuring 18 mm in diameter and 4 mm in thickness were fabricated by milling fully sintered zirconia blanks that had been isostatically pressed. The samples were then classified into three categories. Group A, MDP primer; Group B, sandblasting with aluminum oxide; Group C, MDP priming and sandblasting with aluminum oxide. Scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, shear bond strength tests, and mode of failure analyses were performed. Results Thirty samples were analyzed. The shear bond strength test results showed that Group A had an average score of 8.62 ± 3.18 Group B had a lower value of 5.50 ± 1.78, and Group C had the highest value of 16.05 ± 8.91. The mode of failure among the three groups was found to have no statistically significant changes. Conclusion The application of MDP primers after air abrasion markedly enhanced the shear bond strength and surface roughness of zirconia, as opposed to the effects of each isolated method.

                Background University dropout among indigenous students is a multifactorial phenomenon that significantly impacts education and equity. This systematic review aimed to consolidate global evidence on risk and protective factors associated with university dropout among indigenous populations. Methods A systematic review was conducted following PRISMA 2020 criteria, encompassing ten databases (Web of Science, Scopus, LILACS, Dialnet, PubMed/MEDLINE, Redalyc, Scielo, DOAJ, Latindex, and CLASE) from October 29, 2024, to November 30, 2024. Out of 23,403 initial records, 21 studies met the inclusion criteria, analyzing indigenous university students and their educational trajectories. Two independent reviewers conducted the study selection and data extraction, ensuring minimized bias. Variables included demographic characteristics, geographic context, academic field, dropout rates, and related factors. Results were synthesized through descriptive analysis, focusing on quantitative data. Results Among the 226,049 participants across 21 studies, only 2,340 (1.03%) were indigenous university students, predominantly from South America (9/21 studies). The average dropout rate was 33.59%, ranging from 20% to 66%, with the highest rates reported among female students in six studies (28.57%). However, three studies highlighted higher dropout rates among male students (14.29%). Economic barriers were the primary risk factor (85.7%), followed by linguistic challenges (47.6%) and geographic limitations (33.3%). Protective factors included financial support (76.2%), academic mentorship (47.6%), and social support (42.8%). Public universities accounted for most participants (17/21 studies), with limited representation from private institutions. Despite significant dropout rates, only seven studies provided detailed prevalence data. Conclusion This review highlights systemic inequities contributing to indigenous university dropout, emphasizing economic, linguistic, and geographic barriers. While financial support and mentorship are effective interventions, their implementation remains inconsistent. Addressing these disparities through targeted policies, culturally inclusive curricula, and equitable resource distribution is essential to reducing dropout rates and fostering academic retention among indigenous students.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-640/v1?src=rss">Case Report: Case report: Catheter rupture and migration into the pulmonary artery: A surgical intervention following failed percutaneous retrieval [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Port catheters are commonly used in oncology for chemotherapy, but they can sometimes rupture and migrate, leading to serious complications. Early detection and management are crucial, and surgical intervention may be required when less invasive approaches fail. This report highlights these rare but significant complications. A 57-year-old male, with no significant medical history, underwent surgery for sigmoid colon adenocarcinoma and planned chemotherapy. His port catheter became nonfunctional, and on presentation, he was hemodynamically stable with normal vital signs. Chest radiography revealed catheter rupture, and thoracic angio-CT confirmed the fragment’s migration into the left pulmonary artery. After a failed percutaneous attempt, emergency surgery was performed via median sternotomy, successfully retrieving the catheter fragment. Catheter rupture and migration are rare complications, with an incidence of less than 1%. The clinical presentation can vary from asymptomatic to severe, requiring a high index of suspicion. Imaging, including chest radiography and thoracic angio-CT, is essential for accurate diagnosis and treatment planning. Management options include percutaneous retrieval, but surgery may be necessary when complications arise, as in this case. Preventive strategies, such as proper insertion and regular surveillance, are key in minimizing risks. Catheter rupture with migration is a life-threatening complication that requires urgent diagnosis and intervention. This case underscores the importance of vigilance in monitoring oncology patients with implantable devices and emphasizes the critical role of surgical intervention when less invasive approaches fail.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1504/v2?src=rss">The first mitochondrial genome of Haemagogus equinus from Jamaica [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                In the Americas, the expansion in incidence of arboviral infections including Mayaro virus (MAYV) has drawn attention to the resurgence of viruses associated with understudied arthropods. Mosquitoes belonging to the genus Haemagogus are generally geographically restricted to the forests of Central and South America and the Caribbean and are the known sylvan vectors for yellow fever virus and emerging MAYV. With an established population in Jamaica, Haemagogus equinus has been reported to be well-adapted to oviposition in artificial containers close to human populations. Its role in arboviral transmission however is not fully understood. Given the dearth of genetic information and the difficulty in morphologically identifying cryptic features in species belonging to this genus, we report the first mitochondrial genome of Hg. equinus. Using a genome skimming approach, two Hg. equinus mosquito specimens were sequenced using the Illumina Novaseq 6000 platform. A representative mitogenome of 16,471 bp, 80.7% AT and 37 genes was assembled using NOVOplasty. Phylogenetic analysis placed Hg. equinus in the Albomaculatus section of the Haemagogus subgenus supporting previously described taxonomic studies.

                Until recently, few genetic risk factors had been identified for the distinct pathological subtypes of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) with TDP-43 aggregation (FTLD-TDP). In a recent study, Pottier and colleagues addressed this gap by identifying common and rare genetic variants associated with FTLD-TDP subtypes, providing novel insights into the underlying mechanisms and heterogeneity of FTLD-TDP.

They found that the PAX3::FOXO1 oncoprotein functions as a pioneer transcription factor in vivo and directly activates neural transcriptional programs associated with the human disease, representing a potential early step of tumorigenesis.

                Li et al. find that OASL is a key ISG in mediating the pro-tumor effects of IFN-Is. OASL globally enhances mRNA translation initiation with the preference for mRNAs involved in lipid metabolism by directly interacting with ribosomes to form an ISG-associated ribosome, which induces fatty acid metabolism reprogramming and provides potential therapeutic interventions.

                Abnormal expression of PHGDH is associated with cancer. In this review, Wang et al. summarize the mechanisms by which PHGDH promotes cancer progression through non-canonical pathways. These non-canonical pathways of PHGDH may provide new therapeutic avenues for cancer.

In response to stimulation with a vaccine adjuvant, the model reveals a central role for innate lymphoid cells in directing adaptive immunity, with stromal cells orchestrating the inflammatory response.

We won’t run out of resources but with some mines taking decades to bring into production, we may run out of time.

                <p>Nature Communications, Published online: 02 July 2025; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-59196-1">doi:10.1038/s41467-025-59196-1</a></p>Tree cover gains in the moist tropics (1982–2015) were 56% naturally regenerated forests and 27% managed tree systems, with forest type influencing carbon recovery. Effective forest restoration requires robust tracking of forest types established by restoration efforts.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105918">Structural insights into heterohexameric assembly of epilepsy-related ligand–receptor complex LGI1–ADAM22</a></h4>

              
                Leucine-rich glioma-inactivated 1 protein (LGI1) is a secreted neuronal protein consisting of the N-terminal leucine-rich repeat (LRR) and C-terminal epitempin-repeat (EPTP) domains. LGI1 is linked to epilepsy, a neurological disorder that can be caused by genetic mutations of genes regulating neuronal excitability (e.g. voltage- or ligand-gated ion channels). ADAM22 is a membrane receptor that binds to LGI1 extracellularly and interacts with AMPA-type glutamate receptors via PSD-95 intracellularly to maintain normal synaptic signal transmission. Structural analysis of the LGI1–ADAM22 complex is important for understanding the molecular mechanism of epileptogenesis and developing new therapies against epilepsy. We previously reported the crystal structure of a 2:2 complex consisting of two molecules of LGI1 and two molecules of the ADAM22 ectodomain (ECD), which is suggested to bridge neurons across the synaptic cleft. On the other hand, multiangle light scattering, small-angle X-ray scattering, and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) analyses have suggested the existence of a 3:3 complex consisting of three molecules of LGI1 and three molecules of ADAM22. In the previous cryo-EM analysis, many observed particles were in a dissociated state, making it difficult to determine the three-dimensional (3D) structure of the 3:3 complex. In this study, we stabilized the 3:3 LGI1–ADAM22<sub>ECD</sub> complex using chemical cross-linking and determined the cryo-EM structures of the LGI1<sub>LRR</sub>–LGI1<sub>EPTP</sub>–ADAM22<sub>ECD</sub> and 3:3 LGI1–ADAM22<sub>ECD</sub> complexes at 2.78 Å and 3.79 Å resolutions, respectively. Furthermore, high-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM) visualized the structural features and flexibility of the 3:3 LGI1–ADAM22<sub>ECD</sub> complex in solution. We discuss new insights into the interaction modes of the LGI1–ADAM22 higher-order complex and the structural properties of the 3:3 LGI1–ADAM22 complex.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105311">Human eIF2A has a minimal role in translation initiation and in uORF-mediated translational control in HeLa cells</a></h4>

              
                Translation initiation in eukaryotes requires a 40 S ribosome loaded with initiator tRNA which scans for an initiation codon. The initiator tRNA is usually recruited to the ribosome as part of a ternary complex composed of initiator tRNA, eIF2, and GTP. Although initiator tRNA recruitment was originally ascribed to another factor, eIF2A, it was later disproven and shown to occur via eIF2. Nonetheless, eIF2A is still considered a translation initiation factor because it binds the ribosome and shows genetic interactions with other initiation factors such as eIF4E. The exact function of eIF2A during translation initiation, however, remains unclear. Here, we use ribosome profiling and luciferase reporter assays to systematically test in HeLa cells the role of eIF2A in translation initiation, including translation of upstream ORFs. Since eIF2A is thought to take over the function of eIF2 when eIF2 is inhibited, we also test conditions where the integrated stress response is activated. In none of our assays, however, could we detect a role of eIF2A in translation initiation. It is possible that eIF2A plays a role in translation regulation in specific conditions that we have not tested here, or that it plays a role in a different aspect of RNA biology.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104508">Planar cell polarity coordination in a cnidarian embryo provides clues to animal body axis evolution</a></h4>

              
                Body axis specification is a crucial event in animal embryogenesis and was an essential evolutionary innovation for founding the animal kingdom. This process involves two distinct components that coordinate to establish the spatial organisation of the embryo: initiation of cascades of regionalised gene expression and orientation of morphogenetic processes such as body elongation. Intense interest in the first component has revealed Wnt/β-catenin signalling as ancestrally responsible for initiating regional gene expression, but the evolutionary origin of oriented morphogenesis has received little attention. Here, by addressing the cell and morphological basis of body axis development in embryos of the cnidarian <i>Clytia hemisphaerica</i>, we have uncovered a simple and likely ancestral coordination mechanism between Wnt/β-catenin signalling and directed morphogenesis. We show that the ligand Wnt3, known to initiate oral gene expression via localised Wnt/β-catenin pathway activation, also has a key β-catenin-independent role in globally orienting planar cell polarity (PCP) to direct morphogenesis along the oral-aboral axis. This PCP orientation occurs in two distinct steps: local orientation by Wnt3 and global propagation by conserved core PCP protein interactions along the body axis. From these findings, we propose novel scenarios for PCP-driven symmetry-breaking underlying the emergence of the animal body plan.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103736">Hunger shifts attention and attribute weighting in dietary choice</a></h4>

              
                Hunger is a biological drive which can promote unhealthy dietary decisions. Yet, the cognitive mechanisms underlying this effect, and in particular the interactive role of attention and choice processes, remain elusive. To address this gap, we conducted an eye-tracking experiment, in which 70 participants completed a multi-attribute food choice task in hungry and sated states. Confirming our preregistered hypotheses, participants’ preference for tasty over healthy food items was amplified by hunger. Attention mediated this influence of hunger, as hungry participants focused more on tasty options, leading them to make less healthy decisions. Rigorous model comparisons revealed that an extension of the recently proposed multi-attribute attentional drift diffusion model best explained choice and response times. According to this model, hunger did not only increase the relative taste compared to health weight, but it also increased the fixation-related discounting of health but not taste information. Our results suggest that the cognitive mechanisms underlying unhealthy dietary decisions under hunger are characterized by a nuanced interplay between attention and the significance assigned to the options’ underlying attributes.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101959">Inference technique for the synaptic conductances in rhythmically active networks and application to respiratory central pattern generation circuits</a></h4>

              
                Unraveling synaptic interactions between excitatory and inhibitory interneurons within rhythmic neural circuits, such as central pattern generation (CPG) circuits for rhythmic motor behaviors, is critical for deciphering circuit interactions and functional architecture, which is a major problem for understanding how neural circuits operate. Here, we present a general method for extracting and separating patterns of inhibitory and excitatory synaptic conductances at high temporal resolution from single neuronal intracellular recordings in rhythmically active networks. These post-synaptic conductances reflect the combined synaptic inputs from the key interacting neuronal populations and can reveal the functional connectome of the active circuits. To illustrate the applicability of our analytic technique, we employ our method to infer the synaptic conductance profiles in identified rhythmically active interneurons within key microcircuits of the mammalian (mature rat) brainstem respiratory CPG and provide a perspective on how our approach can resolve the functional interactions and circuit organization of these interneuron populations. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach, which can be applied to any other rhythmic circuits where conditions allow for neuronal intracellular recordings.

                RNA-targeting compounds or small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) offer a potent means to control viral infections. An essential prerequisite for their design depends on identifying conserved and functional viral RNA structures in cells. Techniques that probe RNA structures in situ have recently been developed including SHAPE-MaP, which has been helpful in the analysis of secondary structures of RNA. In this study, we report on the application of SHAPE-MaP to the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus RNA genome to categorize different functional regions, including potential quadruplex-forming sequence and target sites of siRNA. Our results show that these structures can be exploited to inhibit viral proliferation and that SHAPE-MaP is an effective method to identify secondary structures in RNA genomes.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105017">Negative regulation of miRNA sorting into EVs is mediated by the capacity of RBP PCBP2 to impair the SYNCRIP-dependent miRNA loading</a></h4>

              
                While it is accepted that extracellular vesicles (EVs)-mediated transfer of microRNAs contributes to intercellular communication, the knowledge about molecular mechanisms controlling the selective and dynamic miRNA-loading in EVs is still limited to few specific RNA-binding proteins interacting with sequence determinants. Moreover, although mutagenesis analysis demonstrated the presence/function of specific intracellular retention motifs, the interacting protein/s remained unknown. Here, PCBP2 was identified as a direct interactor of an intracellular retention motif: CLIP coupled to RNA pull-down and proteomic analysis demonstrated that it binds to miRNAs embedding this motif and mutagenesis proved the binding specificity. Notably, PCBP2 binding requires SYNCRIP, a previously characterized miRNA EV-loader as indicated by SYNCRIP knock-down. SYNCRIP and PCBP2 may contemporarily bind to miRNAs as demonstrated by EMSA assays and PCBP2 knock-down causes EV loading of intracellular microRNAs. This evidence highlights that multiple proteins/miRNA interactions govern miRNA compartmentalization and identifies PCBP2 as a dominant inhibitor of SYNCRIP function in murine hepatocytes.

">A BASP1/BASP1-AS1 Axis Modulates Wnt and Notch Signaling to Balance Proliferation and Differentiation in Neuroblastoma Cells</a></h4>

              
                Neuroblastoma exhibits significant intratumoral heterogeneity and resistance to differentiation therapy. We identify a regulatory axis between the protein-coding gene BASP1 and its antisense lncRNA BASP1-AS1 as a molecular switch between proliferation and neuronal differentiation in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. BASP1 maintains a proliferative, undifferentiated state by upregulating Wnt3a signaling and stemness-associated markers. Knockdown of BASP1 inhibits both proliferation and neuronal gene expression, implicating it as a context-specific oncogenic driver. In contrast, BASP1-AS1 is transiently induced by retinoic acid (RA) and initiates early neuronal differentiation via DCX and MAP2 induction. BASP1-AS1 represses Wnt3a and activates Notch1, redirecting the signaling balance toward a differentiation-permissive state. A reciprocal suppression between BASP1 and BASP1-AS1 underlies a transition from Wnt3a to Wnt2 activity as differentiation progresses. LiCl mediated Wnt3a activation suppresses BASP1-AS1 and reinduces Sox2, highlighting Wnt3a role in maintaining stemness and therapy resistance. Post RA BDNF treatment reinforces terminal differentiation, defined by high BASP1-AS1, DCX, and MAP2, and loss of proliferative signatures. Together, these findings identify the BASP1/BASP1-AS1 axis as a central node integrating Wnt and Notch pathways to regulate plasticity and lineage progression in neuroblastoma. This axis represents a potential target for overcoming differentiation blockade and therapeutic resistance.

">Tinnitus perception is linked to arousal system dysfunction</a></h4>

              
                Tinnitus, the perception of sound in the absence of an external source, affects 14% of the population and is often associated with concentration and emotional difficulties. However, the characterization of the associated cognitive difficulties remains unclear. We hypothesize that attentional complaints are due to a dysfunction of the exogenous or endogenous orientation of attention, or of the arousal system. In this study, 200 participants (100 with chronic tinnitus and 100 matched controls) completed a battery of cognitive tasks assessing attention, alertness and executive functions, including the Attentional Network Task (ANT), Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART) with mind wandering evaluations, Stroop, and Trail Making Test. Tinnitus comorbidities, including hearing loss, sleep quality, anxiety, and hyperacusis were controlled. The results showed that individuals with tinnitus had a reduced sensitivity to alert signals, and lower sustained attention abilities, both suggesting lower levels of arousal. Mind-wandering analyses revealed fewer planning-related thoughts in the tinnitus group, suggesting higher needed cognitive resources to perform the task. Contrary to prior findings, we found no evidence of deficits in executive functioning specific to tinnitus; rather, executive impairments were associated with hearing loss and sleep disturbances. Overall, these findings support the hypothesis that tinnitus is linked to a dysfunction in the arousal system, likely involving the locus coeruleus, noradrenergic network. This work proposes a new theoretical framework implicating arousal dysregulation as a core mechanism in tinnitus-related cognitive complaints.

">Intergenerational Conditioning via Intermittent Parental Hypoxia Confers Stroke Resilience in Offspring</a></h4>

              
                Background and Aims: Intergenerational disease transmission, where parental exposures or experiences influence disease susceptibility in offspring, may represent a crucial layer of stroke risk that extends beyond genetics alone. Environmental conditioning, such as intermittent sub-lethal hypoxia, can induce adaptive protective stress responses in the brain. However, whether such parental conditioning enhances offspring resilience to cerebral ischaemia remains unclear. This study investigates whether intermittent hypoxia in parents acts as an intergenerational conditioning stimulus, conferring resilience to ischaemic stroke in offspring, and explores associated molecular mechanisms. Methods: Male and female Balb/C mice (F0) were exposed to intermittent hypoxia (8% O2, 2 hours every other day, 16 cycles) prior to mating. To confirm that intermittent hypoxia induced neuroprotection in the parental generation, a separate cohort of F0 mice underwent transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO). Offspring (F1) were generated from hypoxia-exposed F0 breeders and divided into four groups: biparental hypoxia, paternal hypoxia, maternal hypoxia, and normoxic controls. Adult F1 offspring also underwent tMCAO to model ischaemic stroke. Infarct volume and brain swelling were assessed 48 hours post-ischaemia. In a subgroup of F1 offspring, tandem mass tag (TMT)-based proteomic analysis of injured brain tissue was performed post-stroke to identify molecular pathways associated with neuroprotection. Results: Parental intermittent hypoxia significantly reduced infarct size and swelling in F0 mice. These protective effects were inherited by F1 offspring, with biparental exposure producing the greatest reduction in infarct volume, followed by maternal-only and paternal-only groups, and exhibiting sex-specific differences. Proteomic profiling revealed distinct treatment and lineage clusters. Key pathways implicated in offspring neuroprotection included metabolic regulation, immune signalling, cytoskeletal organisation, and cell survival, notably involving PI3K-Akt and EGFR pathways. Conclusions: Intermittent hypoxia in parents acts as an intergenerational conditioning stimulus, conferring offspring resilience to ischaemic stroke. This neuroprotective phenotype is supported by coordinated molecular adaptations in key pathways involved in survival and stress response. These findings highlight the potential for parental environmental conditioning to shape stroke outcomes in offspring, opening new avenues for therapeutic exploration.

">Structural Connectome Dimension Shapes Brain Dynamics in Health and Disease</a></h4>

              
                The structural connectome serves as the foundation for neural information signaling, playing a primary constraint on brain functionality. Yet, its influence on emergent dynamical properties is not fully understood. Generally, a key measure of a system's structural impact on dynamical phenomena is its dimension. By tracking the temporal evolution of diffusive perturbations, we estimate a scale-dependent measure of dimension of empirical connectomes. At the local scale, it is highly heterogeneous and follows a gradient from sensory-motor to executive areas. At the global scale, it encapsulates mesoscale topological information related to the balance between segregation and integration. Furthermore, by comparing connectomes from stroke patients, we find that dimension captures the local effects of lesions and, at a global level, is linked to impaired critical patterns and decreased cognitive performance. Overall, the dimension of the connectome may serve as a powerful descriptor for bridging the gap between structure and function in the human brain.

">Neurological Tissue Dissection Techniques in Mouse Models for Reproducible Scientific Results: Brain, Spinal Cord, CSF, and Sciatic Nerve</a></h4>

              
                Biomedical research studies, specifically regarding human neurodegenerative diseases, are bound by ethical challenges, and have limited diagnostic and treatment options. Transgenic mouse models offer an incredible research advantage to conduct feasible and practical research with the ability to precisely define the progression of neurodegenerative disease over a well-controlled dosage and timeline. The use of transgenic mouse models has been extensive and is critical to advancing research in many ways, including understanding brain morphology and general tissue changes caused by neurological diseases. Often, these studies require specific brain regions or other neurological tissues which may be difficult to obtain. Unfortunately, specific extraction and dissection protocols are few and far between, leading to inconsistent results and a lack of reproducibility. A well-defined protocol, such as this, is instrumental in overcoming these obstacles and acquiring better experimental results. Five mouse-specific protocols are described: brain extraction, brain microdissection, spinal cord extrusion, cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) collection, and sciatic nerve dissection. Each protocol was completed under biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) guidelines, similar to the sterility precautions required in human surgery. Each protocol also includes a collective materials list that defines proper instruments and usage. The protocol was refined based on feedback from numerous research studies in transcriptomics and pharmaceutical development. These applications require minimizing tissue damage, dissection accuracy, and the ability to reproduce the results, skills that are also directly transferable to clinical settings. The proper implementation of these protocols will allow for more accurate and precise results with reduced variability. This study provides well-defined, succinct, accessible protocols that are more ethical and improve the overall quality of the conducted research. By addressing this need, it supports greater advancements in many cross-disciplinary areas.

">Sparkling Water Consumption Mitigates Cognitive Fatigue during Prolonged Esports Play</a></h4>

              
                Prolonged esports play induces cognitive fatigue, characterized by diminished executive function with pupil constriction. Players often rely on caffeinated or sugary drinks to combat fatigue, but regular use poses health risks. Sparkling water, a sugar- and caffeine-free beverage, stimulates brainstem and prefrontal activity via sensory pathways mediated by transient receptor potential (TRP) channels in the throat. We here tested the hypothesis that sparkling water mitigates cognitive fatigue during prolonged esports play. Fifteen young adult players participated in a randomized crossover trial, each completing two 3-hour sessions of a virtual football game while consuming either sparkling water or plain water. Subjective fatigue, enjoyment, and executive function (via a flanker task) were measured at baseline and hourly, while pupil diameter and heart rate were monitored continuously. Blood glucose and salivary cortisol were also assessed periodically. Compared to plain water, sparkling water significantly attenuated increases in subjective fatigue, enhanced enjoyment, and preserved executive function, along with preventing pupil constriction. Heart rate, blood glucose, and salivary cortisol levels did not differ between conditions. Notably, players committed fewer in-game fouls with sparkling water, while offensive and defensive performance remained unchanged. These findings demonstrate that sparkling water alleviates both subjective and objective signs of cognitive fatigue during prolonged esports play, supporting our hypothesis. This non-caffeinated intervention may help sustain inhibitory control and promote fair behavior, offering a safe and sustainable strategy for managing mental fatigue in modern life.

">Transdiagnostic Profiles of BOLD Signal Variability in Autism and Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders: Associations with Cognition and Functioning</a></h4>

              
                Background Autism spectrum disorder (autism) and schizophrenia spectrum disorders (schizophrenia) exhibit overlapping social and neurocognitive impairment and considerable neurobiological heterogeneity. Blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal variability captures the brain's moment-to-moment fluctuations, offering a dynamic marker of neural flexibility that is sensitive to cognitive capacity. This study aimed to examine intra-regional BOLD signal variability during rest and task across schizophrenia, autism, and typically developing controls (TDC) to explore transdiagnostic patterns of brain signal variability and their relationship with cognitive and functional outcomes. Methods Intra-regional BOLD variability, measured by mean squared successive difference (MSSD), was obtained from resting-state and Empathic Accuracy task fMRI in 176 SSD, 89 autism, and 149 TDC participants. ANCOVAs, controlling for age, sex, and motion, assessed group differences in regional and network-level BOLD variability and dimensional associations with social cognition, neurocognition, social functioning, and symptom severity. Results Both autism and schizophrenia exhibited lower BOLD signal variability than TDC across rest and task, with reduced variability observed in somatomotor, visual, and auditory networks (pFDR < 0.01). Greater network variability was positively associated with better social cognitive, neurocognitive, and functional scores across the sample. Resting-state variability showed stronger group-based differences and cognitive associations than task-based variability. Conclusions BOLD signal variability is positively associated with social cognition, neurocognition, and social functioning across groups, suggesting that variability impacts cognitive efficiency and behaviour. Reduced variability in autism and schizophrenia may indicate similar patterns of neural rigidity among these related conditions, positioning BOLD variability as a potential biomarker for neural flexibility and a valuable target for future transdiagnostic clinical interventions.

                <p>Virtual reality (VR) has gained popularity in recent years, integrating with conventional music stimulation (MS), action observation (AO), and motor imagination (MI). It offers promising opportunities for developing innovative rehabilitation treatments, though the mechanisms underlying these effects remain unclear. This study aims to compare brain activation and network mechanisms following the fusion of MS, AO, and MI with VR. Fifty healthy participants were recruited and underwent functional near-infrared spectroscopy synchronization with three VR tasks: MS (VRMS), AO (VRAO), and MI (VRMI). The results indicate that VRMS significantly enhances functional connectivity of the bilateral primary sensory cortex (S1), premotor cortex, and supplementary motor area (PM&amp;SMA) compared with VRAO and VRMI. Furthermore, the interaction among the bilateral PM&amp;SMA, right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and right primary motor cortex (M1) regions is notably stronger with VRMS than with the other VR tasks. These findings elucidate the brain activation and network characteristics of the three VR tasks, highlighting VRMS's potential in boosting the functional interaction among brain regions. Future research should explore additional brain regions, broader diseased brain samples, and alternative brain-stimulation effects of VRMS.</p>

                Introduction This study aimed to evaluate the knowledge and awareness of occupational hazards and preventive measures among dentists and final-year students in two dentistry hospitals in Kabul, Afghanistan. Methods A cross-sectional descriptive study design was used in this research, which was distributed to 198 dental professionals, with Part A dealing with sociodemographic data, Part B focusing on awareness of occupational hazards, and Part C on preventive measures. Responses were analyzed to assess the level of awareness using a five-point scale. The data were also compared using Mann-Whitney U tests to examine the differences between male and female respondents and between final-year dental students and practicing dentists. Results The overall mean proportion of correct answers was 0.71 (71%), indicating moderately high awareness. Part B had a mean of 0.73 (high), and Part C had a mean of 0.69 (medium). High awareness was found in areas such as radiation safety (93.4%), infection control (97.5%) and ergonomics (85.9%). However, gaps were identified in knowledge of lead protective gowns (15.2%) and the inverse square law (8.1%). In Part C, high awareness was noted regarding safety guidelines for electrical devices (85.9%) and protective eyewear (93.4%), but low awareness was found regarding safety boxes for sharp instruments (19.7%) and the scoop technique (31.8%). Mann-Whitney U tests revealed significant differences between male and female respondents (p < 0.001), with females showing higher awareness, although the effect size was small (r = -0.247). No significant difference was observed between the final-year students and practicing dentists (p = 0.575). Conclusions Although dental professionals exhibit a relatively high level of awareness regarding occupational hazards and preventive measures, specific knowledge gaps persist. Addressing these deficiencies through structured educational interventions and continuous professional training is essential to enhance the occupational safety and improve the overall well-being of dental practitioners.

                <p>by Héctor D. García-Verdugo, Cristian Román-Palacios</p>

Effective collaboration, essential for success in academic environments, often requires efficient team communication and access to a team-oriented digital infrastructure. Despite the significance of efficient and effective collaboration within the academy, a standardized and structured suite for collaboration remains relatively overlooked. In the context of research labs, where multiple levels of collaboration often coexist, the ability to communicate and share resources in a timely and secure manner is critical. Modern research teams and institutions have historically attempted to solve these needs through proprietary, largely restrictive, and inflexible tools. Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) has facilitated the development of our modern computer-focused world by virtue of its legal, customizable, and accessible nature. However, FOSS remains weakly used for supporting communication, collaborative writing, storage, and other tasks within research labs. This paper discusses the implementation of a FOSS computational workflow for active collaboration within academic environments. We focus on identifying available tools that can support collaborative writing, instant messaging, data storage, among other tasks. The Lab Operations (LabOps) workflow presented in this paper—which can be self-hosted, adapted, and adopted at different levels—offers an alternative approach to off-the-shelf proprietary solutions for both within- and cross-lab communication. We discuss the benefits, flexibility, limitations, and potential approaches to adoption of the workflow.

                <p>by D. Walker Gauthier, Noelle James, Benjamin D. Auerbach</p>

Atypical sensory processing, particularly in the auditory domain, is one of the most common and quality-of-life affecting symptoms seen in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the leading inherited cause of ASD and a majority of FXS individuals present with auditory processing alterations. While auditory hypersensitivity is a common phenotype observed in FXS and <i>Fmr1</i> knockout (KO) rodent models, it is important to consider other auditory coding impairments that could contribute to sound processing difficulties and disrupted language comprehension in FXS. We have shown previously that a <i>Fmr1</i> KO rat model of FXS exhibits heightened sound sensitivity that coincided with abnormal perceptual integration of stimulus bandwidth, indicative of altered spectral processing. Frequency discrimination is a fundamental aspect of sound encoding that is important for a range of auditory processes, such as source segregation and speech comprehension, and disrupted frequency coding could thus contribute to a range of auditory issues in FXS and ASD. Here we explicitly characterized spectral processing deficits in male <i>Fmr1</i> KO rats using an operant conditioning tone discrimination assay and in vivo electrophysiology recordings from the auditory cortex and inferior colliculus. We found that <i>Fmr1</i> KO rats exhibited poorer frequency resolution, which corresponded with neuronal hyperactivity and broader frequency tuning in auditory cortical but not collicular neurons. Using an experimentally informed population model, we show that these cortical physiological differences can recapitulate the observed behavior discrimination deficits, with decoder performance being tightly linked to differences in cortical tuning width and signal-to-noise ratios. Together, these findings indicate that cortical hyperexcitability in <i>Fmr1</i> KO rats may act to preserve signal-to-noise ratios and signal detection threshold at the expense of sound sensitivity and fine feature discrimination, highlighting a potential mechanistic locus for a range of auditory behavioral phenotypes in FXS.

Effortful learning and practice are integral to academic attainment in areas like reading, language, and mathematics, shaping future career prospects, socioeconomic status, and health outcomes. However, academic learning outcomes often exhibit disparities, with initial cognitive advantages leading to further advantages (the Matthew effect). One of the areas in which learners frequently exhibit difficulties is mathematical learning. Neurobiological research has underscored the involvement of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), and the hippocampus in mathematical learning. However, their causal contributions remain unclear. Moreover, recent findings have highlighted the potential role of excitation/inhibition (E/I) balance in neuroplasticity and learning. To deepen our understanding of the mechanisms driving mathematical learning, we employed a novel approach integrating double-blind excitatory neurostimulation—high-frequency transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS)—and examined its effect at the behavioral, functional, and neurochemical levels. During a 5-day mathematical learning paradigm (<i>n</i> = 72) active tRNS was applied over the dlPFC or the PPC, and we compared the effects versus sham tRNS. Individuals exhibiting stronger positive baseline frontoparietal connectivity demonstrated greater improvement in calculation learning. Subsequently, utilizing tRNS to modulate frontoparietal connectivity, we found that participants with weaker positive baseline frontoparietal connectivity, typically associated with poorer learning performance, experienced enhanced learning outcomes following dlPFC-tRNS only. Further analyses revealed that dlPFC-tRNS improved learning outcomes for participants who showed reductions in dlPFC GABA when it was accompanied by a reduced positive frontoparietal connectivity, but this effect was reversed for participants who showed increased positive frontoparietal connectivity. Our multimodal approach elucidates the causal role of the dlPFC and frontoparietal network in a critical academic learning skill, shedding light on the interplay between functional connectivity and GABAergic modulation in the efficacy of brain-based interventions to augment learning outcomes, particularly benefiting individuals who would learn less optimally based on their neurobiological profile.

Adhesive interactions, mediated by specific molecular and structural mechanisms, are fundamental to host–pathogen and predator–prey relationships, driving evolutionary dynamics and ecological interactions. Here, we investigate the cellular and molecular basis of adhesion between the nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> and its natural predator the nematode-trapping fungus <i>Arthrobotrys oligospora</i>, which employs specialized adhesive nets to capture its prey. Using forward genetic screens, we identified <i>C. elegans</i> mutants that escape fungal traps and revealed the nuclear hormone receptor NHR-66 as a key regulator of fungal-nematode adhesion. Loss-of-function mutations in <i>nhr-66</i> conferred resistance to fungal trapping through the downregulation of a large subset of cuticular collagen genes. Restoring collagen gene expression in <i>nhr-66</i> mutants abolished the escape phenotype, highlighting the essential role of these structural proteins in fungal-nematode adhesion. Furthermore, sequence analysis of natural <i>C. elegans</i> populations revealed no obvious loss-of-function variants in <i>nhr-66</i>, suggesting selective pressures exist that balance adhesion-mediated predation risk with physiological robustness. We observed that loss of <i>nhr-66</i> function resulted in a trade-off of increased hypersensitivity to hypoosmotic stress and cuticular fragility. These findings underscore the pivotal role of structural proteins in shaping ecological interactions and the evolutionary arms race between predator and prey.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>A growing body of evidence indicates a strong genetic overlap between developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs) and movement disorders. De novo loss-of-function variants in <i>NUS1</i> have been recently identified in DEE cases. Herein, we report a large cohort of cases with pathogenic <i>NUS1</i> variants and describe their clinical presentation and the details of the associated epilepsy and movement disorders.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Cases with <i>NUS1</i>-related disorders were identified through a multicentric international collaboration made possible by the GeneMatcher platform. Clinical data were acquired through retrospective case-note review.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified 41 subjects carrying 38 different pathogenic or likely pathogenic heterozygous <i>NUS1</i> variants. The majority of cases displayed developmental delays and intellectual disability of variable severity. Epilepsy was present in 68.3% of cases (28/41) with onset typically in early childhood. Strikingly, 87.8% of cases (36/41) presented with movement disorders and for 13 of these cases the movement disorder was not accompanied by epilepsy. The phenomenology of the movement disorders was complex with myoclonus observed in 68.3% of cases (28/41), either in isolation or in combination with dystonia, ataxia, and/or parkinsonism. Seven cases that otherwise did not have prominent movement disorders had mild incoordination and intention tremor, suggestive of cerebellar dysfunction. There was no observed genotype–phenotype correlation, suggesting that other genetic or acquired factors impact the clinical presentation.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Heterozygous <i>NUS1</i> pathogenic variants cause a complex neurological disorder, variably featuring developmental and epileptic encephalopathies and a broad spectrum of movement disorders, which represent the major source of neurological disability for most cases.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Empathic pain, a core manifestation of empathy, encompasses an individual's perceptual sensitivity, evaluative judgment, and emotional responsiveness to the suffering of others. This capacity is vital for healthy social interaction, as it fosters prosocial behavior, inhibits aggression, and upholds moral norms critical to social development. This article provides a comprehensive review of current research on empathic pain, examining its conceptual foundations and the underlying neural mechanisms. In particular, it explores the activation of key brain regions, including the anterior cingulate cortex, insula, amygdala, and cerebellum, as well as the neural circuits linking these areas. Additionally, the paper summarizes various influencing factors and modulatory strategies related to empathic pain. These insights enhance our understanding of emotional resonance and establish a solid basis for developing clinical modulation models. Future research should adopt a multidisciplinary approach, incorporating advanced neuroimaging techniques, behavioral experiments, and broader clinical trials to further elucidate empathic pain and inform the development of more effective treatment strategies.</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) projections to the hippocampus (HC) play a critical role in cognition and have been associated with cognitive impairments related to aging and neurodegenerative disease. This review aims to provide a detailed anatomical description of the LEC-to-HC pathway, based on a review of data collected using neuroanatomical tract tracing techniques. The LEC projects to the HC in a layer-specific manner. Layer II of the LEC provides the primary source of projections to the dentate gyrus (DG), while layer III is the primary source of projections to the subiculum and cornu Ammonis (CA) region. These projections terminate in the molecular layers of the HC and follow a topographical distribution along the dorsolateral–ventromedial axis. Having a clear understanding of the LEC-to-HC pathway is essential background for investigating its functions and alterations due to disease and aging processes.</p>

<p>High-frequency oscillations (HFO) generated by the microscale overexcitation circuits are promising biomarker of the epileptogenesis and epilepsy development.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The mechanism of epilepsy is still unclear. We aim to explore the relationship between high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) dynamics and epilepsy, with a focus on deciphering underlying mechanisms at the single-neuron level. Using a rat model of chronic focal cortical epilepsy induced by cobalt-wire implantation, we monitored the seizures and HFO dynamics, as well as the cross-frequency coupling trends between HFOs and theta activities. Additionally, excitatory and inhibitory neurons' discharges were recorded by 16-channel tetrode electrode, with comparisons made between the discharge rates and changes from baselines during different bands of HFOs (ripple:80-200 Hz; fast ripple, FRs:200-500 Hz). All rats (8/8) with cobalt-wire implantation developed spontaneous seizures within 4 to 8 days post-surgery, in contrast to the control group (3/3) with steel-wire insertion remaining seizure-free. HFOs exhibited a progressive increase over time post-surgery in the epilepsy model, while minimal HFOs was observed in the control group. HFOs recorded during the peak-seizure periods showed a propensity to synchronize with the trough of theta activity, coinciding with heightened seizure frequency. A substantial augmentation showed in the discharge rates of both putative excitatory and inhibitory neurons during HFO occurrences. The change ratios between putative excitatory and inhibitory neurons during ripples were smaller than those during FRs. In conclusion, we found that HFO dynamics reflect epileptogenic network formation, with implications for early seizure prediction and therapeutic interventions. Our data provide novel insights at cellular and cross-frequency level into the mechanistic underpinnings of HFO emergence and network reorganization offering potential strategies for targeting pathological network activity in epilepsy.</p>

                Sialoglycans on T cells are emerging as important immunotherapeutic targets but remain incompletely characterized in both mice and humans. Here, Izzati and Choksi et al. curate an atlas of functionally important glycans across murine and human T cell repertoires and discover species-specific differences driven by divergent biosynthesis.

                Isogawa et al. show that antibody durability after booster vaccination is predicted by pre-existing memory T cells that produce IL-2 upon antigen stimulation. These memory T cells, termed memory Th0 cells, uniquely express BACH2, distinguishing them from conventional helper T cells.

Additionally, they extend molecular evidence to data from field studies that have demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2-related viruses in wild-caught bats lack an intact furin cleavage site.
