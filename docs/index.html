<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The blood–brain barrier (BBB) is a barrier between the circulatory system and the central nervous system (CNS), contributing to CNS protection and maintaining the brain homeostasis. Establishment of in vitro BBB models that are closer to the microenvironment of the human brain is helpful for evaluating the potential and efficiency of a drug penetrating BBB and thus the clinical application value of the drug. The in vitro BBB models not only provide great convenience for screening new drugs that can access to CNS but also help people to have a deeper study on the mechanism of substances entering and leaving the brain, which makes people have greater opportunities in the treatment of CNS diseases. Up to now, although much effort has been paid to the researches on the in vitro BBB models and many progresses have been achieved, no unified method has been described for establishing a BBB model and there is much work to do and many challenges to be faced with in the future. This review summarizes the research progresses in the establishment, evaluation, and application of in vitro BBB models.</p>

<p>The new rTMS therapeutic module (iTBS) can alter microglial polarization and improve motor dysfunction and neuroinflammation with ischemic stroke in mice.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Neuroinflammation caused by excessive microglial activation plays a key role in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a noninvasive neuromodulatory technique that has recently been reported to regulate microglial functions and exert anti-inflammatory effects. The intermittent burst stimulation (iTBS) regimen in rTMS improves neuronal excitability. However, whether iTBS exerts its anti-inflammatory effects by stimulating neurons and thereby modulating microglial polarization remains unclear. Motor function was assessed after 1 week of rTMS (iTBS regimen) treatment in adult male mice with occlusion/reperfusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCAO/r) injury. We also investigated the molecular biological alterations associated with microglial polarization using a cell proliferation assay, multiplex cytokine bioassays, and immunofluorescence staining. iTBS regimen can improve balance and motor coordination function, increase spontaneous movement, and improve walking function in mice with early cerebral ischemia injury. Expression levels of IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-10 increased significantly in mice with MCAO injury. Especially, rTMS significantly increased the number of proliferating cells in the infarcted cortex. The fluorescence intensity of MAP2 in the peri-infarct area of MCAO injured mice was low, but the signal was broader. Compared with MCAO group, the fluorescence intensity of MAP2 in rTMS group was significantly increased. rTMS inhibited pro-inflammatory M1 activation (Iba1<sup>+</sup>/CD86<sup>+</sup>) and improved anti-inflammatory M2 activation (Iba1<sup>+</sup>/CD206<sup>+</sup>) in the peri-infarct zone, thus significantly changing the phenotypic ratio M1/M2. rTMS improves motor dysfunction and neuroinflammation after cerebral I/R injury in mice by regulating microglial polarization.</p>

                <p>Studies on genetic robustness recently revealed transcriptional adaptation (TA) as a mechanism by which an organism can compensate for genetic mutations through activation of homologous genes. Here, we discovered that genetic mutations, introducing a premature termination codon (PTC) in the amyloid precursor protein-b (<I>appb</I>) gene, activated TA of two other <I>app</I> family members, <I>appa</I> and amyloid precursor-like protein-2 (<I>aplp2</I>), in zebrafish. The observed transcriptional response of <I>appa</I> and <I>aplp2</I> required degradation of mutant mRNA and did not depend on Appb protein level. Furthermore, TA between amyloid precursor protein (APP) family members was observed in human neuronal progenitor cells; however, compensation was only present during early neuronal differentiation and could not be detected in a more differentiated neuronal stage or adult zebrafish brain. Using knockdown and chemical inhibition, we showed that nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) is involved in degradation of mutant mRNA and that Upf1 and Upf2, key proteins in the NMD pathway, regulate the endogenous transcript levels of <I>appa</I>, <I>appb</I>, <I>aplp1</I>, and <I>aplp2</I>. In conclusion, our results suggest that the expression level of App family members is regulated by the NMD pathway and that mutations destabilizing <I>app</I>/<I>APP</I> mRNA can induce genetic compensation by other family members through TA in both zebrafish and human neuronal progenitors.</p>

                <p>Amylin, a pancreatic hormone that is cosecreted with insulin, has been highlighted as a potential treatment target for obesity. Amylin receptors are distributed widely throughout the brain and are coexpressed on mesolimbic dopamine neurons. Activation of amylin receptors is known to reduce food intake, but the neurochemical mechanisms behind this remain to be elucidated. Amylin receptor activation in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), a key dopaminergic nucleus in the mesolimbic reward system, has a potent ability to suppress intake of palatable fat and sugar solutions. Although previous work has demonstrated that VTA amylin receptor activation can dampen mesolimbic dopamine signaling elicited by random delivery of sucrose, whether this is also the case for fat remains unknown. Herein we tested the hypothesis that amylin receptor activation in the VTA of male rats would attenuate dopamine signaling in the nucleus accumbens core in response to random intraoral delivery of either fat or sugar solutions. Results show that fat solution produces a greater potentiation of accumbens dopamine than an isocaloric sucrose solution. Moreover, activation of VTA amylin receptors elicits a more robust suppression of accumbens dopamine signaling in response to fat solution than to sucrose. Taken together these results shed new light on the amylin system as a therapeutic target for obesity and emphasize the reinforcing nature of high-fat/high-sugar diets.</p>

                In 2023 Alkhathami and colleagues from the Prince Sultan Military College of Health Sciences highlighted the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia’s transformative upgrades across various sectors, notably including enhancements to the healthcare system, and called for action to extend these upgrades to the military healthcare field. Prompted by this call to action, the leadership of the military healthcare system swiftly commenced initiatives, acting in less than three months from this pivotal appeal. In January 2023 the first author ordered a decree via the General Directorate of Armed Forces Medical Services of Saudi Arabia, in collaboration with US central Command and international partners, to host the 3rd International Conference of Military Medicine. The event graciously welcoming more than 1000 military representatives from 20 participating nations. The Military Medical Conference, fostering a global military community dialogue on the necessity to explore collective capacities to endure and overcome humanitarian challenges, thereby sustaining health, promoting well-being, and nurturing life through strategies that align with the insights of Alkhathami et al. (2023). The response and the need underlined by the original article are discussed by the Major General, staff of the Saudi Military Medical Services and academics from the University of Sharjah.

                Background In this paper we analyse the novel The End of Eddy by Édouard Louis. The motivation for this paper is Bourdeau’s (2020) observation that Louis’s book explores working class politics, sexuality, and masculinity. Methods We analysed the amendment through narrative content analysis, the application of which allows us to answer the following question: Édouard Louis’s novel The End of Eddy: A representation of hegemonic masculinity? Results We conclude that this narrative is built on contradictions that can be summarized as a conflict between a socio-cultural norm anchored in a French village and a person who does not fulfil this concept, who is outside of it. We believe that hegemonic masculinity, that is, one part of the cultural norm of a given village, causes Eddy’s inclination or consciousness of homonationalism. Thus, on the one hand, hegemonic masculinity is undoubtedly present in this novel; on the other hand, it forms a kind of background or socio-cultural environment which, although it defines itself against the given, unconsciously causes the “birth of the conscious homosexual”. Conclusions Thus, we dare to claim that the narrative under analysis is not only a representation of hegemonic masculinity, but also an accentuation of its external and internal influence on one’s own perception of (sexual) difference.

                Background Post-operative sore throat (POST) is one of the most common complaints post-endotracheal intubation and can be decreased through various interventions. This study aimed to determine the effect of fluticasone-impregnated versus saline throat packs on the occurrence and severity of POST and voice hoarseness. Methods This prospective, randomized, double-blinded trial was conducted on patients undergoing nasosinus surgeries at Kasturba Medical College and Hospital. Patients were randomized to groups based on a computer-generated table of random numbers post-intubation after placing a definite length of oropharyngeal packs into group F (fluticasone) who received four puffs of fluticasone furoate-soaked throat packs and group C (control) wherein normal saline-soaked throat packs were used. Determining the incidence of POST and voice hoarseness was the primary outcome; severity of POST and voice hoarseness, patient satisfaction scores at 24 hours post-surgery and adverse events were secondary outcomes. Results Overall, 86 patients were randomized and 43 patients were included in each group. Incidence of POST (%) and voice hoarseness (%) were 55.8, 55.6, 55.8, 53.4 and 30.2, 28, 28, 28 in group C. Incidence of POST (%) and voice hoarseness (%) were 37.2, 37.2, 37.2, 34.8 and 14, 14, 14,14 in group F at 1, 2, 6 and 24 hours, respectively, however, the p values were not found to be significant at any time interval. There was no significant difference in terms of severity of POST and voice hoarseness, patient satisfaction scores between the groups and there were no reported adverse events. Conclusions In patients undergoing nasosinus surgery under general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation, fluticasone furoate-impregnated throat packs failed to show any significant reduction in the incidence and severity of POST as well as hoarseness of voice, and even though it was not statistically significant, the fluticasone impregnated group had higher patient satisfaction scores.

                Background Although numerous case-control studies have examined the role of nitric oxide, particularly the 894G>T polymorphism in the eNOS gene, in increasing the risk of stroke and cancer, there remains a need for a comprehensive meta-analysis to clarify these associations. This study aims to address this gap by thoroughly evaluating the relationship between the eNOS 894G>T polymorphism and the risks of cancer and stroke. Methods We conducted an exhaustive search across digital databases including Science Direct, PubMed, and Google Scholar for studies published between 2012-2023. A rigorous selection process was employed to include relevant studies, which were then analyzed using robust meta-analytical techniques to determine the association between the eNOS 894G>T polymorphism and the risks of cancer and stroke. Results In this meta-analysis, we combined data from 2,013 cases and 2,187 control subjects for cancer risk assessment and 1,006 cases with 1,146 control subjects for stroke risk evaluation. Our findings indicate that the eNOS 894G>T polymorphism is significantly associated with an increased risk of cancer when comparing GG vs. GT+TT genotypes. Additionally, there is a notable correlation between this polymorphism and stroke incidence under various genetic models (T vs. G, TT vs. GG + GT, GG + GT vs. TT). Conclusions The results of this meta-analysis suggest a significant association between the eNOS 894G>T polymorphism and increased risks of cancer and stroke. These findings underscore the importance of conducting future studies with larger sample sizes and more comprehensive analyses further to elucidate the role of nitric oxide in these diseases. This study addresses some concerns but further detailed and non-repetitive research is necessary for conclusive evidence.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-611/v1?src=rss">Understanding the Dynamics of consumer behaviour and purchase intentions for Green Cosmetic Products in North India: A Gender-Neutral Approach [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background The increasing popularity of green cosmetic products among consumers who prioritize skin health, quality, and beauty has driven the production of these products. Growing awareness of harmful toxins in traditional cosmetics is leading consumers to prefer natural alternatives. This study aimed to identify the factors influencing Indian consumers' buying behaviour and purchase intentions toward green cosmetics, focusing on both male and female consumers. Methods To achieve this, a thorough evaluation of the literature from Scopus-indexed journals was conducted, employing the theory of planned behavior as the theoretical framework. The study used Smart PLS 3.0’s structural equation modeling to analyze data and performed a multi-group analysis to explore variations in purchasing intentions and actions between male and female consumers. Results The research indicated an increasing demand for green cosmetics among males in North India. Findings revealed that subjective norms significantly influenced both purchase behaviour and purchase intention. Additionally, perceived behavioural control and subjective norms positively impacted purchase intention, which in turn indirectly affected purchase behaviour. Interestingly, environmental concerns did not influence consumers' actual purchasing intentions or behaviour. The analysis also demonstrated no significant differences between male and female consumers regarding the impact of various factors on their purchase intentions and behaviours. Conclusion These findings provide valuable insights for policymakers and marketing managers aiming to promote green cosmetic product purchase behaviour. Recognizing that subjective norms and perceived behavioural control are crucial drivers of purchase intention and behaviour can help in devising effective marketing strategies. Despite the absence of significant gender differences in the factors influencing purchase behaviour, the increasing interest in green cosmetics, especially among males, highlights a broader market potential for these products. This research underscores the importance of focusing on social and behavioural influences to encourage the adoption of green cosmetics

New sublineages of SARS-CoV-2 variants-of-concern (VOCs) continuously emerge with mutations in the spike glycoprotein. In most cases, the sublineage-defining mutations vary between the VOCs. It is unclear whether these differences reflect lineage-specific likelihoods for mutations at each spike position or the stochastic nature of their appearance. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 lineages have distinct evolutionary spaces (a probabilistic definition of the sequence states that can be occupied by expanding virus subpopulations). This space can be accurately inferred from the patterns of amino acid variability at the whole-protein level. Robust networks of co-variable sites identify the highest-likelihood mutations in new VOC sublineages and predict remarkably well the emergence of subvariants with resistance mutations to COVID-19 therapeutics. Our studies reveal the contribution of low frequency variant patterns at heterologous sites across the protein to accurate prediction of the changes at each position of interest.

                <p>by Diego Andrés Contreras, Giulia Cencetti, Alain Barrat</p>

Contagion processes, representing the spread of infectious diseases, information, or social behaviors, are often schematized as taking place on networks, which encode for instance the interactions between individuals. The impact of the network structure on spreading process has been widely investigated, but not the reverse question: do different processes unfolding on a given network lead to different infection patterns? How do the infection patterns depend on a model’s parameters or on the nature of the contagion processes? Here we address this issue by investigating the infection patterns for a variety of models. In simple contagion processes, where contagion events involve one connection at a time, we find that the infection patterns are extremely robust across models and parameters. In complex contagion models instead, in which multiple interactions are needed for a contagion event, non-trivial dependencies on models parameters emerge, as the infection pattern depends on the interplay between pairwise and group contagions. In models involving threshold mechanisms moreover, slight parameter changes can significantly impact the spreading paths. Our results show that it is possible to study crucial features of a spread from schematized models, and inform us on the variations between spreading patterns in processes of different nature.

                <p>by Florian Bolenz, Thorsten Pachur</p>

Younger and older adults often differ in their risky choices. Theoretical frameworks on human aging point to various cognitive and motivational factors that might underlie these differences. Using a novel computational model based on the framework of resource rationality, we find that the two age groups rely on different strategies. Importantly, older adults did not use simpler strategies than younger adults, they did not select among fewer strategies, they did not make more errors, and they did not put more weight on cognitive costs. Instead, older adults selected strategies that had different risk propensities than those selected by younger adults. Our modeling approach suggests that age differences in risky choice are not necessarily a consequence of cognitive decline; instead, they may reflect motivational differences between age groups.

Transcription factors (TFs) regulate the process of transcription through the modulation of different kinetic steps. Although models can often describe the observed transcriptional output of a measured gene, predicting a TFs role on a given promoter requires an understanding of how the TF alters each step of the transcription process. In this work, we use a simple model of transcription to assess the role of promoter identity, and the degree to which TFs alter binding of RNAP (stabilization) and initiation of transcription (acceleration) on three primary characteristics: the range of steady-state regulation, cell-to-cell variability in expression, and the dynamic response time of a regulated gene. We find that steady state regulation and the response time of a gene behave uniquely for TFs that regulate incoherently, i.e that speed up one step but slow the other. We also find that incoherent TFs have dynamic implications, with one type of incoherent mode configuring the promoter to respond more slowly at intermediate TF concentrations. We also demonstrate that the noise of gene expression for these TFs is sensitive to promoter strength, with a distinct non-monotonic profile that is apparent under stronger promoters. Taken together, our work uncovers the coupling between promoters and TF regulatory modes with implications for understanding natural promoters and engineering synthetic gene circuits with desired expression properties.

                <p>by Sebastian Salwig, Jakob Drefs, Jörg Lücke</p>

Conventional and electron microscopy visualize structures in the micrometer to nanometer range, and such visualizations contribute decisively to our understanding of biological processes. Due to different factors in recording processes, microscopy images are subject to noise. Especially at their respective resolution limits, a high degree of noise can negatively effect both image interpretation by experts and further automated processing. However, the deteriorating effects of strong noise can be alleviated to a large extend by image enhancement algorithms. Because of the inherent high noise, a requirement for such algorithms is their applicability directly to noisy images or, in the extreme case, to just a single noisy image without a priori noise level information (referred to as blind zero-shot setting). This work investigates blind zero-shot algorithms for microscopy image denoising. The strategies for denoising applied by the investigated approaches include: filtering methods, recent feed-forward neural networks which were amended to be trainable on noisy images, and recent probabilistic generative models. As datasets we consider transmission electron microscopy images including images of SARS-CoV-2 viruses and fluorescence microscopy images. A natural goal of denoising algorithms is to simultaneously reduce noise while preserving the original image features, e.g., the sharpness of structures. However, in practice, a tradeoff between both aspects often has to be found. Our performance evaluations, therefore, focus not only on noise removal but set noise removal in relation to a metric which is instructive about sharpness. For all considered approaches, we numerically investigate their performance, report their denoising/sharpness tradeoff on different images, and discuss future developments. We observe that, depending on the data, the different algorithms can provide significant advantages or disadvantages in terms of their noise removal vs. sharpness preservation capabilities, which may be very relevant for different virological applications, e.g., virological analysis or image segmentation.

                <p>by Xiangting Li, Tom Chou</p>

Cellular signaling, crucial for biological processes like immune response and homeostasis, relies on specificity and fidelity in signal transduction to accurately respond to stimuli amidst biological noise. Kinetic proofreading (KPR) is a key mechanism enhancing signaling specificity through time-delayed steps, although its effectiveness is debated due to intrinsic noise potentially reducing signal fidelity. In this study, we reformulate the theory of kinetic proofreading (KPR) by convolving multiple intermediate states into a single state and then define an overall “processing” time required to traverse these states. This simplification allows us to succinctly describe kinetic proofreading in terms of a single waiting time parameter, facilitating a more direct evaluation and comparison of KPR performance across different biological contexts such as DNA replication and T cell receptor (TCR) signaling. We find that loss of fidelity for longer proofreading steps relies on the specific strategy of information extraction and show that in the first-passage time (FPT) discrimination strategy, longer proofreading steps can exponentially improve the accuracy of KPR at the cost of speed. Thus, KPR can still be an effective discrimination mechanism in the high noise regime. However, in a product concentration-based discrimination strategy, longer proofreading steps do not necessarily lead to an increase in performance. However, by introducing activation thresholds on product concentrations, can we decompose the product-based strategy into a series of FPT-based strategies to better resolve the subtleties of KPR-mediated product discrimination. Our findings underscore the importance of understanding KPR in the context of how information is extracted and processed in the cell.

                <p>by Charlotte Cordonnier, Msano Mandalasi, Jason Gigley, Elizabeth A. Wohlfert, Christopher M. West, Ira J. Blader</p>

As <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> disseminates through its host, the parasite must sense and adapt to its environment and scavenge nutrients. Oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) is one such environmental factor and cytoplasmic prolyl 4-hydroxylases (PHDs) are evolutionarily conserved O<sub>2</sub> cellular sensing proteins that regulate responses to changes in O<sub>2</sub> availability. <i>Toxoplasma</i> expresses 2 PHDs. One of them, TgPHYa hydroxylates SKP1, a subunit of the SCF-E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. In vitro, TgPHYa is important for growth at low O<sub>2</sub> levels. However, studies have yet to examine the role that TgPHYa or any other pathogen-encoded PHD plays in virulence and disease. Using a type II ME49 <i>Toxoplasma</i> TgPHYa knockout, we report that TgPHYa is important for <i>Toxoplasma</i> virulence and brain cyst formation in mice. We further find that while TgPHYa mutant parasites can establish an infection in the gut, they are unable to efficiently disseminate to peripheral tissues because the mutant parasites are unable to survive within recruited immune cells. Since this phenotype was abrogated in IFNγ knockout mice, we studied how TgPHYa mediates survival in IFNγ-treated cells. We find that TgPHYa is not required for release of parasite-encoded effectors into host cells that neutralize anti-parasitic processes induced by IFNγ. In contrast, we find that TgPHYa is required for the parasite to scavenge tryptophan, which is an amino acid whose levels are decreased after IFNγ up-regulates the tryptophan-catabolizing enzyme, indoleamine dioxygenase (IDO). We further find, relative to wild-type mice, that IDO knockout mice display increased morbidity when infected with TgPHYa knockout parasites. Together, these data identify the first parasite mechanism for evading IFNγ-induced nutritional immunity and highlight a novel role that oxygen-sensing proteins play in pathogen growth and virulence.

                <p>by Vanessa M. Adams</p>

There has been an increasingly prevalent message that data regarding costs must be included in conservation planning activities to make cost-efficient decisions. Despite the growing acceptance that socioeconomic context is critical to conservation success, the approaches to embedded economic and financial considerations into planning have not significantly evolved. Inappropriate cost data is frequently included in decisions, with the potential of compromising biodiversity and social outcomes. For each conservation planning step, this essay details common mistakes made when considering costs, proposing solutions to enable conservation managers to know when and how to include costs. Appropriate use of high-quality cost data obtained at the right scale will improve decision-making and ultimately avoid costly mistakes.

Notably, the severity of these sensory symptoms is often predictive of the expression of other autistic traits. However, the origin of these perceptual deficits remains largely elusive. Here, we show a recurrent impairment in visual threat perception that is similarly impaired in 3 independent mouse models of ASD with different molecular aetiologies. Interestingly, this deficit is associated with reduced avoidance of threatening environments—a nonperceptual trait. Focusing on a common cause of ASDs, the <i>Setd5</i> gene mutation, we define the molecular mechanism. We show that the perceptual impairment is caused by a potassium channel (Kv1)-mediated hypoexcitability in a subcortical node essential for the initiation of escape responses, the dorsal periaqueductal grey (dPAG). Targeted pharmacological Kv1 blockade rescued both perceptual and place avoidance deficits, causally linking seemingly unrelated trait deficits to the dPAG. Furthermore, we show that different molecular mechanisms converge on similar behavioural phenotypes by demonstrating that the autism models <i>Cul3</i> and <i>Ptchd1</i>, despite having similar behavioural phenotypes, differ in their functional and molecular alteration. Our findings reveal a link between rapid perception controlled by subcortical pathways and appropriate learned interactions with the environment and define a nondevelopmental source of such deficits in ASD.

                Background Nintedanib (NTB) is a multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitor, been investigated for many disease conditions like idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), systemic sclerosis interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). NTB is available as oral capsule formulation, but its ability to detect degradants formed through oxidative, photolytic and hydrolytic processes makes it difficult to quantify. In the current work, a novel reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) method was developed and validated. Methods The developed method is simple, precise, reproducible, stable and accurate. The inherent stability of NTB was evaluated using the proposed analytical method approach and force degradation studies were carried out. NTB was separated chromatographically on the Shimadzu C18 column as stationary phase (250 ×4.6 mm, 5 µm) using an isocratic elution method with 0.1% v/v triethyl amine (TEA) in HPLC grade water and acetonitrile (ACN) in the ratio 35:65% v/v. The mobile phase was pumped at a constant flow rate of 1.0 ml/min, and the eluent was detected at 390 nm wavelength. Results NTB was eluted at 6.77±0.00 min of retention time (tR) with a correlation coefficient of 0.999, the developed method was linear in the concentration range of 0.5 µg/ml to 4.5 µg/ml. The recovery rate was found to be in the range of 99.391±0.468% for 1.5 µg/ml concentration. Six replicate standards were determined to have an % RSD of 0.04. Conclusion The formulation excipients didn’t interfere with the determination of NTB, demonstrating the specificity of the developed method. The proposed approach of the analytical method developed can be used to quantify the amount of NTB present in bulk drugs and pharmaceutical formulations.

                Background Various stemness markers (SOX2, OCT4, and NANOG) have been studied in odontogenic cysts and tumors. However, studies on SALL4 having similar properties of stemness has not been documented. Additionally, insight into fascin as a migratory molecule is less explored. In this study, the expression of SALL4 and fascin were evaluated in ameloblastoma, adenomatoid odontogenic tumor (AOT), odontogenic keratocyst (OKC), dentigerous cyst (DC), radicular cyst (RC), and calcifying odontogenic cyst (COC). Methods Semi-quantitative analysis of fascin and SALL4 immuno-positive cells was done in a total of 40 cases of ameloblastoma (11 plexiform, 12 follicular, 12 unicystic, and 5 desmoplastic) variants, 6 cases of AOT, 15 each of OKC, DC, RC and 5 of COC. Chi-square test was applied to evaluate the association between SALL4 and fascin expression in odontogenic cysts and tumors. Results Fascin immunopositivity was observed in peripheral ameloblast-like cells, and the expression was weak or absent in stellate reticulum-like cells. A moderate to weak immune-reactivity to SALL4 was observed in the cytoplasm of ameloblastoma, epithelial cells of dentigerous and radicular cysts, having a marked inflammatory infiltrate, which was an interesting observation. COC and AOT had negative to weak expressions. No recurrence has been reported. Conclusions Expression of fascin in ameloblastomas elucidate their role in motility and localized invasion. Its expression in less aggressive lesions like DC, COC, AOT will incite to explore the other functional properties of fascin. SALL4 expression in the cytoplasm of odontogenic cysts and tumors may represent inactive or mutant forms which requires further validation.

                Background: Worldwide, infertility affects about 15% of reproductive-age couples. In many cases, infertility can't be treated, however new treatment options with promising value have been involved in recent clinical trials. The aim of this clinical trial was to evaluate the impacts of adding coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) to letrozole on the results of spermiogram and sex hormone tests in men diagnosed with idiopathic oligoasthenoteratozoospermia (iOAT) syndrome, which is a type of male defective spermatogenesis of unknown etiology. Methods: This randomized, open-label, parallel two-arm interventional study included 67 adult male patients aged 18-60 years with a confirmed diagnosis of iOAT syndrome recruited from The High Institute for Infertility Diagnosis & Assisted Reproduction Technologies/Nahrain University. Patients were randomly separated into two groups, Group A included 29 patients treated with letrozole 2.5 mg tablet orally twice a week, Group B included 38 patients treated with a combination of letrozole 2.5 mg tablet orally twice a week plus CoQ10 400 mg per day. Both groups completed treatment for three months. Semen samples, serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), estradiol (E2), and testosterone (T) were analyzed at day one, and at the end of month one, two and three. Results: Both groups showed that sperm concentration, normal morphology, total sperm count and motility, serum testosterone and FSH levels, and T/E2 ratio were significantly increased, while estradiol levels significantly decreased after three months of treatment. Seminal fluid volume changed significantly in group A only. In comparing between the two groups, all measured parameters, apart from sperm motility and FSH level, demonstrated a significant difference after three months of treatment, while sperm volume reached significant value after only two months of therapy. Conclusions: CoQ10 as adjuvant treatment to letrozole effectively improved most of the tested sperm parameters in Iraqi men with iOAT. Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05847257, May 6, 2023).

                Background In recent times, the efforts to profile the language characteristics of bilinguals have been extended from mere documentation of proficiency in each language to the determination of language dominance that captures both proficiency and usage (i.e., frequency & contexts) of each language. In multilingual countries, individuals are immersed in various languages in different contexts. With the broader intention to improve the linguistic profiling of bilinguals in countries with similar characteristics, we aimed to adapt and validate the Self-report classification tool in Indian Kannada-English bilinguals. Methods A group of 88 adult Kannada-English bilingual participants self-rated their language proficiency. We measured their language dominance with the adapted tool. Finally, to objectively measure their language abilities, we used the short version of the Bilingual Aphasia Test. Results Discriminant analysis of the ratings showed that the self-report classification tool accurately classified our participants into three groups based on language dominance. Both the self-rating and the objective measure of language proficiency supported the (dominance) classifications by the adapted tool. Conclusion Findings show that the adapted self-report classification tool is valid for determining language dominance in Kannada-English bilinguals. Further, the current study shows that this tool is adaptable to novel bilingual language dyads.

                Background Tissue engineering research aims to address the global shortage of donated corneal tissue, yet challenges persist in clinical translation. This study assesses the pathway from basic research to clinical adoption in corneal tissue engineering. Methods Bibliometric and patent analyses were conducted using the Web of Science-Core Collection and Lens databases to identify top authors, countries, journals, publication trends, inventors, patent statuses, and affiliated companies. A quality-adjusted life year (QALY) analysis compared engineered corneal endothelium to full keratoplasty. A pilot study surveyed thirty ophthalmologist surgeons from eight Latin American countries. Results A strong upward publication trend (R2 = 0.89, p = 1.53x10^-9) in corneal endothelium engineering was observed over the past decade, led by the USA, China, and Japan. Among 614 research papers, 26 patents and 10 companies were identified. Engineered corneal endothelium showed a QALY gain of 0.74 versus 0.07 of corneal transplants. Most survey respondents (97%) expressed interest in adopting engineered corneal endothelium for transplantation if affordability, biocompatibility, and functionality were assured. Conclusions While tissue engineering offers promise in alleviating corneal scarcity, a significant gap remains between scientific advancements and clinical adoption, presenting “death valleys.” Addressing this requires more efficient navigation of the interplay between scientific progress, technology adoption, and clinical practice.

                α-Synuclein (αS) is an abundant presynaptic protein that regulates neurotransmission. It is also a key protein implicated in a broad class of neurodegenerative disorders termed synucleinopathies, including Parkinson’s disease (PD) and Lewy body dementia (LBD). Pathological αS deposits in these diseases, Lewy bodies (LBs)/neurites (LNs), contain about 90% of αS in its phospho-serine129 (pS129) form. Therefore, pS129 is widely used as a surrogate marker of pathology. However, recent findings demonstrate that pS129 is also physiologically triggered by neuronal activity to positively regulate synaptic transmission. In this opinion article, we contrast the literature on pathological and physiological pS129, with a special focus on the latter. We emphasize that pS129 is ambiguous and knowledge about the context is necessary to correctly interpret changes in pS129.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93094">7,8-Dihydroxyflavone is a direct inhibitor of human and murine pyridoxal phosphatase</a></h4>

              
                Vitamin B6 deficiency has been linked to cognitive impairment in human brain disorders for decades. Still, the molecular mechanisms linking vitamin B6 to these pathologies remain poorly understood, and whether vitamin B6 supplementation improves cognition is unclear as well. Pyridoxal 5’-phosphate phosphatase (PDXP), an enzyme that controls levels of pyridoxal 5’-phosphate (PLP), the co-enzymatically active form of vitamin B6, may represent an alternative therapeutic entry point into vitamin B6-associated pathologies. However, pharmacological PDXP inhibitors to test this concept are lacking. We now identify a PDXP and age-dependent decline of PLP levels in the murine hippocampus that provides a rationale for the development of PDXP inhibitors. Using a combination of small-molecule screening, protein crystallography, and biolayer interferometry, we discover, visualize, and analyze 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF) as a direct and potent PDXP inhibitor. 7,8-DHF binds and reversibly inhibits PDXP with low micromolar affinity and sub-micromolar potency. In mouse hippocampal neurons, 7,8-DHF increases PLP in a PDXP-dependent manner. These findings validate PDXP as a druggable target. Of note, 7,8-DHF is a well-studied molecule in brain disorder models, although its mechanism of action is actively debated. Our discovery of 7,8-DHF as a PDXP inhibitor offers novel mechanistic insights into the controversy surrounding 7,8-DHF-mediated effects in the brain.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95856">Obox4 promotes zygotic genome activation upon loss of Dux</a></h4>

              
                Once fertilized, mouse zygotes rapidly proceed to zygotic genome activation (ZGA), during which long terminal repeats (LTRs) of murine endogenous retroviruses with leucine tRNA primer (MERVL) are activated by a conserved homeodomain-containing transcription factor, DUX. However, <i>Dux</i>-knockout embryos produce fertile mice, suggesting that ZGA is redundantly driven by an unknown factor(s). Here we present multiple lines of evidence that the multicopy homeobox gene, <i>Obox4</i>, encodes a transcription factor that is highly expressed in mouse 2-cell embryos and redundantly drives ZGA. Genome-wide profiling revealed that OBOX4 specifically binds and activates MERVL LTRs as well as a subset of murine endogenous retroviruses with lysine tRNA primer (MERVK) LTRs. Depletion of<i> Obox4 </i>is tolerated by embryogenesis, whereas concomitant <i>Obox4</i>/<i>Dux</i> depletion markedly compromises embryonic development. Our study identified OBOX4 as a transcription factor that provides genetic redundancy to pre-implantation development.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97489">Convergence of inputs from the basal ganglia with layer 5 of motor cortex and cerebellum in mouse motor thalamus</a></h4>

              
                A key to motor control is the motor thalamus, where several inputs converge. One excitatory input originates from layer 5 of primary motor cortex (M1<sub>L5</sub>), while another arises from the deep cerebellar nuclei (Cb). M1<sub>L5</sub> terminals distribute throughout the motor thalamus and overlap with GABAergic inputs from the basal ganglia output nuclei, the internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPi) and substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr). In contrast, it is thought that Cb and basal ganglia inputs are segregated. Therefore, we hypothesized that one potential function of the GABAergic inputs from basal ganglia is to selectively inhibit, or gate, excitatory signals from M1<sub>L5</sub> in the motor thalamus. Here, we tested this possibility and determined the circuit organization of mouse (both sexes) motor thalamus using an optogenetic strategy in acute slices. First, we demonstrated the presence of a feedforward transthalamic pathway from M1<sub>L5</sub> through motor thalamus. Importantly, we discovered that GABAergic inputs from the GPi and SNr converge onto single motor thalamic cells with excitatory synapses from M1<sub>L5</sub>. Separately, we also demonstrate that, perhaps unexpectedly, GABAergic GPi and SNr inputs converge with those from the Cb. We interpret these results to indicate that a role of the basal ganglia is to gate the thalamic transmission of M1<sub>L5</sub> and Cb information to cortex.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95297">Secreted antigen A peptidoglycan hydrolase is essential for Enterococcus faecium cell separation and priming of immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy</a></h4>

              
                <i>Enterococcus faecium</i> is a microbiota species in humans that can modulate host immunity (Griffin and Hang, 2022), but has also acquired antibiotic resistance and is a major cause of hospital-associated infections (Van Tyne and Gilmore, 2014). Notably, diverse strains of <i>E. faecium</i> produce SagA, a highly conserved peptidoglycan hydrolase that is sufficient to promote intestinal immunity (Rangan et al., 2016; Pedicord et al., 2016; Kim et al., 2019) and immune checkpoint inhibitor antitumor activity (Griffin et al., 2021). However, the functions of SagA in <i>E. faecium</i> were unknown. Here, we report that deletion of <i>sagA</i> impaired <i>E. faecium</i> growth and resulted in bulged and clustered enterococci due to defective peptidoglycan cleavage and cell separation. Moreover, Δ<i>sagA</i> showed increased antibiotic sensitivity, yielded lower levels of active muropeptides, displayed reduced activation of the peptidoglycan pattern-recognition receptor NOD2, and failed to promote cancer immunotherapy. Importantly, the plasmid-based expression of SagA, but not its catalytically inactive mutant, restored Δ<i>sagA</i> growth, production of active muropeptides, and NOD2 activation. SagA is, therefore, essential for <i>E. faecium</i> growth, stress resistance, and activation of host immunity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92673">Cell-autonomous role of leucine-rich repeat kinase in the protection of dopaminergic neuron survival</a></h4>

              
                Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are the most common genetic cause of Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, whether LRRK2 mutations cause PD and degeneration of dopaminergic (DA) neurons via a toxic gain-of-function or a loss-of-function mechanism is unresolved and has pivotal implications for LRRK2-based PD therapies. In this study, we investigate whether <i>Lrrk2</i> and its functional homolog <i>Lrrk1</i> play a cell-intrinsic role in DA neuron survival through the development of DA neuron-specific <i>Lrrk</i> conditional double knockout (cDKO) mice. Unlike <i>Lrrk</i> germline DKO mice, DA neuron-restricted <i>Lrrk</i> cDKO mice exhibit normal mortality but develop age-dependent loss of DA neurons, as shown by the progressive reduction of DA neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) at the ages of 20 and 24 months. Moreover, DA neurodegeneration is accompanied with increases in apoptosis and elevated microgliosis in the SNpc as well as decreases in DA terminals in the striatum, and is preceded by impaired motor coordination. Taken together, these findings provide the unequivocal evidence for the cell-intrinsic requirement of LRRK in DA neurons and raise the possibility that LRRK2 mutations may impair its protection of DA neurons, leading to DA neurodegeneration in PD.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91532">Deciphering the genetic code of neuronal type connectivity through bilinear modeling</a></h4>

              
                Understanding how different neuronal types connect and communicate is critical to interpreting brain function and behavior. However, it has remained a formidable challenge to decipher the genetic underpinnings that dictate the specific connections formed between neuronal types. To address this, we propose a novel bilinear modeling approach that leverages the architecture similar to that of recommendation systems. Our model transforms the gene expressions of presynaptic and postsynaptic neuronal types, obtained from single-cell transcriptomics, into a covariance matrix. The objective is to construct this covariance matrix that closely mirrors a connectivity matrix, derived from connectomic data, reflecting the known anatomical connections between these neuronal types. When tested on a dataset of <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>, our model achieved a performance comparable to, if slightly better than, the previously proposed spatial connectome model (SCM) in reconstructing electrical synaptic connectivity based on gene expressions. Through a comparative analysis, our model not only captured all genetic interactions identified by the SCM but also inferred additional ones. Applied to a mouse retinal neuronal dataset, the bilinear model successfully recapitulated recognized connectivity motifs between bipolar cells and retinal ganglion cells, and provided interpretable insights into genetic interactions shaping the connectivity. Specifically, it identified unique genetic signatures associated with different connectivity motifs, including genes important to cell-cell adhesion and synapse formation, highlighting their role in orchestrating specific synaptic connections between these neurons. Our work establishes an innovative computational strategy for decoding the genetic programming of neuronal type connectivity. It not only sets a new benchmark for single-cell transcriptomic analysis of synaptic connections but also paves the way for mechanistic studies of neural circuit assembly and genetic manipulation of circuit wiring.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/86722">Rapid, DNA-induced interface swapping by DNA gyrase</a></h4>

              
                DNA gyrase, a ubiquitous bacterial enzyme, is a type IIA topoisomerase formed by heterotetramerisation of 2 GyrA subunits and 2 GyrB subunits, to form the active complex. DNA gyrase can loop DNA around the C-terminal domains (CTDs) of GyrA and pass one DNA duplex through a transient double-strand break (DSB) established in another duplex. This results in the conversion from a positive (+1) to a negative (–1) supercoil, thereby introducing negative supercoiling into the bacterial genome by steps of 2, an activity essential for DNA replication and transcription. The strong protein interface in the GyrA dimer must be broken to allow passage of the transported DNA segment and it is generally assumed that the interface is usually stable and only opens when DNA is transported, to prevent the introduction of deleterious DSBs in the genome. In this paper, we show that DNA gyrase can exchange its DNA-cleaving interfaces between two active heterotetramers. This so-called interface ‘swapping’ (IS) can occur within a few minutes in solution. We also show that bending of DNA by gyrase is essential for cleavage but not for DNA binding per se and favors IS. Interface swapping is also favored by DNA wrapping and an excess of GyrB. We suggest that proximity, promoted by GyrB oligomerization and binding and wrapping along a length of DNA, between two heterotetramers favors rapid interface swapping. This swapping does not require ATP, occurs in the presence of fluoroquinolones, and raises the possibility of non-homologous recombination solely through gyrase activity. The ability of gyrase to undergo interface swapping explains how gyrase heterodimers, containing a single active-site tyrosine, can carry out double-strand passage reactions and therefore suggests an alternative explanation to the recently proposed ‘swivelling’ mechanism for DNA gyrase (Gubaev et al., 2016).

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91876">Defective mesenchymal Bmpr1a-mediated BMP signaling causes congenital pulmonary cysts</a></h4>

              
                Abnormal lung development can cause congenital pulmonary cysts, the mechanisms of which remain largely unknown. Although the cystic lesions are believed to result directly from disrupted airway epithelial cell growth, the extent to which developmental defects in lung mesenchymal cells contribute to abnormal airway epithelial cell growth and subsequent cystic lesions has not been thoroughly examined. In the present study using genetic mouse models, we dissected the roles of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) receptor 1a (Bmpr1a)-mediated BMP signaling in lung mesenchyme during prenatal lung development and discovered that abrogation of mesenchymal <i>Bmpr1a</i> disrupted normal lung branching morphogenesis, leading to the formation of prenatal pulmonary cystic lesions. Severe deficiency of airway smooth muscle cells and subepithelial elastin fibers were found in the cystic airways of the mesenchymal <i>Bmpr1a</i> knockout lungs. In addition, ectopic mesenchymal expression of BMP ligands and airway epithelial perturbation of the Sox2-Sox9 proximal-distal axis were detected in the mesenchymal <i>Bmpr1a</i> knockout lungs. However, deletion of Smad1/5, two major BMP signaling downstream effectors, from the lung mesenchyme did not phenocopy the cystic abnormalities observed in the mesenchymal <i>Bmpr1a</i> knockout lungs, suggesting that a Smad-independent mechanism contributes to prenatal pulmonary cystic lesions. These findings reveal for the first time the role of mesenchymal BMP signaling in lung development and a potential pathogenic mechanism underlying congenital pulmonary cysts.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88942">Single-cell transcriptome analysis of cavernous tissues reveals the key roles of pericytes in diabetic erectile dysfunction</a></h4>

              
                Erectile dysfunction (ED) affects a significant proportion of men aged 40–70 and is caused by cavernous tissue dysfunction. Presently, the most common treatment for ED is phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors; however, this is less effective in patients with severe vascular disease such as diabetic ED. Therefore, there is a need for development of new treatment, which requires a better understanding of the cavernous microenvironment and cell-cell communications under diabetic condition. Pericytes are vital in penile erection; however, their dysfunction due to diabetes remains unclear. In this study, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing to understand the cellular landscape of cavernous tissues and cell type-specific transcriptional changes in diabetic ED. We found a decreased expression of genes associated with collagen or extracellular matrix organization and angiogenesis in diabetic fibroblasts, chondrocytes, myofibroblasts, valve-related lymphatic endothelial cells, and pericytes. Moreover, the newly identified pericyte-specific marker, Limb Bud-Heart (Lbh)<i>,</i> in mouse and human cavernous tissues, clearly distinguishing pericytes from smooth muscle cells. Cell-cell interaction analysis revealed that pericytes are involved in angiogenesis, adhesion, and migration by communicating with other cell types in the corpus cavernosum; however, these interactions were highly reduced under diabetic conditions. Lbh expression is low in diabetic pericytes, and overexpression of LBH prevents erectile function by regulating neurovascular regeneration. Furthermore, the LBH-interacting proteins (Crystallin Alpha B and Vimentin) were identified in mouse cavernous pericytes through LC-MS/MS analysis, indicating that their interactions were critical for maintaining pericyte function. Thus, our study reveals novel targets and insights into the pathogenesis of ED in patients with diabetes.

">NMDA receptor antagonist memantine selectively affects recurrent processing during perceptual inference</a></h4>

              
                Perceptual inference requires the integration of visual features through recurrent processing, the dynamic exchange of information between higher and lower level cortical regions. While animal research has demonstrated a crucial role of NMDA receptors in recurrent processing, establishing a causal link between NMDA-mediated recurrent processing and human perception has remained challenging. Here, we report two pharmacological studies with randomized, double-blind, crossover designs in which we administered the NMDA antagonist memantine, while collecting human electroencephalography (EEG). We trained and tested EEG classifiers to reflect the processing of specific stimulus features with increasing levels of complexity, namely differences in stimulus contrast, collinearity between local line elements, and illusory surfaces of a Kanizsa triangle. In two experiments involving different participants and visual tasks, we found that memantine selectively affected decoding of the Kanizsa illusion, known to depend on recurrent processing, while leaving decoding of contrast and collinearity largely unaffected. Interestingly, the results from an attentional blink (experiment 1) and task-relevance manipulation (experiment 2) showed that memantine was only effective when the stimulus was attended and consciously accessed. These findings demonstrate that NMDA inhibition selectively affects recurrent processing, especially for attended objects, and thereby provide a crucial step toward bridging animal and human research, shedding light on the neural mechanisms underpinning perceptual inference and conscious perception.

">Lack of Oncomodulin Increases ATP-Dependent Calcium Signaling and Susceptibility to Noise in Adult Mice</a></h4>

              
                Tight regulation of Ca2+ is crucial for the function of cochlear outer hair cells (OHCs). Dysregulation of Ca2+ homeostasis in OHCs is associated with impaired hearing function and contributes to increased vulnerability to environmental insults, such as noise exposure. Ca2+ signaling in developing OHCs can be modulated by oncomodulin (OCM), an EF-hand calcium-binding protein. Here, we investigated whether the lack of OCM disrupts the control of intracellular Ca2+ in mature OHCs, and influences vulnerability to noise. Using young adult CBA/CaJ mice, we found that OHCs from Ocm-knockout (Ocm-/-) mice exhibited normal biophysical profiles and electromotile responses compared to littermate control OHCs. Moderate noise exposure (95 dB SPL, 2 hrs) caused temporary hearing threshold shifts in Ocm+/+ and Ocm-/- mice but the loss of hearing was permanent for Ocm-/- mice. However, while Ocm+/+ fully recovered their hearing 2 weeks after noise exposure, Ocm-/- mice showed permanent threshold shifts. Using a genetically encoded Ca2+ sensor (GCaMP6s) expressed in Ocm+/+ and Ocm-/- OHCs, we found that chronic noise exposure (95 dB SPL, 9 hrs) increased ATP-induced Ca2+ signaling in Ocm-/- OHCs compared to Ocm+/+ OHCs. Chronic noise exposures also caused higher hearing threshold shifts in Ocm-/- mice. Prior to noise exposure, P2X2 expression was already upregulated in Ocm-/- mice compared to Ocm+/+ mice. Following chronic noise, P2X2 receptors were upregulated in the Ocm+/+ cochlea but not in the Ocm-/- cochlea, which retains their pre-noise high expression level. We propose that the lack of OCM increases susceptibility to noise. Increased purinergic signaling and dysregulation of cytosolic Ca2+ homeostasis could contribute to early onset hearing loss in the Ocm-/- mice.

">Hierarchical Bayesian inference to model continuous phenotypical progression in Alzheimer's Disease</a></h4>

              
                Throughout an organism's lifespan, a multitude of biological systems transition through complex biophysical processes. These processes serve as indicators of the underlying biological states. Inferring these latent unobserved states is a key problem in modern biology and neuroscience. Unfortunately, in many experimental setups, we can at best obtain snapshots of the system at different times for different individuals, and one major challenge is the one of reconciling those measurements. This formalism is particularly relevant in the study of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) progression, in which we observe in brain donors the aggregation of pathological proteins but the underlying disease state is unknown. The progression of AD can be modeled by assigning a latent score - termed pseudotime - to each pathological state, creating a pseudotemporal ordering of donors based on their pathological burden. This paper proposes a hierarchical Bayesian framework to model AD progression using detailed quantification of multiple AD pathological proteins from the Seattle AD Brain Cell Atlas consortium (SEA-AD). Inspired by biophysical models, we model pathological burden as an exponential process. Theoretical properties of the model are studied, by using linearization to reveal convergence and identifiability properties. We provide Markov chain Monte Carlo estimation algorithms, and show the effectiveness of our approach with multiple simulation studies across data conditions. Applying the methodology to SEA-AD brain data, we infer pseudotime for each donor and order them by pathological burden. Finally, we analyze the information within each pathological feature and utilize it to refine the model by focusing on the most informative pathologies. This lays the groundwork for suggesting future experimental design approaches.

">Retinoid X Receptor as a Novel Drug Target to Treat Neurological Disorders Associated with α-Synucleinopathies.</a></h4>

              
                The pathology of Parkinson Disease (PD) is multifaceted, with chronic neuroinflammation associated with glial cell activation standing out as a hallmark of PD pathophysiology. While a few treatments exist to interfere with inflammation, a breakthrough therapy based on innovative molecular mechanisms and targets is still awaited. The nuclear retinoid X receptor (RXR) is of particular interest for therapeutic intervention due to its ability to bind and activate permissive partners, NURR1 and PPARs, which have been shown to be dysfunctional in PD brains. Therefore, the goal of this study was to validate RXR-based therapy to slow down PD pathogenesis. Adult C57BL6 male mice were used in the study. PD-like pathology was triggered by co-delivery of AAV expressing alpha-synuclein and PFF to the substantia nigra pars compacta. The therapeutic potential of RXR activation was evaluated using AAV-mediated gene transport. Unbiased stereology, immunohistochemical analysis, LC/MS, and western blotting were employed to assess the therapeutic effect. At 8 weeks post-injection, elevated GFAP and Iba1 levels, associated with accumulated LB-like aggregates, pronounced loss of TH neuronal cells, and diminished dopamine (DA) levels were observed in affected brains. Moreover, PPAR and NURR1 protein levels were also reduced in these brains. Conversely, RXR overexpression resulted in an increase in PPAR and NURR1 levels, a reduction in GFAP and Iba1 levels, and a decrease in the number and distribution of LB-like aggregates. These phenomena were also accompanied by the prevention of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)+ cell loss and the DA deficit in the treated brains. Therefore, our data provide direct evidence of the therapeutic potential of RXR-based therapy and highlight RXR as a novel drug target for PD.

">Human sensory-like neuron cultivation - an optimized protocol</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Reprogramming of human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) and their differentiation into specific cell types, such as induced sensory-like neurons (iSN), are critical for disease modeling and drug testing. However, the variability of cell populations challenges reliability and reproducibility. While various protocols for iSN differentiation exist, development of non-iSN cells in these cultures remains an issue. Therefore, standardization of protocols is essential. This study aimed to improve iSN culture conditions by reducing the number of non-iSN cells while preserving survival and quality of iSN. Methods: iSN were differentiated from a healthy control iPSC line using an established protocol. Interventions for protocol optimization included floxuridine (FdU) or 1-{beta}-D-arabinofuranosyl-cytosin-hydrochlorid (AraC) treatment, Magnetic-Activated Cell Sorting (MACS), early cell passaging, and replating. Cell viability and iSN-to-total-cell-count ratio were assessed using a luminescent assay and immunocytochemistry, respectively. Results: Passaging of cells during differentiation did not increase the iSN-to-total-cell-count ratio, and MACS of immature iSN led to neuronal blebbing and reduced the iSN-to-total-cell-count ratio. Treatment with high concentrations and prolonged incubation of FdU or AraC resulted in excessive cell death. However, treatment with 10 M FdU for 24 h post-differentiation showed the most selective targeting of non-iSN cells, leading to an increase in the iSN-to-total-cell count ratio without compromising the viability or functionality of the iSN population. Replating of iSN shortly after seeding also helped to reduce non-iSN cells. Conclusion: In direct comparison to other methods, treatment with 10 M FdU for 24 h after differentiation represents a promising approach to improve iSN culture purity, offering a potential benefit for downstream applications in disease modeling and drug discovery. However, further investigations involving multiple iPSC lines and optimization of protocol parameters are warranted to fully exploit the potential of this method and enhance its reproducibility and applicability. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into optimizing culture conditions for iSN differentiation and highlights the importance of standardized protocols in iPSC-based research.

">Amyloid beta oligomers dysregulate oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination via PKC in the zebrafish spinal cord</a></h4>

              
                Amyloid beta oligomers (Abetao) have been proposed as candidates to induce oligodendrocyte (OL) and myelin dysfunctions in early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. Nevertheless, little is known about how Abetao affect OL differentiation and myelination in vivo, and the underlying molecular mechanisms. In this study, we explored the effects of a brain intraventricular injection of Abetao on OLs and myelin in the developing spinal cord of zebrafish larvae. Using quantitative fluorescent in situ RNA hybridization assays, we demonstrated that Abetao altered myrf and mbp mRNA levels and the regional distribution of mbp during larval development, suggesting an early differentiation of OLs. Through live imaging of Tg(myrf:mScarlet) and Tg(mbp:tagRFP) zebrafish lines, both crossed with Tg(olig2:EGFP), we found that Abetao increased the number of myrf+ and mbp+ OLs in the dorsal spinal cord at 72 hpf and 5 dpf, respectively, without affecting total cell numbers. Furthermore, Abetao also increased the number of myelin sheaths per OL and the number of myelinated axons in the dorsal spinal cord compared to vehicle-injected control animals. Interestingly, the treatment of Abetao-injected zebrafish with the pan-PKC inhibitor Go6983 restored the aforementioned alterations in OLs and myelin to control levels. Altogether, not only do we demonstrate that Abetao induce a precocious oligodendroglial differentiation leading to dysregulated myelination, but we also identified PKC as a key player in Abetao-induced pathology.

">Dynamics of pitch perception in the auditory cortex</a></h4>

              
                The ability to perceive pitch allows human listeners to experience music, recognize the identity and emotion conveyed by conversational partners, and make sense of their auditory environment. A pitch percept is formed by weighting different acoustic cues (e.g., signal fundamental frequency and inter-harmonic spacing) and contextual cues (expectation). How and when such cues are neurally encoded and integrated remains debated. In this study, twenty-eight participants listened to tone sequences with different acoustic cues (pure tones, complex missing fundamental tones, and ambiguous mixtures), placed in predictable and less predictable sequences, while magnetoencephalography was recorded. Decoding analyses revealed that pitch was encoded in neural responses to all three tone types, in the low-to-mid auditory cortex, bilaterally, with right-hemisphere dominance. The pattern of activity generalized across cue-types, offset in time: pitch was neurally encoded earlier for harmonic tones (~85ms) than pure tones (~95ms). For ambiguous tones, pitch emerged significantly earlier in predictable contexts, and could be decoded even before tone onset. The results suggest that a unified neural representation of pitch emerges by integrating independent pitch cues, and that context alters the dynamics of pitch generation when acoustic cues are ambiguous.

">Visual neurons recognize complex image transformations</a></h4>

              
                Natural visual scenes are dominated by sequences of transforming images. Spatial visual information is thought to be processed by detection of elemental stimulus features which are recomposed into scenes. How image information is integrated over time is unclear. We explored visual information encoding in the optic tectum. Unbiased stimulus presentation shows that the majority of tectal neurons recognize image sequences. This is achieved by temporally dynamic response properties, which encode complex image transitions over several hundred milliseconds. Calcium imaging reveals that neurons that encode spatiotemporal image sequences fire in spike sequences that predict a logical diagram of spatiotemporal information processing. Furthermore, the temporal scale of visual information is tuned by experience. This study indicates how neurons recognize dynamic visual scenes that transform over time.

">Experience-dependent predictions of feedforward and contextual information in mouse visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                Neurons in primary visual cortex are driven by feedforward visual inputs and top-down contextual inputs. The nature of this contextual information is difficult to study, as responses to feedforward and top-down inputs overlap in time and are difficult to disentangle experimentally. To address this issue, we measured responses to natural images and partially occluded versions of these images in the visual cortex of mice. Assessing neuronal responses before and after familiarizing mice with the non-occluded images allowed us to study experience-dependent and stimulus-specific contextual responses in pyramidal cells (PyCs) in cortical layers 2/3 and 5 in the absence of feedforward input. Surprisingly, in the same retinotopic region of cortex, we found that separate populations of PyCs in layer 2/3 responded to occluded and non-occluded images. Responses of PyCs selective for occluded images were strengthened upon familiarization and decoding analysis revealed they contained image-specific information, suggesting that they signaled the absence of predicted visual stimuli. Responses of PyCs selective for non-occluded scenes were weaker for familiarized images but stronger for unfamiliar images, suggesting that these neurons signaled the presence of unpredicted visual stimuli. Layer 5 also contained PyCs preferring either feedforward or contextual inputs, but their responses were more complex and strengthening of responses to occluded images required task engagement. The results show that visual experience decreases the activity of neurons responding to known feedforward inputs but increases the activity of neurons responding to contextual inputs tied to expected stimuli.

For the myriad of marine species, the ocean represents a complex sensory environment, which acts as a crucible of evolution for polymodal sensory perception. The cellular and molecular bases of polymodal sensory perception in a marine environment remain enigmatic. Here we use Ca2+ imaging and quantitative behavioral analysis to show that in the tunicate Ciona intestinalis two members of the evolutionarily conserved Anoctamin family1-4 (Tmem16E/Ano5 and Tmem16F/Ano6), are required for sensing chemosensory and mechanosensory metamorphic cues. We find that they act by modulating neuronal excitability and Ca2+ response kinetics in the primary sensory neurons and axial columnar cells of the papillae, a widely conserved sensory-adhesive organ across ascidians5-9. Finally, we use electrophysiological recordings and a scramblase assay in tissue culture to demonstrate that Tmem16E/Ano5 acts as a channel, while Tmem16F/Ano6 is a bifunctional ion channel and phospholipid scramblase. Our results establish Ano5 and Ano6 as novel players in the zooplanktonic, pre-vertebrate molecular toolkit that controls polymodal sensory perception in aquatic environments.

">Rapid emergence of latent knowledge in the sensory cortex drives learning</a></h4>

              
                Rapid learning confers significant advantages to animals in ecological environments. Despite the need for speed, animals appear to only slowly learn to associate rewarded actions with predictive cues. This slow learning is thought to be supported by a gradual expansion of predictive cue representation in the sensory cortex. However, evidence is growing that animals learn more rapidly than classical performance measures suggest, challenging the prevailing model of sensory cortical plasticity. Here, we investigated the relationship between learning and sensory cortical representations. We trained mice on an auditory go/no-go task that dissociated the rapid acquisition of task contingencies (learning) from its slower expression (performance). Optogenetic silencing demonstrated that the auditory cortex (AC) drives both rapid learning and slower performance gains but becomes dispensable at expert. Rather than enhancement or expansion of cue representations, two-photon calcium imaging of AC excitatory neurons throughout learning revealed two higher-order signals that were causal to learning and performance. First, a reward prediction (RP) signal emerged rapidly within tens of trials, was present after action-related errors only early in training, and faded at expert levels. Strikingly, silencing at the time of the RP signal impaired rapid learning, suggesting it serves an associative and teaching role. Second, a distinct cell ensemble encoded and controlled licking suppression that drove the slower performance improvements. These two ensembles were spatially clustered but uncoupled from underlying sensory representations, indicating a higher-order functional segregation within AC. Our results reveal that the sensory cortex manifests higher-order computations that separably drive rapid learning and slower performance improvements, reshaping our understanding of the fundamental role of the sensory cortex.

">Activity-Dependent Remodeling of Corticostriatal Axonal Boutons During Motor Learning</a></h4>

              
                Motor skill learning induces long-lasting synaptic plasticity at not only the inputs, such as dendritic spines1-4, but also at the outputs to the striatum of motor cortical neurons5,6. However, very little is known about the activity and structural plasticity of corticostriatal axons during learning in the adult brain. Here, we used longitudinal in vivo two-photon imaging to monitor the activity and structure of thousands of corticostriatal axonal boutons in the dorsolateral striatum in awake mice. We found that learning a new motor skill induces dynamic regulation of axonal boutons. The activities of motor corticostriatal axonal boutons exhibited selectivity for rewarded movements (RM) and un-rewarded movements (UM). Strikingly, boutons on the same axonal branches showed diverse responses during behavior. Motor learning significantly increased the fraction of RM boutons and reduced the heterogeneity of bouton activities. Moreover, motor learning-induced profound structural dynamism in boutons. By combining structural and functional imaging, we identified that newly formed axonal boutons are more likely to exhibit selectivity for RM and are stabilized during motor learning, while UM boutons are selectively eliminated. Our results highlight a novel form of plasticity at corticostriatal axons induced by motor learning, indicating that motor corticostriatal axonal boutons undergo dynamic reorganization that facilitates the acquisition and execution of motor skills.

">Dye-based Fluorescent Organic Nanoparticles, New Promising Tools for Optogenetics</a></h4>

              
                Dye-based fluorescent organic nanoparticles are a specific class of nanoparticles obtained by nanoprecipitation in water of pure dyes only. While the photophysical and colloidal properties of the nanoparticles strongly depend on the nature of the aggregated dyes, their excellent brightness in the visible and in the near infrared make these nanoparticles a unique and versatile platform for in vivo application. This article examines the promising utilization of these nanoparticles for in vivo optogenetics applications. Their photophysical properties as well as their biocompatibility and their capacity to activate Chrimson opsin in vivo through fluorescence reabsorption process are demonstrated. Additionally, an illustrative example of employing these nanoparticles in fear reduction in mice through close-loop stimulation is presented. Through an optogenetic methodology, the nanoparticles demonstrate an ability to selectively manipulate neurons implicated in the fear response and diminish the latter. Dye-based fluorescent organic nanoparticles represent a promising and innovative strategy for optogenetic applications, holding substantial potential in the domain of translational neuroscience. This work paves the way for novel therapeutic modalities for neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders.

                Spatial sequences encoded by cells in the hippocampal-entorhinal region have been observed to spontaneously alternate across the animal's midline during navigation in the open field, but it is unknown how this occurs. We show that sinusoidal sampling patterns emerge rapidly and robustly in a simple model of the hippocampus that makes no assumptions about sequence direction. We corroborate our findings using hippocampal data from rats navigating in the open field.

">Systemic and targeted activation of Nrf2 reverses doxorubicin-induced cognitive impairments and sensorimotor deficits in mice</a></h4>

              
                While cancer survivorship has increased due to advances in treatments, chemotherapy often carries long-lived neurotoxic side effects which reduce quality of life. Commonly affected domains include memory, executive function, attention, processing speed and sensorimotor function, colloquially known as chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment (CICI) or chemobrain. Oxidative stress and neuroimmune signaling in the brain have been mechanistically linked to the deleterious effects of chemotherapy on cognition and sensorimotor function. With this in mind, we tested if activation of the master regulator of antioxidant response nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) alleviates cognitive and sensorimotor impairments induced by doxorubicin. The FDA-approved systemic Nrf2 activator, diroximel fumarate (DRF) was used, along with our recently developed prodrug 1c which has the advantage of specifically releasing monomethyl fumarate at sites of oxidative stress. DRF and 1c both reversed doxorubicin-induced deficits in executive function, spatial and working memory, as well as decrements in fine motor coordination and grip strength, across both male and female mice. Both treatments reversed doxorubicin-induced loss of synaptic proteins and microglia phenotypic transition in the hippocampus. Doxorubicin-induced myelin damage in the corpus callosum was reversed by both Nrf2 activators. These results demonstrate the therapeutic potential of Nrf2 activators to reverse doxorubicin-induced cognitive impairments, motor incoordination, and associated structural and phenotypic changes in the brain. The localized release of monomethyl fumarate by 1c has the potential to diminish unwanted effects of fumarates while retaining efficacy.

">Communication subspace dynamics of the canonical olfactory pathway</a></h4>

              
                Understanding how different brain areas communicate is crucial for elucidating the mechanisms underlying cognition. A possible way for neural populations to interact is through a communication subspace, a specific region in the state-space enabling the transmission of behaviorally-relevant spiking patterns. In the olfactory system, it remains unclear if different populations employ such a mechanism. Our study reveals that neuronal ensembles in the main olfactory pathway (olfactory bulb to olfactory cortex) interact through a communication subspace, which is driven by nasal respiration and allows feedforward and feedback transmission to occur segregated along the sniffing cycle. Moreover, our results demonstrate that subspace communication depends causally on the activity of both areas, is hindered during anesthesia, and transmits a low-dimensional representation of odor.

">Induction of a Muller glial-specific protective pathway safeguards the retina from diabetes induced damage</a></h4>

              
                Diabetes can lead to cell-type-specific responses in the retina, including vascular lesions, glial dysfunction and neurodegeneration, all of which contribute to retinopathy. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these cell type-specific responses, and the cell types that are sensitive to diabetes have not been fully elucidated. Employing single cell transcriptomic analyses, we profiled the transcriptional changes induced by diabetes in different retinal cell types in diabetic rat models as the disease progressed. Rod photoreceptors, a subtype of amacrine interneurons, and Muller glial cells exhibited rapid responses to diabetes at the transcript levels. Genes associated with ion regulation were upregulated in all three cell types, suggesting a common response to diabetes. Furthermore, focused studies revealed that while Muller glial cells initially increased the expression of genes playing protective roles, they cannot sustain this beneficial effect as the disease progressed. We explored one of the candidate protective genes, Zinc finger protein 36 homolog (Zfp36), and observed that depleting Zfp36 in rat Muller glial cells in vivo using AAV-based tools exacerbated early diabetes-induced phenotypes, including gliosis, neurodegeneration, and vascular defects. Notably, the over-expression of Zfp36 slowed the development of phenotypes associated with diabetic retinopathy. In summary, this work unveiled retinal cell types that are sensitive to diabetes and demonstrated that Muller glial cells can mount protective responses through Zfp36. The failure to maintain Zfp36 levels contributes to the development of diabetic retinopathy.

">M1 Large-scale Network Dynamics Support Human Motor Resonance and Its Plastic Reshaping</a></h4>

              
                Motor resonance - the activation of the observer's motor system when viewing others' actions - grounds the intertwined nature of action perception and execution, with profound implications for social cognition and action understanding. Despite extensive research, the neural underpinnings supporting motor resonance emergence and rewriting remain unexplored. In this study, we investigated the role of sensorimotor associative learning in motor resonance neural mechanisms. To this aim, we applied cross-systems paired associative stimulation (PAS) to induce novel visuomotor associations in the human brain. This protocol, which repeatedly pairs transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) pulses over the primary motor cortex (M1) with visual stimuli of actions, drives the emergence of an atypical, PAS-conditioned motor resonance response. Using TMS and electroencephalography (EEG) co-registration during action observation, we tracked the M1 functional connectivity profile during this process to map the inter-areal connectivity profiles associated with typical and PAS-induced motor resonance phenomena. Besides confirming, at the corticospinal level, the emergence of newly acquired motor resonance responses at the cost of typical ones after PAS administration, our results reveal dissociable aspects of motor resonance in M1 interregional communication. On the one side, typical motor resonance effects acquired through the lifespan are associated with prominent M1 alpha-band and reduced beta-band connectivity, which might facilitate the corticospinal output while integrating visuomotor information. Conversely, the atypical PAS-induced motor resonance is linked to M1 beta-band cortical connectivity modulations, only partially overlapping with interregional communication patterns related to the typical mirroring responses. This evidence suggests that beta-phase synchronization may be the critical mechanism supporting the formation of motor resonance by coordinating the activity of motor regions during action observation, which also involves alpha-band top-down control of frontal areas. These findings provide new insights into the neural dynamics underlying (typical and newly acquired) motor resonance, highlighting the role of large-scale interregional communication in sensorimotor associative learning within the action observation network.

">Translational profiling reveals novel gene expression changes in the direct and indirect pathways in a mouse model of LDOPA-induced dyskinesia</a></h4>

              
                The molecular mechanisms underlying L dihydroxyphenylalanine (LDOPA) induced dyskinesia in Parkinson's disease are poorly understood. Here we employ two transgenic mouse lines, combining translating ribosomal affinity purification (TRAP) with bacterial artificial chromosome expression (Bac), to selectively isolate RNA from either DRD1A expressing striatonigral, or DRD2 expressing striatopallidal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) of the direct and indirect pathways respectively, to study changes in translational gene expression following repeated LDOPA treatment. 6-OHDA lesioned DRD1A and DRD2 BacTRAP mice were treated with either saline or LDOPA bi-daily for 21 days over which time they developed abnormal involuntary movements reminiscent of dyskinesia. On day 22, all animals received LDOPA 40 minutes prior to sacrifice. The striatum of the lesioned hemisphere was dissected and subject to TRAP. Extracted ribosomal RNA was amplified, purified and gene expression was quantified using microarray. 195 significantly varying transcripts were identified among the 4 treatment groups. Pathway analysis revealed an overrepresentation of calcium signaling and long-term potentiation in the DRD1A expressing MSNs of the direct pathway, with significant involvement of long-term depression in the DRD2 expressing MSNs of the indirect pathway following chronic treatment with LDOPA. Several MAPK associated genes (NR4A1, GADD45G, STMN1, FOS and DUSP1) differentiated the direct and indirect pathways following both acute and chronic LDOPA treatment. However, the MAPK pathway activator PAK1 was downregulated in the indirect pathway and upregulated in the direct pathway, strongly suggesting a role for PAK1 in regulating the opposing effects of LDOPA on these two pathways in dyskinesia. Future studies will assess the potential of targeting these genes and pathways to prevent the development of LDOPA-induced dyskinesia.

">Predictive coding model can detect novelty on different levels of representation hierarchy</a></h4>

              
                Novelty detection, also known as familiarity discrimination or recognition memory, refers to the ability to distinguish whether a stimulus has been seen before. It has been hypothesized that novelty detection can naturally arise within networks that store memory or learn efficient neural representation, because these networks already store information on familiar stimuli. However, computational models instantiating this hypothesis have not been shown to reproduce high capacity of human recognition memory, so it is unclear if this hypothesis is feasible. This paper demonstrates that predictive coding, which is an established model previously shown to effectively support representation learning and memory, can also naturally discriminate novelty with high capacity. Predictive coding model includes neurons encoding prediction errors, and we show that these neurons produce higher activity for novel stimuli, so that the novelty can be decoded from their activity. Moreover, the hierarchical predictive coding networks uniquely perform novelty detection at varying abstraction levels across the hierarchy, i.e., they can detect both novel low-level features, and novel higher-level objects. Overall, we unify novelty detection, associative memory, and representation learning within a single computational framework.

">Wavelet transform of single-trial vestibular short-latency evoked potential reveals temporary reduction in signal detectability and temporal precision following noise exposure</a></h4>

              
                The vestibular short-latency evoked potential (VsEP) reflects the activity of irregular vestibular afferents and their target neurons in the brain stem. Attenuation of trial-averaged VsEP waveforms is widely accepted as an indicator of vestibular dysfunction, however, more quantitative analyses of VsEP waveforms could reveal underlying neural properties of VsEP waveforms. Here, we present a time-frequency analysis of the VsEP with a wavelet transform on a single-trial basis, which allows us to examine trial-by-trial variability in the strength of VsEP waves as well as their temporal coherence across trials. Using this method, we examined changes in the VsEP following 110 dB SPL noise exposure in rats. We found detectability of head jerks based on the power of wavelet transform coefficients was significantly reduced 1 day after noise exposure but recovered nearly to pre-exposure level in 3 - 7 days and completely by 28 days after exposure. Temporal coherence of VsEP waves across trials was also significantly reduced on 1 day after exposure but recovered with a similar time course. Additionally, we found a significant reduction in the number of calretinin-positive calyces in the sacculi collected 28 days after noise exposure. Furthermore, the number of calretinin-positive calyces was significantly correlated with the degree of reduction in temporal coherence and/or signal detectability of the smallest-amplitude jerks. This new analysis of the VsEP provides more quantitative descriptions of noise-induced changes as well as new insights into potential mechanisms underlying noise-induced vestibular dysfunction.

">Neural correlates of retrieval success and precision: an fMRI study</a></h4>

              
                Prior studies examining the neural mechanisms underlying retrieval success and precision have yielded inconsistent results. Here, their neural correlates were examined using a memory task that assessed precision for spatial location. A sample of healthy young adults underwent fMRI scanning during a single study-test cycle. At study, participants viewed a series of object images, each placed at a randomly selected location on an imaginary circle. At test, studied images were intermixed with new images and presented to the participants. The requirement was to move a cursor to the location of the studied image, guessing if necessary. Participants then signaled whether the presented image as having been studied. Memory precision was quantified as the angle between the studied location and the location selected by the participant. A precision effect was evident in the left angular gyrus, where BOLD activity covaried across trials with location accuracy. Multi-voxel pattern analysis also revealed a significant item-level reinstatement effect for high-precision trials. There was no evidence of a retrieval success effect in the angular gyrus. BOLD activity in the hippocampus was insensitive to both success and precision. These findings are partially consistent with prior evidence that success and precision are dissociable features of memory retrieval.

">A minimally invasive thrombotic stroke model to study circadian rhythm in awake mice</a></h4>

              
                Experimental stroke models in rodents are essential for mechanistic studies and therapeutic development. However, these models have several limitations negatively impacting their translational relevance. Here we aimed to develop a minimally invasive thrombotic stroke model through magnetic particle delivery that does not require craniotomy, is amenable to reperfusion therapy, can be combined with in vivo imaging modalities, and can be performed in awake mice. We found that the model results in reproducible cortical infarcts within the middle cerebral artery (MCA) with cytologic and immune changes similar to that observed with more invasive distal MCA occlusion models. Importantly, the injury produced by the model was ameliorated by tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) administration. We also show that MCA occlusion in awake animals results in bigger ischemic lesions independent of day/night cycle. Magnetic particle delivery had no overt effects on physiologic parameters and systemic immune biomarkers. In conclusion, we developed a novel stroke model in mice that fulfills many requirements for modeling human stroke.

">Neural Prioritisation of Past Solutions Supports Generalisation</a></h4>

              
                Generalisation from past experience is an important feature of intelligent systems. When faced with a new task, efficient generalisation can be achieved by evaluating solutions to earlier tasks as candidates for reuse. Consistent with this idea, we found that human participants (n=40) learned optimal solutions to a set of training tasks and continued to reuse them on novel test tasks. Corresponding functional magnetic resonance imaging data showed that optimal solutions from the training tasks were represented on test tasks in occipitotemporal and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. These findings suggest that humans evaluate and generalise successful past solutions when attempting to solve new tasks.

">Dopamine-driven Increase in IL-1β in Myeloid Cells is Mediated by Differential Dopamine Receptor Expression and Exacerbated by HIV</a></h4>

              
                The catecholamine neurotransmitter dopamine is classically known for regulation of central nervous system (CNS) functions such as reward, movement, and cognition. Increasing evidence also indicates that dopamine regulates critical functions in peripheral organs and is an important immunoregulatory factor. We have previously shown that dopamine increases NF-{kappa}B activity, inflammasome activation, and the production of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1{beta} in human macrophages. As myeloid lineage cells are central to the initiation and resolution of acute inflammatory responses, dopamine-mediated dysregulation of these functions could both impair the innate immune response and exacerbate chronic inflammation. However, the exact pathways by which dopamine drives myeloid inflammation are not well defined, and studies in both rodent and human systems indicate that dopamine can impact the production of inflammatory mediators through both D1-like dopamine receptors (DRD1, DRD5) and D2-like dopamine receptors (DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4). Therefore, we hypothesized that dopamine-mediated production of IL-1{beta} in myeloid cells is regulated by the ratio of different dopamine receptors that are activated. Our data in primary human monocyte-derived macrophages (hMDM) indicate that DRD1 expression is necessary for dopamine-mediated increases in IL-1{beta}, and that changes in the expression of DRD2 and other dopamine receptors can alter the magnitude of the dopamine-mediated increase in IL-1{beta}. Mature hMDM have a high D1-like to D2-like receptor ratio, which is different relative to monocytes and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). We further confirm in human microglia cell lines that a high ratio of D1-like to D2-like receptors promotes dopamine-induced increases in IL-1{beta} gene and protein expression using pharmacological inhibition or overexpression of dopamine receptors. RNA-sequencing of dopamine-treated microglia shows that genes encoding functions in IL-1{beta} signaling pathways, microglia activation, and neurotransmission increased with dopamine treatment. Finally, using HIV as an example of a chronic inflammatory disease that is substantively worsened by comorbid substance use disorders (SUDs) that impact dopaminergic signaling, we show increased effects of dopamine on inflammasome activation and IL-1{beta} in the presence of HIV in both human macrophages and microglia. These data suggest that use of addictive substances and dopamine-modulating therapeutics could dysregulate the innate inflammatory response and exacerbate chronic neuroimmunological conditions like HIV. Thus, a detailed understanding of dopamine-mediated changes in inflammation, in particular pathways regulating IL-1{beta}, will be critical to effectively tailor medication regimens.

">Inter-individual differences in cerebrovascular reactivity are synchronized within functional networks and tissue layers: evidence from healthy older adults and patients with hypertension</a></h4>

              
                Functional-connectivity mapping has primarily relied resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI), and resting-state functional networks (RSNs) have been used widely to represent interactions within brain circuits. However, recent work demonstrated that resting-state functional networks (RSNs) may co-exist with vascular networks. In this work, we clarify the nature of these vascular networks by assessing the spatial covariation structure in breath-holding-based CVR amplitude and lag in a group of healthy older adults. We demonstrate a spatial synchrony in CVR amplitude and lag co-variations across participants confined to RSNs. Such a network structure is not seen when looking at the time-variate BOLD signal response to the breathhold. a network structure is also maintained in older adults with clinical hypertension, demonstrating its robustness against vascular pathologies. CVR amplitude is also found to vary with tissue layer in the grey matter and white matter, being most variable in deep WM and least variable in superficial cortex. Conversely, CVR lag appears to be organized by fibre tracts. This work demonstrates the use of cross-participant covariation patterns in CVR as an informative way of mapping the vascular routes in the GM and WM, and also raises questions about the nature and interpretation of RSNs.

">Broken time reversal symmetry in visual motion detection</a></h4>

              
                Our intuition suggests that when a movie is played in reverse, our perception of motion in the reversed movie will be perfectly inverted compared to the original. This intuition is also reflected in many classical theoretical and practical models of motion detection. However, here we demonstrate that this symmetry of motion perception upon time reversal is often broken in real visual systems. In this work, we designed a set of visual stimuli to investigate how stimulus symmetries affect time reversal symmetry breaking in the fruit fly Drosophila's well-studied optomotor rotation behavior. We discovered a suite of new stimuli with a wide variety of different properties that can lead to broken time reversal symmetries in fly behavioral responses. We then trained neural network models to predict the velocity of scenes with both natural and artificial contrast distributions. Training with naturalistic contrast distributions yielded models that break time reversal symmetry, even when the training data was time reversal symmetric. We show analytically and numerically that the breaking of time reversal symmetry in the model responses can arise from contrast asymmetry in the training data, but can also arise from other features of the contrast distribution. Furthermore, shallower neural network models can exhibit stronger symmetry breaking than deeper ones, suggesting that less flexible neural networks promote some forms of time reversal symmetry breaking. Overall, these results reveal a surprising feature of biological motion detectors and suggest that it could arise from constrained optimization in natural environments.

">Axon length-dependent synapse loss is mediated by neuronal cytokine-induced glial phagocytosis</a></h4>

              
                Many neurodegenerative disorders (NDDs) preferentially affect neurons with long or complex axonal arbors, but our understanding of this specific vulnerability is limited. Using Drosophila larval class IV dendrite arborization (C4da) neurons, we found that neuronal activation of the integrated stress response (ISR) induces axon length-dependent degeneration (LDD). We identified the Interleukin-6 homologue unpaired 3 (upd3) as both necessary and sufficient for LDD in C4da neurons. Upd3 recruits glial cells to phagocytose presynapses preferentially on neurons with long axons, revealing an intrinsic axon length-dependent vulnerability to glia-mediated presynapse removal. Finally, we found that axon length-dependent presynapse loss in fly models of human NDDs utilized this pathway. Altogether, our studies identify inflammatory cytokine signaling from neurons to glia as a key determinant in axon length-dependent vulnerability.

">Endothelin B receptor inhibition rescues aging-dependent neuronal regenerative decline</a></h4>

              
                Peripheral sensory neurons regenerate their axons after injury to regain function, but this ability declines with age. The mechanisms behind this decline are not fully understood. While excessive production of endothelin 1 (ET-1), a potent vasoconstrictor, is linked to many diseases that increase with age, the role of ET-1 and its receptors in axon regeneration is unknown. Using a single cell RNAseq approach, we reveal that in dorsal root ganglia (DRG), satellite glial cells (SGCs), which completely envelop the sensory neuron soma, express the endothelin B receptor (ETBR), while ET-1 is expressed by endothelial cells. Inhibition of ETBR ex-vivo in DRG explant cultures improves axon growth in both adult and aged conditions. In vivo, treatment with the FDA-approved compound, Bosentan, improves axon regeneration and reverses the age-dependent decrease in axonal regenerative capacity. Bosentan treatment also enhances the expression of connexin 43 in SGCs after injury in adult and aged mice. These results reveal that inhibiting ETBR function enhances axon regeneration and rescues the age-dependent decrease in axonal regenerative capacity, providing a potential avenue for future therapies.

">Loss of neuronal lysosomal acid lipase drives amyloid pathology in Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                Underlying drivers of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) pathology remain unknown. However, multiple biologically diverse risk factors share a common pathological progression. To identify convergent molecular abnormalities that drive LOAD pathogenesis we compared two common midlife risk factors for LOAD, heavy alcohol use and obesity. This revealed that disrupted lipophagy is an underlying cause of LOAD pathogenesis. Both exposures reduced lysosomal flux, with a loss of neuronal lysosomal acid lipase (LAL). This resulted in neuronal lysosomal lipid (NLL) accumulation, which opposed A{beta} localization to lysosomes. Neuronal LAL loss both preceded (with aging) and promoted (targeted knockdown) A{beta} pathology and cognitive deficits in AD mice. The addition of recombinant LAL ex vivo and neuronal LAL overexpression in vivo prevented amyloid increases and improved cognition. In WT mice, neuronal LAL declined with aging and correlated negatively with entorhinal A{beta}. In healthy human brain, LAL also declined with age, suggesting this contributes to the age-related vulnerability for AD. In human LOAD LAL was further reduced, correlated negatively with A{beta}1-42, and occurred with polymerase pausing at the LAL gene. Together, this finds that the loss of neuronal LAL promotes NLL accumulation to impede degradation of A{beta} in neuronal lysosomes to drive AD amyloid pathology.

	<p>The endocannabinoid system has been linked to various physiological and pathological processes, because it plays a neuromodulator role in the central nervous system. In this sense, cannabinoids have been used off-label for neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHA), as well as in Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD), a more prevalent neurodegenerative disease. Thus, this study aims, through a comprehensive literature review, to arrive at a better understanding of the impact of cannabinoids in the therapeutic treatment of patients with ASD, ADHD, and Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD). Overall, cannabis products rich in CBD displayed a higher therapeutic potential for ASD children, while cannabis products rich in THC have been tested more for AD therapy. For ADHD, the clinical studies are incipient and inconclusive, but promising. In general, the main limitations of the clinical studies are the lack of standardization of the cannabis-based products consumed by the participants, a lack of scientific rigor, and the small number of participants.</p>

	<p>Transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) is increasingly recognized for its potential to modulate cerebral blood flow (CBF) and evoke cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR), which are crucial in conditions like mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. This study explores the impact of tES on the neurovascular unit (NVU), employing a physiological modeling approach to simulate the vascular response to electric fields generated by tES. Utilizing the FitzHugh&amp;amp;ndash;Nagumo model for neuroelectrical activity, we demonstrate how tES can initiate vascular responses such as vasoconstriction followed by delayed vasodilation in cerebral arterioles, potentially modulated by a combination of local metabolic demands and autonomic regulation (pivotal locus coeruleus). Here, four distinct pathways within the NVU were modeled to reflect the complex interplay between synaptic activity, astrocytic influences, perivascular potassium dynamics, and smooth muscle cell responses. Modal analysis revealed characteristic dynamics of these pathways, suggesting that oscillatory tES may finely tune the vascular tone by modulating the stiffness and elasticity of blood vessel walls, possibly by also impacting endothelial glycocalyx function. The findings underscore the therapeutic potential vis-&amp;amp;agrave;-vis blood-brain barrier safety of tES in modulating neurovascular coupling and cognitive function needing the precise modulation of NVU dynamics. This technology review supports the human-in-the-loop integration of tES leveraging digital health technologies for the personalized management of cerebral blood flow, offering new avenues for treating vascular cognitive disorders. Future studies should aim to optimize tES parameters using computational modeling and validate these models in clinical settings, enhancing the understanding of tES in neurovascular health.</p>

<p>Graphical Abstract: We used single-cell transcriptomics to explore cell type and neuronal class diversity, and in situ hybridization chain reaction to view expression in the brain of the nudibranch mollusc, <i>Berghia stephanieae</i>. Gene markers for nudibranch neurons and glia were found. Transcription factors, neuropeptides, and unannotated genes subdivided neuronal classes.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Gastropod molluscs such as <i>Aplysia</i>, <i>Lymnaea</i>, and <i>Tritonia</i> have been important for determining fundamental rules of motor control, learning, and memory because of their large, individually identifiable neurons. Yet only a small number of gastropod neurons have known molecular markers, limiting the ability to establish brain-wide structure–function relations. Here we combine high-throughput, single-cell RNA sequencing with in situ hybridization chain reaction in the nudibranch <i>Berghia stephanieae</i> to identify and visualize the expression of markers for cell types. Broad neuronal classes were characterized by genes associated with neurotransmitters, like acetylcholine, glutamate, serotonin, and GABA, as well as neuropeptides. These classes were subdivided by other genes including transcriptional regulators and unannotated genes. Marker genes expressed by neurons and glia formed discrete, previously unrecognized regions within and between ganglia. This study provides the foundation for understanding the fundamental cellular organization of gastropod nervous systems.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Mitochondria play critical roles in neural stem/progenitor cell proliferation and fate decisions. The subcellular localization of mitochondria in neural stem/progenitor cells during mitosis potentially influences the distribution of mitochondria to the daughter cells and thus their fates. Therefore, understanding the spatial dynamics of mitochondria provides important knowledge about brain development. In this study, we analyzed the subcellular localization of mitochondria in the fetal human neocortex with a particular focus on the basal radial glial cells (bRGCs), a neural stem/progenitor cell subtype attributed to the evolutionary expansion of the human neocortex. During interphase, bRGCs exhibit a polarized localization of mitochondria that is localized at the base of the process or the proximal part of the process. Thereafter, mitochondria in bRGCs at metaphase show unpolarized distribution in which the mitochondria are randomly localized in the cytoplasm. During anaphase and telophase, mitochondria are still localized evenly, but mainly in the periphery of the cytoplasm. Mitochondria start to accumulate at the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis. These results suggest that the mitochondrial localization in bRGCs is tightly regulated during the cell cycle, which may ensure the proper distribution of mitochondria to the daughter cells and, thus in turn, influence their fates.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>For postmetamorphic specimens of amphioxus (Cephalochordata), serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (SBSEM) is used to describe the long-ignored Rohde-like cells (RLCs) at the extreme posterior end of the dorsal nerve cord. These cells, numbering about three dozen in all, are divisible into a group with larger diameters running near the dorsal side of the cord and a more ventral group with smaller diameters closely associated with the central canal of the neurocoel. It is possible that the smaller ventral cells might be generated at the ependymal zone of the dorsal nerve cord and later migrate to a dorsal position, although a functional reason for this remains a mystery. All the RLCs have conspicuous regions of microvilli covering as much as 40% of their surface; limited data (by others) on the more anterior bona fide Rohde cells also indicate an extensive microvillar surface. Thus, both the RLCs and the better-known Rohde cells appear to be rhabdomeric photoreceptors, although a specific function for this feature is currently unknown. Even more perplexingly, although the Rohde cells are quintessential neurons extending giant processes, each RLC comprises a perikaryon that does not bear any neurites.</p>

	<p>As the population ages worldwide, Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD), the most prevalent kind of neurodegenerative disorder among older people, has become a significant factor affecting quality of life, public health, and economies. However, the exact pathogenesis of Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s remains elusive, and existing highly recognized pathogenesis includes the amyloid cascade hypothesis, Tau neurofibrillary tangles hypothesis, and neuroinflammation hypothesis. The major diagnoses of Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease include neuroimaging positron emission computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and cerebrospinal fluid molecular diagnosis. The therapy of Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease primarily relies on drugs, and the approved drugs on the market include acetylcholinesterase drugs, glutamate receptor antagonists, and amyloid-&amp;amp;beta; monoclonal antibodies. Still, the existing drugs can only alleviate the symptoms of the disease and cannot completely reverse it. This review aims to summarize existing research results on Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease pathogenesis, diagnosis, and drug therapy, with the objective of facilitating future research in this area.</p>

	<p>Neuropathic pain arises from injuries to the nervous system in diseases such as diabetes, infections, toxicity, and traumas. The underlying mechanism of neuropathic pain involves peripheral and central pathological modifications. Peripheral mechanisms entail nerve damage, leading to neuronal hypersensitivity and ectopic action potentials. Central sensitization involves a neuropathological process with increased responsiveness of the nociceptive neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) to their normal or subthreshold input due to persistent stimuli, leading to sustained electrical discharge, synaptic plasticity, and aberrant processing in the CNS. Current treatments, both pharmacological and non-pharmacological, aim to alleviate symptoms but often face challenges due to the complexity of neuropathic pain. Neuromodulation is emerging as an important therapeutic approach for the treatment of neuropathic pain in patients unresponsive to common therapies, by promoting the normalization of neuronal and/or glial activity and by targeting cerebral cortical regions, spinal cord, dorsal root ganglia, and nerve endings. Having a better understanding of the efficacy, adverse events and applicability of neuromodulation through pre-clinical studies is of great importance. Unveiling the mechanisms and characteristics of neuromodulation to manage neuropathic pain is essential to understand how to use it. In the present article, we review the current understanding supporting dorsal root ganglia and spinal cord neuromodulation as a therapeutic approach for neuropathic pain.</p>

	<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has brought attention to the long-term consequences of the virus, particularly the persistent symptoms that characterize long COVID. This syndrome, which can last for months after the initial infection, includes a range of neurological and neuropsychiatric manifestations that have significant implications for brain health and dementia research. This review explores the current understanding of long COVID&amp;amp;rsquo;s cognitive, neurological, and psychiatric symptoms and their potential impact on brain stimulation and neuroimaging studies. It argues that researchers must adapt their study designs and screening processes to account for the confounding effects of long COVID and ensure the accuracy and reliability of their findings. To advance the understanding of this condition and its long-term effects on brain health, the review proposes a series of strategies, including the development of standardized screening tools, the investigation of underlying mechanisms, and the identification of risk factors and protective factors. It also emphasizes the importance of collaborative research efforts and international data sharing platforms in accelerating the pace of discovery and developing targeted interventions for individuals with long COVID. As the prevalence of this condition continues to grow, it is imperative that the neuroscience community comes together to address this challenge and support those affected by long COVID.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/11/6/ENEURO.0286-23.2024?rss=1">Large Individual Differences in Functional Connectivity in the Context of Major Depression and Antidepressant Pharmacotherapy</a></h4>

              
                <p>Clinical studies of major depression (MD) generally focus on group effects, yet interindividual differences in brain function are increasingly recognized as important and may even impact effect sizes related to group effects. Here, we examine the magnitude of individual differences in relation to group differences that are commonly investigated (e.g., related to MD diagnosis and treatment response). Functional MRI data from 107 participants (63 female, 44 male) were collected at baseline, 2, and 8&nbsp;weeks during which patients received pharmacotherapy (escitalopram, <I>N</I> = 68) and controls (<I>N</I>&nbsp;=&nbsp;39) received no intervention. The unique contributions of different sources of variation were examined by calculating how much variance in functional connectivity was shared across all participants and sessions, within/across groups (patients vs controls, responders vs nonresponders, female vs male participants), recording sessions, and individuals. Individual differences and common connectivity across groups, sessions, and participants contributed most to the explained variance (&gt;95% across analyses). Group differences related to MD diagnosis, treatment response, and biological sex made significant but small contributions (0.3&ndash;1.2%). High individual variation was present in cognitive control and attention areas, while low individual variation characterized primary sensorimotor regions. Group differences were much smaller than individual differences in the context of MD and its treatment. These results could be linked to the variable findings and difficulty translating research on MD to clinical practice. Future research should examine brain features with low and high individual variation in relation to psychiatric symptoms and treatment trajectories to explore the clinical relevance of the individual differences identified here.</p>

                <p>Homeostatic plasticity stabilizes firing rates of neurons, but the pressure to restore low activity rates can significantly alter synaptic and cellular properties. Most previous studies of homeostatic readjustment to complete activity silencing in rodent forebrain have examined changes after 2&nbsp;d of deprivation, but it is known that longer periods of deprivation can produce adverse effects. To better understand the mechanisms underlying these effects and to address how presynaptic as well as postsynaptic compartments change during homeostatic plasticity, we subjected mouse cortical slice cultures to a more severe 5&nbsp;d deprivation paradigm. We developed and validated a computational framework to measure the number and morphology of presynaptic and postsynaptic compartments from super-resolution light microscopy images of dense cortical tissue. Using these tools, combined with electrophysiological miniature excitatory postsynaptic current measurements, and synaptic imaging at the electron microscopy level, we assessed the functional and morphological results of prolonged deprivation. Excitatory synapses were strengthened both presynaptically and postsynaptically. Surprisingly, we also observed a decrement in the density of excitatory synapses, both as measured from colocalized staining of pre- and postsynaptic proteins in tissue and from the number of dendritic spines. Overall, our results suggest that cortical networks deprived of activity progressively move toward a smaller population of stronger synapses.</p>

                Background Non-union fractures can be prevented with bone grafts, such as hydroxyapatite made from green mussel shells. Green mussel shells contain a high percentage of HA, making them a promising alternative for bone healing. This research aims to reveal the effectiveness of green mussel shell HA as a bone substitute material and to provide knowledge for further research. Methods This research was conducted for four months using a true experimental research method with a post-test-only control group design. This study used 36 New Zealand rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) which were divided into 9 groups: positive control, negative control, and intervention at weeks 2, 4 and 6 after the intervention. All groups were subjected to three general procedures: pre-surgery, surgery, and post-surgery. This study utilized histological evaluation and biochemical assessment, specifically measuring serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels, to investigate the effects of hydroxyapatite (HA) from green mussel shells on bone healing in rabbits. Results The findings demonstrated that green mussel shell HA hashad efficacy in accelerating bone healing, better than HA bovine HA i.e. green mussel shell hydroxyapatite showed superior efficacy compared to bovine hydroxyapatite in accelerating and maximizing fracture healing, as compared to the 6-week negative control group and demonstrated a significant difference (p < 0.05). Conclusions Green mussel hydroxyapatite is proven to be able to fasten and maximize the bone healing process as fast as bovine HA, and even has higher efficacy than bovine HA.

                Background Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as obesity, hypertension (HPT), and type II diabetes (T2D) are of increasing concern in South Africa (SA), with women being more at risk. Authors conducted a scoping review to identify and map the evidence available about the barriers of access to obesity, HPT, and T2D care among women in SA. Methods Arksey and O'Malley's framework for scoping review was used. The search of the literature was completed in the Scopus, Web of Science, and PubMed databases between April and May 2022. Only studies conducted among women in SA were eligible for inclusion. Identified barriers were mapped onto Levesque’s framework of access to health care to determine which points along the chain of accessing NCD health care among women are mostly impacted. Results Seven articles were included in the review: qualitative (n=2), quantitative (n=2), mixed methods (n=2), and grey literature (n=1). The included studies reported barriers of access to HPT and T2D care only, and no study reported barriers to obesity care. Supply-side barriers included lack of knowledge about available services, physician heavy workloads, medicine stock-outs, limited availability of testing equipment, travelling long distances, long waiting times, and delayed referral. Demand-side barriers included women having low self-awareness of NCD status, concerns about confidentiality, perceived discrimination, and poverty. Conclusions The study highlighted barriers related to the availability and accessibility dimension of access to health care, indicating that care for HPT and T2D is often inaccessible, with women often unable to reach health facilities or service providers. There is a pressing need for further research on access to healthcare for obesity, T2D, and HPT for women in South Africa, particularly among women who bear a disproportionately high burden of these conditions.

                Background High work pressure and complex problems during the COVID-19 pandemic caused nursing staff, including first-line managers, experienced burnout. Objective This study aims to explore burnout experienced of first-line managers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods This qualitative descriptive study used thematic analysis. Twelve first-line managers were selected using purposive sampling from two government hospitals, designated as COVID-19 referral centres in Jakarta and Depok, Indonesia. Data were collected through semi-structured online face-to-face interviews using ZOOM meeting video with a guideline interview. Results Exploration of first-line manager’s burnout revealed three themes: 1) unpreparedness, 2) impact on wellbeing, and 3) resilience. Conclusion The first-line managers experienced burnout during the pandemic due to obstacles in implementing management roles and functions accompanied. Their burnout was caused by the unpreparedness of both the hospital management and the community. Their burnout has an impact on their emotional and physical well-being. By this time, the first-line manager’s resilience was formed because they used adaptive coping mechanisms and had a good support system. The experience during COVID-19 should be a lesson learned to strengthen the healthcare system in the future. Risk management mitigation must be systematically and routinely performed.

                Abstract* Background Researchers are leading the development of AI designed to conduct interviews. These developments imply that AI's role is expanding from mere data analysis to becoming a tool for social researchers to interact with and comprehend their subjects. Yet, academic discussions have not addressed the potential impacts of AI on narrative interviews. In narrative interviews, the method of collecting data is a collaborative effort. The interviewer also contributes to exploring and shaping the interviewee's story. A compelling narrative interviewer has to display critical skills, such as maintaining a specific questioning order, showing empathy, and helping participants delve into and build their own stories. Methods This case study configured an OpenAI Assistant on WhatsApp to conduct narrative interviews with a human participant. The participant shared the same story in two distinct conversations: first, following a standard cycle and answering questions earnestly, and second, deliberately sidetracking the assistant from the main interview path as instructed by the researcher, to test how well the metrics could reflect the deliberate differences between different conversations. The AI's performance was evaluated through conversation analysis and specific narrative indicators, focusing on its adherence to the interview structure, empathy, narrative coherence, complexity, and support for human participant agency. The study sought to answer these questions: 1) How can the proposed metrics help us, as social researchers without a technical background, understand the quality of the AI-driven interviews in this study? 2) What do these findings contribute to our discussion on using AI in narrative interviews for social research? 3) What further research could these results inspire? Results The findings show to what extent the AI maintained structure and adaptability in conversations, illustrating its potential to support personalized, flexible narrative interviews based on specific needs. Conclusions These results suggest that social researchers without a technical background can use observation-based metrics to gauge how well an AI assistant conducts narrative interviews. They also prompt reflection on AI's role in narrative interviews and spark further research.

                Background Mental health and work are closely interlinked. Evidence suggests that food handlers suffer from poor mental health across the globe. A job in the food service sector is emotionally demanding as employees directly interact with customers who insist on impeccable services and real-time responses. The causes of mental health conditions among food handlers are multifactorial. Studies on the antecedents, outcomes, and intervening factors of foodservice employees’ mental health are fragmented and sparse. Objective We aimed to explore the existing literature describing the antecedents and outcomes of mental health disorders among food handlers. Moreover, we also aimed to explore various contextual factors that directly or indirectly influence the relationship between multiple antecedents and outcomes of food handlers’ mental health. Inclusion criteria Studies that focus on identifying the antecedents, outcomes, and contextual factors that influence the relationship between the antecedents and consequences of food handlers’ mental health will be included in the scoping review. Methods This scoping review will follow Arksey and O'Malley's (2005) framework: 1) identifying the research question; 2) identifying relevant studies; 3) study selection; 4) charting the data; and 5) collating, summarizing, and reporting results. Comprehensive searches will be conducted in databases such as PubMed, PsycINFO, and CINAHL using relevant keywords. Studies meeting the inclusion criteria that focused on antecedents, outcomes, and contextual factors influencing the mental health of food handlers will be selected. Data will be extracted and charted in electronic form. The findings will be narratively summarized and thematically analyzed to answer the research questions.

                <p>by Shaked Bergman, Tamir Tuller</p>

CRISPR is a gene editing technology which enables precise in-vivo genome editing; but its potential is hampered by its relatively low specificity and sensitivity. Improving CRISPR’s on-target and off-target effects requires a better understanding of its mechanism and determinants. Here we demonstrate, for the first time, the chromosomal 3D spatial structure’s association with CRISPR’s cleavage efficiency, and its predictive capabilities. We used high-resolution Hi-C data to estimate the 3D distance between different regions in the human genome and utilized these spatial properties to generate 3D-based features, characterizing each region’s density. We evaluated these features based on empirical, in-vivo CRISPR efficiency data and compared them to 425 features used in state-of-the-art models. The 3D features ranked in the top 13% of the features, and significantly improved the predictive power of LASSO and xgboost models trained with these features. The features indicated that sites with lower spatial density demonstrated higher efficiency. Understanding how CRISPR is affected by the 3D DNA structure provides insight into CRISPR’s mechanism in general and improves our ability to correctly predict CRISPR’s cleavage as well as design sgRNAs for therapeutic and scientific use.

                <p>by Christina M. P. Ray, Huilin Yang, Jamie B. Spangler, Feilim Mac Gabhann</p>

The spread of cancer from organ to organ (metastasis) is responsible for the vast majority of cancer deaths; however, most current anti-cancer drugs are designed to arrest or reverse tumor growth without directly addressing disease spread. It was recently discovered that tumor cell-secreted interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) synergize to enhance cancer metastasis in a cell-density dependent manner, and blockade of the IL-6 and IL-8 receptors (IL-6R and IL-8R) with a novel bispecific antibody, BS1, significantly reduced metastatic burden in multiple preclinical mouse models of cancer. Bispecific antibodies (BsAbs), which combine two different antigen-binding sites into one molecule, are a promising modality for drug development due to their enhanced avidity and dual targeting effects. However, while BsAbs have tremendous therapeutic potential, elucidating the mechanisms underlying their binding and inhibition will be critical for maximizing the efficacy of new BsAb treatments. Here, we describe a quantitative, computational model of the BS1 BsAb, exhibiting how modeling multivalent binding provides key insights into antibody affinity and avidity effects and can guide therapeutic design. We present detailed simulations of the monovalent and bivalent binding interactions between different antibody constructs and the IL-6 and IL-8 receptors to establish how antibody properties and system conditions impact the formation of binary (antibody-receptor) and ternary (receptor-antibody-receptor) complexes. Model results demonstrate how the balance of these complex types drives receptor inhibition, providing important and generalizable predictions for effective therapeutic design.

Immunization through repeated direct venous inoculation of <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> (Pf) sporozoites (PfSPZ) under chloroquine chemoprophylaxis, using the PfSPZ Chemoprophylaxis Vaccine (PfSPZ-CVac), induces high-level protection against controlled human malaria infection (CHMI). Humoral and cellular immunity contribute to vaccine efficacy but only limited information about the implicated Pf-specific antigens is available. Here, we examined Pf-specific antibody profiles, measured by protein arrays representing the full Pf proteome, of 40 placebo- and PfSPZ-immunized malaria-naïve volunteers from an earlier published PfSPZ-CVac dose-escalation trial. For this purpose, we both utilized and adapted supervised machine learning methods to identify predictive antibody profiles at two different time points: after immunization and before CHMI. We developed an adapted multitask support vector machine (SVM) approach and compared it to standard methods, i.e. single-task SVM, regularized logistic regression and random forests. Our results show, that the multitask SVM approach improved the classification performance to discriminate the protection status based on the underlying antibody-profiles while combining time- and dose-dependent data in the prediction model. Additionally, we developed the new f<i>E</i>ature di<i>S</i>tance ex<i>P</i>lainabilit<i>Y</i> (ESPY) method to quantify the impact of single antigens on the non-linear multitask SVM model and make it more interpretable. In conclusion, our multitask SVM model outperforms the studied standard approaches in regard of classification performance. Moreover, with our new explanation method ESPY, we were able to interpret the impact of Pf-specific antigen antibody responses that predict sterile protective immunity against CHMI after immunization. The identified Pf-specific antigens may contribute to a better understanding of immunity against human malaria and may foster vaccine development.

                <p>by Ellie Mainou, Ruy M. Ribeiro, Jessica M. Conway</p>

Understanding the dynamics of acute HIV infection can offer valuable insights into the early stages of viral behavior, potentially helping uncover various aspects of HIV pathogenesis. The standard viral dynamics model explains HIV viral dynamics during acute infection reasonably well. However, the model makes simplifying assumptions, neglecting some aspects of HIV infection. For instance, in the standard model, target cells are infected by a single HIV virion. Yet, cellular multiplicity of infection (MOI) may have considerable effects in pathogenesis and viral evolution. Further, when using the standard model, we take constant infected cell death rates, simplifying the dynamic immune responses. Here, we use four models—1) the standard viral dynamics model, 2) an alternate model incorporating cellular MOI, 3) a model assuming density-dependent death rate of infected cells and 4) a model combining (2) and (3)—to investigate acute infection dynamics in 43 people living with HIV very early after HIV exposure. We find that all models qualitatively describe the data, but none of the tested models is by itself the best to capture different kinds of heterogeneity. Instead, different models describe differing features of the dynamics more accurately. For example, while the standard viral dynamics model may be the most parsimonious across study participants by the corrected Akaike Information Criterion (AICc), we find that viral peaks are better explained by a model allowing for cellular MOI, using a linear regression analysis as analyzed by <i>R</i><sup>2</sup>. These results suggest that heterogeneity in within-host viral dynamics cannot be captured by a single model. Depending on the specific aspect of interest, a corresponding model should be employed.

                Introduction Biliary tract cancers (BTCs) have low survival rates in advanced stages. Anticancer drugs (ACDs) are usually recommended, but may be associated with important toxicity and lower quality of life (QoL). Best supportive care (BSC) could represent a valid alternative of treatment. We aim to synthesise evidence regarding the effects of ACDs versus BSC in patients with advanced BTCs. Methods We conducted a systematic review including randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any type of ACD versus BSC, placebo or no active treatment. We searched in five databases. Two reviewers performed selection, risk of bias and data extraction processes. We conducted random-effects meta-analyses and assessed certainty of evidence using GRADE. Results We included eight RCTs. Biological/targeted therapies may result in little to no difference in overall survival (OS) (Mean difference (MD): 1.66 months higher; 95%CI, -0.65 to 3.96; low certainty) and toxicity (Relative risk (RR): 1.38; 95%CI, 0.99 to 1.93; low certainty), with uncertain effects on QoL. Evidence is very uncertain about the effects of chemotherapy on OS (MD: 3.28 months higher; 95%CI, 0.16 to 6.39; very low certainty), and may increase toxicity (RR: 1.33; 95%CI, 1.03 to 1.72; low certainty). We identified insufficient evidence for other prespecified outcomes. Conclusions Compared to BSC, ACDs have poor OS benefit and higher toxicity. Due to overall very low certainty of evidence, the effects of ACDs on critical outcomes are still unclear. Our findings should be used to better inform decision-making processes and future research.

                Abstract* Background The high prevalence of infant stunting and maternal undernutrition in low- and middle-income countries poses a significant public health threat. The World Health Organization recommends balanced energy-protein (BEP) supplementation to pregnant women from populations with a high prevalence of underweight (prepregnancy BMI <18.5 kg/m2), leaving a notable gap in guidance for lactating women. Therefore, we established the Maternal BEP Studies Harmonization Initiative (BEP Initiative) to investigate the impact of BEP supplementation given to pregnant and/or lactating women on maternal and infant outcomes by synthesizing data from multiple clinical trials. This is a study protocol for our prospective individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis on BEP lactation trials. Methods Data from four randomized controlled trials that include mother-infant dyads in India (n=816), Pakistan (n=957), Burkina Faso (n=800), and Nepal (n=726) will be pooled and analysed. Women were randomized to BEP (one trial had a third arm with maternal BEP plus infants receiving azithromycin) or control groups at baseline (during the first week) and received the intervention through six months postpartum. A one-stage IPD meta-analysis will be done using mixed-effects linear and log-binomial regression models to account for between-trial heterogeneity. The primary outcome of infant length-for-age z scores (LAZ) and secondary outcomes of maternal and infant indicators of nutritional status, all at six months of age, will be examined. Also, we will assess baseline characteristics as covariates and effect modifiers for the BEP to outcome relationship. Discussion This prospective IPD meta-analysis uses a one-stage IPD meta-analysis, which allows for higher statistical power to examine outcomes, more flexibility in defining variables, and can examine effect modifiers, which could inform which individuals or populations may benefit more from BEP given during lactation.

                Background Cardiovascular disease (CVD) continues to be the foremost mortality internationally. Cardiac rehabilitation has proven as an effective program in reducing CVD burden. Participation in cardiac rehabilitation programs is very low. Digital health intervention emerged as an alternative method to deliver Cardiac rehabilitation. This review aimed to investigate the impact of digital health intervention on the outcomes of interest Methods the following databases: PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, and Cochrane Library have been searched to retrieve randomized controlled trials that examine the impact of digital health intervention on blood pressure, body mass index, lipid profile, blood glucose, Six-Minute Walk Test, and peak oxygen consumption. filters were set to include studies published in English between 2000-2023. Results Nineteen studies were included in this review. Six-Minute Walk Test (MD = 16.70; 95% CI: 6.00 to 27.39, p = 0.000) and maximal oxygen consumption (SMD = 0.27; 95% CI: 0.08 to 0.45, p = 0.004) significantly improved following digital health intervention, after employing the sensitivity analysis significant improvement was observed in systolic (MD = -2.54; 95% CI: -4.98 to -0.11, p = 0.04) and diastolic blood pressure (SMD = -2.0182; 95% CI: -3.9436 to -0.0928, p = 0.04) favoring experimental groups. Subgroup analysis revealed significant improvement in quality of life after three months of follow-up (SMD = 0.18; 95% CI: 0.05 to 0.31, p = 0.00), no significant differences have been observed in body mass index, lipid profile, and blood glucose. Conclusion The findings emphasize the significant impact of digital vs CBCR or usual care on physical capacity, blood pressure, and quality of life. Despite the non-statistically significant differences in body mass index and lipid profile, the comparable effect between the two methods suggests the superiority of digital over CBCR or usual care due to its convenient nature, accessibility, and cost-effectiveness.

                Background Colon cancer is the third most common cancer type worldwide. Novel alternative therapeutic anti-cancer drugs against colon cancer with less toxicity are to be explored . This study was aimed to explore the anti-proliferative and anti-migratory activity of various fractions of Annona reticulata ethanolic leaf extract on human colon cancer cell lines (HCT-116) and to explore the potential molecular targets from the most potent plant extract fraction. Methods After obtaining ethical clearance from the institutional ethics committee, the extract and fractions were prepared and a preliminary analysis of the phytochemical was done qualitatively. Total phenolic and flavonoids were determined. Ethanolic leaf extract and its fractions were subjected to cytotoxicity analysis using the sulforhodamine B assay and the most promising fraction which showed the highest viability was selected to study anti-migratory activity. The anti-migratory effect was studied using a scratch wound healing assay. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was done to identify the major phytocompounds present in the fraction. The major five phytocompounds identified from the GC-MS were subjected to bioinformatics analysis. Result Among the four fractions, the petroleum ether fraction exhibited the highest anti-proliferative activity. The migration of colon cancer cells was significantly inhibited by the extract and petroleum ether fraction. The major phytocompounds identified from GC-MS were phytol (13.03%), 2,6-bis (3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl)-3,7-dioxabicyclo (3.3.0) octane (11.95%), gamma.-sitosterol (10.45%), alpha.-tocopherol-beta.-D-mannoside (7.50%) and 3-amino-4-piperonyl-5-pyrazolone (5.84%). The bioinformatics analysis of these phytochemicals showed a high potential to affect the levels of key proteins driving colon cancer progression, inhibiting the enzymes and proteins overexpressed in cancer. Conclusion The outcome of this study endorses the potential of phytochemicals of the petroleum ether fraction of ethanolic leaf extract of Annona reticulata for the development of a new chemotherapeutic agent in the treatment of colon cancer.

                Introduction Surgical removal of an impacted third molar is one of the most common oral surgical procedures performed in dental offices. The postoperative phase is often associated with severe inflammation. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are usually prescribed to manage postoperative discomfort. NSAIDs have been associated with gastrointestinal bleeding, renal function disturbances, and platelet count reductions. Thus, the present study demonstrates the utility of aescin in managing postoperative discomfort after the surgical removal of impacted mandibular third molars. This study aimed to correlate and compare the impact of aescin and diclofenac on salivary PGE2 levels and serum C-reactive protein levels after surgical extraction of the mandibular third molar. The study will also evaluate and compare the effectiveness of individual drug therapy in managing postoperative pain, swelling and mouth opening. Methods The planned study is a single-center, double-blind, randomized, parallel, prospective clinical trial. Each patient will be prescribed either diclofenac sodium 150 mg/day or aescin (escin) 120 mg/day to be taken orally in divided doses for five days after surgically removing the impacted mandibular third molar. Pain will be assessed using a visual analog scale. Facial swelling and mouth opening will be recorded using a metric scale with standardized reference points. ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) will be employed to measure salivary Prostaglandin E2 and serum C–reactive protein levels. All parameters will be recorded preoperatively (T0) on the second postoperative day (T1) and fifth postoperative day (T2). Conclusion The proposed study is expected to show a clinically acceptable response to the administration of aescin for the management of postoperative discomfort compared to diclofenac sodium after third molar surgery. The proposed study is expected to positively manipulate the levels of salivary Prostaglandin E2 and serum C–reactive protein, which are reliable inflammatory markers. The outcome of this study may provide an efficacious and safe alternative to conventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for managing postoperative discomfort following third molar surgery.

                Background Excess nitrogen (N) loading to coastal ecosystems impairs estuarine water quality. Land management decisions made within estuarine watersheds have a direct impact on downstream N delivery. Natural features within watersheds can act as landscape sinks for N, such as wetlands, streams and ponds that transform dissolved N into gaseous N, effectively removing it from the aquatic system. Identifying and evaluating these landscape sinks and their spatial relationship to N sources can help managers understand the effects of alternative decisions on downstream resources. Methods The N-Sink approach uses widely available GIS data to identify landscape sinks within HUC-12 (or larger) catchments, estimate their N removal potential and map the effect of those sinks on N movement through the catchment. Static maps are produced to visualize N removal efficiency, transport and delivery, the latter in the form of an index. The R package nsink was developed to facilitate data acquisition, processing and visualization. Results The R package creates static maps for a specific HUC-12, or users can visit the University of Connecticut website to explore previously mapped areas. Users can also investigate specific flowpaths interactively by clicking on any location within the catchment. A flowpath is generated with a table describing N removal along each segment. We describe the motivation behind developing nsink, discuss implementation in R, and present two use case examples. nsink is available from https://github.com/USEPA/nsink. Conclusions N-Sink is a decision support tool created for local decision-makers to facilitate better understanding of the relationship between land use and downstream N delivery. Local decision-makers that have prioritized N mitigation in their long-term planning can use nsink to better understand the potential impact of proposed development projects and zoning variances. Similarly, land trusts and other NGOs interested in N mitigation can use nsink to identify high priority areas for acquisition or restoration.

<p>High-fat diets alter amygdala and hippocampus neurochemistry in juvenile male rats. Rats with metabolic changes show enhanced odor aversion memory, linked to elevated noradrenergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission. This highlights intricate connections between obesogenic diets, neurochemistry, and cognition, implying that metabolic dysfunctions can induce both detrimental and enhanced plasticity effects.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Childhood obesity increases the risk of health and cognitive disorders in adulthood. Consuming high-fat diets (HFD) during critical neurodevelopmental periods, like childhood, impairs cognition and memory in humans and animals, affecting the function and connectivity of brain structures related to emotional memory. However, the underlying mechanisms of such phenomena need to be better understood. This study aimed to investigate the neurochemical profile of the amygdala and hippocampus, brain structures involved in emotional memory, during the acquisition of conditioned odor aversion in male rats that consumed a HFD from weaning to adulthood. The rats gained weight, experienced metabolic changes, and reduced insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance. Rats showed enhanced odor aversion memory, contrary to the expected cognitive impairments. This memory enhancement was accompanied by increased noradrenergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission in the amygdala and hippocampus. Importantly, this upregulation was specific to stimuli exposure, as basal neurotransmitter levels remained unaltered by the HFD. Our results suggest that HFD modifies cognitive function by altering neurochemical signaling, in this case, upregulating neurotransmitter levels rendering a stronger memory trace, demonstrating that metabolic dysfunctions do not only trigger exclusively detrimental plasticity processes but also render enhanced plastic effects depending on the type of information.</p>

                Background Research on Mpox is essential to protect public health, develop effective interventions, and enhance global preparedness for infectious disease outbreaks. Owing to the scarcity of any specific treatment for Mpox disease, public health guidelines are important for patient care and management. Therefore, this systematic review suggests a public health policy guidelines to control Mpox diseases, especially in densely populated countries. Methods In this systematic review study, the databases and search engines PubMed, Scopus, BanglaJol, WHO, and Google Scholar were searched, and related literature was retrieved for further investigation. Articles describing monkeypox epidemiology, clinical symptoms, and preventive strategies, and published in English language were the core inclusion criteria; articles published in other languages were excluded. All records in the literature were managed through Mendeley (version 1.19.4) reference manager and summarized for further investigation. Results Mpox severity is prevalent in America and Europe. Male (96.3%) and young adults aged 18-44 years (mean: 34 years) were the most vulnerable population due to the virus. Among the patients, rash and fever were the most frequent symptoms, with cough, vomiting, anogenital pain and/or bleeding, conjunctivitis, diarrhea, and genital edema being the least prevalent symptoms in less than 5% of the patients. As there is no specific treatment for the disease, infection control in densely populated countries require early detection, isolation of infected individuals, strict infection control measures, mass vaccination campaigns, education, public awareness campaigns, and continued investment in research. Conclusions This study underscores the urgent need for comprehensive infection control strategies, including early detection, strict isolation protocols, mass vaccination initiatives, and ongoing research investment given the absence of specific treatment options for the disease.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The long-term consequences of traumatic brain injury (TBI) on brain structure remain uncertain. Given evidence that a single significant brain injury event increases the risk of dementia, brain-age estimation could provide a novel and efficient indexing of the long-term consequences of TBI. Brain-age procedures use predictive modeling to calculate brain-age scores for an individual using structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. Complicated mild, moderate, and severe TBI (cmsTBI) is associated with a higher predicted age difference (PAD), but the progression of PAD over time remains unclear. We sought to examine whether PAD increases as a function of time since injury (TSI) and if injury severity and sex interacted to influence this progression.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Through the ENIGMA Adult Moderate and Severe (AMS)-TBI working group, we examine the largest TBI sample to date (n = 343), along with controls, for a total sample size of n = 540, to replicate and extend prior findings in the study of TBI brain age. Cross-sectional T1w-MRI data were aggregated across 7 cohorts, and brain age was established using a similar brain age algorithm to prior work in TBI.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Findings show that PAD widens with longer TSI, and there was evidence for differences between sexes in PAD, with men showing more advanced brain age. We did not find strong evidence supporting a link between PAD and cognitive performance.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This work provides evidence that changes in brain structure after cmsTBI are dynamic, with an initial period of change, followed by relative stability in brain morphometry, eventually leading to further changes in the decades after a single cmsTBI. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                Trained immunity initially describes the long-term functional reprogramming of innate immune cells. Here, Yang et al. reveal the mechanism of trained immunity in zebrafish hepatocytes. They uncover that β-glucan training induces DrDectin-1-gated H3K4me3 modification of mitophagy-related genes, inhibiting pyroptosis to protect the host from septic liver injury in vivo.

                Tong et al. systematically explore a bispecific antibody (bsAb)-dependent synergistic effect that can effectively restore the neutralizing activity of the bispecific antibody when individual monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are evaded by variants. They show that this synergistic effect can salvage more escaped antibodies when certain prerequisites for the narrower antigen-binding site span, such as scDbs, and the correct antibody combinations are met.

                Using NGS approaches, Fazel Darbandi et al. demonstrate that ASD-associated TRs in the developing cortex share substantial overlap in their binding sites. In vitro CRISPRi delineated downstream convergent biology that correlates with the postmortem brain samples from individuals with ASD. We suggest that functional convergence of ASD-associated TRs leads to shared neurodevelopmental disorders.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90948">Enhancing CRISPR prime editing by reducing misfolded pegRNA interactions</a></h4>

              
                CRISPR prime editing (<b>PE</b>) requires a Cas9 nickase-reverse transcriptase fusion protein (known as PE2) and a prime editing guide RNA (<b>pegRNA</b>), an extended version of a standard guide RNA (<b>gRNA</b>) that both specifies the intended target genomic sequence and encodes the desired genetic edit. Here, we show that sequence complementarity between the 5’ and the 3’ regions of a pegRNA can negatively impact its ability to complex with Cas9, thereby potentially reducing PE efficiency. We demonstrate this limitation can be overcome by a simple pegRNA refolding procedure, which improved ribonucleoprotein-mediated PE efficiencies in zebrafish embryos by up to nearly 25-fold. Further gains in PE efficiencies of as much as sixfold could also be achieved by introducing point mutations designed to disrupt internal interactions within the pegRNA. Our work defines simple strategies that can be implemented to improve the efficiency of PE.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93908">Targeted protein degradation systems to enhance Wnt signaling</a></h4>

              
                Molecules that facilitate targeted protein degradation (TPD) offer great promise as novel therapeutics. The human hepatic lectin asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGR) is selectively expressed on hepatocytes. We have previously engineered an anti-ASGR1 antibody-mutant RSPO2 (RSPO2RA) fusion protein (called SWEETS) to drive tissue-specific degradation of ZNRF3/RNF43 E3 ubiquitin ligases, which achieved hepatocyte-specific enhanced Wnt signaling, proliferation, and restored liver function in mouse models, and an antibody–RSPO2RA fusion molecule is currently in human clinical trials. In the current study, we identified two new ASGR1- and ASGR1/2-specific antibodies, 8M24 and 8G8. High-resolution crystal structures of ASGR1:8M24 and ASGR2:8G8 complexes revealed that these antibodies bind to distinct epitopes on opposing sides of ASGR, away from the substrate-binding site. Both antibodies enhanced Wnt activity when assembled as SWEETS molecules with RSPO2RA through specific effects sequestering E3 ligases. In addition, 8M24-RSPO2RA and 8G8-RSPO2RA efficiently downregulate ASGR1 through TPD mechanisms. These results demonstrate the possibility of combining different therapeutic effects and degradation mechanisms in a single molecule.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97035">Post-meiotic mechanism of facultative parthenogenesis in gonochoristic whiptail lizard species</a></h4>

              
                Facultative parthenogenesis (FP) has historically been regarded as rare in vertebrates, but in recent years incidences have been reported in a growing list of fish, reptile, and bird species. Despite the increasing interest in the phenomenon, the underlying mechanism and evolutionary implications have remained unclear. A common finding across many incidences of FP is either a high degree of homozygosity at microsatellite loci or low levels of heterozygosity detected in next-generation sequencing data. This has led to the proposal that second polar body fusion following the meiotic divisions restores diploidy and thereby mimics fertilization. Here, we show that FP occurring in the gonochoristic <i>Aspidoscelis</i> species <i>A. marmoratus</i> and <i>A. arizonae</i> results in genome-wide homozygosity, an observation inconsistent with polar body fusion as the underlying mechanism of restoration. Instead, a high-quality reference genome for <i>A. marmoratus</i> and analysis of whole-genome sequencing from multiple FP and control animals reveals that a post-meiotic mechanism gives rise to homozygous animals from haploid, unfertilized oocytes. Contrary to the widely held belief that females need to be isolated from males to undergo FP, females housed with conspecific and heterospecific males produced unfertilized eggs that underwent spontaneous development. In addition, offspring arising from both fertilized eggs and parthenogenetic development were observed to arise from a single clutch. Strikingly, our data support a mechanism for facultative parthenogenesis that removes all heterozygosity in a single generation. Complete homozygosity exposes the genetic load and explains the high rate of congenital malformations and embryonic mortality associated with FP in many species. Conversely, for animals that develop normally, FP could potentially exert strong purifying selection as all lethal recessive alleles are purged in a single generation.

	<p>Porcine Liver Decomposition Product (PLDP) was obtained by treating pig liver homogenate with protease and filling it into capsules. We have already confirmed from three clinical trials that PLDP enhances visual memory and delays memory recall, and we believe that its activity is due to various phospholipids, including phosphatidylcholine (PC). In this study, we clinically evaluated PLDP for depressive symptoms caused by a decline in cognitive function. This clinical trial was conducted using the Revised Hasegawa Dementia Scale (HDS-R). The HDS-R (maximum score is 30 points) is a test similar to the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), which is commonly used in Japan. Dementia is suspected if the score falls below 20 on the HDS-R. Additionally, in a previous clinical trial, there was no change in scores in the placebo group after three doses of the HDS-R. In order to clearly confirm the effectiveness of PLDP, this study was conducted under stricter conditions (HDS-R points of 15 to 23) than previous clinical trials (all participants had scores of 20 or higher). Therefore, from ethical considerations, a clinical trial was conducted using the scores before PLDP administration as a control. In this study, PLDP was administered orally at 4 capsules per day, and the HDS-R was confirmed 2 and 4 weeks after administration. A significant increase in HDS-R scores was observed at 2 and 4 weeks after PLDP administration. Additionally, regarding each item of the HDS-R, PLDP significantly increased 2 and 4 weeks after oral administration for the question items assessing delayed recall, and the question item assessing verbal fluency tasks was recognized. From the above results, we confirmed the reproducibility of the effect of PLDP in improving the delayed recall of verbal memories. Furthermore, increasing scores on verbal fluency tasks suggest that PLDP may enhance frontal lobe function and prevent or improve depressive symptoms. The effects observed in this study may differ from the mechanisms of action of existing antidepressants, and we believe that this may lead to the discovery of new antidepressants.</p>

                Background With rapid industrialization, urbanization, and population explosion in sub-Saharan Africa including Uganda, the population has experienced increased exposure to environmental lead subsequently causing elevated blood lead levels. Mean blood levels of 332µg/dL,120µg/dʟ, 25µg/dL,11µg/dL, and 10µg/dL in children under 18 years of age in Nigeria, DR Congo, South Africa, Sudan, and Uganda respectively. Susceptibility to lead toxicity correlates with one’s nutrition status, age, and genetics. This study expounded susceptibility to lead toxicity by relating blood lead levels, delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD) enzyme activity, and genetic variations of proteins that code for ALAD in urban children of Uganda aged between 6 and 60 months. Methods A total of 198 blood samples were analyzed for blood lead levels (BLL), on an atomic absorption spectrophotometer whereas hemoglobin (Hb) levels, and ALAD enzyme activity, were analyzed on a spectrophotometer before DNA extraction, polymerase chain reaction, and restriction fragment length digestion for ALAD polymorphism. Results Geometric means of BLL (10.55µg/dL, SD = 7.4), Hb (7.85g/dL, SD = 1.3) and ALAD enzyme activity (37.15 units/L BLL, S.D = 9.7), corresponded to samples that coded for ALAD1 allele (99.05%) compared to the 0.05% that coded for ALAD2 with BLL (14.5µg/ dL, SD = 4.7), Hb (6.1 g/ dL), ALAD enzyme activity (33.8 units/L, SD=1.45). There was a significant relationship with a negative linear correlation between BLL, Hb (status, and ALAD enzyme activity in the three isozymes (ALAD1-1, ALAD1-2, and ALAD2-2) in the strength of ALAD1-1 (r = 0.42, p-value = 0.02) ˂ ALAD1-2 (r = 0.62, effective size = 0.43, p-value = ˂ 0.001) ˂ ALAD2-2 (r = 0.67, effective size = 0.86, p-value = ˂ 0.001). Conclusions Most of the study participants coded for the ALAD1 allele hence hoarded blood lead, which could result in delayed exposure and adverse effects later in their lives.

                Objective To determine gender gaps in Emeritus researchers in Colombia. Methods Oaxaca-Blinder-Kitakagwa decomposition model, correcting the sample selection bias with the inclusion of Mills’ inverse ratio (Heckman’s Lambda) through an ordered probit model. Data: Information available in the ScienTI Platform – Colombia during the period 2015-2021. Results The results show that the gender gap between female and male researchers is 5.8%. To achieve Emeritus status, one must be over 65 years old, and the possibility of achieving Emeritus status is 5.1% higher for female researchers than for their male counterparts. These differences can be explained by the time constraints that female researchers face in being productive, as they spend more time than male researchers on caregiving responsibilities, either due to motherhood or the care of other dependent family members. Conclusions The results obtained allow us to affirm that there is a gender gap in scientific research in Colombia in the Emeritus research category in the calls for proposals for the period 2015-2021. Moreover, the existing gap cannot be explained by factors associated with attributes of education and academic productivity that are part of the regulatory requirements, insofar as not being explained by them, it evidences the existence of discrimination against women researchers to access the highest research category.

                Introduction Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common chronic lung disease that affects premature infants and is characterized by disrupted alveolar and vascular development. Pulmonary complications significantly affect morbidity and mortality rates in neonates with BPD. Aim This systematic review aimed to outline a protocol for investigating the effects of pulmonary complications in neonates diagnosed with BPD. Methods A comprehensive search strategy will be implemented across electronic databases, including PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Library. Eligible studies will include primary research articles reporting pulmonary complications, such as pulmonary hypertension, respiratory infections, ventilator-associated events, and airway abnormalities among neonates diagnosed with BPD. Two independent reviewers screened the titles, abstracts, and full text of the identified articles for eligibility. Data extraction will be conducted using a predefined form, including study characteristics, participant demographics, types of pulmonary complications, and relevant outcomes. The methodological quality of the included studies will be assessed using appropriate tools, such as the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool for randomized controlled trials. Outcome measures The primary outcomes of interest will include the prevalence and incidence of pulmonary complications among neonates diagnosed with BPD. Secondary outcomes will encompass the impact of pulmonary complications on clinical outcomes, such as respiratory morbidity, mortality rates, length of hospital stay, and neurodevelopmental outcomes. Narrative synthesis will be employed to summarize the findings of the included studies, and where applicable, a meta-analysis will be conducted to quantify the effects of pulmonary complications on neonatal outcomes. Discussion This systematic review protocol outlines a rigorous methodology for investigating the effects of pulmonary complications in neonates with BPD. The findings of this review will provide valuable insights into the burden of pulmonary complications in this vulnerable population, and inform clinical practice and future research endeavors aimed at improving the care and management of neonates with BPD.

                <p>by Seolah Shin, Seok Joo Chae, Seunggyu Lee, Jae Kyoung Kim</p>

The Michaelis–Menten (MM) rate law has been a fundamental tool in describing enzyme-catalyzed reactions for over a century. When substrates and enzymes are homogeneously distributed, the validity of the MM rate law can be easily assessed based on relative concentrations: the substrate is in large excess over the enzyme-substrate complex. However, the applicability of this conventional criterion remains unclear when species exhibit spatial heterogeneity, a prevailing scenario in biological systems. Here, we explore the MM rate law’s applicability under spatial heterogeneity by using partial differential equations. In this study, molecules diffuse very slowly, allowing them to locally reach quasi-steady states at each time point. We find that the conventional criterion for the validity of the MM rate law cannot be readily extended to heterogeneous environments solely through spatial averages of molecular concentrations. That is, even when the conventional criterion for the spatial averages is satisfied, the MM rate law fails to capture the enzyme catalytic rate under spatial heterogeneity. In contrast, a slightly modified form of the MM rate law, based on the total quasi-steady state approximation (tQSSA), is accurate. Specifically, the tQSSA-based modified form, but not the original MM rate law, accurately predicts the drug clearance via cytochrome P450 enzymes and the ultrasensitive phosphorylation in heterogeneous environments. Our findings shed light on how to simplify spatiotemporal models for enzyme-catalyzed reactions in the right context, ensuring accurate conclusions and avoiding misinterpretations in <i>in silico</i> simulations.

                <p>by Roberto Efraín Díaz, Stephanie A. Wankowicz</p>

Despite advances and social progress, the exclusion of diverse groups in academia, especially science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields, across the US and Europe persists, resulting in the underrepresentation of diverse people in higher education. There is extensive literature about theory, observation, and evidence-based practices that can help create a more equitable, inclusive, and diverse learning environment. In this article, we propose the implementation of a Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Justice (DEIJ) journal club as a strategic initiative to foster education and promote action towards making academia a more equitable institution. By creating a space for people to engage with DEIJ theories* and strategize ways to improve their learning environment, we hope to normalize the practice and importance of analyzing academia through an equity lens. Guided by restorative justice principles, we offer 10 recommendations for fostering community cohesion through education and mutual understanding. This approach underscores the importance of appropriate action and self-education in the journey toward a more diverse, equitable, inclusive, and just academic environment.
*Authors’ note: We understand that “DEIJ” is a multidisciplinary organizational framework that relies on numerous fields of study, including history, sociology, philosophy, and more. We use this term to refer to these different fields of study for brevity purposes.

                <p>by Pavel Sanda, Jaroslav Hlinka, Monica van den Berg, Antonin Skoch, Maxim Bazhenov, Georgios A. Keliris, Giri P. Krishnan</p>

Brain activity during the resting state is widely used to examine brain organization, cognition and alterations in disease states. While it is known that neuromodulation and the state of alertness impact resting-state activity, neural mechanisms behind such modulation of resting-state activity are unknown. In this work, we used a computational model to demonstrate that change in excitability and recurrent connections, due to cholinergic modulation, impacts resting-state activity. The results of such modulation in the model match closely with experimental work on direct cholinergic modulation of Default Mode Network (DMN) in rodents. We further extended our study to the human connectome derived from diffusion-weighted MRI. In human resting-state simulations, an increase in cholinergic input resulted in a brain-wide reduction of functional connectivity. Furthermore, selective cholinergic modulation of DMN closely captured experimentally observed transitions between the baseline resting state and states with suppressed DMN fluctuations associated with attention to external tasks. Our study thus provides insight into potential neural mechanisms for the effects of cholinergic neuromodulation on resting-state activity and its dynamics.

                <p>by Joshua M. Mitchell, Yuanye Chi, Maheshwor Thapa, Zhiqiang Pang, Jianguo Xia, Shuzhao Li</p>

To standardize metabolomics data analysis and facilitate future computational developments, it is essential to have a set of well-defined templates for common data structures. Here we describe a collection of data structures involved in metabolomics data processing and illustrate how they are utilized in a full-featured Python-centric pipeline. We demonstrate the performance of the pipeline, and the details in annotation and quality control using large-scale LC-MS metabolomics and lipidomics data and LC-MS/MS data. Multiple previously published datasets are also reanalyzed to showcase its utility in biological data analysis. This pipeline allows users to streamline data processing, quality control, annotation, and standardization in an efficient and transparent manner. This work fills a major gap in the Python ecosystem for computational metabolomics.

                <p>by Marco A. Coelho, Márcia David-Palma, Terrance Shea, Katharine Bowers, Sage McGinley-Smith, Arman W. Mohammad, Andreas Gnirke, Andrey M. Yurkov, Minou Nowrousian, Sheng Sun, Christina A. Cuomo, Joseph Heitman</p>

In exploring the evolutionary trajectories of both pathogenesis and karyotype dynamics in fungi, we conducted a large-scale comparative genomic analysis spanning the <i>Cryptococcus</i> genus, encompassing both global human fungal pathogens and nonpathogenic species, and related species from the sister genus <i>Kwoniella</i>. Chromosome-level genome assemblies were generated for multiple species, covering virtually all known diversity within these genera. Although <i>Cryptococcus</i> and <i>Kwoniella</i> have comparable genome sizes (about 19.2 and 22.9 Mb) and similar gene content, hinting at preadaptive pathogenic potential, our analysis found evidence of gene gain (via horizontal gene transfer) and gene loss in pathogenic <i>Cryptococcus</i> species, which might represent evolutionary signatures of pathogenic development. Genome analysis also revealed a significant variation in chromosome number and structure between the 2 genera. By combining synteny analysis and experimental centromere validation, we found that most <i>Cryptococcus</i> species have 14 chromosomes, whereas most <i>Kwoniella</i> species have fewer (11, 8, 5, or even as few as 3). Reduced chromosome number in <i>Kwoniella</i> is associated with formation of giant chromosomes (up to 18 Mb) through repeated chromosome fusion events, each marked by a pericentric inversion and centromere loss. While similar chromosome inversion–fusion patterns were observed in all <i>Kwoniella</i> species with fewer than 14 chromosomes, no such pattern was detected in <i>Cryptococcus</i>. Instead, <i>Cryptococcus</i> species with less than 14 chromosomes showed reductions primarily through rearrangements associated with the loss of repeat-rich centromeres. Additionally, <i>Cryptococcus</i> genomes exhibited frequent interchromosomal translocations, including intercentromeric recombination facilitated by transposons shared between centromeres. Overall, our findings advance our understanding of genetic changes possibly associated with pathogenicity in <i>Cryptococcus</i> and provide a foundation to elucidate mechanisms of centromere loss and chromosome fusion driving distinct karyotypes in closely related fungal species, including prominent global human pathogens.

                <p>by Edwin S. Dalmaijer</p>

Homing pigeons (<i>Columba livia</i>) navigate by solar and magnetic compass, and fly home in idiosyncratic but stable routes when repeatedly released from the same location. However, when experienced pigeons fly alongside naive counterparts, their path is altered. Over several generations of turnover (pairs in which the most experienced individual is replaced with a naive one), pigeons show cumulative improvements in efficiency. Here, I show that such cumulative route improvements can occur in a much simpler system by using agent-based simulation. Artificial agents are in silico entities that navigate with a minimal cognitive architecture of goal-direction (they know roughly where the goal is), social proximity (they seek proximity to others and align headings), route memory (they recall landmarks with increasing precision), and continuity (they avoid erratic turns). Agents’ behaviour qualitatively matched that of pigeons, and quantitatively fitted to pigeon data. My results indicate that naive agents benefitted from being paired with experienced agents by following their previously established route. Importantly, experienced agents also benefitted from being paired with naive agents due to regression to the goal: naive agents were more likely to err towards the goal from the perspective of experienced agents’ memorised paths. This subtly biased pairs in the goal direction, resulting in intergenerational improvements of route efficiency. No cumulative improvements were evident in control studies in which agents’ goal-direction, social proximity, or memory were lesioned. These 3 factors are thus necessary and sufficient for cumulative route improvements to emerge, even in the absence of sophisticated communication or thought.

                <p>by Yangfan Zhang, Hungtang Ko, Michael A. Calicchia, Rui Ni, George V. Lauder</p>

The ecological and evolutionary benefits of energy-saving in collective behaviors are rooted in the physical principles and physiological mechanisms underpinning animal locomotion. We propose a turbulence sheltering hypothesis that collective movements of fish schools in turbulent flow can reduce the total energetic cost of locomotion by shielding individuals from the perturbation of chaotic turbulent eddies. We test this hypothesis by quantifying energetics and kinematics in schools of giant danio (<i>Devario aequipinnatus</i>) and compared that to solitary individuals swimming under laminar and turbulent conditions over a wide speed range. We discovered that, when swimming at high speeds and high turbulence levels, fish schools reduced their total energy expenditure (TEE, both aerobic and anaerobic energy) by 63% to 79% compared to solitary fish (e.g., 228 versus 48 kj kg<sup>−1</sup>). Solitary individuals spend approximately 22% more kinematic effort (tail beat amplitude•frequency: 1.7 versus 1.4 BL s<sup>−1</sup>) to swim in turbulence at higher speeds than in laminar conditions. Fish schools swimming in turbulence reduced their three-dimensional group volume by 41% to 68% (at higher speeds, approximately 103 versus 33 cm<sup>3</sup>) and did not alter their kinematic effort compared to laminar conditions. This substantial energy saving highlights that schooling behaviors can mitigate turbulent disturbances by sheltering fish (within schools) from the eddies of sufficient kinetic energy that can disrupt locomotor gaits. Therefore, providing a more desirable internal hydrodynamic environment could be one of the ecological drivers underlying collective behaviors in a dense fluid environment.

                Aims There is minimal research on the duration of biofield experiences. This preliminary study used the experiential learning practice of Master Choa Kok Suis hands sensitisation to determine the duration to experience biofield sensations in between hands and to find the relationship between learning style preferences and biofield sensations. Methods This randomized placebo controlled, single blinded trial included 88 male and female pre-service teachers, aged 22.8±1.2 years. Participants completed a ruler drop test for reaction time, and Six Letter Cancellation test for measuring attention, learning style questionnaire for preferred method of learning, before randomization. The experimental (hands facing each other as introduced by Master Choa Kok Sui) and sham (hands facing opposite) groups practiced hands sensitisation. A semi-structured questionnaire was provided to gather information about biofield sensations and the time it took to experience these sensations between the hands. Results All (N=44) the participants in the experimental group and 13 participants in the sham group reported experiencing biofield sensations. A significant difference was noticed in experiencing magnetic (X2 = 38.247, p ≤ .001), physical sensations of energy (X2 = 12.02, p ≤ .001) and pain (X2 = 62.259, p ≤ .001) among the experimental and sham group . In the experimental group, the average time taken to first experience magnetic sensation, other biofield sensations and temperature variation was 34.84±12.97seconds, 40.28±20.96 seconds and 42.50±19.79 seconds, respectively. Minimum time taken to first experience biofield sensation was 5 seconds and lasted up to study duration of 120 seconds. There was no correlation found between reaction time, sustained attention, and the time needed to experience biofield sensations. Conclusions This study highlights importance of Master Choa Kok Sui hand sensitization in controlled setting revealing differences in experiences of various biofield sensations, showing valuable time-related insights and variability of sensation based on preferred learning.

                Foreign bodies are objects that do not typically belong in the human body but can be ingested, inserted, or entered due to injuries. This article presents various cases and examples of foreign bodies, including objects swallowed, objects inserted into the rectum, vagina, urethra, ear, and nose, or due to injuries caused by falls, puncture wounds, and gunshot wounds. Foreign bodies can be difficult to detect, particularly if they are not inherently radio-opaque, and may be overlooked by patients who cannot provide an adequate history. These foreign bodies may cause harm to the patient. Interpretation is done on radiographs, computed tomography (CT), Ultrasonography (USG), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies. Most foreign objects pass through the gastrointestinal tract without problem; sharp and elongated objects can cause significant injury, and even if they only partially perforate the bowel wall, they can produce chronic inflammatory processes that produce symptoms months or years later. Hence, searching for foreign bodies should be done throughout the gastrointestinal tract, particularly in children and people with mental illness who are more likely to swallow multiple items more than once. Although rare, various materials can be left behind in the body of a patient after surgery, including large and small wire sutures, surgical drains, and retained sponges, which can cause potential complications and foreign body reactions. This article highlights the importance of being aware of the presence of foreign bodies in clinical practice, and a thorough search should be carried out using different modalities, especially CT. Great suspicion and early diagnosis of foreign bodies can avoid potential complications and morbidity. In general, it provides information on the diagnosis and treatment of various types of foreign bodies.

Umbilical Cord-derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells have been known to have higher proliferation rates, plasticity, and better self-improvement ability than MSCs from other sources. The objective was to analyze the secreting proteins in the Conditioned Medium - Umbilical cord-derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells (CM-UCMSCs) which potentially has a role in the chondrogenesis of cartilage defect. Methods We used SDS PAGE combined with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry using mass spectrometer to perform a proteomic analysis of CM-UCMSCs which conditioned in a state of fasting (without serum albumin). Then, we continue to analyze to identify proteins of interest using Mascot sequence matching software. Then Analyzed using in silico / molecular docking to know the interaction of each protein with the cartilage repair factor. Results SDS PAGE performed on all secreted products in CM-UCMSCs. We found one dominant band, then we used Mass Spectrometry continued Mascot sequencing protein that band, conclude that the protein was a D4A9T1/ RNF-111/ Arkadia Protein. And then using in silico/ molecular docking method analyzed that Arkadia Protein worked synergistically with TGF-β1 Protein through activation of TGF-β1 receptors to induce the chondrogenesis. Conclusions Our results show that the fasting state on CM-UCMSCs promoted secreted Arkadia protein. From in silico model prediction, this protein suspects to have an important role in the process of repairing cartilage defects. However, further research is needed before feasible and safe for the clinical application of CM-UCMSCs in cartilage repair.

                Background Tigecycline, a glycylcycline antibiotic is a promising option for the treatment of single or multidrug resistant pathogens. The aim of the study was to evaluate the in-vitro Tigecycline susceptibility of various pathogens from clinical samples received at the tertiary care hospitals in South India. Methods The analysis of specimens from patients admitted were carried out in this prospective cross sectional study. The identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by semi-automated Vitek 2 systems and Kirby Bauer method. Pattern of data analysis was done by descriptive statistics. Results Among 2574 isolates, 812 isolates were Gram positive pathogens and 1762 isolates were Gram negative pathogens. Resistance to Tigecycline was more common among Gram negative pathogens (18.62%) in comparison to the Gram positive pathogens (0.49%). Among 740 Extended Spectrum Beta Lactamases (ESBL) producers such as Klebsiella species & E coli, 629 isolates were susceptible, and 93 isolates were resistant to the tigecycline. All the methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolates were susceptible to tigecycline. Conclusion Multidrug resistant (MDR) pathogens like Acinetobacter species, and Klebsiella species were found to be highly effective in vitro to tigecycline for elimination of infections caused by both Gram positive and Gram negative pathogens. The use of combination therapy becomes crucial to prevent the development of Pan Drug resistance.

                Background This study investigates various surface treatment methods to assess shear bond strength between set Cention N (alkasite-based restorative material) and new alkasite based restorative material. Assessing different surface treatments provide insights in optimizing repair procedure that enables durability of the restoration, thus potentially benefitting clinical outcomes. Methods A total of 48 alkasite based restorative material blocks, measuring 4 mm in depth and 4 mm in diameter, were prepared. The samples were randomly divided into 8 groups (n = 6) according to the surface treatment done. Group I: Surface preparation by bur; Group II: Surface treatment by laser; Group III: Application of 2-step etch and rinse adhesive (Adper Single Bond 2 adhesive),Group IV: Application of single step self-etch adhesive (Scotchbond Universal adhesive); Group V: Bur preparation followed by application of 2-step etch and rinse adhesive; Group VI: Bur preparation followed by application of single step self-etch adhesive; Group VII: Laser preparation followed by application of 2-step etch and rinse adhesive; and Group VIII: Laser preparation followed by application of single step self-etch adhesive. Post-surface preparation, all the specimens were restored with newly mixed alkasite material. Repair bond strength measurements were assessed with universal testing machine. Shapiro-Wilk and Levene's tests were used to check normality and Homogeneity of variance. ANOVA with post-hoc Games-Howell test and two-way ANOVA with post-hoc Bonferroni test was performed to evaluate the influence of surface preparation on the repair bond strength. Results Using a 2-step etch and rinse adhesive resulted in a higher repair bond strength (26.05±2.12) compared to other surface treatments. In contrast, roughening of the surface with burs led to lowest repair bond strength (17.06±3.29) (P=0.02). Conclusion Application of 2-step etch and rinse adhesive to the existing alkasite based restorative material provides superior bonding with the newly added alkasite based restorative material.

                The Neuroscientist, Ahead of Print. <br/>The current study investigates the intricate connection between neurology and islands shedding light on the historical, epidemiological, and genetic aspects. Based on an elaborate literature review, we identified neurological conditions having a significant clustering in an island(s), confined to a particular island(s), named after an island, and described first in an island. The genetic factors played a crucial role, uncovering disorders like Cayman ataxia, Machado Joseph disease, SGCE-mediated dystonia-myoclonus syndrome, X-linked dystonia parkinsonism, hereditary transthyretinrelated amyloidosis, Charcot Marie Tooth 4F, and progressive myoclonic epilepsy syndromes, that exhibited remarkable clustering in diverse islands. Local customs also left enduring imprints. Practices such as cannibalism in Papua New Guinea led to Kuru, while cycad seed consumption in Guam triggered Lytico-Bodig disease. Toxin-mediated neurologic disorders exhibited intricate island connections, exemplified by Minamata disease in Kyushu islands and atypical parkinsonism in French Caribbean islands. Additionally, the Cuban epidemic of amblyopia and neuropathy was associated with severe nutritional deficiencies. This study pioneers a comprehensive review narrating the genetic, environmental, and cultural factors highlighting the spectrum of neurological disorders in island settings. It enriches the medical literature with a unique understanding of the diverse influences shaping neurological health in island environments.

                Branchial cleft cysts are frequently encountered congenital anomalies, arising from the first to fourth pharyngeal clefts and second branchial cleft anomalies are the most common. These anomalies, even though present from birth, become symptomatic only later in life. Majority of them are benign in nature. However, these cysts can get secondarily infected or can harbour secondary metastases and sometimes even primary malignancy in very rare cases. Here we discuss a case of a middle-aged female presenting with a gradually increasing branchial cleft cyst with incidental thyroid lesion on ultrasonography, later proven to be papillary thyroid carcinoma with metastatic spread to the brachial cleft cyst.

                Abstract* Attribution rules act as a tool to modify the terms of a contract by accepting pre-specified terms and conditions. This methodology ensures that the contractual relationship is protected while addressing potentially complex scenarios that may arise during contract execution due to evolving circumstances. To maintain the binding force of the contract, Parties expedite dispute resolution and protect the integrity of their contracts by choosing recourse and prior agreeing to remedies, which encourages continuity in enforcement. These clauses are intended to automatically amend the terms of the contract without requiring the parties to participate in the amendment process. These items adjust the amount of funds subject to the obligation according to changes observed by external indicators associated with the obligation. This is done by comparing the price of a particular currency with the price of a different commodity. In the case of payment in gold or foreign currency, it represents an assault on the binding legal force of the national currency by competing with it as a means of payment and considering it as one of them. Terms of payment in gold and foreign currency are excluded from the attribution requirement, which replaces legal means of payment with new means of payment. It does not constitute a basis for determining the extent of fulfillment of the obligation, and we conclude that the attribution clause is a distinct legal system that deals with amending contractual terms and the contractual imbalance they cause. Amendment is permitted in the event of circumstances occurring that would upset the balance throughout the contract implementation period, and we recommend adopting the attribution clause as an automatic adjustment tool.
