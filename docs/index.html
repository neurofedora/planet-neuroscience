              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Ubiquitous lognormal distribution of neuron densities across mammalian cerebral cortex</a></h4>

              
                Numbers of neurons and their spatial variation are fundamental organizational features of the brain. Despite the large corpus of data available in the literature, the statistical distributions of neuron densities within and across brain areas remain largely uncharacterized. Here, we show that neuron densities are compatible with a lognormal distribution across cortical areas in several mammalian species. We find that this also holds true for uniformly sampled regions across cortex as well as within cortical areas. Our findings uncover a new organizational principle of cortical cytoarchitecture. The ubiquitous lognormal distribution of neuron densities adds to a long list of lognormal variables in the brain.

	<p>Despite extensive research on COVID-19&amp;amp;rsquo;s impact on healthcare workers, few studies have targeted mental health workers (MHWs) and none have investigated previous traumatic events. We investigated psychological distress in MHWs after the first lockdown in Italy to understand which COVID-19, sociodemographic, and professional variables represented greater effects, and the role of previous trauma. The survey included sociodemographic and professional questions, COVID-19 variables, and the questionnaires Life Events Checklist for DSM-5 (LEC-5), Impact of Event Scale&amp;amp;mdash;Revised (IES-R), and Depression Anxiety Stress Scales 21 (DASS-21). On the 271 MHWs who completed the survey (73.1% female; mean age 45.37), we obtained significant effects for contagion fear, experience of patients&amp;amp;rsquo; death, increased workload, and worse team relationship during the first wave. Nurses were more affected and showed more post-traumatic stress symptoms, assessed by IES-R, and more depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms, assessed by DASS-21. The strongest risk factors for distress were greater age, professional role, increased workload, worse team relationship, and separation from family members. Previous experience of severe human suffering and unwanted sexual experiences negatively impacted IES-R and DASS-21 scores. Being a psychiatrist or psychologist/psychotherapist and good team relationships were protective factors. Recent but also previous severe stressful events might represent relevant risk factors for distress, reducing resilience skills. Identifying vulnerable factors and professional categories may help in the development of dedicated measures to prevent emotional burden and support psychological health. Highlights: Psychological distress in mental health workers in the COVID-19 pandemic is more frequent in nurses, who experience more depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress symptoms. Previous and recent stressful events are risk factors for distress and should guide intervention strategies.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The thalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVT) is a structure highly interconnected with several nuclei ranging from forebrain to hypothalamus and brainstem. Numerous rodent studies have examined afferent and efferent connections of the PVT and their contribution to behavior, revealing its important role in the integration of arousal cues. However, the majority of these studies used a region-oriented approach, without considering the neuronal subtype diversity of the nucleus. In the present study, we provide the anatomical and transcriptomic characterization of a subpopulation of PVT neurons molecularly defined by the expression of glucokinase (Gck). Combining a genetically modified mouse model with viral tracing approaches, we mapped both the anterograde and the retrograde projections of Gck-positive neurons of the anterior PVT (Gck<sup>aPVT</sup>). Our results demonstrated that Gck<sup>aPVT</sup> neurons innervate several nuclei throughout the brain axis. The strongest connections are with forebrain areas associated with reward and stress and with hypothalamic structures involved in energy balance and feeding regulation. Furthermore, transcriptomic analysis of the Gck-expressing neurons revealed that they are enriched in receptors for hypothalamic-derived neuropeptides, adhesion molecules, and obesity and diabetes susceptibility transcription factors. Using retrograde labeling combined with immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, we identify that Gck<sup>aPVT</sup> neurons receive direct inputs from well-defined hypothalamic populations, including arginine-vasopressin-, melanin-concentrating hormone-, orexin-, and proopiomelanocortin-expressing neurons. This detailed anatomical and transcriptomic characterization of Gck<sup>aPVT</sup> neurons provides a basis for functional studies of the integration of homeostatic and hedonic aspects of energy homeostasis, and for deciphering the potential role of these neurons in obesity and diabetes development.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Quantification of Neurite Degeneration with Enhanced Accuracy and Efficiency in an In Vitro Model of Parkinsons Disease</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Neurite degeneration is associated with early stages of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease, Parkinson&rsquo;s disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. One method that is commonly used to analyze neurite degeneration involves calculation of a Degeneration Index (DI) following utilization of the Analyze Particles tool of ImageJ to detect neurite fragments in micrographs of cultured cells. However, DI analyses are prone to several types of measurement error, can be time consuming to perform, and are limited in application. Here, we describe an improved method for performing DI analyses. Accuracy of measurements was enhanced through modification of selection criteria for detecting neurite fragments, removal of image artifacts and non-neurite materials from images, and optimization of image contrast. Such enhancements were implemented into an ImageJ macro that enables rapid and fully automated DI analysis of multiple images. The macro features operations for automated removal of cell bodies from micrographs, thus expanding the application of DI analyses to use in experiments involving dissociated cultures. We present experimental findings supporting that, compared with the conventional method, the enhanced analysis method yields measurements with increased accuracy and requires significantly less time to perform. Furthermore, we demonstrate the utility of the method to investigate neurite degeneration in a cell culture model of PD by conducting an experiment revealing the effects of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) on neurite degeneration induced by oxidative stress in human mesencephalic cells. This improved analysis method may be used to gain novel insight into factors underlying neurite degeneration and the progression of neurodegenerative disorders.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Transient Response of Basal Ganglia Network in Healthy and Low-Dopamine State</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The basal ganglia (BG) are crucial for a variety of motor and cognitive functions. Changes induced by persistent low-dopamine (e.g., in Parkinson&rsquo;s disease; PD) result in aberrant changes in steady-state population activity (&beta; band oscillations) and the transient response of the BG. Typically, a brief cortical stimulation results in a triphasic response in the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr; an output of the BG). The properties of the triphasic responses are shaped by dopamine levels. While mechanisms underlying aberrant steady state activity are well studied, it is still unclear which BG interactions are crucial for the aberrant transient responses in the BG. Moreover, it is also unclear whether mechanisms underlying the aberrant changes in steady-state activity and transient response are the same. Here, we used numerical simulations of a network model of BG to identify the key factors that determine the shape of the transient responses. We show that an aberrant transient response of the SNr in the low-dopamine state involves changes in the direct pathway and the recurrent interactions within the globus pallidus externa (GPe) and between GPe and subthalamic nucleus (STN). However, the connections from D2-type spiny projection neurons (D2-SPN) to GPe are most crucial in shaping the transient response and by restoring them to their healthy level, we could restore the shape of transient response even in low-dopamine state. Finally, we show that the changes in BG that result in aberrant transient response are also sufficient to generate pathologic oscillatory activity in the steady state.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Avalanches during epithelial tissue growth; Uniform Growth and a drosophila eye disc model</a></h4>

              
                <p>by George Courcoubetis, Chi Xu, Sergey V. Nuzhdin, Stephan Haas</p>

Epithelial tissues constitute an exotic type of active matter with non-linear properties reminiscent of amorphous materials. In the context of a proliferating epithelium, modeled by the quasistatic vertex model, we identify novel discrete tissue scale rearrangements, i.e. cellular rearrangement avalanches, which are a form of collective cell movement. During the avalanches, the vast majority of cells retain their neighbors, and the resulting cellular trajectories are radial in the periphery, a vortex in the core. After the onset of these avalanches, the epithelial area grows discontinuously. The avalanches are found to be stochastic, and their strength is correlated with the density of cells in the tissue. Overall, avalanches redistribute accumulated local spatial pressure along the tissue. Furthermore, the distribution of avalanche magnitudes is found to obey a power law, with an exponent consistent with sheer induced avalanches in amorphous materials. To understand the role of avalanches in organ development, we simulate epithelial growth of the <i>Drosophila</i> eye disc during the third instar using a computational model, which includes both chemical and mechanistic signaling. During the third instar, the morphogenetic furrow (MF), a ~10 cell wide wave of apical area constriction propagates through the epithelium. These simulations are used to understand the details of the growth process, the effect of the MF on the growth dynamics on the tissue scale, and to make predictions for experimental observations. The avalanches are found to depend on the strength of the apical constriction of cells in the MF, with a stronger apical constriction leading to less frequent and more pronounced avalanches. The results herein highlight the dependence of simulated tissue growth dynamics on relaxation timescales, and serve as a guide for <i>in vitro</i> experiments.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Parameter inference for stochastic biochemical models from perturbation experiments parallelised at the single cell level</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Anđela Davidović, Remy Chait, Gregory Batt, Jakob Ruess</p>

Understanding and characterising biochemical processes inside single cells requires experimental platforms that allow one to perturb and observe the dynamics of such processes as well as computational methods to build and parameterise models from the collected data. Recent progress with experimental platforms and optogenetics has made it possible to expose each cell in an experiment to an individualised input and automatically record cellular responses over days with fine time resolution. However, methods to infer parameters of stochastic kinetic models from single-cell longitudinal data have generally been developed under the assumption that experimental data is sparse and that responses of cells to at most a few different input perturbations can be observed. Here, we investigate and compare different approaches for calculating parameter likelihoods of single-cell longitudinal data based on approximations of the chemical master equation (CME) with a particular focus on coupling the linear noise approximation (LNA) or moment closure methods to a Kalman filter. We show that, as long as cells are measured sufficiently frequently, coupling the LNA to a Kalman filter allows one to accurately approximate likelihoods and to infer model parameters from data even in cases where the LNA provides poor approximations of the CME. Furthermore, the computational cost of filtering-based iterative likelihood evaluation scales advantageously in the number of measurement times and different input perturbations and is thus ideally suited for data obtained from modern experimental platforms. To demonstrate the practical usefulness of these results, we perform an experiment in which single cells, equipped with an optogenetic gene expression system, are exposed to various different light-input sequences and measured at several hundred time points and use parameter inference based on iterative likelihood evaluation to parameterise a stochastic model of the system.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">In vitro machine learning-based CAR T immunological synapse quality measurements correlate with patient clinical outcomes</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Alireza Naghizadeh, Wei-chung Tsao, Jong Hyun Cho, Hongye Xu, Mohab Mohamed, Dali Li, Wei Xiong, Dimitri Metaxas, Carlos A. Ramos, Dongfang Liu</p>

The human immune system consists of a highly intelligent network of billions of independent, self-organized cells that interact with each other. Machine learning (ML) is an artificial intelligence (AI) tool that automatically processes huge amounts of image data. Immunotherapies have revolutionized the treatment of blood cancer. Specifically, one such therapy involves engineering immune cells to express chimeric antigen receptors (CAR), which combine tumor antigen specificity with immune cell activation in a single receptor. To improve their efficacy and expand their applicability to solid tumors, scientists optimize different CARs with different modifications. However, predicting and ranking the efficacy of different "off-the-shelf" immune products (e.g., CAR or Bispecific T-cell Engager [BiTE]) and selection of clinical responders are challenging in clinical practice. Meanwhile, identifying the optimal CAR construct for a researcher to further develop a potential clinical application is limited by the current, time-consuming, costly, and labor-intensive conventional tools used to evaluate efficacy. Particularly, more than 30 years of immunological synapse (IS) research data demonstrate that T cell efficacy is not only controlled by the specificity and avidity of the tumor antigen and T cell interaction, but also it depends on a collective process, involving multiple adhesion and regulatory molecules, as well as tumor microenvironment, spatially and temporally organized at the IS formed by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) and natural killer (NK) cells. The optimal function of cytotoxic lymphocytes (including CTL and NK) depends on IS quality. Recognizing the inadequacy of conventional tools and the importance of IS in immune cell functions, we investigate a new strategy for assessing CAR-T efficacy by quantifying CAR IS quality using the glass-support planar lipid bilayer system combined with ML-based data analysis. Previous studies in our group show that CAR-T IS quality correlates with antitumor activities <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. However, current manually quantified IS quality data analysis is time-consuming and labor-intensive with low accuracy, reproducibility, and repeatability. In this study, we develop a novel ML-based method to quantify thousands of CAR cell IS images with enhanced accuracy and speed. Specifically, we used artificial neural networks (ANN) to incorporate object detection into segmentation. The proposed ANN model extracts the most useful information to differentiate different IS datasets. The network output is flexible and produces bounding boxes, instance segmentation, contour outlines (borders), intensities of the borders, and segmentations without borders. Based on requirements, one or a combination of this information is used in statistical analysis. The ML-based automated algorithm quantified CAR-T IS data correlates with the clinical responder and non-responder treated with Kappa-CAR-T cells directly from patients. The results suggest that CAR cell IS quality can be used as a potential composite biomarker and correlates with antitumor activities in patients, which is sufficiently discriminative to further test the CAR IS quality as a clinical biomarker to predict response to CAR immunotherapy in cancer. For translational research, the method developed here can also provide guidelines for designing and optimizing numerous CAR constructs for potential clinical development.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Metaproteomics as a tool for studying the protein landscape of human-gut bacterial species</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Moses Stamboulian, Jamie Canderan, Yuzhen Ye</p>

Host-microbiome interactions and the microbial community have broad impact in human health and diseases. Most microbiome based studies are performed at the genome level based on next-generation sequencing techniques, but metaproteomics is emerging as a powerful technique to study microbiome functional activity by characterizing the complex and dynamic composition of microbial proteins. We conducted a large-scale survey of human gut microbiome metaproteomic data to identify generalist species that are ubiquitously expressed across all samples and specialists that are highly expressed in a small subset of samples associated with a certain phenotype. We were able to utilize the metaproteomic mass spectrometry data to reveal the protein landscapes of these species, which enables the characterization of the expression levels of proteins of different functions and underlying regulatory mechanisms, such as operons. Finally, we were able to recover a large number of open reading frames (ORFs) with spectral support, which were missed by <i>de novo</i> protein-coding gene predictors. We showed that a majority of the rescued ORFs overlapped with <i>de novo</i> predicted protein-coding genes, but on opposite strands or in different frames. Together, these demonstrate applications of metaproteomics for the characterization of important gut bacterial species.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Mathematical analysis of robustness of oscillations in models of the mammalian circadian clock</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Xiangyu Yao, Benjamin L. Heidebrecht, Jing Chen, John J. Tyson</p>

Circadian rhythms in a wide range of organisms are mediated by molecular mechanisms based on transcription-translation feedback. In this paper, we use bifurcation theory to explore mathematical models of genetic oscillators, based on Kim & Forger’s interpretation of the circadian clock in mammals. At the core of their models is a negative feedback loop whereby PER proteins (PER1 and PER2) bind to and inhibit their transcriptional activator, BMAL1. For oscillations to occur, the dissociation constant of the PER:BMAL1 complex, K^d, must be ≤ 0.04 nM, which is orders of magnitude smaller than a reasonable expectation of 1–10 nM for this protein complex. We relax this constraint by two modifications to Kim & Forger’s ‘single negative feedback’ (SNF) model: first, by introducing a multistep reaction chain for posttranscriptional modifications of <i>Per</i> mRNA and posttranslational phosphorylations of PER, and second, by replacing the first-order rate law for degradation of PER in the nucleus by a Michaelis-Menten rate law. These modifications increase the maximum allowable K^d to ~2 nM. In a third modification, we consider an alternative rate law for gene transcription to resolve an unrealistically large rate of <i>Per2</i> transcription at very low concentrations of BMAL1. Additionally, we studied extensions of the SNF model to include a second negative feedback loop (involving REV-ERB) and a supplementary positive feedback loop (involving ROR). Contrary to Kim & Forger’s observations of these extended models, we find that, with our modifications, the supplementary positive feedback loop makes the oscillations more robust than observed in the models with one or two negative feedback loops. However, all three models are similarly robust when accounting for circadian rhythms (~24 h period) with K^d ≥ 1 nM. Our results provide testable predictions for future experimental studies.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Quantitative input–output dynamics of a c-di-GMP signal transduction cascade in Vibrio cholerae</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Andrew A. Bridges, Jojo A. Prentice, Chenyi Fei, Ned S. Wingreen, Bonnie L. Bassler</p>

Bacterial biofilms are multicellular communities that collectively overcome environmental threats and clinical treatments. To regulate the biofilm lifecycle, bacteria commonly transduce sensory information via the second messenger molecule cyclic diguanylate (c-di-GMP). Using experimental and modeling approaches, we quantitatively capture c-di-GMP signal transmission via the bifunctional polyamine receptor NspS-MbaA, from ligand binding to output, in the pathogen <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>. Upon binding of norspermidine or spermidine, NspS-MbaA synthesizes or degrades c-di-GMP, respectively, which, in turn, drives alterations specifically to biofilm gene expression. A long-standing question is how output specificity is achieved via c-di-GMP, a diffusible molecule that regulates dozens of effectors. We show that NspS-MbaA signals locally to specific effectors, sensitizing <i>V</i>. <i>cholerae</i> to polyamines. However, local signaling is not required for specificity, as changes to global cytoplasmic c-di-GMP levels can selectively regulate biofilm genes. This work establishes the input–output dynamics underlying c-di-GMP signaling, which could be useful for developing bacterial manipulation strategies.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Periodic synchronisation of dengue epidemics in Thailand over the last 5 decades driven by temperature and immunity</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Bernardo García-Carreras, Bingyi Yang, Mary K. Grabowski, Lawrence W. Sheppard, Angkana T. Huang, Henrik Salje, Hannah Eleanor Clapham, Sopon Iamsirithaworn, Pawinee Doung-Ngern, Justin Lessler, Derek A. T. Cummings</p>

The spatial distribution of dengue and its vectors (spp. <i>Aedes</i>) may be the widest it has ever been, and projections suggest that climate change may allow the expansion to continue. However, less work has been done to understand how climate variability and change affects dengue in regions where the pathogen is already endemic. In these areas, the waxing and waning of immunity has a large impact on temporal dynamics of cases of dengue haemorrhagic fever. Here, we use 51 years of data across 72 provinces and characterise spatiotemporal patterns of dengue in Thailand, where dengue has caused almost 1.5 million cases over the last 30 years, and examine the roles played by temperature and dynamics of immunity in giving rise to those patterns. We find that timescales of multiannual oscillations in dengue vary in space and time and uncover an interesting spatial phenomenon: Thailand has experienced multiple, periodic synchronisation events. We show that although patterns in synchrony of dengue are similar to those observed in temperature, the relationship between the two is most consistent during synchronous periods, while during asynchronous periods, temperature plays a less prominent role. With simulations from temperature-driven models, we explore how dynamics of immunity interact with temperature to produce the observed patterns in synchrony. The simulations produced patterns in synchrony that were similar to observations, supporting an important role of immunity. We demonstrate that multiannual oscillations produced by immunity can lead to asynchronous dynamics and that synchrony in temperature can then synchronise these dengue dynamics. At higher mean temperatures, immune dynamics can be more predominant, and dengue dynamics more insensitive to multiannual fluctuations in temperature, suggesting that with rising mean temperatures, dengue dynamics may become increasingly asynchronous. These findings can help underpin predictions of disease patterns as global temperatures rise.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to evaluate functional and safety outcomes of endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) versus medical management (MM) in patients with M2 occlusion and examine their association with perfusion imaging mismatch and stroke severity.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In a pooled, patient-level analysis of 3 randomized controlled trials (EXTEND-IA, EXTEND-and IA-TNK parts 1 and 2) and 2 prospective nonrandomized studies (INSPIRE and SELECT), we evaluated EVT association with 90-day functional independence (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] = 0–2) in isolated M2 occlusions as compared to medical management overall and in subgroups by mismatch profile status and stroke severity.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We included 517 patients (EVT = 195 and MM = 322), baseline median (interquartile range [IQR]) National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) was 13 (8–19) in EVT versus 10 (6–15) in MM, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001. Pretreatment ischemic core did not differ (EVT = 10 [0–24] ml vs MM = 9 [3–21] ml, <i>p</i> = 0.59). Compared to MM, EVT was more frequently associated with functional independence (68.3 vs 61.6%, adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.42, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.25–4.67, <i>p</i> = 0.008, inverse probability of treatment weights [IPTW]-OR = 1.75, 95% CI = 1.00–3.75, <i>p</i> = 0.05) with a shift toward better mRS outcomes (adjusted cOR = 2.02, 95% CI:1.23–3.29, <i>p</i> = 0.005), and lower mortality (5 vs 10%, aOR = 0.32, 95% CI = 0.12–0.87, <i>p</i> = 0.025). EVT was associated with higher functional independence in patients with a perfusion mismatch profile (EVT = 70.7% vs MM = 61.3%, aOR = 2.29, 95% CI = 1.09–4.79, <i>p</i> = 0.029, IPTW-OR = 2.02, 1.08–3.78, <i>p</i> = 0.029), whereas no difference was found in those without mismatch (EVT = 43.8% vs MM = 62.7%, <i>p</i> = 0.17, IPTW-OR: 0.71, 95% CI = 0.18–2.78, <i>p</i> = 0.62). Functional independence was more frequent with EVT in patients with moderate or severe strokes, as defined by baseline NIHSS above any thresholds from 6 to 10, whereas there was no difference between groups with milder strokes below these thresholds.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In patients with M2 occlusion, EVT was associated with improved clinical outcomes when compared to MM. This association was primarily observed in patients with a mismatch profile and those with higher stroke severity. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Memory is supported by a network of brain regions, with the hippocampus serving a critical role in this cognitive process. Previous meta-analyses on the association between hippocampal structure and memory have largely focused on adults. Multiple studies have since suggested that hippocampal volume is related to memory performance in children and adolescents; however, the strength and direction of this relation varies across reports, and thus, remains unclear. To further understand this brain–behavior relation, we conducted a meta-analysis to investigate the association between hippocampal volume (assessed as total volume) and memory during typical development. Across 25 studies and 61 memory outcomes with 1357 participants, results showed a small, but significant, positive association between total hippocampal volume and memory performance. Estimates of the variability across studies in the relation between total volume and memory were not explained by differences in memory task type (delayed vs. immediate; relational vs. nonrelational), participant age range, or the method of normalization of hippocampal volumes. Overall, findings suggest that larger total hippocampal volume relates to better memory performance in children and adolescents and that this relation is similar across the memory types and age ranges assessed. To facilitate enhanced generalization across studies in the future, we discuss considerations for the field moving forward.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Activin A regulates the excitability of hippocampal mossy cells</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Mossy cells (MCs) in the hilus of the dentate gyrus (DG) receive increasing attention as a major player controlling information processing in the DG network. Furthermore, disturbed MC activity has been implicated in widespread neuropsychiatric disorders such as epilepsy and major depression. Using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from MCs in acute hippocampal slices from wild type and transgenic mice, we demonstrate that activin, a member of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) family, has a strong neuromodulatory effect on MC activity. Disruption of activin receptor signaling reduced MC firing, dampened their excitatory input and augmented their inhibitory input. By contrast, acute application of recombinant activin A strongly increased MC activity and promoted excitatory synaptic drive. Notably, similar changes of MC activity have been observed in a rodent model of depression and after antidepressant drug therapy, respectively. Given that a rise in activin signaling particularly in the DG has been proposed as a mechanism of antidepressant action, our data suggest that the effect of activin on MC excitability might make a considerable contribution in this regard.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The out-of-field dose in radiation therapy induces delayed tumorigenesis by senescence evasion</a></h4>

              
                A rare but severe complication of curative-intent radiation therapy is the induction of second primary cancers. These cancers preferentially develop not inside the planning target volume (PTV) but around, over several centimeters, after a latency period of 1–40 years. We show here that normal human or mouse dermal fibroblasts submitted to the out-of-field dose scattering at the margin of a PTV receiving a mimicked patient’s treatment do not die but enter in a long-lived senescent state resulting from the accumulation of unrepaired DNA single-strand breaks, in the almost absence of double-strand breaks. Importantly, a few of these senescent cells systematically and spontaneously escape from the cell cycle arrest after a while to generate daughter cells harboring mutations and invasive capacities. These findings highlight single-strand break-induced senescence as the mechanism of second primary cancer initiation, with clinically relevant spatiotemporal specificities. Senescence being pharmacologically targetable, they open the avenue for second primary cancer prevention.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Effector membrane translocation biosensors reveal G protein and βarrestin coupling profiles of 100 therapeutically relevant GPCRs</a></h4>

              
                The recognition that individual GPCRs can activate multiple signaling pathways has raised the possibility of developing drugs selectively targeting therapeutically relevant ones. This requires tools to determine which G proteins and barrestins are activated by a given receptor. Here, we present a set of BRET sensors monitoring the activation of the 12 G protein subtypes based on the translocation of their effectors to the plasma membrane (EMTA). Unlike most of the existing detection systems, EMTA does not require modification of receptors or G proteins (except for G<sub>s</sub>). EMTA was found to be suitable for the detection of constitutive activity, inverse agonism, biased signaling and polypharmacology. Profiling of 100 therapeutically relevant human GPCRs resulted in 1,500 pathway-specific concentration-response curves and revealed a great diversity of coupling profiles ranging from exquisite selectivity to broad promiscuity. Overall, this work describes unique resources for studying the complexities underlying GPCR signaling and pharmacology.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Hyperphosphatemia increases inflammation to exacerbate anemia and skeletal muscle wasting independently of FGF23-FGFR4 signaling</a></h4>

              
                Elevations in plasma phosphate concentrations (hyperphosphatemia) occur in chronic kidney disease (CKD), in certain genetic disorders, and following the intake of a phosphate-rich diet. Whether hyperphosphatemia and/or associated changes in metabolic regulators, including elevations of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) directly contribute to specific complications of CKD is uncertain. Here we report that similar to patients with CKD, mice with adenine-induced CKD develop inflammation, anemia and skeletal muscle wasting. These complications are also observed in mice fed high phosphate diet even without CKD. Ablation of pathologic FGF23-FGFR4 signaling did not protect mice on an increased phosphate diet or mice with adenine-induced CKD from these sequelae. However, low phosphate diet ameliorated anemia and skeletal muscle wasting in a genetic mouse model of CKD. Our mechanistic <i>in vitro</i> studies indicate that phosphate elevations induce inflammatory signaling and increase hepcidin expression in hepatocytes, a potential causative link between hyperphosphatemia, anemia and skeletal muscle dysfunction. Our study suggests that high phosphate intake, as caused by the consumption of processed food, may have harmful effects irrespective of pre-existing kidney injury, supporting not only the clinical utility of treating hyperphosphatemia in CKD patients but also arguing for limiting phosphate intake in healthy individuals.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Mapping circuit dynamics during function and dysfunction</a></h4>

              
                Neural circuits can generate many spike patterns, but only some are functional. The study of how circuits generate and maintain functional dynamics is hindered by a poverty of description of circuit dynamics across functional and dysfunctional states. For example, although the regular oscillation of a central pattern generator is well characterized by its frequency and the phase relationships between its neurons, these metrics are ineffective descriptors of the irregular and aperiodic dynamics that circuits can generate under perturbation or in disease states. By recording the circuit dynamics of the well-studied pyloric circuit in <i>Cancer borealis</i>, we used statistical features of spike times from neurons in the circuit to visualize the spike patterns generated by this circuit under a variety of conditions. This approach captures both the variability of functional rhythms and the diversity of atypical dynamics in a single map. Clusters in the map identify qualitatively different spike patterns hinting at different dynamical states in the circuit. State probability and the statistics of the transitions between states varied with environmental perturbations, removal of descending neuromodulatory inputs, and the addition of exogenous neuromodulators. This analysis reveals strong mechanistically interpretable links between complex changes in the collective behavior of a neural circuit and specific experimental manipulations, and can constrain hypotheses of how circuits generate functional dynamics despite variability in circuit architecture and environmental perturbations.

                Two-thirds of human hormones and one-third of clinical drugs act on membrane receptors that couple to G proteins to achieve appropriate functional responses. While G protein transducers from literature are annotated in the Guide to Pharmacology database, two recent large-scale datasets now expand the receptor-G protein 'couplome'. However, these three datasets differ in scope and reported G protein couplings giving different coverage and conclusions on GPCR-G protein signaling. Here, we report a common coupling map uncovering novel couplings supported by both large-scale studies, the selectivity/promiscuity of GPCRs and G proteins, and how the co-coupling and co-expression of G proteins compare to the families from phylogenetic relationships. The coupling map and insights on GPCR-G protein selectivity will catalyze advances in receptor research and cellular signaling towards the exploitation of G protein signaling bias in design of safer drugs.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Persistent cell migration emerges from a coupling between protrusion dynamics and polarized trafficking</a></h4>

              
                Migrating cells present a variety of paths, from random to highly directional ones. While random movement can be explained by basal intrinsic activity, persistent movement requires stable polarization. Here, we quantitatively address emergence of persistent migration in RPE1 cells over long timescales. By live-cell imaging and dynamic micropatterning, we demonstrate that the Nucleus-Golgi axis aligns with direction of migration leading to efficient cell movement. We show that polarized trafficking is directed towards protrusions with a 20 min delay, and that migration becomes random after disrupting internal cell organization. Eventually, we prove that localized optogenetic Cdc42 activation orients the Nucleus-Golgi axis. Our work suggests that polarized trafficking stabilizes the protrusive activity of the cell, while protrusive activity orients this polarity axis, leading to persistent cell migration. Using a minimal physical model, we show that this feedback is sufficient to recapitulate the quantitative properties of cell migration in the timescale of hours.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Mesoaccumbal glutamate neurons drive reward via glutamate release, but aversion via dopamine co-release</a></h4>

              
                Ventral tegmental area (VTA) projections to the nucleus accumbens medial shell (NAc) drive reward-related motivation. Although dopamine neurons are predominant, a substantial glutamatergic projection is also present, and a subset of these populations can release both dopamine and glutamate. Optogenetic stimulation of VTA glutamate neurons supports self-stimulation, but can also induce place avoidance, even in the same assay. Here, we parsed the selective contribution of glutamate or dopamine co-release from VTA glutamate neurons to reinforcement and avoidance. We expressed Channelrhodopsin (ChR2) in VTA glutamate neurons, in combination with CRISPR/Cas9 to disrupt either the gene encoding vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGLUT2) or Tyrosine hydroxylase (Th). Selective disruption of VGLUT2 abolished optogenetic self-stimulation, but left real-time place avoidance intact, while CRISPR/Cas9 deletion of Th preserved optogenetic self-stimulation but abolished place avoidance. Our results demonstrate that glutamate release from VTA glutamate neurons is positively reinforcing, but that dopamine release from these same neurons can induce avoidance behavior.

                The auditory system relies on local and global representations, depending on the amount of entering temporal details. When local information exceeds system constraints, acoustic details are summarized into a set of average statistics and global structure emerges. Whether computations subtending local and global representations of sounds can be distinguished at the cortical level is unknown. A computational auditory model was employed to extract auditory statistics from natural sound textures, such as fire, wind, and rain, and generate synthetic exemplars in which we had control of local and global properties. Participants were passively exposed to auditory streams with triplets of sounds including two standards and an oddball while the EEG was recorded. In Local Discrimination (exp 1) the oddball sound varied from standards only for its local features; in Global Discrimination (exp 2), it varied for its global structure. Different sound durations were employed to manipulate the amount of acoustic information and statistical variability between standards and oddballs. We expected short and long sounds to engage local (exp 1) or global (exp 2) representations, respectively. As predicted, neural responses associated with local discriminations exceeded global ones for short sounds, whereas the opposite pattern emerged for longer sounds. Electrical source estimates revealed that local discriminations mainly engaged auditory regions of the right hemisphere, while global discriminations of the left hemisphere. These findings revealed distinct neural correlates of acoustic discriminations guided by local or global structures. Ultimately results demonstrated that the auditory system developed a functional architecture to automatically detect changes occurring in the environment based on these two modes of sound representation.

                PTEN is a well-known tumor suppressor whose mutations are also strongly associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The activity and function of PTEN in neurons have been studied extensively in various settings, whereas animal models offer the best opportunity to experimentally modify and test the role of PTEN in neuronal development in vivo. On the molecular level, PTEN's importance in the mTOR pathway's suppression is well-known but many other interactions have been suggested and yet others likely remain undiscovered. Therefore, to systematically explore the regulatory landscape downstream of PTEN on the genetic level, we have set out to establish a single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) workflow to measure gene expression changes as a result of knocking out the Pten gene in vivo. We were able to collect brain tissue from four conditionally knocked out mouse samples and dissociate them into single live cells, which were subsequently flow-sorted and a scRNA-seq library was prepared. All of these steps were completed in a single day, yielding sequencing data from hundreds of cells suitable for cell clustering, cell type identification, and differential expression measurements. Having demonstrated its feasibility, this approach promises to aid hypothesis generation and discovery in mapping the function of Pten as well other genes whose regulatory networks remain to be fully defined.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Transcriptomic similarity in the mouse and human brain</a></h4>

              
                The ever-increasing use of mouse models in preclinical neuroscience research calls for an improvement in the methods used to translate findings between mouse and human brains. Using openly accessible brain-wide transcriptomic data sets, we evaluated the similarity of mouse and human brain regions on the basis of homologous gene expression. Our results suggest that mouse-human homologous genes capture broad patterns of neuroanatomical organization, but that the resolution of cross-species correspondences can be improved using a novel supervised machine learning approach. Using this method, we demonstrate that sensorimotor subdivisions of the neocortex exhibit greater similarity between species, compared with supramodal subdivisions, and that mouse isocortical regions separate into sensorimotor and supramodal clusters based on their similarity to human cortical regions. We also find that mouse and human striatal regions are strongly conserved, with the mouse caudoputamen exhibiting an equal degree of similarity to both the human caudate and putamen.

                The generation of neural organoids from human pluripotent stem cells holds great promise in modeling disease and screenings drugs, but current approaches are difficult to scale due to undesired organoid fusion. Here, we develop a scalable neural organoid platform by screening biocompatible polymers that prevent fusion of organoids cultured in suspension. We show that addition of one inexpensive polysaccharide enables straightforward screening of 298 FDA-approved drugs and teratogens for growth defects using over 2,400 cortical organoids.

                Absence seizures are characterized by brief periods of unconsciousness accompanied by a lapse in motor function that can occur hundreds of times throughout the day. Outside of these frequent moments of unconsciousness, approximately a third of patients experience treatment-resistant attention impairments. Convergent evidence suggests prefrontal cortex (PFC) dysfunction may underlie attention impairments in affected patients. To test this, we use a combination of slice physiology, fiber photometry, optogenetics, and behavior in the Scn8a+/- mouse model of absence epilepsy. In these mice, we find decreased parvalbumin interneuron (PVIN) recruitment in the medial PFC (mPFC) in vitro and hypoactivity during cue presentation in vivo that is linked to attention dysfunction. Further, we find that low levels of mPFC PVIN activity are predictive of poorer performance in WT littermates. This highlights cue-evoked PVIN activity as an important mechanism for attention and suggests PVINs may represent a therapeutic target for cognitive co-morbidities in absence epilepsy.

                Dendritic computations signaled into neuronal output by the initiation and propagation of regenerative dendritic spikes are a feature of the electrical operation of rodent neocortical pyramidal neurons, that have a central role in neocortical circuit function. However, it remains poorly explored whether these mechanisms are operational in the human neocortex. To directly compare the dendritic computational properties of the most numerous class of pyramidal neuron in the human and rat neocortex we made simultaneous electrical recordings from the soma and apical dendrites of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons maintained in acute brain slices of analogous cortical areas under identical experimental conditions. In both species correlated dendritic excitatory input led to the initiation of sodium channel-mediated dendritic spikes, which had stereotyped biophysical properties. Dendritic sodium spikes in human and rat layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons could be generated across a similar wide input range, exhibited a similar frequency range of activation, and forward propagated with high fidelity to drive neuronal output. Our findings therefore reveal that the dendritic computational properties of human layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons are phylogenetically conserved.

                Experience-dependent cortical plasticity is a pivotal process of human brain development and essential for the formation of most cognitive functions. Although studies found that early visual experience could influence the endogenous development of visual cortex in animals, little is known about such impact on human infants. Using the multi-modal MRI data from developing human connectome project, we revealed the early structural and functional maps in the ventral visual cortex and their development across the first month of age. Particularly, we found the postnatal experience could modulate both the cortical morphology in ventral visual cortex and the functional circuit between bilateral primary visual cortices. But the cortical myelination and overall functional circuits of ventral cortex, particularly that of the high-order visual cortex, developed without significant influence of postnatal experience in such early period. These experience-dependent cortical properties were further validated in the preterm-born infants who have longer postnatal time but immature cortical development at birth. The results confirmed that the development of cortical thickness was dominated by the postnatal experience but the functional circuit might be determined by the overall maturity of visual cortex. These data suggest in human newborns that early postnatal experience shapes the structural and functional development of the visual cortex in selective and organized pattern.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Patterns of retrieval-related cortico-striatal connectivity are stable across the adult lifespan</a></h4>

              
                Memory retrieval effects in the striatum are well documented and robust across a number of experimental paradigms and stimulus materials. However, the functional significance of these effects, and whether they are moderated by age, remains unclear. In the present study, we used fMRI paired with an associative recognition task to examine retrieval effects in the striatum in a large sample of healthy young, middle aged, and older adults. We identified anatomically segregated patterns of enhanced striatal BOLD activity during recollection- and familiarity-based memory judgments. Successful recollection was associated with enhanced BOLD activity in bilateral putamen and nucleus accumbens. Familiarity effects were evident in the head of the caudate nucleus bilaterally. Crucially, none of these effects were reliably moderated by age. Using psychophysiological interaction analyses, we observed a monitoring-related increase in functional connectivity between the caudate and regions of the frontoparietal control network, and between the putamen and bilateral retrosplenial cortex and intraparietal sulcus. In all instances, monitoring-related increases in cortico-striatal connectivity were unmoderated by age. These results suggest that the striatum, and the caudate in particular, couples with the frontoparietal control network to support top-down retrieval monitoring operations, and that the integrity of these effects are preserved in advanced age.

                People with hearing loss struggle understanding speech in noisy backgrounds. Speech intelligibility models highlight the importance of slow-varying envelopes of speech and noise; however, the physiological basis of impaired perception remains unclear. We provide neurophysiological evidence that, although acoustic trauma enhances both speech and noise envelopes, disruptions in cochlear tonotopicity preferentially enhance neural responses to noise in noisy speech. These results provide mechanistic insights into everyday-communication challenges created by hearing loss.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Patch2Self denoising of Diffusion MRI with Self-Supervision and Matrix Sketching</a></h4>

              
                Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) is the only noninvasive method for quantifying microstructure and reconstructing white-matter pathways in the living human brain. Fluctuations from multiple sources create significant additive noise in DWI data which must be suppressed before subsequent microstructure analysis. We introduce a self-supervised learning method for denoising DWI data, Patch2Self (P2S), which uses the entire volume to learn a full-rank locally linear denoiser for that volume. By taking advantage of the oversampled $q$-space of DWI data, P2S can separate structure from noise without requiring an explicit model for either. The setup of P2S however can be resource intensive, both in terms of running time and memory usage, as it uses all voxels (n) from all-but-one held-in volumes (d-1) to learn a linear mapping $Phi : mathbb{R}^{n times (d-1)} mapsto mathbb{R}^{n}$ for denoising the held-out volume. We exploit the redundancy imposed by P2S to alleviate its performance issues and inspect regions that influence the noise disproportionately. Specifically we introduce P2S-sketch, which makes a two-fold contribution: textit{(1)} P2S-sketch uses matrix sketching to perform self-supervised denoising. By solving a sub-problem on a smaller sub-space, so called, textit{coreset}, we show how P2S can yield a significant speedup in training time while using less memory. textit{(2)} We show how the so-called statistical leverage scores can be used to textit{interpret} the denoising of dMRI data, a process that was traditionally treated as a black-box. Our experiments conducted on simulated and real data clearly demonstrate that P2S via matrix sketching (P2S-sketch) does not lead to any loss in denoising quality, while yielding significant speedup and improved memory usage by training on a smaller fraction of the data. With thorough comparisons on real and simulated data, we show that Patch2Self outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods for DWI denoising both in terms of visual conspicuity and downstream modeling tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach via multiple quantitative metrics such as fiber bundle coherence, $R^2$ via cross-validation on model fitting, mean absolute error of DTI residuals across a cohort of sixty subjects.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Targeted Anatomical and Functional Identification of Antinociceptive and Pronociceptive Serotonergic Neurons that project to the Superficial Dorsal Horn</a></h4>

              
                Spinally-projecting serotonergic neurons play a key role in controlling pain sensitivity and can either increase or decrease nociception depending on physiological context. It is currently unknown how serotonergic neurons mediate these opposing effects. Utilizing virus-based strategies, we identified two anatomically separated populations of serotonergic hindbrain neurons located in the lateral paragigantocellularis (LPGi) and the medial hindbrain, which respectively innervate the superficial and deep spinal dorsal horn and have contrasting effects on pain perception. Our tracing experiments revealed an unexpected high selectivity of serotonergic neurons of the LPGi for transduction with spinally injected AAV2retro vectors while medial hindbrain serotonergic neurons were largely resistant to AAV2retro transduction. Taking advantage of this selectivity, we employed intersectional chemogenetic approaches to demonstrate that activation of the LPGi serotonergic projections decreases thermal sensitivity, whereas activation of medial serotonergic neurons increases sensitivity to mechanical von Frey stimulation. Together these results suggest that there are functionally distinct classes of serotonergic hindbrain neurons that differ in their anatomical location in the hindbrain, their postsynaptic targets in the spinal cord, and impact on nociceptive sensitivity. At least the LPGi neurons give rise to rather global and bilateral projections throughout the rostrocaudal extent of the spinal cord suggesting that they contribute to widespread systemic pain control.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Automated neuron tracking inside moving and deforming animals using deep learning and targeted augmentation</a></h4>

              
                Advances in functional brain imaging now allow sustained rapid 3D visualization of large numbers of neurons inside behaving animals. To decode circuit activity, imaged neurons must be individually segmented and tracked. This is particularly challenging when the brain itself moves and deforms inside a flexible body. The field has lacked general methods for solving this problem effectively. To address this need, we developed a method based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) with specific enhancements which we apply to freely moving Caenorhabditis elegans. For a traditional CNN to track neurons across images of a brain with different postures, the CNN must be trained with ground truth (GT) annotations of similar postures. When these postures are diverse, an adequate number of GT annotations can be prohibitively large to generate manually. We introduce 'targeted augmentation', a method to automatically synthesize reliable annotations from a few manual annotations. Our method effectively learns the internal deformations of the brain. The learned deformations are used to synthesize annotations for new postures by deforming the manual annotations of similar postures in GT images. The technique is germane to 3D images, which are generally more difficult to analyze than 2D images. The synthetic annotations, which are added to diversify training datasets, drastically reduce manual annotation and proofreading. Our method is effective both when neurons are represented as individual points or as 3D volumes. We provide a GUI that incorporates targeted augmentation in an end-to-end pipeline, from manual GT annotation of a few images to final proofreading of all images. We apply the method to simultaneously measure activity in the second-layer interneurons in C. elegans: RIA, RIB, and RIM, including the RIA neurite. We find that these neurons show rich behaviors, including switching entrainment on and off dynamically when the animal is exposed to periodic odor pulses.

                Our preference for a reward depends on the time of delay for its delivery. Here we show that changes in the external environment can manipulate the perceived duration of time, which alters the formation of the choice preference through value signals in the cortical and subcortical brain regions. Humans anticipated a real liquid reward delayed by tens of seconds, during which colors of visually presented panels gradually changed. The color-change delay was perceived as shorter than a control color-constant delay. Interestingly, participants with greater perceptual bias of the delay showed stronger preference for rewards with the color-change delay. The ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) and ventral striatum (VS) showed dynamic neural signatures of value components that were modulated by subjectively perceived duration. Crucially, these effects were specifically observed while a future reward was anticipated, and moreover, the vlPFC activity was weaker in participants with greater bias in the duration perception. These results demonstrate that subjective time experience leads to biased choice preference of delayed rewards, which is regulated by dynamic value signals of future rewards and accurate perception of the external world in the vlPFC-VS systems.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">High-level visual areas act like domain-general filters with strong selectivity and functional specialization</a></h4>

              
                Investigation of the visual system has mainly relied on a-priori hypotheses to restrict experimental stimuli or models used to analyze experimental data. Hypotheses are an essential part of scientific inquiry, but an exclusively hypothesis-driven approach might lead to confirmation bias towards existing theories and away from novel discoveries not predicted by them. This paper uses a hypothesis-neutral computational approach to study four high-level visual regions of interest (ROIs) selective to faces, places, letters, or body parts. We leverage the unprecedented scale and quality of the Natural Scenes Dataset to constrain neural network models of these ROIs with functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) measurements. We show that using only the stimulus images and the associated activity in an ROI, we are able to train from scratch a neural network that can predict the activity in each voxel of that ROI with an accuracy that beats state-of-the-art models. Moreover, once trained, the ROI-specific networks can reveal what kinds of functional properties emerge spontaneously in their training. Strikingly, despite no category-level supervision, the units in the trained networks act strongly as detectors for semantic concepts like faces or words, thereby providing substantial pieces of evidence for categorical selectivity in these visual areas. Importantly, this selectivity is maintained when training the networks with selective deprivations in the training diet, by excluding images that contain their preferred category. The resulting selectivity in the trained networks strongly suggests that the visual areas do not function as exclusive category detectors but are also sensitive to visual patterns that are typical to their preferred categories, even in the absence of these categories. Finally, we show that our response-optimized networks have distinct functional properties. Together, our findings suggest that response-optimized models combined with model interpretability techniques can serve as a powerful and unifying computational framework for probing the nature of representations and computations in the brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Tuning of motor outputs produced by spinal stimulation during voluntary control of torque directions in monkeys</a></h4>

              
                Spinal stimulation is a promising method to restore motor function after impairment of descending pathways. While paresis, a weakness of voluntary movements driven by surviving descending pathways, can benefit from spinal stimulation, the effects of descending commands on motor outputs produced by spinal stimulation are unclear. Here, we show that descending commands amplify stimulus-evoked joint torque and the function of intraspinal elements. During the wrist torque tracking task, optimized currents of spinal stimulation over the cervical enlargement facilitated and/or suppressed activities of forelimb muscles. Magnitudes of these effects were dependent on directions of voluntarily-produced torque and positively correlated with levels of voluntary muscle activity. Furthermore, the directions of evoked wrist torque corresponded to the directions of voluntarily-produced torque. These results suggest that spinal stimulation is beneficial in cases of partial lesion of descending pathways by compensating for reduced descending commands through activation of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic connections to motoneurons.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Resolving the mesoscopic missing link: Biophysical modeling of EEG from cortical columns in primates</a></h4>

              
                Event-related potentials (ERP) are among the most widely measured indices for studying human cognition. While their timing and magnitude provide valuable insights, their usefulness is limited by our understanding of their neural generators at the circuit level. Inverse source localization offers insights into such generators, but their solutions are not unique. To address this problem, scientists have assumed the source space generating such signals comprises a set of discrete equivalent current dipoles, representing the activity of small cortical regions. Based on this notion, theoretical studies have employed forward modeling of scalp potentials to understand how changes in circuit-level dynamics translate into macroscopic ERPs. However, experimental validation is lacking because it requires in vivo measurements of intracranial brain sources. Laminar local field potentials (LFP) offer a mechanism for estimating intracranial current sources. Yet, a theoretical link between LFPs and intracranial brain sources is missing. Here, we present a forward modeling approach for estimating mesoscopic intracranial brain sources from LFPs and predict their contribution to macroscopic ERPs. We evaluate the accuracy of this LFP-based representation of brain sources utilizing synthetic laminar neurophysiological measurements and then demonstrate the power of the approach in vivo to clarify the source of a representative cognitive ERP component. To that end, LFP was measured across the cortical layers of visual area V4 in macaque monkeys performing an attention demanding task. We show that area V4 generates dipoles through layer-specific transsynaptic currents that biophysically recapitulate the ERP component through the detailed forward modeling. The constraints imposed on EEG production by this method also revealed an important dissociation between computational and biophysical contributors. As such, this approach represents an important bridge from the mesoscopic activity of cortical columns to the patterns of EEG we measure at the scalp.

                Here we follow the call to target measurement reliability as a key prerequisite for individual-level predictions in translational neuroscience by investigating i) longitudinal reliability at the individual and ii) group level, iii) cross-sectional reliability and iv) response predictability across experimental phases. 120 individuals performed a fear conditioning paradigm twice six month apart. Analyses of skin conductance responses, fear ratings and BOLD-fMRI with different data transformations and included numbers of trials were conducted. While longitudinal reliability was generally poor to moderate at the individual level, it was good for acquisition but not extinction at the group-level. Cross-sectional reliability was satisfactory. Higher responding in preceding phases predicted higher responding in subsequent experimental phases at a weak to moderate level depending on data specifications. In sum, the results suggest the feasibility of individual-level predictions for (very) short time intervals (e.g., cross-phases) while predictions for longer time intervals may be problematic.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Axisymmetric diffusion kurtosis imaging with Rician bias correction: A simulation study</a></h4>

              
                Purpose: To compare the estimation accuracy of axisymmetric diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) and standard DKI in combination with Rician bias correction (RBC) under the influence of noise. Methods: Axisymmetric DKI is more robust against noise-induced variation in the measured signal than standard DKI because of its reduced parameter space but its susceptibility to Rician bias at low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) is unknown. We investigate estimation accuracy of standard DKI and axisymmetric DKI on five axisymmetric DKI tensor metrics (AxTM): the parallel and perpendicular diffusivity and kurtosis and the mean kurtosis. Estimation accuracy was investigated in a simulation study based on two datasets. One dataset consists of synthetic data of tissues of varying degrees of fiber alignment and one is based on in-vivo data of typical white matter fiber tracts. Furthermore, the influence of RBC on axisymmetric DKI is investigated. Results: We found that RBC was most effective for increasing accuracy of the parallel AxTM in anisotropic white matter. For the perpendicular AxTM, axisymmetric DKI without RBC performed slightly better than with RBC. However, the combination of axisymmetric DKI with RBC was the overall best performing algorithm across all five AxTM and the axisymmetric DKI framework itself substantially improved parameter estimation in tissues with low fiber alignment. Conclusion: The combination of axisymmetric DKI with RBC facilitates accurate DKI parameter estimation at unprecedented low SNRs (approx 15), possibly making it a valuable tool for neuroscience and clinical research studies where scan time is a limited resource. The tools used in this paper for time-efficient estimation of the AxTM with axisymmetric DKI, standard DKI and RBC are available in the open-source ACID toolbox for SPM.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Glocal dendritic spikes: variation in branch activity during dendritic spiking indicates multiple functional units in the pyramidal neuron apical tuft</a></h4>

              
                There is a lively debate on how many functional units exist within the dendritic tree of pyramidal neurons (PNs). The classical view that the PNs dendritic tree comprises several computational units was challenged by recent in-vivo studies that identified mainly widespread dendritic spikes, suggesting a low degree of dendritic compartmentalization. We reasoned that global spikes do not rule out dendritic compartmentalization if these spikes contain a high variation in branch activity. Therefore, we turned to image Ca2+ activity in many apical dendrites from individual layer (L) 5 PNs of the primary motor cortex (M1). For proper dendritic morphology and Ca2+ activity analysis, we used mice with sparse double labeling of PNs with a structural marker (tdTomato) and a GCaMP6s probe. We first collected data for complete registration of the apical tuft dendritic structure. We then used 3D two-photon microscopy to image Ca2+ activity within these tufts during treadmill running. Using these, we imaged up to 30 apical branches from individual L5 PNs, including branches separated by as many as 11 bifurcations and more than 1000 microns of intracellular distance. We found that local spikes were rare, but global spikes often displayed heterogeneous Ca2+ elevation across branches, giving rise to an activity pattern across the tuft. This spiking pattern was dynamic and according to unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis, fitted to 2-6 distinct patterns, even over short imaging periods. Taken together, we find a considerable variation in branch activity within and between global dendritic spikes, supporting multiple dendritic functional units.

                In the brain, spiking patterns live in a high-dimensional space of neurons and time. Thus, determining the intrinsic structure of this state space for neural activity presents a theoretical and experimental challenge. To address this challenge, we introduce a new framework for applying topological data analysis (TDA) to spike train data to determine the geometry of neural activity space. Key to our approach is a parametrized family of distances based on the timing of spikes to determine the dissimilarity between neuronal responses. We applied TDA to visually driven single-unit and multiple single-unit spiking activity in macaque V1 and V2. TDA across timescales reveals a common geometry in V1 and V2 that is most consistent with a low-dimensional space endowed with Euclidean or hyperbolic geometry with modest curvature. Remarkably, the inferred geometry depends on timescale, and is most distinct for the timescales that are important for encoding contrast, orientation, and spatial correlations.

                Complex wiring between neurons underlies the information-processing network enabling all brain functions, including cognition and memory. For understanding how the network is structured, processes information, and changes over time, comprehensive visualization of the architecture of living brain tissue with its cellular and molecular components would open up major opportunities. However, electron microscopy (EM) provides nanometre-scale resolution required for full in-silico reconstruction, yet is limited to fixed specimens and static representations. Light microscopy allows live observation with super-resolution approaches facilitating nanoscale visualization, but comprehensive 3D-reconstruction of living brain tissue has been hindered by tissue photo-burden, photobleaching, insufficient 3D-resolution, and inadequate signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Here we demonstrate saturated reconstruction of living brain tissue. We developed an integrated imaging and analysis technology, adapting stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy in extracellularly labelled tissue for high SNR and isotropic resolution. Centrally, a two-stage deep-learning approach leveraged previously obtained information on sample structure to drastically reduce photo-burden and enable automated volumetric reconstruction down to synapse level. Live reconstruction provides unbiased analysis of tissue architecture across time in relation to functional activity and targeted activation, and contextual understanding of molecular labelling. This adoptable technology will facilitate novel insights into the dynamic functional architecture of living brain tissue.

                The course of multiple sclerosis (MS) is characterized by striking sex differences in symptoms such as fatigue and impaired thermal regulation, which are associated with aggravated systemic pro-inflammatory processes. The purpose of this study was to replicate these symptoms in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in C57BL/6 mice in the quest to advance the preclinical study of non-motor symptoms of MS. Male and female C57BL/6 mice exposed to a mild form of EAE were evaluated for the progression of clinical, behavioural, thermal, and inflammatory processes. We show higher susceptibility in females to EAE than males based on greater clinical score and cumulative disease index (CDI), fatigue-like and anxiety-like behaviours. Accordingly, infrared (IR) thermography indicated higher cutaneous temperature in females from post-induction days 12 to 23. Females also responded to EAE with greater splenic and adrenal gland weights than males as well as sex-specific changes in pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. These findings provide the first evidence of a sex-specific thermal response to immune-mediated demyelination, thus proposing a non-invasive assessment approach of the psychophysiological dynamics in EAE mice. The results are discussed in relation to the thermoregulatory correlates of fatigue and how endogenously elevated body temperature without direct heat exposure may be linked to psychomotor inhibition in patients with MS.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A flexible and versatile system for multicolor fiber photometry and optogenetic manipulation</a></h4>

              
                Fiber photometry is a technique of growing popularity in neuroscientific research. It is widely used to infer brain activity by recording calcium dynamics in genetically defined populations of neurons. Aside from the wide variety of calcium indicators, other genetically encoded biosensors have recently been engineered to measure membrane potential, neurotransmitter release, pH, or various cellular metabolites, such as ATP or cAMP. Due to the spectral characteristics of these molecular tools, different assemblies of optical hardware are usually needed to reveal the full potential of different biosensors. In addition, the combination of multiple biosensors in one experiment often requires the investment in more complex equipment, which limits the flexibility of the experimental design. Such constraints often hamper a straightforward implementation of new molecular tools, evaluation of their performance in vivo, and design of new experimental paradigms - especially if the financial budget is a limiting factor. Here, we propose a novel approach for fiber photometry recordings, based on a multimode optical fused-fiber coupler (FFC) for both light delivery and collection. Recordings can readily be combined with optogenetic manipulations in a single device without the requirement for dichroic beam-splitters. In combination with a multi-color light source and appropriate emission filters, our approach offers remarkable flexibility in experimental design and facilitates the implication of new molecular tools in vivo at minimal cost. The ease of assembly, operation, characterization, and customization of this platform holds the potential to foster the development of experimental strategies for multicolor fused fiber photometry (FFP) combined with optogenetics far beyond its current state.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Comparable theta phase coding dynamics along the transverse axis of CA1</a></h4>

              
                Topographical projection patterns from the entorhinal cortex to area CA1 of the hippocampus have led to a hypothesis that proximal CA1 (pCA1) is spatially more selective than distal CA1 (dCA1). While earlier studies have shown evidence supporting this hypothesis, we recently showed that this difference does not hold true under all experimental conditions. In a complex environment with distinct local texture cues on a circular track and global visual cues, pCA1 and dCA1 display comparable spatial selectivity. Correlated with the spatial selectivity differences, the earlier studies also showed differences in theta phase coding dynamics between pCA1 and dCA1 neurons. Here we show that there are no differences in theta phase coding dynamics between neurons in these two regions under the experimental conditions where pCA1 and dCA1 neurons are equally spatially selective. We also show that dCA1 local field potentials (LFPs) show higher power in theta range compared to pCA1 LFPs. These findings challenge the established notion of dCA1 being inherently less spatially selective and theta modulated than pCA1 and suggest that theta-mediated activation of the CA1 sub-networks to represent space is task-dependent.

                This paper proposes an explicit computational process which reproduces what are considered to be two essential experimentally observed hippocampus capabilities. These are path planning and determining the chain of ordered relationships which bind two concepts. These are both inverse problems. The paper presents algorithmic simulations of the process and a neuronal circuit (and variants) with the same dataflow, both consistent with the known neuroanatomy of the hippocampus. The process described here is purpose-built for hippocampus function and architecture and does not derive from any pre-existing class of models.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Microglial P2Y12 mediates chronic stress-induced synapse loss in the prefrontal cortex and associated behavioral consequences in male mice</a></h4>

              
                Recent studies demonstrate that chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) drives microglia-mediated neuronal remodeling, contributing to synapse loss in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and cognitive-behavioral dysfunction. Nonetheless, it remains unclear what mechanisms guide microglia-neuron interactions in stress. Evidence indicates that neuronal activity-dependent purinergic signaling directs microglial processes and microglia-synapse interaction via P2Y12, a purinergic receptor exclusively expressed by microglia in the brain. Stress exposure alters excitatory neurotransmission in the PFC, thus we aimed to determine if P2Y12 signaling promotes functional changes in microglia in the context of chronic stress. Using an activating DREADD, our initial studies showed that PFC microglia adopt a CUS-associated phenotype after repeated pyramidal neuronal activation. To further investigate the role of purinergic signaling, we used genetic (P2ry12-/-) or pharmacological (clopidogrel, ticagrelor) approaches to block P2Y12 in the context of CUS. Various behavioral, physiological, and cytometric endpoints were analyzed. Both P2Y12-deletion and treatment with clopidogrel prevented increases in forced swim test immobility and attenuated deficits in temporal object recognition following CUS. Flow cytometry of PFC microglia revealed that both P2ry12-/- mice and those treated with clopidogrel have significantly different phenotypes (independent of CUS); with diminished P2Y12 expression and altered surface levels of CX3CR1, CSF1R, and CD11b. Immunohistology in Thy1-GFP(M) mice demonstrated that pharmacological blockade of P2Y12 prevented stress-induced increases in the proportion of microglia with GFP+ neuronal inclusions and limited dendritic spine loss in the PFC. Together, these findings indicate that microglial P2Y12 is a critical mediator of stress-induced neuronal remodeling in the PFC and subsequent behavioral deficits.

                The GPi-LHb pathway is the main output of the basal ganglia suggested to shape motivated behaviors. We show here that Sst+ GPi-LHb neurons send direct feedback to key nodes of the basal ganglia: the GPe, the striatal striosomes, and dopamine neurons in the SNc. Chronic silencing of this pathway did not affect learning or execution of value-guided choices, but severely disrupted the ability to adapt choice-behavior and seek an alternative reward location after task reversal. Calcium imaging revealed that Sst+ GPi neurons did not signal outcome value or value updates during reversal learning. Instead, progressive suppression of the Sst+ GPi activity was linked to increased commitment to one choice, and activity increased during exploration of alternative choices. We propose that GPi Sst+ neurons drive behavioral flexibility through a direct feedback signal to balance the activity of key nodes in the basal ganglia.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Electroencephalography-derived functional connectivity in sensorimotor networks in Stroke and Multiple Sclerosis Fatigue</a></h4>

              
                A common mechanism of altered sensory processing is the basis of chronic fatigue in neurological disorders. Here we test the hypothesis - Altered connectivity in sensory networks underlies chronic fatigue in stroke and multiple sclerosis. In 46 non-depressed, minimally impaired stroke survivors (n=29) and multiple sclerosis patients (n=17), median disease duration of 5 years, resting state neuronal activity was measured using 64-channel electroencephalography. Graph theory-based network analysis measure of functional connectivity (small-world index) was calculated in right and left motor (Brodmann areas 4, 6, 8, 9, 24 and 32) and somatosensory (Brodmann areas 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 40 and 43) networks, in 5 frequency bands: delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma. Fatigue was measured using Fatigue Severity Scale (Stroke) and modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MS), with scores of >4 (FSS) and >38 (mFIS), defined as high fatigue. Both stroke survivors and multiple sclerosis patients with high fatigue showed significantly more small-worldness in the right sensory networks in the beta band frequency. Additionally, only in stroke survivors with high fatigue, there was decreased small-worldness in the left motor network in the delta and theta bands. Altered sensory network connectivity is common to both stroke and MS fatigue, indicating impaired sensory processing as a disease-independent mechanism of chronic fatigue in neurological conditions. Furthermore, such difference in functional connectivity emerges in beta band activity, further strengthening the idea of altered sensorimotor processing as the basis of chronic neurological fatigue.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Feature-based attention multiplicatively scales the fMRI-BOLD contrast-response function</a></h4>

              
                Functional MRI (fMRI) plays a key role in the study of attention. However, there remains a puzzling discrepancy between attention effects measured with fMRI and with electrophysiological methods. While electrophysiological studies find that attention increases sensory gain, amplifying stimulus-evoked neural responses by multiplicatively scaling the contrast-response function (CRF), fMRI appears to be insensitive to these multiplicative effects. Instead, fMRI studies typically find that attention produces an additive baseline shift in the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal. These findings suggest that attentional effects measured with fMRI reflect top-down inputs to visual cortex, rather than the modulation of sensory gain. If true, this drastically limits what fMRI can tell us about how attention improves sensory coding. Here, we re-examined whether fMRI is sensitive to multiplicative effects of attention using a feature-based attention paradigm designed to preclude any possible additive effects. We measured BOLD activity evoked by a probe stimulus in one visual hemifield while participants (6 male, 6 female) attended to the probe orientation (attended condition), or to an orthogonal orientation (unattended condition), in the other hemifield. To measure CRFs in visual areas V1-V3, we parametrically varied the contrast of the probe stimulus. In all three areas, feature-based attention increased contrast gain, improving sensitivity by shifting CRFs towards lower contrasts. For a subset of visual eccentricities, we also found an increase in response gain, an increase in the responsivity of the CRF. These results provide clear evidence that the fMRI-BOLD signal is sensitive to multiplicative effects of attention.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Brain-wide screen of prelimbic cortex inputs reveals a functional shift during early fear memory consolidation</a></h4>

              
                Memory formation and storage rely on multiple interconnected brain areas, the contribution of which varies during memory consolidation. The medial prefrontal cortex, in particular the prelimbic cortex (PL), was traditionally found to be involved in remote memory storage, but recent evidence points towards its implication in early consolidation as well. Nevertheless, the inputs to the PL governing these dynamics remain unknown. Here, we first performed a brain-wide, rabies-based retrograde tracing screen of PL engram cells activated during contextual fear memory formation to identify relevant PL input regions. Next, we assessed the specific activity pattern of these inputs across different phases of memory consolidation, from fear memory encoding to recent and remote memory recall. Using projection-specific chemogenetic inhibition, we then tested their functional role in memory consolidation, which revealed a hitherto unknown contribution of claustrum to PL inputs at encoding, and of insular cortex to PL inputs at recent memory recall. Both of these inputs further impacted how PL engram cells were reactivated at memory recall, testifying to their relevance for establishing a memory trace in the PL. Collectively, this data identify a spatiotemporal shift in PL inputs important for early memory consolidation, and thereby help to refine the working model of memory formation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A brain-wide analysis maps structural evolution to distinct anatomical modules</a></h4>

              
                Brain anatomy is highly variable and it is widely accepted that anatomical variation impacts brain function and ultimately behavior. The structural complexity of the brain, including differences in volume and shape, presents an enormous barrier to define how variability underlies differences in function. In this study, we sought to investigate the evolution of brain anatomy in relation to brain region volume and shape across the brain of a single species with variable genetic and anatomical morphs. We generated a high-resolution brain atlas for the blind Mexican cavefish and coupled the atlas with automated computational tools to directly assess brain region shape and volume variability across all populations. We measured the volume and shape of every neuroanatomical region of the brain and assess correlations between anatomical regions in surface, cavefish and surface to cave F2 hybrids, whose phenotypes span the range of surface to cave. We find that dorsal regions of the brain are contracted in cavefish, while ventral regions have expanded. Interestingly, in hybrid fish the volume and shape of dorsal regions are inversely proportional to ventral regions. This trend is true for both volume and shape, suggesting that these two parameters share developmental mechanisms necessary for remodeling the entire brain. Given the high conservation of brain anatomy and function among vertebrate species, we expect these data to studies reveal generalized principles of brain evolution and show that Astyanax provides a system for functionally determining basic principles of brain evolution by utilizing the independent genetic diversity of different morphs, to test how genes influence early patterning events to drive brain-wide anatomical evolution.

	<p>Background: With 10 vaccines approved by the WHO and nearly 48% of people fully vaccinated worldwide, we have observed several individual case studies of neurological manifestations post-COVID-19 vaccination. Through this systematic review, we aim to discern these CNS and PNS manifestations following the COVID-19 vaccine to help produce methods to mitigate them. Methods: We conducted a thorough literature search of Google Scholar and PubMed from 1 December 2020 until 10 October 2021 and included all the case studies of COVID-19 vaccine-associated neurological side effects. The literature search and data analysis were performed by two independent reviewers according to prespecified inclusion and exclusion criteria using PRISMA. Results: The most common CNS manifestation was CVST (14.47%), found in females (64%) younger than 50 years (71%) after the first AstraZeneca dose (93%). Others included CNS demyelinating disorders (TM, ADEM, MS, NMOSD) (9.30%), encephalopathy/encephalitis (3.10%), and others (4.13%). The most common PNS manifestation was GBS (14.67%) found in males (71%) older than 50 years (79%), followed by Bell&amp;amp;rsquo;s palsy (5.24%) and others (2.10%). Most occurred with the AstraZeneca (28.55%), Pfizer-BioNTech (9.18%), and Moderna (8.16%) vaccines. Nine (64%) out of the 14 patients with CVST died. However, most cases overall (42 out of 51) were non-fatal (82%). Conclusion: Several CNS and PNS adverse events have occurred post-COVID-19 vaccination, including CVST, GBS, and TM. High vigilance with early identification and treatment leads to better outcomes. Further studies with non-vaccinated controls might help in understanding the pathophysiologic mechanisms of these neurological manifestations following COVID-19 vaccination.</p>

	<p>The passing of time can be precisely measured by using clocks, whereas humans&amp;amp;rsquo; estimation of temporal durations is influenced by many physical, cognitive and contextual factors, which distort our internal clock. Although it has been shown that temporal estimation accuracy is impaired by non-temporal tasks performed at the same time, no studies have investigated how concurrent cognitive and motor tasks interfere with time estimation. Moreover, most experiments only tested time intervals of a few seconds. In the present study, participants were asked to perform cognitive tasks of different difficulties (look, read, solve simple and hard mathematical operations) and estimate durations of up to two minutes, while walking or sitting. The results show that if observers pay attention only to time without performing any other mental task, they tend to overestimate the durations. Meanwhile, the more difficult the concurrent task, the more they tend to underestimate the time. These distortions are even more pronounced when observers are walking. Estimation biases and uncertainties change differently with durations depending on the task, consistent with a fixed relative uncertainty. Our findings show that cognitive and motor systems interact non-linearly and interfere with time perception processes, suggesting that they all compete for the same resources.</p>

	<p>Background: There is currently a dearth of research on the neural framework of writing tasks in children, as measured by neuroimaging techniques. Objective: This paper provides an overview of the current literature examining the neurological underpinnings of written expression in children. Design: Using a scoping review approach, with thorough searches of key databases, this paper presents the available literature comprising 13 different studies using both structural and functional neuroimaging techniques with the 0&amp;amp;ndash;18 English speaking population. Results: Studies largely presented small sample sizes, with most studies utilizing elementary or middle school-aged children. Emergent findings revealed a complex network of neural contributions to the writing process in children. There were associations between the left fusiform gyrus and orthographic coding (i.e., handwriting), and spelling and written composition measures were significantly correlated with activity in the left posterior cingulate, left precuneus, and right precuneus regions. Additionally, results revealed that good versus poor writers manifested differential brain activation patterns during many tasks associated with written expression, with good writers performing more efficiently than poor writers with respect to brain regions activated during a writing task across handwriting, spelling, and idea generation. Conclusions: The findings from this scoping review lay the foundation for future studies examining the interface between writing skills in children and underlying neural pathways that support the various components of the writing process. It will be important for future research to examine the neurological bases of the various components of written expression in children and adolescents.</p>

	<p>Background: The cranio-orbito-zygomatic (COZ) approach is a workhorse of skull base surgery, and each of its steps has a precise effect on target exposure and surgical freedom. The present study overviews the key techniques for execution and tailoring of the COZ approach, focusing on the quantitative effects resulting from removal of the orbitozygomatic (OZ) bar, orbital rim, and zygomatic arch. Methods: A PRISMA-based literature review was performed on the PubMed/Medline and Web of Science databases using the main keywords associated with the COZ approach. Articles in English without temporal restriction were included. Eligibility was limited to neurosurgical relevance. Results: A total of 78 articles were selected. The range of variants of the COZ approach involves a one-piece, two-piece, and three-piece technique, with a decreasing level of complexity and risk of complications. The two-piece technique includes an OZ and orbitopterional variant. Superolateral orbitotomy expands the subfrontal and transsylvian corridors, increasing surgical freedom to the basal forebrain, hypothalamic region, interpeduncular fossa, and basilar apex. Zygomatic osteotomy shortens the working distance of the pretemporal and subtemporal routes. Conclusion: Subtraction of the OZ bar causes a tremendous increase in angular exposure of the subfrontal, transsylvian, pretemporal, and subtemporal perspectives avoiding brain retraction, allowing for multiangled trajectories, and shortening the working distance. The COZ approach can be tailored based on the location of the lesion, thus optimizing the target exposure and surgical freedom and decreasing the risk of complications.</p>

	<p>Background: The present study hypothesized that some factors may distinguish between patients with a brain cavernous angioma (BCA), who were free from anti-seizure medication (ASM), and patients who still required ASMs postoperatively. The purpose of the study was thus to identify factors associated with ceasing ASMs for patients with drug-resistant epilepsy secondary to BCA, who underwent BCA removal surgery. Methods: We divided patients into those with drug-resistant epilepsy secondary to BCA who achieved complete seizure freedom without ASMs a year after surgery (No-ASM group) (International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) classification class I with no epileptiform discharges), and others (ASM group) (ILAE classification &amp;amp;le;II and/or epileptiform discharges). We statistically compared groups in terms of: (1) age at operation; (2) history of epilepsy; (3) size of BCA; and (4) location of BCA. Results: Overall, a year after the surgery, the No-ASM group comprised 12 patients (48%), and the ASM group comprised 13 patients (52%). In both multi- and univariate logistic regression analyses, age at BCA removal surgery correlated significantly with the No-ASM group (p = 0.043, p = 0.019), but history of epilepsy did not (p = 0.581, p = 0.585). Conclusions: Earlier age at surgery for patients with drug-resistant epilepsy is encouraged to achieve complete seizure freedom without the need for ASMs when the cause of epilepsy is BCA.</p>

	<p>In recent years, applications of the network science to electrophysiological data have increased as electrophysiological techniques are not only relatively low cost, largely available on the territory and non-invasive, but also potential tools for large population screening. One of the emergent methods for the study of functional connectivity in electrophysiological recordings is graph theory: it allows to describe the brain through a mathematic model, the graph, and provides a simple representation of a complex system. As Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s and Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease are associated with synaptic disruptions and changes in the strength of functional connectivity, they can be well described by functional connectivity analysis computed via graph theory. The aim of the present review is to provide an overview of the most recent applications of the graph theory to electrophysiological data in the two by far most frequent neurodegenerative disorders, Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s and Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s diseases.</p>

                Background: Self-etching has been shown to be beneficial compared to the other resin sealants especially in pediatric practice. The present in-vivo study was designed to clinically evaluate the sealing ability and retention of the self-etching sealant compared to the conventional resin sealant. The aim was to evaluate and compare the retention and marginal integrity of the self-etch and acid etch sealant materials at three, six and twelve-month follow up. Methods: The study was designed as a double blinded, split mouth randomized controlled trial, . In total, 35 children (70 teeth) between 7 and 10 years of age formed part of the study. Group 1 received acid-etch sealant and Group 2 received self-etch sealants. The study participants and the investigator who performed the statistical analysis were blinded to the treatment allocation. All the samples were evaluated at 3, 6, and 12 months. The inter-group and intragroup comparison were carried out using the Chi-Square test and Friedman test with level of significance set at 5% and the P value less than 0.05. Results: Complete retention of sealants was observed in 34.5% of conventional acid etch (group 1) and 22.9% of self-etch samples (group 2) whereas complete loss of sealants were seen in 11.4% of group 1 and 20% of the group 2 samples and intergroup comparison of retention failure was non-significant (p=0.135). In total, 85.7% of the group 1 and 82.9% of the group 2 samples exhibited good marginal integrity with no clinical changes in the enamel around the margins but this was not statistically significant (p=0.5). Conclusions: Sealants with fewer procedural steps and those which provide adequate retention would be ideal for use in children. Thus, self-etch sealants have been found to be effective and efficient as a sealant in the present in-vivo study.

                Modern treatment is based on reproducible quantitative analysis of available data. The Covid-19 pandemic did accelerate development and research in several multidisciplinary areas. One of them is the use of software tools for faster and reproducible patient data evaluation. A CT scan can be invaluable for a search of details, but it is not always easy to see the big picture in 3D data. Even in the visual analysis of CT slice by slice can inter and intra variability makes a big difference. We present an ImageJ tool developed together with the radiology center of Faculty hospital Královské Vinohrady for CT evaluation of patients with COVID-19. The tool was developed to help estimate the percentage of lungs affected by the infection. The patients can be divided into five groups based on percentage score and proper treatment can be applied

Ocular light exposure has important influences on human health and well-being through modulation of circadian rhythms and sleep, as well as neuroendocrine and cognitive functions. Prevailing patterns of light exposure do not optimally engage these actions for many individuals, but advances in our understanding of the underpinning mechanisms and emerging lighting technologies now present opportunities to adjust lighting to promote optimal physical and mental health and performance. A newly developed, international standard provides a SI-compliant way of quantifying the influence of light on the intrinsically photosensitive, melanopsin-expressing, retinal neurons that mediate these effects. The present report provides recommendations for lighting, based on an expert scientific consensus and expressed in an easily measured quantity (melanopic equivalent daylight illuminance (melaponic EDI)) defined within this standard. The recommendations are supported by detailed analysis of the sensitivity of human circadian, neuroendocrine, and alerting responses to ocular light and provide a straightforward framework to inform lighting design and practice.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Dynamic changes in brain lateralization correlate with human cognitive performance</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Xinran Wu, Xiangzhen Kong, Deniz Vatansever, Zhaowen Liu, Kai Zhang, Barbara J. Sahakian, Trevor W. Robbins, Jianfeng Feng, Paul Thompson, Jie Zhang</p>

Hemispheric lateralization constitutes a core architectural principle of human brain organization underlying cognition, often argued to represent a stable, trait-like feature. However, emerging evidence underlines the inherently dynamic nature of brain networks, in which time-resolved alterations in functional lateralization remain uncharted. Integrating dynamic network approaches with the concept of hemispheric laterality, we map the spatiotemporal architecture of whole-brain lateralization in a large sample of high-quality resting-state fMRI data (<i>N =</i> 991, Human Connectome Project). We reveal distinct laterality dynamics across lower-order sensorimotor systems and higher-order associative networks. Specifically, we expose 2 aspects of the laterality dynamics: laterality fluctuations (LF), defined as the standard deviation of laterality time series, and laterality reversal (LR), referring to the number of zero crossings in laterality time series. These 2 measures are associated with moderate and extreme changes in laterality over time, respectively. While LF depict positive association with language function and cognitive flexibility, LR shows a negative association with the same cognitive abilities. These opposing interactions indicate a dynamic balance between intra and interhemispheric communication, i.e., segregation and integration of information across hemispheres. Furthermore, in their time-resolved laterality index, the default mode and language networks correlate negatively with visual/sensorimotor and attention networks, which are linked to better cognitive abilities. Finally, the laterality dynamics are associated with functional connectivity changes of higher-order brain networks and correlate with regional metabolism and structural connectivity. Our results provide insights into the adaptive nature of the lateralized brain and new perspectives for future studies of human cognition, genetics, and brain disorders.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Electronic signature and attestation in conveyancing practice: A Malaysian legal perspective [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background  The Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic brought about an unprecedented disruption to global business activities. Physical face-to-face activities must be restricted due to movement control order (MCO). The clients are required to sign the documents physically in the presence of the solicitor who must subsequently attest to the signature of the clients. The issue arises whether electronic signature (e-signature) and attestation are permissible under the laws of Malaysia. The aim of this research was to study the legality of e-signature and attestation in conveyancing practice in Malaysia and subsequently to propose recommendations to overcome these issues.   Methods   This is qualitative study and not an empirical study. The data was collected by library-based research from various primary and secondary data sources, including case law in Malaysia, written statutes, publication of journal and article.   Results  The Digital Signatures Act 1997 (DSA) and the Electronic Commerce Act 2006 (ECA) have legalised e-signatures. The DSA is the law that governs the digital signatures in Malaysia. ECA has listed a few documents which are not legally accepted if signed electronically, namely Power of Attorney, the Wills and codicils, the Trusts, and negotiable instruments. However, with regards to the issue of attestation of these documents, there are no clear laws which govern the attestation. The legal issue arises when the lawyers who have attested these documents are liable to be called as witness under the Evidence Act 1950 to testify their signature if these documents are tendered as evidence in any court proceedings.   Conclusion  Thus, it is suggested that there is a need for unique legal framework for e-signature and attestation in Malaysia due to the lack of specific laws which govern the issues of electronic signature and attestation.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Incidence and Risk Factors for Perioperative Cardiovascular Complications in Spine Surgery [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: An increasing number of patients are opting for spine surgery despite the associated risk of cardiovascular complications. The evidence regarding the incidence and risk factors of cardiovascular complications in spine surgery is insufficient. Therefore, we aimed to determine the incidence and risk factors for cardiovascular complications that occur perioperatively in spine surgery. Methods: This retrospective study included all patients who underwent spine surgery between January 2018 and December 2019 at a single center. Demographic, clinical, and operative data were collected from electronic medical records. The incidence of perioperative cardiac complications was determined. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify risk factors for the development of perioperative cardiovascular complications in the participants. Results: Of the 1,002 eligible patients enrolled in the study, six developed cardiac complications. Acute myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, and congestive heart failure occurred in one, two, and three patients, respectively. Risk factors for cardiovascular complications included scoliosis surgery (odds ratios (OR): 18.61; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.346-257.35) and a history of congestive heart failure (OR: 120.97; 95% CI: 2.12-6898.80). Conclusion: The incidence of perioperative cardiovascular complications in patients who underwent spine surgery was 0.6%. High-risk patients should be closely monitored optimally managed throughout the perioperative period.

                Background: Globally, arterial hypertension (AH) has increased by 90% over the last four decades, and has increased by 1.6% in Peru over the previous four years. Scientific evidence indicates the prevalence of depressive symptoms in patients with AH and its importance in the comprehensive evaluation of the adult for adherence to clinical treatment. Previous studies carried out in the Peruvian population with AH mostly report the prevalence and associations, but do not indicate which depressive symptoms are more relevant in patients with AH. This study involved a network analysis of depressive symptomatology in Peruvian patients with AH using network estimation. Network analysis is used in this study for analysis, control, and monitoring purposes. Method: A representative cross-sectional study at the national level, using secondary data from 2019 Demographic and Family Health Survey (ENDES) was performed. The sample used included men and women of age over 17 years diagnosed with AH and was able to respond to Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Results: The symptoms of depressive mood (bridging force and centrality) and energy fatigue or loss (bridge centrality) play an essential role in the network structure, as does the feeling of uselessness in terms of closeness and intermediation. Conclusion: The study highlighted the symptoms related to depressive mood and energy fatigue or loss as bridging symptoms, which could trigger a depressive episode in patients diagnosed with AH. The results will contribute to developing personalized treatments aimed at patients with specific depressive symptoms who have also been diagnosed with AH. The study analysis presents statistical coefficients of effect size (≤ 0,1 = small; > 0,1 to < 0,5 = moderate; ≥ 0,5 = large) to determine network connections.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Efficient embryoid-based method to improve generation of optic vesicles from human induced pluripotent stem cells [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Animal models have provided many insights into ocular development and disease, but they remain suboptimal for understanding human oculogenesis. Eye development requires spatiotemporal gene expression patterns and disease phenotypes can differ significantly between humans and animal models, with patient-associated mutations causing embryonic lethality reported in some animal models. The emergence of human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) technology has provided a new resource for dissecting the complex nature of early eye morphogenesis through the generation of three-dimensional (3D) cellular models. By using patient-specific hiPSCs to generate in vitro optic vesicle-like models, we can enhance the understanding of early developmental eye disorders and provide a pre-clinical platform for disease modelling and therapeutics testing. A major challenge of in vitro optic vesicle generation is the low efficiency of differentiation in 3D cultures. To address this, we adapted a previously published protocol of retinal organoid differentiation to improve embryoid body formation using a microwell plate. Established morphology, upregulated transcript levels of known early eye-field transcription factors and protein expression of standard retinal progenitor markers confirmed the optic vesicle/presumptive optic cup identity of in vitro models between day 20 and 50 of culture. This adapted protocol is relevant to researchers seeking a physiologically relevant model of early human ocular development and disease with a view to replacing animal models.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Efficacy, Feasibility, and Safety of Percutaneous Image-Guided Catheter Drainage of Thoracic, Abdominal, and Pelvic Fluid Collections. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background – Image-guided percutaneous catheter drainage (PCD) using a pigtail catheter bridges the gap between non-invasive and invasive surgical intervention with minimally invasive, image-guided drainage. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy, feasibility, safety, and relevant clinical outcomes of image guided PCD of thoracic, abdominal, and pelvic fluid collections. It also aims to assess the causes of complications and failure associated with PCD. Methods – This prospective analysis of 83 patients with abdominal, thoracic, or pelvic fluid collections was conducted by categorizing patients into three groups of intervention namely – group A (intermittent needle aspiration (INA) and PCD in the same sitting), group B (INA followed by PCD after a 48-hour interval gap), and group C (INA and PCD followed by open surgical drainage). Outcomes were measured in terms of statistical analysis, complications, residual collection, success, and failure rates of the procedure. Results – Abdomen was the most frequently encountered site of fluid collection (61.45%), CT was the most utilized modality for image guidance (61.45%), and fluid drained was most frequently purulent (57.83%). Majority of the patients were categorized into group B (57.83%), followed by group A (38.53%), and group C (3.61%). Pain at the catheter insertion site was the most commonly reported complication (72.23%). Group A and Group B showed a success rate of 93.7% and 97.9% respectively. Conclusion – In our study, image-guided PCD proved to be a time saving and efficient intervention, making it an intervention of choice in a variety of fluid collections/abscesses. INA should be considered as an initial step of management for fluid drainage, which provides an access pathway for catheter placement for PCD.

                Background: Myofunctional therapy has been shown to be effective in treating sleep-disordered breathing. The elaboration of this protocol arises with the purpose of establishing a complete and common evaluation of sleep respiratory disorders from the point of view of the anatomy and functionality of the upper airway to guarantee the long-term treatment of the different phenotypes of patients with obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). Our multidisciplinary unit has an experience of more than 10 years in treating OSA patients and has numerous recent publications focused on the role of myofunctional therapy. Methods: The evaluation of the patient with obstructive sleep apnoea is carried out jointly by the medical team of Pulmonology and Otorhinolaryngology of the Sleep Unit. The patients undergo an anatomical and motor tone evaluation of the upper airway to find the cause of the collapse and a sleep study to confirm the diagnosis and its severity. Conclusions: With this protocol we want to present our clinical experience in the comprehensive diagnostic management of the patient with obstructive sleep apnea and provide the most correct treatment among the different therapeutic options available for sleep apnea.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The philanthropy's crucial role in alleviating stunting in Southeast Asian countries through research funding: a policy brief [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Developing countries need funding for researchers to maximize the evidence base, especially in stunting research. This short policy is expected to provide opportunities for Southeast Asian countries to receive more research funding to stunt philanthropists. Policy and implications: Multi-sector cooperation is arguably the leading player in acceleration programs to reduce growth delays. The Stunted Reduction Acceleration Program, complemented by higher research and development expenditures (RDEs) and open policies to support philanthropic activities in Indonesia, will help improve the efficiency of stunted stunt reduction through adequate funding and investment. As evidenced by Singapore and Thailand, the increase in government budgets focused on research and development (R&D) and supportive environments, as shown by Global Philanthropy Environment Index (GPEI), prove that evidence-based and practical researches can lead to the reduction of estimated prevalence of stunting rather than innovation-stage research. Recommendations: Attention should be paid to proposing major changes to the allocation of R&D expenses and creating an environment that supports philanthropy. The challenges associated with these issues are: (1) stunted research and innovation are still left behind. (2) The availability of data and the lack of transparency. (3) Subpar performance in relation to philanthropists. (4) Inconsistent legal definitions and a lack of industry-specific guidelines. (5) Inadequate law enforcement. (6) Local leaders must engage in evidence-based advocacy. (7) Philanthropists have few opportunities to learn.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Students’ attitudes and coping strategies relating to online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic has forced most classes at the tertiary education level to be held online or in a digital mode. This study investigates Multimedia University (MMU) students’ attitudes and coping strategies in relation to online learning classes during the COVID-19 pandemic.     Methods: This is a cross-sectional analysis among students at the MMU campus in Malaysia. Student respondents were chosen using simple random sampling. They answered online surveys developed through Google forms with an appended consent form. Two questions were developed inquiring about students' acceptance of online learning courses to gauge their attitudes. The coping strategies questions were adapted from the Brief-COPE questionnaire with 28 items. There are 14 strategies in the Brief-COPE: self-distraction, active coping, denial, substance use, emotional support, instrumental support, behavioural disengagement, venting, positive reframing, planning, humour, acceptance, religion, and self-blame. We hypothesised that there would be a significant correlation between attitudes and coping strategies among MMU students taking online classes during the COVID-19 pandemic.    Results: 8 out of 14 coping strategies were significantly correlated with students’ attitudes towards online learning. The study showed that those students with a positive or accepting attitude towards online learning were more likely to use positive coping strategies. Those students with negative, less accepting attitudes towards online learning seemed to use more negative coping strategies.     Conclusion: The study focuses on students studying at MMU. Therefore, the outcome cannot be generalised for all university students in Malaysia. The primary goal of the study was to investigate the attitudes and coping strategies of Multimedia University students when confronted with the unexpected outcomes of the COVID-19 pandemic. The results of the study may assist MMU in understanding student behaviour and developing strategies to assist the students.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Typhoid diagnosis and associated prevailing drug resistance in Mbale city, Uganda [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The study aimed at determining the predictive values of Widal’s test against culture and the antimicrobial sensitivity profile of Salmonella typhi (S. typhi) isolates from patients attending private health facilities in Mbale city, Uganda. Methods: This was a quantitative cross-sectional study in which 172 participants were recruited. Blood and stool samples collected were cultured; and to each stool sample the following tests were done; Xylose Lysine Deoxycholate (XLD), Salmonella Shigella agar (SSA), and MacConkey. Isolates suggestive for S. typhi were examined with triple sugar iron (TSI) and SIM (Sulphur, indole, and motile) and antibiotic sensitivity test (Ciprofloxacin, Imipenem, Ceftriaxone, Chloramphenicol and Augmentin for sensitivity testing) conducted with Mueller Hinton respectively. Generated data was entered into the Epidemiological information (Epi Info) software (version 7) and analyzed using the contingency table to determine the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and the negative predictive value. The analysis was then presented in form of graphs and tables. Results: The positive predictive value (PPV) for Widal’s test was 6.8% while the negative predictive value (NPV) was 100%. Three isolates were sensitive to Ciprofloxacin (3, 100%) and Imipenem (3, 100%), intermediate to Ceftriaxone (2, 67%) and resistant to Chloramphenicol (2, 67%) and Augmentin (2, 67%). Conclusion: In comparison with culture, Widal’s test is highly sensitive (100%) with a low specificity of 76% and PPV (6.8%) and NPV (100%). It should therefore be followed up with a more specific confirmatory test. S. typhi was highly sensitive to both Ciprofloxacin and Imipenem; and resistant Chloramphenicol and Augmentin.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Astrocytes play a significant role in the pathology of multiple sclerosis (MS). Nevertheless, for ethical reasons, most studies in these cells were performed using the Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis model. As there are significant differences between human and mouse cells, we aimed here to better characterize astrocytes from patients with MS (PwMS), focusing mainly on mitochondrial function and cell metabolism.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We obtained and characterized induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived astrocytes from three PwMS and three unaffected controls, and performed electron microscopy, flow cytometry, cytokine and glutamate measurements, gene expression, in situ respiration, and metabolomics. We validated our findings using a single-nuclei RNA sequencing dataset.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We detected several differences in MS astrocytes including: (i) enrichment of genes associated with neurodegeneration, (ii) increased mitochondrial fission, (iii) increased production of superoxide and MS-related proinflammatory chemokines, (iv) impaired uptake and enhanced release of glutamate, (v) increased electron transport capacity and proton leak, in line with the increased oxidative stress, and (vi) a distinct metabolic profile, with a deficiency in amino acid catabolism and increased sphingolipid metabolism, which have already been linked to MS.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Here we describe the metabolic profile of iPSC-derived astrocytes from PwMS and validate this model as a very powerful tool to study disease mechanisms and to perform non-invasive drug targeting assays in vitro. Our findings recapitulate several disease features described in patients and provide new mechanistic insights into the metabolic rewiring of astrocytes in MS, which could be targeted in future therapeutic studies.

                Individuals who maintain cognitive function despite high levels of Alzheimer’s disease (AD)-associated pathology are said to be ‘resilient’ to AD. Identifying mechanisms underlying resilience represents an exciting therapeutic opportunity. Human studies have identified a number of molecular and genetic factors associated with resilience, but the complexity of these cohorts prohibits a complete understanding of which factors are causal or simply correlated with resilience. Genetically and phenotypically diverse mouse models of AD provide new and translationally relevant opportunities to identify and prioritize new resilience mechanisms for further cross-species investigation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Structures of PKA-phospholamban complexes reveal a mechanism of familial dilated cardiomyopathy</a></h4>

              
                Several mutations identified in phospholamban (PLN) have been linked to familial dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and heart failure, yet the underlying molecular mechanism remains controversial. PLN interacts with sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase (SERCA) and regulates calcium uptake, which is modulated by the protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent phosphorylation of PLN during the fight-or-flight response. Here, we present the crystal structures of the catalytic domain of mouse PKA in complex with wild-type and DCM-mutant PLNs. Our structures, combined with the results from other biophysical and biochemical assays, reveal a common disease mechanism: the mutations in PLN reduce its phosphorylation level by changing its conformation and weakening its interactions with PKA. In addition, we demonstrate that another more ubiquitous SERCA-regulatory peptide, called another-regulin (ALN), shares a similar mechanism mediated by PKA in regulating SERCA activity.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Adiponectin receptor agonist AdipoRon improves skeletal muscle function in aged mice</a></h4>

              
                The loss of skeletal muscle function with age, known as sarcopenia, significantly reduces independence and quality of life and can have significant metabolic consequences. Although exercise is effective in treating sarcopenia it is not always a viable option clinically, and currently there are no pharmacological therapeutic interventions for sarcopenia. Here we show that chronic treatment with pan-adiponectin receptor agonist AdipoRon improved muscle function in male mice by a mechanism linked to skeletal muscle metabolism and tissue remodeling. In aged mice, 6 weeks of AdipoRon treatment improved skeletal muscle functional measures <i>in vivo</i> and <i>ex vivo</i>. Improvements were linked to changes in fiber type, including an enrichment of oxidative fibers, and an increase in mitochondrial activity. In young mice, 6 weeks of AdipoRon treatment improved contractile force and activated the energy sensing kinase AMPK and the mitochondrial regulator PGC-1a (peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha). In cultured cells, the AdipoRon induced stimulation of AMPK and PGC-1a was associated with increased mitochondrial membrane potential, reorganization of mitochondrial architecture, increased respiration, and increased ATP production. Furthermore, the ability of AdipoRon to stimulate AMPK and PGC1a was conserved in nonhuman primate cultured cells. These data show that AdipoRon is an effective agent for the prevention of sarcopenia in mice and indicate that its effects translate to primates, suggesting it may also be a suitable therapeutic for sarcopenia in clinical application.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Fast and slow feedforward inhibitory circuits for cortical odor processing</a></h4>

              
                Feedforward inhibitory circuits are key contributors to the complex interplay between excitation and inhibition in the brain. Little is known about the function of feedforward inhibition in the primary olfactory (piriform) cortex. Using in vivo two-photon-targeted patch clamping and calcium imaging in mice, we find that odors evoke strong excitation in two classes of interneurons – neurogliaform (NG) cells and horizontal (HZ) cells – that provide feedforward inhibition in layer 1 of the piriform cortex. NG cells fire much earlier than HZ cells following odor onset, a difference that can be attributed to the faster odor-driven excitatory synaptic drive that NG cells receive from the olfactory bulb. As a result, NG cells strongly but transiently inhibit odor-evoked excitation in layer 2 principal cells, whereas HZ cells provide more diffuse and prolonged feedforward inhibition. Our findings reveal unexpected complexity in the operation of inhibition in the piriform cortex.

                Post-mortem MRI provides the opportunity to acquire high-resolution datasets to investigate neuroanatomy, and validate the origins of image contrast through microscopy comparisons. We introduce the <i>Digital Brain Bank</i> (open.win.ox.ac.uk/DigitalBrainBank), a data release platform providing open access to curated, multimodal post-mortem neuroimaging datasets. Datasets span three themes - <i>Digital Neuroanatomist</i>: datasets for detailed neuroanatomical investigations; <i>Digital Brain Zoo</i>: datasets for comparative neuroanatomy; <i>Digital Pathologist</i>: datasets for neuropathology investigations. The first Digital Brain Bank release includes twenty one distinctive whole-brain diffusion MRI datasets for structural connectivity investigations, alongside microscopy and complementary MRI modalities. This includes one of the highest-resolution whole-brain human diffusion MRI datasets ever acquired, whole-brain diffusion MRI in fourteen non-human primate species, and one of the largest post-mortem whole-brain cohort imaging studies in neurodegeneration. The <i>Digital Brain Bank</i> is the culmination of our lab's investment into post-mortem MRI methodology and MRI-microscopy analysis techniques.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Noninvasive stimulation of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex modulates rationality of human decision-making</a></h4>

              
                The framing-effect is a bias that affects decision-making depending on whether the available options are presented with positive or negative connotations. Even when the outcome of two choices is equivalent, people have a strong tendency to avoid the negatively framed option because losses are perceived about twice as salient as gains of the same amount (i.e. loss-aversion). The ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) is crucial for rational decision-making, and dysfunctions in this region have been linked to cognitive biases, impulsive behavior and gambling addiction. Using a financial decision-making task in combination with magnetoencephalographic neuroimaging, we show that excitatory compared to inhibitory non-invasive transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of the vmPFC reduces framing-effects while improving the assessment of loss-probabilities, ultimately leading to increased overall gains. Behavioral and neural data consistently suggest that this improvement in rational decision-making is predominately a consequence of reduced loss-aversion. These findings recommend further research towards clinical applications of vmPFC-tDCS in addictive disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Optogenetic stimulation of medial septal glutamatergic neurons modulates theta-gamma coupling in the hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                The oscillatory activity of the hippocampus and parahippocampal structures encodes information during cognition. Multiple researchers emphasize hippocampal cross-frequency theta-gamma coupling (TGC) as a basic mechanism for information processing, retrieval, and consolidation of long-term and working memory. While the role of entorhinal afferents in the modulation of hippocampal TGC is widely accepted, the influence of other main input to the hippocampus, from the medial septal area (MSA, the pacemaker of the hippocampal theta rhythm) is poorly understood. This area innervates multiple targets in the hippocampus, so information about the participation of MSA in cross-frequency interactions might be critical for an understanding of neural coding. Optogenetics allows us to explore how different neuronal populations of septohippocampal circuits control neuronal oscillations in vivo. It was shown that optogenetic activation of glutamatergic projections to the hippocampus with theta-frequency stimuli paces the hippocampal theta rhythm. Here we investigated the influence of phasic activation of MSA glutamatergic neurons expressing channelrhodopsin II on theta-gamma coupling in the hippocampus. Transgenic mice B6.Cg-Tg (Thy1-COP4/EYFP)18Gfng/J were used in this experiment. Expression of ChRII in MSA was verified immunohistochemically and the optic fibers just above MSA and the recording electrodes in the CA1 hippocampal field were implanted. During the experiment, local field potentials of MSA and hippocampus of freely behaving mice were modulated by 470nm light flashes with theta frequency (2-10) Hz. It was shown that both the power and the strength of modulation of gamma rhythm nested on hippocampal theta waves depend on the frequency of stimulation. The modulation of the amplitude of slow gamma rhythm (30-50 Hz) prevailed over modulation of fast gamma (55-100 Hz) during flash trains and the observed effects were specific for theta stimulation of MSA. We discuss the possibility that phasic depolarization of septal glutamatergic neurons controls theta-gamma coupling in the hippocampus and plays a role in memory retrieval and consolidation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Microarray profiling of hypothalamic gene expression changes in Huntington's disease mouse models</a></h4>

              
                Structural changes and neuropathology in the hypothalamus have been suggested to contribute to the non-motor manifestations of Huntington's disease (HD), a neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expanded CAG repeat in the huntingtin (HTT) gene. In the present study, we investigated whether transcriptional changes would be part of hypothalamic pathology induced by the disease-causing huntingtin (HTT) protein. We performed microarray analysis using the Affymetrix platform on total hypothalamic RNA isolated from two HD mouse models and their littermate controls; BACHD mice with ubiquitous expression of full-length mutant HTT (mHTT) and wild-type mice with targeted hypothalamic overexpression of either wild-type HTT (wtHTT) or mHTT fragments. To analyze microarray datasets (34760 variables) and obtain functional implications of differential expression patterns, we used Linear Models for Microarray Data (limma) followed by Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) using ClusterProfiler. Limma identified 735 and 721 significantly differentially expressed genes (adjusted p < 0.05) in hypothalamus of AAV datasets wtHTT vs control and mHTT vs control. In contrast, for BACHD datasets and the AAV mHTT vs. wtHTT dataset, none of the genes were differentially expressed (adjusted p-value > 0.05 for all probe IDs). In AAV groups, from the combined limma with GSEA using ClusterProfiler, we found both shared and unique gene sets and pathways for mice with wtHTT overexpression compared to mice with mHTT overexpression. mHTT caused widespread suppression of neuroendocrine networks, as evident by GSEA enrichment of GO-terms related to neurons and/or specific neuroendocrine populations. Using qRT-PCR, we confirmed that mHTT overexpression caused significant downregulation of key enzymes involved in neuropeptide synthesis, including histidine and dopa decarboxylases, compared to wtHTT overexpression. Multiple biosynthetic pathways such as sterol synthesis were among the top shared processes, where both unique and shared genes constituted leading-edge subsets. In conclusion, mice with targeted overexpression of HTT (wtHTT or mHTT) in the hypothalamus show dysregulation of pathways, of which there are subsets of shared pathways and pathways unique to either wtHTT or mHTT overexpression.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor differentially controls mossy cell activity across the dentate gyrus longitudinal axis</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the role of dentate gyrus (DG) mossy cells (MCs) in learning and memory has rapidly evolved due to increasingly precise methods for targeting MCs and for in vivo recording and activity manipulation in rodents. These studies have shown MCs are highly active in vivo, strongly remap to contextual manipulation, and that their inhibition or hyperactivation impairs pattern separation and location or context discrimination. What is not well understood is how MC activity is modulated by neurohormonal mechanisms, which might differentially control the participation of MCs in cognitive functions during discrete states, such as hunger or satiety. In this study, we demonstrate that glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), a neuropeptide produced in the gut and the brain that regulates food consumption and hippocampal-dependent mnemonic function, might regulate MC function through selective expression of its receptor, GLP-1R. RNA-seq demonstrated that most Glp1r in hippocampal principal neurons is expressed in MCs, and in situ hybridization revealed strong expression of Glp1r in hilar neurons. Glp1r-ires-Cre mice crossed with Ai14D reporter mice followed by co-labeling for the MC marker GluR2/3 revealed that almost all MCs in the ventral DG expressed Glp1r and that almost all Glp1r-expressing hilar neurons were MCs. However, only ~60% of dorsal DG MCs expressed Glp1r, and Glp1r was also expressed in small hilar neurons that were not MCs. Consistent with this expression pattern, peripheral administration of the GLP-1R agonist exendin-4 (5 microgram/kg) increased cFos expression in ventral but not dorsal DG hilar neurons. Finally, whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from ventral MCs showed that bath application of exendin-4 (200 nM) depolarized MCs and increased action potential firing. Taken together, this study identifies a potential neurohormonal mechanism linking a critically important satiety signal with activity of MCs in the ventral DG that might have functional effects on learning and memory during distinct states.

                We present a novel mean-field theory for balanced neuronal networks with arbitrary levels of symmetry in the synaptic connectivity. The theory determines the fixed point of the network dynamics and the conditions for its stability. The fixed point becomes unstable by increasing the synaptic gain beyond a critical value that depends on the level of symmetry. Beyond this critical gain, for positive levels of symmetry, we find a previously unreported phase. In this phase, the dynamical landscape is dominated by a large number of marginally-stable fixed points. As a result, the network dynamics exhibit non-exponential relaxation and ergodicity is broken. We discuss the relevance of such a glassy phase for understanding dynamical and computational aspects of cortical operation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Angiotensin blockade enhances motivational reward learning via enhancing ventral striatal prediction error and frontostriatal communication</a></h4>

              
                Adaptive human learning utilizes reward prediction errors (RPEs) that scale the differences between expected and actual outcomes to optimize future choices. Depression has been linked with biased RPE signaling and an exaggerated impact of negative outcomes on learning which may promote amotivation and anhedonia. The present proof-of-concept study combined computational modelling and multivariate decoding with neuroimaging to determine the influence of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist losartan on learning from positive or negative outcomes and the underlying neural mechanisms in healthy humans. In a double-blind, between-subjects, placebo-controlled pharmaco-fMRI experiment, 61 healthy male participants (losartan, n=30; placebo, n=31) underwent a probabilistic selection reinforcement learning task incorporating a learning and transfer phase. Losartan improved choice accuracy for the hardest stimulus pair relative to the placebo group during learning. Computational modelling revealed that losartan reduced the learning rate for negative outcomes and increased exploitatory choice behaviors while preserving learning for positive outcomes. These behavioral patterns were paralleled on the neural level by increased RPE signaling in orbitofrontal-striatal regions and enhanced positive outcome representations in the ventral striatum (VS) following losartan. In the transfer phase, losartan accelerated response times and enhanced VS functional connectivity with left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex when approaching maximum rewards. These findings elucidate the potential of losartan to reduce the impact of negative outcomes during learning and subsequently facilitate motivational approach towards maximum rewards in the transfer of learning. The mechanism could help to normalize biased reward learning characteristic of depression.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Brain Capillary Pericytes are Metabolic Sentinels that Control Blood Flow through KATP Channel Activity</a></h4>

              
                Capillary pericytes and their processes cover ~90% of the total length of the brains capillary bed. Despite their abundance, little is known of pericyte function, and their contributions to the control of brain hemodynamics remain unclear. Here, we report that deep capillary pericytes possess a mechanistic 'energy switch' that, when activated by a decrease in glucose, elicits robust KATP channel activation to increase blood flow and protect energy substrate availability. We demonstrate that pharmacological activation of KATP channels profoundly hyperpolarizes capillary pericytes and leads to dilation of upstream penetrating arterioles and arteriole-proximate capillaries covered with contractile pericytes, leading to an increase in local capillary blood flow. Stimulation of a single capillary pericyte with a KATP channel agonist is sufficient to evoke this response, which is mediated via KIR channel-dependent retrograde propagation of hyperpolarizing electrical signals. Genetic inactivation of pericyte KATP channels via expression of a dominant-negative version of KIR6.1 eliminates these effects. Critically, we show that lowering extracellular glucose below 1 mM evokes dramatic KATP channel-mediated pericyte hyperpolarization. Inhibiting glucose uptake by blocking GLUT1 transporters in vivo also activates this energy switch to increase pericyte KATP channel activity, dilate arterioles and increase blood flow. Together, our findings recast capillary pericytes as metabolic sentinels that respond to local energy deficits by robustly increasing blood flow to protect metabolic substrate delivery to neurons and prevent energetic shortfalls.

                Selective attention implements preferential routing of attended stimuli, likely through increasing the influence of the respective synaptic inputs on higher-area neurons. As the inputs of competing stimuli converge onto postsynaptic neurons, presynaptic circuits might offer the best target for attentional top-down influences. If those influences enabled presynaptic circuits to selectively entrain postsynaptic neurons, this might lead to selective routing. Indeed, when two visual stimuli induce two gamma rhythms in V1, only the gamma induced by the attended stimulus entrains gamma in V4. Here, we modeled this selective entrainment with a Dynamic Causal Model for Cross-Spectral Densities and found that it can be explained by attentional modulation of intrinsic V1 connections. Specifically, local inhibition was decreased in the granular input layer and increased in the supragranular output layer of the V1 circuit that processed the attended stimulus. Thus, presynaptic attentional influences and ensuing entrainment were sufficient to mediate selective routing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The Influence of Neural activity and Neural Cytoarchitecture on Cerebrovascular Arborization: A Computational Model</a></h4>

              
                Normal functioning of the brain relies on a continual and efficient delivery of energy by a vast network of cerebral blood vessels. The bidirectional coupling between neurons and blood vessels consists of vasodilatory energy demand signals from neurons to blood vessels, and the retrograde flow of energy substrates from the vessels to neurons, which fuel neural firing, growth and other housekeeping activities in the neurons. Recent works indicate that, in addition to the functional coupling observed in the adult brain, the interdependence between the neural and vascular networks begins at the embryonic stage, and continues into subsequent developmental stages. The proposed Vascular Arborization Model (VAM) captures the effect of neural cytoarchitecture and neural activity on vascular arborization. The VAM describes three important stages of vascular tree growth: (i) The prenatal growth phase, where the vascular arborization depends on the cytoarchitecture of neurons and non-neural cells, (ii) the post-natal growth phase during which the further arborization of the vasculature depends on neural activity in addition to neural cytoarchitecture, and (iii) the settling phase, where the fully grown vascular tree repositions its vascular branch points or nodes to ensure minimum path length and wire length. The vasculature growth depicted by VAM captures structural characteristics like vascular volume density, radii, mean distance to proximal neurons in the cortex. VAM-grown vasculature agrees with the experimental observation that the neural densities do not covary with the vascular density along the depth of the cortex but predicts a high correlation between neural areal density and microvascular density when compared over a global scale (across animals and regions). To explore the influence of neural activity on vascular arborization, the VAM was used to grow the vasculature in neonatal rat whisker barrel cortex under two conditions: (i) Control, where the whiskers were intact and (ii) Lesioned, where one row of whiskers was cauterized. The model captures a significant reduction in vascular branch density in lesioned animals compared to control animals, concurring with experimental observation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Mixture of Learning Strategies Underlies Rodent Behavior in Dynamic Foraging</a></h4>

              
                In volatile foraging environments, agents need to adapt their learning in accordance with the uncertainty of the environment and knowledge of the hidden structure of the world. In these contexts, previous studies have distinguished between two types of strategies, model-free learning, where reward values are updated locally based on external feedback signals, and inference-based learning, where an internal model of the world is used to make optimal inferences about the current state of the environment. Distinguishing between these strategies during the dynamic foraging behavioral paradigm has been a challenging problem for studies of reward-guided decisions, due to the diversity in behavior of model-free and inference-based agents, as well as the complexities that arise when animals mix between these types of strategies. Here, we developed two solutions that jointly tackle these problems. First, we identified four key behavioral features that together benchmark the switching dynamics of agents in response to a change in reward contingency. We performed computational simulations to systematically measure these features for a large ensemble of model-free and inference-based agents, uncovering an organized structure of behavioral choices where observed behavior can be reliably classified into one of six distinct regimes in the two respective parameter spaces. Second, to address the challenge that arises when animals use multiple strategies within single sessions, we developed a novel state-space method, block Hidden Markov Model (blockHMM), to infer switches in discrete latent states that govern the choice sequences across blocks of trials. Our results revealed a remarkable degree of mixing between different strategies even in expert animals, such that model-free and inference-based learning modes often co-existed within single sessions. Together, these results invite a re-evaluation of the stationarity of behavior during dynamic foraging, provide a comprehensive set of tools to characterize the evolution of learning strategies, and form the basis of understanding neural circuits involved in different modes of behavior within this domain.

                Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is the second leading cause of death globally. No Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved therapies exist targeting cerebroprotection following stroke. Our group recently reported significant cerebroprotection with the adenosine A1/A3 receptor agonist, AST-004, in a transient stroke model in non-human primates (NHP) and in a preclinical mouse model of traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, the specific receptor pathway activated was only inferred based on in vitro binding studies. The current study investigated the underlying mechanism of AST-004 cerebroprotection in two independent models of AIS: permanent photothrombotic stroke in mice and transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in rats. AST-004 treatments across a range of doses were cerebroprotective and efficacy could be blocked by A3R antagonism, indicating a mechanism of action that does not require A1R agonism. The high affinity A3R agonist MRS5698 was also cerebroprotective following stroke, but not the A3R agonist Cl-IB-MECA under our experimental conditions. AST-004 efficacy was blocked by the astrocyte specific mitochondrial toxin fluoroacetate, confirming an underlying mechanism of cerebroprotection dependent on astrocyte mitochondrial metabolism. An increase in A3R mRNA levels following stroke suggested an intrinsic cerebroprotective response that was mediated by A3R signaling. Together, these studies confirm certain A3R agonists, such as AST-004, are promising new therapeutics for the treatment of AIS.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Medial septum glutamate neurons are essential for spatial goal-directed memory</a></h4>

              
                The medial septum (MS), a brain region containing acetylcholine, GABA and glutamate neurons, is essential for learning and memory. However, whether MS glutamate neurons contribute to memory is unknown. Here, we use calcium imaging and optogenetic silencing to determine the function of MS glutamate neurons in mice performing a spatial allocentric memory navigation task. While MS glutamate neurons appeared randomly active during free exploration, two groups of glutamate neurons emerged during training in a five-arm star maze, distinguished by their peak activity. The largest group was predominantly activated before locomotion whereas the other was primarily active when mice reached the reward site. Both populations were preferentially activated for correct over incorrect trajectories. Interestingly, optogenetic silencing of MS glutamate neurons immediately before mice start navigating, induced significant spatial memory impairments. Together these results demonstrate that MS glutamate neurons heterogeneously encode navigationally relevant information and are essential for spatial learning.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Proportional intracranial volume correction differentially biases behavioral predictions across neuroanatomical features and populations</a></h4>

              
                Individual differences in brain anatomy can be used to predict variability in cognitive function. Most studies to date have focused on broad population-level trends, but the extent to which the observed predictive features are shared across sexes and age groups remains to be established. While it is standard practice to account for intracranial volume (ICV) using proportion correction in both regional and whole-brain morphometric analyses, in the context of brain-behavior predictions the possible differential impact of ICV correction on anatomical features and subgroups within the population has yet to be systematically investigated. In this work, we evaluate the effect of proportional ICV correction on sex-independent and sex-specific predictive models of individual cognitive abilities across multiple anatomical properties (surface area, gray matter volume, and cortical thickness) in healthy young adults (Human Connectome Project; n=1013, 548 females) and typically developing children (Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study; n=1823, 979 females). We demonstrate that ICV correction generally reduces predictive accuracies derived from surface area and gray matter volume, while increasing predictive accuracies based on cortical thickness in both adults and children. Furthermore, the extent to which predictive models generalize across sexes and age groups depends on ICV correction: models based on surface area and gray matter volume are more generalizable without ICV correction, while models based on cortical thickness are more generalizable with ICV correction. Finally, the observed neuroanatomical features predictive of cognitive abilities are unique across age groups regardless of ICV correction, but whether they are shared or unique across sexes (within age groups) depends on ICV correction. These findings highlight the importance of considering individual differences in ICV, and show that proportional ICV correction does not remove the effects of cranium volumes from anatomical measurements and can introduce ICV bias where previously there was none. ICV correction choices affect not just the strength of the relationships captured, but also the conclusions drawn regarding the neuroanatomical features that underlie those relationships.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysfunction worsens epilepsy outcomes and increases SUDEP risk</a></h4>

              
                Epilepsy is often comorbid with psychiatric illnesses, including anxiety and depression. Despite the high incidence of psychiatric comorbidities in people with epilepsy, few studies address the underlying mechanisms. Stress can trigger both epilepsy and depression and significant accumulating evidence, from both human and animal studies, support that hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysfunction may contribute to the comorbidity of these two disorders1. Here we directly investigate the contribution of HPA axis dysfunction to epilepsy outcomes and psychiatric comorbidities. We generated a novel mouse model (KCC2/Crh mice) that lacks the K+/Cl- co-transporter, KCC2, in corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) neurons, which exhibit stress- and seizure-induced hyperactivation of the HPA axis.2,3 Here we demonstrate that HPA axis dysfunction in KCC2/Crh mice is associated with increased vulnerability to behavioral deficits in chronically epileptic mice and more severe neuropathological features associated with chronic epilepsy (e.g. increased mossy fiber sprouting). Despite equivalent seizure burden, HPA axis dysfunction in these chronically epileptic mice increased the incidence of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Suppressing HPA axis hyperexcitability in this model using a pharmacological or chemogenetic approach decreased SUDEP incidence, supporting HPA axis dysfunction in SUDEP vulnerability. We also observed changes in neuroendocrine markers in individuals that died of SUDEP compared to people with epilepsy or individuals without a history of epilepsy. Together, these findings describe a novel, nongenetic mouse model of SUDEP which will benefit preclinical SUDEP research to gain a better understanding of the underlying pathological mechanisms contributing to SUDEP. HPA axis dysfunction increases vulnerability to psychiatric comorbidities in epilepsy and may be a risk factor for SUDEP.

	<p>To date, objective measurements and psychophysical experiments have been used to measure frequency dependent basilar membrane (BM) delays in humans; however, in vivo measurements have not been made. This study aimed to measure BM delays by performing intracochlear electrocochleography in cochlear implant recipients. Sixteen subjects with various degrees of hearing abilities were selected. Postoperative Computer Tomography was performed to determine electrode locations. Electrical potentials in response to acoustic tone pips at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz and clicks were recorded with electrodes at the frequency specific region. The electrode array was inserted up to the characteristic cochlear frequency region of 250 Hz for 6 subjects. Furthermore, the array was inserted in the region of 500 Hz for 15 subjects, and 1, 2, and 4 kHz were reached in all subjects. Intracochlear electrocochleography for each frequency-specific tone pip and clicks showed detectable responses in all subjects. The latencies differed among the cochlear location and the cochlear microphonic (CM) onset latency increased with decreasing frequency and were consistent with click derived band technique. Accordingly, BM delays in humans could be derived. The BM delays increased systematically along the cochlea from basal to apical end and were in accordance with Ruggero and Temchin, 2007.</p>

	<p>The Baking Tray Task is an ecological task developed for the assessment of unilateral neglect that can also be used for research on neurotypical participants. In this task, participants are asked to place 16 objects inside a board as evenly as possible. In the case of impaired spatial exploration, consequent to right attentional networks damage, asymmetrical object disposition is observed as more objects are placed on the ipsilesional side (typically the right side). The E-BTT is a technology-enhanced version of the Baking Tray Task, implemented with a software platform, E-TAN, which detects the objects and automatically computes their spatial coordinates. This allows a complement to the traditional scoring methods with new measures to extract richer information from the data. In this study, we focus on neurotypical participants to explore if some new indexes, derived from the literature review on similar tasks, can be applied to BTT and E-BTT for research aims. A principal component analysis (PCA) was then performed to verify if these new indexes reflect some common dimensions. Results indicate the emergence of two principal dimensions: spatiality, which summarizes both laterality and verticality, and quality, which regards the explored space and (dis)organization in placing the items.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">China’s economic connectivity to the world economy [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                The ambition of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is to revive the silk road of Roman times which was used by merchants to carry trade across Eurasia. China’s proclaimed aspiration is to reconnect to the world through its ancient trade corridors, and to emphasize its role as a world trade power. Should the BRI or “new silk road” be understood as efforts from President Xi Jinping to project China’s power into both Eurasia and at the global level? Should it moreover be understood as China’s step forward to fill the leadership vacuum left by a perceived weakening USA in terms of international relations? The present economic climate is characterised by uncertainty and turbulence at the global level, with some economies shifting towards protectionist practices, and others, such as the United Kingdom, trying to regain some international recognition outside the EU. This turbulent climate appears to benefit Beijing who can position itself as a new leader in the global political economy, notably through its BRI. The article discusses the issues raised by China’s ambition to shape  the current international economic order.

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">KIFC1 Regulates the Trajectory of Neuronal Migration</a></h4>

              
                <p>During neuronal migration, forces generated by cytoplasmic dynein yank on microtubules extending from the centrosome into the leading process and move the nucleus along microtubules that extend behind the centrosome. Scaffolds, such as radial glia, guide neuronal migration outward from the ventricles, but little is known about the internal machinery that ensures that the soma migrates along its proper path rather than moving backward or off the path. Here we report that depletion of KIFC1, a minus-end-directed kinesin called HSET in humans, causes neurons to migrate off their appropriate path, suggesting that this molecular motor is what ensures fidelity of the trajectory of migration. For these studies, we used rat migratory neurons <I>in vitro</I> and developing mouse brain <I>in vivo</I>, together with RNA interference and ectopic expression of mutant forms of KIFC1. We found that crosslinking of microtubules into a nonsliding mode by KIFC1 is necessary for dynein-driven forces to achieve sufficient traction to thrust the soma forward. Asymmetric bouts of microtubule sliding driven by KIFC1 thereby enable the soma to tilt in one direction or another, thus providing midcourse corrections that keep the neuron on its appropriate trajectory. KIFC1-driven sliding of microtubules further assists neurons in remaining on their appropriate path by allowing the nucleus to rotate directionally as it moves, which is consistent with how we found that KIFC1 contributes to interkinetic nuclear migration at an earlier stage of neuronal development.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Resolving the mechanisms of neuronal migration is medically important because many developmental disorders of the brain involve flaws in neuronal migration and because deployment of newly born neurons may be important in the adult for cognition and memory. Drugs that inhibit KIFC1 are candidates for chemotherapy and therefore should be used with caution if they are allowed to enter the brain.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Long-Lasting, Pathway-Specific Impairment of a Novel Form of Spike-Timing-Dependent Long-Term Depression by Neuropathic Pain in the Anterior Cingulate Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>Malfunctioning synaptic plasticity is one of the major mechanisms contributing to the development of chronic pain. We studied spike-timing dependent depression (tLTD) in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) of male mice, a brain region involved in processing emotional aspects of pain. tLTD onto layer 5 pyramidal neurons depended on postsynaptic calcium-influx through GluN2B-containing NMDARs and retrograde signaling via nitric oxide to reduce presynaptic release probability. After chronic constriction injury of the sciatic nerve, a model for neuropathic pain, tLTD was rapidly impaired; and this phenotype persisted even beyond the time of recovery from mechanical sensitization. Exclusion of GluN2B-containing NMDARs from the postsynaptic site specifically at projections from the anterior thalamus to the ACC caused the tLTD phenotype, whereas signaling downstream of nitric oxide synthesis remained intact. Thus, transient neuropathic pain can leave a permanent trace manifested in the disturbance of synaptic plasticity in a specific afferent pathway to the cortex.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Synaptic plasticity is one of the main mechanisms that contributes to the development of chronic pain. Most studies have focused on potentiation of excitatory synaptic transmission, but very little is known about the reduction in synaptic strength. We have focused on the ACC, a brain region associated with the processing of emotional and affective components of pain. We studied spike-timing dependent LTD, which is a biologically plausible form of synaptic plasticity, that depends on the relative timing of presynaptic and postsynaptic activity. We found a long-lasting and pathway-specific suppression of the induction mechanism for spike-timing dependent LTD from the anterior thalamus to the ACC, suggesting that this pathology might be involved in altered emotional processing in pain.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Reproducibility of the Rod Photoreceptor Response Depends Critically on the Concentration of the Phosphodiesterase Effector Enzyme</a></h4>

              
                <p>The high sensitivity of night vision requires that rod photoreceptors reliably and reproducibly signal the absorption of single photons, a process that depends on tight regulation of intracellular cGMP concentration through the phototransduction cascade. Here in the mouse (Mus musculus), we studied a single-site <I>D167A</I> mutation of the gene for the &alpha; subunit of rod photoreceptor phosphodiesterase (PDEA), made with the aim of removing a noncatalytic binding site for cGMP. This mutation unexpectedly eliminated nearly all PDEA expression and reduced expression of the &beta; subunit (PDEB) to ~5%-10% of WT. The remaining PDE had nearly normal specific activity; degeneration was slow, with 50%-60% of rods remaining after 6 months. Responses were larger and more sensitive than normal but slower in rise and decay, probably from slower dark turnover of cGMP. Remarkably, responses became much less reproducible than WT, with response variance increasing for amplitude by over 10-fold, and for latency and time-to-peak by &gt;100-fold. We hypothesize that the increase in variance is the result of greater variability in the dark-resting concentration of cGMP, produced by spatial and temporal nonuniformity in spontaneous PDE activity. This variability decreased as stimuli were made brighter, presumably because of greater spatial uniformity of phototransduction and the approach to saturation. We conclude that the constancy of the rod response depends critically on PDE expression to maintain adequate spontaneous PDE activity, so that the concentration of second messenger is relatively uniform throughout the outer segment.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Rod photoreceptors in the vertebrate retina reliably signal the absorption of single photons of light by generating responses that are remarkably reproducible in amplitude and waveform. We show that this reproducibility depends critically on the concentration of the effector enzyme phosphodiesterase (PDE), which metabolizes the second messenger cGMP and generates rod light responses. In rods with the <I>D167A</I> mutation of the &alpha; subunit of PDE, only 5%-10% of PDE is expressed. Single-photon responses then become much more variable than in WT rods. We think this variability is caused by spatial and temporal inhomogeneity in the concentration of cGMP in darkness, so that photons absorbed in different parts of the cell produce responses of greatly varying amplitude and waveform.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Inositol Polyphosphate-5-Phosphatase K (Inpp5k) Enhances Sprouting of Corticospinal Tract Axons after CNS Trauma</a></h4>

              
                <p>Failure of CNS neurons to mount a significant growth response after trauma contributes to chronic functional deficits after spinal cord injury. Activator and repressor screening of embryonic cortical neurons and retinal ganglion cells <I>in vitro</I> and transcriptional profiling of developing CNS neurons harvested <I>in vivo</I> have identified several candidates that stimulate robust axon growth <I>in vitro</I> and <I>in vivo</I>. Building on these studies, we sought to identify novel axon growth activators induced in the complex adult CNS environment <I>in vivo</I>. We transcriptionally profiled intact sprouting adult corticospinal neurons (CSNs) after contralateral pyramidotomy (PyX) in nogo receptor-1 knock-out mice and found that intact CSNs were enriched in genes in the 3-phosphoinositide degradation pathway, including six 5-phosphatases. We explored whether inositol polyphosphate-5-phosphatase K (<I>Inpp5k</I>) could enhance corticospinal tract (CST) axon growth in preclinical models of acute and chronic CNS trauma. Overexpression of <I>Inpp5k</I> in intact adult CSNs in male and female mice enhanced the sprouting of intact CST terminals after PyX and cortical stroke and sprouting of CST axons after acute and chronic severe thoracic spinal contusion. We show that <I>Inpp5k</I> stimulates axon growth in part by elevating the density of active cofilin in labile growth cones, thus stimulating actin polymerization and enhancing microtubule protrusion into distal filopodia. We identify <I>Inpp5k</I> as a novel CST growth activator capable of driving compensatory axon growth in multiple complex CNS injury environments and underscores the veracity of using <I>in vivo</I> transcriptional screening to identify the next generation of cell-autonomous factors capable of repairing the damaged CNS.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Neurologic recovery is limited after spinal cord injury as CNS neurons are incapable of self-repair post-trauma. <I>In vitro</I> screening strategies exploit the intrinsically high growth capacity of embryonic CNS neurons to identify novel axon growth activators. While promising candidates have been shown to stimulate axon growth <I>in vivo</I>, concomitant functional recovery remains incomplete. We identified <I>Inpp5k</I> as a novel axon growth activator using transcriptional profiling of intact adult corticospinal tract (CST) neurons that had initiated a growth response after pyramidotomy in plasticity sensitized nogo receptor-1-null mice. Here, we show that <I>Inpp5k</I> overexpression can stimulate CST axon growth after pyramidotomy, stroke, and acute and chronic contusion injuries. These data support <I>in vivo</I> screening approaches to identify novel axon growth activators.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Sensory and Motor Components of the Cortical Hierarchy Are Coupled to the Rhythm of the Stomach during Rest</a></h4>

              
                <p>Bodily rhythms appear as novel scaffolding mechanisms orchestrating the spatiotemporal organization of spontaneous brain activity. Here, we follow-up on the discovery of the gastric resting-state network (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B65">Rebollo et al., 2018</cross-ref>), composed of brain regions in which the fMRI signal is phase-synchronized to the slow (0.05 Hz) electrical rhythm of the stomach. Using a larger sample size (<I>n</I> = 63 human participants, both genders), we further characterize the anatomy and effect sizes of gastric-brain coupling across resting-state networks, a fine grained cortical parcellation, as well as along the main gradients of cortical organization. Most (67%) of the gastric network is included in the somato-motor-auditory (38%) and visual (29%) resting state networks (RSNs). Gastric brain coupling also occurs in the granular insula and, to a lesser extent, in the piriform cortex. Thus, all sensory and motor cortices corresponding to both exteroceptive and interoceptive modalities are coupled to the gastric rhythm during rest. Conversely, little gastric-brain coupling occurs in cognitive networks and transmodal regions. These results suggest not only that gastric rhythm and sensory-motor processes are likely to interact, but also that gastric-brain coupling might be a mechanism of sensory and motor integration that mostly bypasses cognition, complementing the classical hierarchical organization of the human brain.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> While there is growing interest for brain-body communication in general and brain-viscera communication in particular, little is known about how the brain interacts with the gastric rhythm, the slow electrical rhythm continuously produced in the stomach. Here, we show in human participants at rest that the gastric network, composed of brain regions synchronized with delays to the gastric rhythm, includes all motor and sensory (vision, audition, touch and interoception, olfaction) regions, but only few of the transmodal regions associated with higher-level cognition. Such results prompt for a reconsideration of the classical view of cortical organization, where the different sensory modalities are considered as relatively independent modules.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Long-Range Amplitude Coupling Is Optimized for Brain Networks That Function at Criticality</a></h4>

              
                <p>Brain function depends on segregation and integration of information processing in brain networks often separated by long-range anatomic connections. Neuronal oscillations orchestrate such distributed processing through transient amplitude and phase coupling, yet surprisingly, little is known about local network properties facilitating these functional connections. Here, we test whether criticality, a dynamical state characterized by scale-free oscillations, optimizes the capacity of neuronal networks to couple through amplitude or phase, and transfer information. We coupled <I>in silico</I> networks which exhibit oscillations in the &alpha; band (8&ndash;16 Hz), and varied excitatory and inhibitory connectivity. We found that phase coupling of oscillations emerges at criticality, and that amplitude coupling, as well as information transfer, are maximal when networks are critical. Importantly, regulating criticality through modulation of synaptic gain showed that critical dynamics, as opposed to a static ratio of excitatory and inhibitory connections, optimize network coupling and information transfer. Our data support the idea that criticality is important for local and global information processing and may help explain why brain disorders characterized by local alterations in criticality also exhibit impaired long-range synchrony, even before degeneration of axonal connections.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> To perform adaptively in a changing environment, our brains dynamically coordinate activity across distant areas. Empirical evidence suggests that long-range amplitude and phase coupling of oscillations are systems-level mechanisms enabling transient formation of spatially distributed functional networks on the backbone of a relatively static structural connectome. However, surprisingly little is known about the local network properties that optimize coupling and information transfer. Here, we show that criticality, a dynamical state characterized by scale-free oscillations and a hallmark of neuronal network activity, optimizes the capacity of neuronal networks to couple through amplitude or phase and transfer information.</p>

                <p>Theta oscillations are key brain rhythm involved in memory formation, sensorimotor integration, and control of locomotion and behavioral states. Generation and spatiotemporal synchronization of theta oscillations rely on interactions between brain nuclei forming a large neural network, which includes pontine nucleus incertus (NI). Here we identified distinct populations of NI neurons, based on the relationship of their firing to hippocampal waves, with a special focus on theta oscillations, and the direction and type of interaction with the medial septum (MS) in male, urethane-anesthetized rats. By recording NI neuronal firing and hippocampal LFP, we described NI neurons that fire action potentials in a theta phase-independent or theta phase-locked and delta wave-independent or delta wave-locked manner. Among hippocampal activity-independent NI neurons, irregular, slow-firing, and regular, fast-firing cells were observed, while hippocampal oscillation-/wave-locked NI neurons were of a bursting or nonbursting type. By projection-specific optotagging, we revealed that only fast-firing theta phase-independent NI neurons innervate the MS, rarely receiving feedback information. In contrast, the majority of theta-bursting NI neurons were inhibited by MS stimulation, and this effect was mediated by direct GABAergic input. Described NI neuronal populations differ in reciprocal connections with the septohippocampal system, plausibly forming separate neuronal loops. Our results suggest that theta phase-independent NI neurons participate in theta rhythm generation through direct innervation of the MS, while theta-bursting NI neurons further transmit the rhythmic signal received from the MS to stabilize and/or strengthen rhythmic activity in other structures.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The generation and spatiotemporal synchronization of theta oscillations rely on interactions between nuclei forming a large neural network, part of which is the pontine nucleus incertus (NI). Here we describe that within NI there are populations of neurons that can be distinguished based on the relationship of their firing to hippocampal theta oscillations and delta waves. We show that these neuronal populations largely do not have reciprocal connections with the septohippocampal system, but form separate neuronal loops. Our results suggest that medial septum (MS)-projecting, fast-firing, theta phase-independent NI neurons may participate in theta rhythm generation through direct innervation of the MS, while theta-bursting NI neurons may further transmit the rhythmic signal received from the MS to other structures.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Peristimulus Time Responses Predict Adaptation and Spontaneous Firing of Auditory-Nerve Fibers: From Rodents Data to Humans</a></h4>

              
                <p>Sound-level coding in the auditory nerve is achieved through the progressive recruitment of auditory nerve fibers (ANFs) that differ in threshold of activation and in the stimulus level at which the spike rate saturates. To investigate the functional state of the ANFs, the electrophysiological tests routinely used in clinics only capture the first action potentials firing in synchrony at the onset of the acoustic stimulation. Assessment of other properties (e.g., spontaneous rate and adaptation time constants) requires single-fiber recordings directly from the nerve, which for ethical reasons is not allowed in humans. By combining neuronal activity measurements at the round window and signal-processing algorithms, we constructed a peristimulus time response (PSTR), with a waveform similar to the peristimulus time histograms (PSTHs) derived from single-fiber recordings in young adult female gerbils. Simultaneous recordings of round-window PSTR and single-fiber PSTH provided models to predict the adaptation kinetics and spontaneous rate of the ANFs tuned at the PSTR probe frequency. The predictive model derived from gerbils was then validated in female mice and finally applied to humans by recording PSTRs from the auditory nerve in normal-hearing patients who underwent cerebellopontine angle surgeries. A rapid adaptation time constant of ~3 ms and a mean spontaneous rate of ~22 spikes/s in the 4 kHz frequency range were found. This study offers a promising diagnostic tool to map the human auditory nerve, thus opening new avenues to better understanding auditory neuropathies, tinnitus, and hyperacusis.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Neural adaptation in auditory nerve fibers corresponds to the reduction in the neuronal activity to prolonged or repeated sound stimulation. For obvious ethical reasons, single-fiber recordings from the auditory nerve are not feasible in humans, creating a critical gap in extending data obtained using animal models to humans. Using electrocochleography in rodents, we inferred adaptation kinetics and spontaneous discharge rates of the auditory nerve fibers in humans. Routinely used in basic and clinical laboratories, this tool will provide a better understanding of auditory disorders such as neuropathies, tinnitus, and hyperacusis, and will help to improve hearing-aid fittings.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Delta Oscillations Coordinate Intracerebellar and Cerebello-Hippocampal Network Dynamics during Sleep</a></h4>

              
                <p>During sleep, the widespread coordination of neuronal oscillations across both cortical and subcortical brain regions is thought to support various physiological functions. However, how sleep-related activity within the brain's largest sensorimotor structure, the cerebellum, is multiplexed with well-described sleep-related mechanisms in regions such as the hippocampus remains unknown. We therefore simultaneously recorded from the dorsal hippocampus and three distinct regions of the cerebellum (Crus I, lobule VI, and lobules II/III) in male mice during natural sleep. Local field potential (LFP) oscillations were found to be coordinated between these structures in a sleep stage-specific manner. During non-REM sleep, prominent  frequency coherence was observed between lobule VI and hippocampus, whereas non-REM-associated hippocampal sharp-wave ripple activity evoked discrete LFP modulation in all recorded cerebellar regions, with the shortest latency effects in lobule VI. We also describe discrete phasic sharp potentials (PSPs), which synchronize across cerebellar regions and trigger sharp-wave ripple suppression. During REM, cerebellar  phase significantly modulated hippocampal theta frequency, and this effect was greatest when PSPs were abundant. PSPs were phase-locked to cerebellar  oscillation peak and hippocampal theta oscillation trough, respectively. Within all three cerebellar regions, prominent LFP oscillations were observed at both low (, &lt;4 Hz) and very high frequencies (~250 Hz) during non-REM and REM sleep. Intracerebellar cross-frequency analysis revealed that  oscillations modulate those in the very high-frequency range. Together, these results reveal multiple candidate physiological mechanisms to support "offline," bidirectional interaction within distributed cerebello-hippocampal networks.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Sleep is associated with widespread coordination of activity across a range of brain regions. However, little is known about how activity within the largest sensorimotor region of the brain, the cerebellum, is both intrinsically organized and links with higher-order structures, such as the hippocampus, during sleep. By making multisite local field potential recordings in naturally sleeping mice, we reveal and characterize multiple sleep stage-specific physiological mechanisms linking three distinct cerebellar regions with the hippocampus. Central to these physiological mechanisms is a prominent  (&lt;4 Hz) oscillation, which temporally coordinates both intracerebellar and cerebello-hippocampal network dynamics. Understanding this distributed network activity is important for gaining insight into cerebellar contributions to sleep-dependent processes, such as memory consolidation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Directional Tuning of Phase Precession Properties in the Hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                <p>Running direction in the hippocampus is encoded by rate modulations of place field activity but also by spike timing correlations known as theta sequences. Whether directional rate codes and the directionality of place field correlations are related, however, has so far not been explored, and therefore the nature of how directional information is encoded in the cornu ammonis remains unresolved. Here, using a previously published dataset that contains the spike activity of rat hippocampal place cells in the CA1, CA2, and CA3 subregions during free foraging of male Long-Evans rats in a 2D environment, we found that rate and spike timing codes are related. Opposite to a preferred firing rate direction of a place field, spikes are more likely to undergo theta phase precession and, hence, more strongly affect paired correlations. Furthermore, we identified a subset of field pairs whose theta correlations are intrinsic in that they maintain the same firing order when the running direction is reversed. Both effects are associated with differences in theta phase distributions and are more prominent in CA3 than in CA1. We thus hypothesize that intrinsic spiking is most prominent when the directionally modulated sensory-motor drive of hippocampal firing rates is minimal, suggesting that extrinsic and intrinsic sequences contribute to phase precession as two distinct mechanisms.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Hippocampal theta sequences, on the one hand, are thought to reflect the running trajectory of an animal, connecting past and future locations. On the other hand, sequences have been proposed to reflect the rich, recursive hippocampal connectivity, related to memories of previous trajectories or even to experience-independent prestructure. Such intrinsic sequences are inherently one dimensional and cannot be easily reconciled with running trajectories in two dimensions as place fields can be approached on multiple one-dimensional paths. In this article, we dissect phase precession along different directions in all hippocampal subareas and find that CA3 in particular shows a high level of direction-independent correlations that are inconsistent with the notion of representing running trajectories. These intrinsic correlations are associated with later spike phases.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Somatosensory Evoked Potentials Reveal Reduced Embodiment of Emotions in Autism</a></h4>

              
                <p>Consistent with current models of embodied emotions, this study investigates whether the somatosensory system shows reduced sensitivity to facial emotional expressions in autistic compared with neurotypical individuals, and whether these differences are independent from between-group differences in visual processing of facial stimuli. To investigate the dynamics of somatosensory activity over and above visual carryover effects, we recorded EEG activity from two groups of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or typically developing (TD) humans (male and female), while they were performing a facial emotion discrimination task and a control gender task. To probe the state of the somatosensory system during face processing, in 50% of trials we evoked somatosensory activity by delivering task-irrelevant tactile taps on participants' index finger, 105 ms after visual stimulus onset. Importantly, we isolated somatosensory from concurrent visual activity by subtracting visual responses from activity evoked by somatosensory and visual stimuli. Results revealed significant task-dependent group differences in mid-latency components of somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs). ASD participants showed a selective reduction of SEP amplitudes (P100) compared with TD during emotion task; and TD, but not ASD, showed increased somatosensory responses during emotion compared with gender discrimination. Interestingly, autistic traits, but not alexithymia, significantly predicted SEP amplitudes evoked during emotion, but not gender, task. Importantly, we did not observe the same pattern of group differences in visual responses. Our study provides direct evidence of reduced recruitment of the somatosensory system during emotion discrimination in ASD and suggests that this effect is not a byproduct of differences in visual processing.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The somatosensory system is involved in embodiment of visually presented facial expressions of emotion. Despite autism being characterized by difficulties in emotion-related processing, no studies have addressed whether this extends to embodied representations of others' emotions. By dissociating somatosensory activity from visual evoked potentials, we provide the first evidence of reduced recruitment of the somatosensory system during emotion discrimination in autistic participants, independently from differences in visual processing between typically developing and autism spectrum disorder participants. Our study uses a novel methodology to reveal the neural dynamics underlying difficulties in emotion recognition in autism spectrum disorder and provides direct evidence that embodied simulation of others' emotional expressions operates differently in autistic individuals.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Left Motor {delta} Oscillations Reflect Asynchrony Detection in Multisensory Speech Perception</a></h4>

              
                <p>During multisensory speech perception, slow  oscillations (~1&ndash;3 Hz) in the listener's brain synchronize with the speech signal, likely engaging in speech signal decomposition. Notable fluctuations in the speech amplitude envelope, resounding speaker prosody, temporally align with articulatory and body gestures and both provide complementary sensations that temporally structure speech. Further,  oscillations in the left motor cortex seem to align with speech and musical beats, suggesting their possible role in the temporal structuring of (quasi)-rhythmic stimulation. We extended the role of  oscillations to audiovisual asynchrony detection as a test case of the temporal analysis of multisensory prosody fluctuations in speech. We recorded Electroencephalograph (EEG) responses in an audiovisual asynchrony detection task while participants watched videos of a speaker. We filtered the speech signal to remove verbal content and examined how visual and auditory prosodic features temporally (mis-)align. Results confirm (1) that participants accurately detected audiovisual asynchrony, and (2) increased  power in the left motor cortex in response to audiovisual asynchrony. The difference of  power between asynchronous and synchronous conditions predicted behavioral performance, and (3) decreased -&beta; coupling in the left motor cortex when listeners could not accurately map visual and auditory prosodies. Finally, both behavioral and neurophysiological evidence was altered when a speaker's face was degraded by a visual mask. Together, these findings suggest that motor  oscillations support asynchrony detection of multisensory prosodic fluctuation in speech.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Speech perception is facilitated by regular prosodic fluctuations that temporally structure the auditory signal. Auditory speech processing involves the left motor cortex and associated  oscillations. However, visual prosody (i.e., a speaker's body movements) complements auditory prosody, and it is unclear how the brain temporally analyses different prosodic features in multisensory speech perception. We combined an audiovisual asynchrony detection task with electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings to investigate how  oscillations support the temporal analysis of multisensory speech. Results confirmed that asynchrony detection of visual and auditory prosodies leads to increased  power in left motor cortex and correlates with performance. We conclude that  oscillations are invoked in an effort to resolve denoted temporal asynchrony in multisensory speech perception.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Elevation of Extracellular Glutamate by Blockade of Astrocyte Glutamate Transporters Inhibits Cocaine Reinforcement in Rats via a NMDA-GluN2B Receptor Mechanism</a></h4>

              
                <p>It is well established that glutamate plays an important role in drug-induced and cue-induced reinstatement of drug seeking. However, the role of glutamate in drug reward is unclear. In this study, we systemically evaluated the effects of multiple glutamate transporter (GLT) inhibitors on extracellular glutamate and dopamine (DA) in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), intravenous cocaine self-administration, intracranial brain-stimulation reward (BSR), and reinstatement of cocaine seeking in male and female rats. Among the five GLT inhibitors we tested, TFB-TBOA was the most potent. Microinjections of TFB-TBOA into the NAc, but not the ventral tegmental area (VTA), or dorsal striatum (DS), dose-dependently inhibited cocaine self-administration under fixed-ratio and progressive-ratio (PR) reinforcement schedules, shifted the cocaine dose&ndash;response curve downward, and inhibited intracranial BSR. Selective downregulation of astrocytic GLT-1 expression in the NAc by GLT-1 antisense oligonucleotides also inhibited cocaine self-administration. The reduction in cocaine self-administration following TFB-TBOA administration was NMDA GluN2B receptor dependent, and rats self-administering cocaine showed upregulation of GluN2B expression in NAc DA- and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein 32 (DARPP-32)-positive medium-spiny neurons (MSNs). In contrast, TFB-TBOA, when locally administered into the NAc, VTA, or ventral pallidum (VP), dose-dependently reinstated cocaine-seeking behavior. Intra-NAc TFB-TBOA-evoked drug-seeking was long-lasting and NMDA/AMPA receptor dependent. These findings, for the first time, indicate that glutamate in the NAc negatively regulates cocaine's rewarding effects, while an excess of glutamate in multiple brain regions can trigger reinstatement of drug-seeking behavior.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> It is well known that glutamate plays an important role in relapse to drug seeking. However, the role of glutamate in drug reward is less clear. Here, we report that TFB-TBOA, a highly potent glutamate transporter (GLT) inhibitor, dose-dependently elevates extracellular glutamate and inhibits cocaine self-administration and brain-stimulation reward (BSR), when administered locally into the nucleus accumbens (NAc), but not other brain regions. Mechanistic assays indicate that cocaine self-administration upregulates NMDA-GluN2B receptor subtype expression in striatal dopaminoceptive neurons and activation of GluN2B by TFB-TBOA-enhanced glutamate inhibits cocaine self-administration. TFB-TBOA also reinstates cocaine-seeking behavior when administered into the NAc, ventral tegmental area (VTA), and ventral pallidum (VP). These findings demonstrate that glutamate differentially regulates cocaine reward versus relapse, reducing cocaine reward, while potentiating relapse to cocaine seeking.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Neural Encoding of Active Multi-Sensing Enhances Perceptual Decision-Making via a Synergistic Cross-Modal Interaction</a></h4>

              
                <p>Most perceptual decisions rely on the active acquisition of evidence from the environment involving stimulation from multiple senses. However, our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying this process is limited. Crucially, it remains elusive how different sensory representations interact in the formation of perceptual decisions. To answer these questions, we used an active sensing paradigm coupled with neuroimaging, multivariate analysis, and computational modeling to probe how the human brain processes multisensory information to make perceptual judgments. Participants of both sexes actively sensed to discriminate two texture stimuli using visual (V) or haptic (H) information or the two sensory cues together (VH). Crucially, information acquisition was under the participants' control, who could choose where to sample information from and for how long on each trial. To understand the neural underpinnings of this process, we first characterized where and when active sensory experience (movement patterns) is encoded in human brain activity (EEG) in the three sensory conditions. Then, to offer a neurocomputational account of active multisensory decision formation, we used these neural representations of active sensing to inform a drift diffusion model of decision-making behavior. This revealed a multisensory enhancement of the neural representation of active sensing, which led to faster and more accurate multisensory decisions. We then dissected the interactions between the V, H, and VH representations using a novel information-theoretic methodology. Ultimately, we identified a synergistic neural interaction between the two unisensory (V, H) representations over contralateral somatosensory and motor locations that predicted multisensory (VH) decision-making performance.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In real-world settings, perceptual decisions are made during active behaviors, such as crossing the road on a rainy night, and include information from different senses (e.g., car lights, slippery ground). Critically, it remains largely unknown how sensory evidence is combined and translated into perceptual decisions in such active scenarios. Here we address this knowledge gap. First, we show that the simultaneous exploration of information across senses (multi-sensing) enhances the neural encoding of active sensing movements. Second, the neural representation of active sensing modulates the evidence available for decision; and importantly, multi-sensing yields faster evidence accumulation. Finally, we identify a cross-modal interaction in the human brain that correlates with multisensory performance, constituting a putative neural mechanism for forging active multisensory perception.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">A Distinct Metabolically Defined Central Nucleus Circuit Bidirectionally Controls Anxiety-Related Behaviors</a></h4>

              
                <p>Anxiety disorders are debilitating psychiatric diseases that affect ~16% of the world's population. Although it has been proposed that the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) plays a role in anxiety, the molecular and circuit mechanisms through which CeA neurons modulate anxiety-related behaviors are largely uncharacterized. Soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) is a key enzyme in the metabolism of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), and has been shown to play a role in psychiatric disorders. Here, we reported that sEH was enriched in neurons in the CeA and regulated anxiety-related behaviors in adult male mice. Deletion of sEH in CeA neurons but not astrocytes induced anxiety-like behaviors. Mechanistic studies indicated that sEH was required for maintaining the the excitability of sEH positive neurons (sEH<sup>CeA</sup> neurons) in the CeA. Using chemogenetic manipulations, we found that sEH<sup>CeA</sup> neurons bidirectionally regulated anxiety-related behaviors. Notably, we identified that sEH<sup>CeA</sup> neurons directly projected to the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST; sEH<sup>CeA&ndash;BNST</sup>). Optogenetic activation and inhibition of the sEH<sup>CeA&ndash;BNST</sup> pathway produced anxiolytic and anxiogenic effects, respectively. In summary, our studies reveal a set of molecular and circuit mechanisms of sEH<sup>CeA</sup> neurons underlying anxiety.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH), a key enzyme that catalyzes the degradation of EETs, is shown to play a key role in mood disorders. It is well known that sEH is mostly localized in astrocytes in the prefrontal cortex and regulates depressive-like behaviors. Notably, sEH is also expressed in central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) neurons. While the CeA has been studied for its role in the regulation of anxiety, the molecular and circuit mechanism is quite complex. In the present study, we explored a previously unknown cellular and circuitry mechanism that guides sEH<sup>CeA</sup> neurons response to anxiety. Our findings reveal a critical role of sEH in the CeA, sEH<sup>CeA</sup> neurons and CeA-bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) pathway in regulation of anxiety-related behaviors.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Action Potentials Are Critical for the Propagation of Focally Elicited Spreading Depolarizations</a></h4>

              
                <p>Spreading depolarizations (SDs) of gray matter occur in the brain in different pathologic conditions, and cause varying degrees of tissue damage depending on the extent of metabolic burden on the tissue. As might be expected for such large depolarizations, neurons exhibit bursts of action potentials (APs) as the wave propagates. However, the specific role of APs in SD propagation is unclear. This is potentially consequential, since sodium channel modulation has not been considered as a therapeutic target for SD-associated disorders, because of ambiguous experimental evidence. Using whole-cell electrophysiology and single-photon imaging in acute cortical slices from male C57Bl6 mice, we tested the effects of AP blockade on SDs generated by two widely used induction paradigms. We found that AP blockade using tetrodotoxin (TTX) restricted propagation of focally induced SDs, and significantly reduced the amplitude of neuronal depolarization, as well as its Ca<sup>2+</sup> load. TTX also abolished the suppression of spontaneous synaptic activity that is a hallmark of focally induced SD. In contrast, TTX did not affect the propagation of SD induced by global superfusion of high [K<sup>+</sup>]<SUB>e</SUB> containing artificial CSF (ACSF). Thus, we show that voltage-gated sodium channel (Na<SUB>v</SUB>)-mediated neuronal AP bursts are critical for the propagation and downstream effects of focally induced SD but are less important when the ionic balance of the extracellular space is already compromised. In doing so we corroborate the notion that two different SD induction paradigms, each relevant to different clinical situations, vary significantly in their characteristics and potentially their response to treatment.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Our findings suggest that voltage-gated sodium channel (Na<SUB>v</SUB>) channels have a critical role in the propagation and downstream neural effects of focally induced spreading depolarization (SD). As SDs are likely induced focally in many disease conditions, these studies support sodium channel modulation, a previously underappreciated therapeutic option in SD-associated disorders, as a viable approach.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>To better understand complex systems, such as the brain, studying the interactions between multiple brain regions is imperative. Such experiments often require delineation of multiple brain regions on microscopic images based on preexisting brain atlases. Experiments examining the relationships of multiple regions across the brain have traditionally relied on manual plotting of regions. This process is very intensive and becomes untenable with a large number of regions of interest (ROIs). To reduce the amount of time required to process multi-region datasets, several tools for atlas registration have been developed; however, these tools are often inflexible to tissue type, only supportive of a limited number of atlases and orientation, require considerable computational expertise, or are only compatible with certain types of microscopy. To address the need for a simple yet extensible atlas registration tool, we have developed FASTMAP, a Flexible Atlas Segmentation Tool for Multi-Area Processing. We demonstrate its ability to register images efficiently and flexibly to custom mouse brain atlas plates, to detect differences in the regional numbers of labels of interest, and to conduct densitometry analyses. This open-source and user-friendly tool will facilitate the atlas registration of diverse tissue types, unconventional atlas organizations, and a variety of tissue preparations.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Sensorimotor Learning in Response to Errors in Task Performance</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The human sensorimotor system is sensitive to both limb-related prediction errors and task-related performance errors. Prediction error signals are believed to drive implicit refinements to motor plans. However, an understanding of the mechanisms that performance errors stimulate has remained unclear largely because their effects have not been probed in isolation from prediction errors. Diverging from past work, we induced performance errors independent of prediction errors by shifting the location of a reach target but keeping the intended and actual kinematic consequences of the motion matched. Our first two experiments revealed that rather than implicit learning, motor adjustments in response to performance errors reflect the use of deliberative, volitional strategies. Our third experiment revealed a potential dissociation of performance-error-driven strategies based on error size. Specifically, behavioral changes following large errors were consistent with goal-directed or model-based control, known to be supported by connections between prefrontal cortex and associative striatum. In contrast, motor changes following smaller performance errors carried signatures of model-free stimulus-response learning, of the kind underpinned by pathways between motor cortical areas and sensorimotor striatum. Across all experiments, we also found remarkably faster re-learning, advocating that such "savings" is associated with retrieval of previously learned strategic error compensation and may not require a history of exposure to limb-related errors.</p>

                Thermal injuries in young children involving the buttocks, perineum, and lower limbs raise suspicion of child abuse. Determining the manner of death and ruling out homicide in a fatal case of scalding remains a challenge for forensic practitioners. In the present article, the medicolegal evaluation in a case of fatal scald injury involving a two-year-old child from rural Nepal is discussed. Young children sustaining serious injuries from scalds is a grave social concern. Such young lives need to be protected from scald injuries whether accidental or purposeful. Differences in injury patterns on the basis of their distribution and their characteristics are important to determine the manner of death in such cases.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A roadmap for the generation of benchmarking resources for antimicrobial resistance detection using next generation sequencing [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Next Generation Sequencing technologies significantly impact the field of Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) detection and monitoring, with immediate uses in diagnosis and risk assessment. For this application and in general, considerable challenges remain in demonstrating sufficient trust to act upon the meaningful information produced from raw data, partly because of the reliance on bioinformatics pipelines, which can produce different results and therefore lead to different interpretations. With the constant evolution of the field, it is difficult to identify, harmonise and recommend specific methods for large-scale implementations over time. In this article, we propose to address this challenge through establishing a transparent, performance-based, evaluation approach to provide flexibility in the bioinformatics tools of choice, while demonstrating proficiency in meeting common performance standards. The approach is two-fold: first, a community-driven effort to establish and maintain “live” (dynamic) benchmarking platforms to provide relevant performance metrics, based on different use-cases, that would evolve together with the AMR field; second, agreed and defined datasets to allow the pipelines’ implementation, validation, and quality-control over time. Following previous discussions on the main challenges linked to this approach, we provide concrete recommendations and future steps, related to different aspects of the design of benchmarks, such as the selection and the characteristics of the datasets (quality, choice of pathogens and resistances, etc.), the evaluation criteria of the pipelines, and the way these resources should be deployed in the community.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Acceleration of wound healing by topical application of gel formulation of Barringtonia racemosa (L.) Spreng kernel extract [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Phytomedicines are gaining a spotlight in wound management, where much research has suggested the wound healing potential of Barringtonia racemosa. The objective of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of B. racemosa kernel extract in accelerating wound healing process in animal models. Methods: B. racemosa kernel was extracted using ethanol:water (7:3) solvent and was then used as a bioactive ingredient in a Carbopol 940-based gel formulation in four different concentrations (1, 3, 5 and 7 ppm). A 3 cm diameter wound was made in the dorsal area of Rattus norvegicus rat and wound healing process was assessed up to 12 days using DESIGN (Depth, Exudate, Size of Inflammation/Infection, Granulation tissue, and Necrotic tissue) scoring system. Results: Our data suggested that the DESIGN scores were significantly different among concentration groups after the 3rdday onward suggesting B. racemosa extract accelerated the wound healing process. Rats treated with gel formulation containing 7 ppm of B. racemosa kernel extract had faster wound healing than that treated with topical Metcovazin. On day 6, macroscopic observation on 7 ppm group revealed that the wound had persistent redness, lesion area of < 3 cm2, and 80% healthy granulation, where presence of exudate and redness were not observable. Conclusion: B. racemosa kernel extract was effective in accelerating wound healing on rats. Further study is warranted to purify the bioactive component and the action mechanism in wound healing process.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Corneal laser procedure for vision improvement in patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration and other retinal disorders involving central vision loss: a retrospective cohort study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The purposes of this pilot retrospective observational cohort study are to determine: 1) the safety and efficacy of corneal photovitrification (CPV), a corneal laser procedure, for vision improvement in patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) and other retinal disorders involving central vision loss, and 2) the correlation between post-treatment (post-treatment (Tx)) best-corrected distance visual acuity (BCDVA) and pre-Tx potential visual acuity (PVA). Methods: BCDVA measurements using ETDRS charts and PVA measurements using Gonzalez-Markowitz PVA charts were analyzed for 72 eyes that received a single CPV treatment.   Results: Safety - No clinically significant complications or serious adverse events occurred. Efficacy – Mean BCDVA improved significantly from 20/303 (1.18 log of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR), 26 letters) at pre-Tx to 20/208 (1.02 logMAR, 34 letters) at 1m post-Tx (p = 0.000001) for a cohort of 57 eyes, improving to 20/198 (1.00 logMAR, 35 letters; 11.6 mean letters gained) at 12m (p = 0.0009) for a cohort of 29 eyes. Mean pre-Tx PVA gains correlated well with mean BCDVA improvements at 1m, 3m, 6m and 12m post-Tx. Conclusions: Subject to a small sample size, the CPV corneal laser procedure is safe and efficacious for vision improvement in patients with nAMD and other retinal disorders involving central vision loss. The pre-Tx PVA correlates well with post-Tx BCDVA; the PVA test may be useful for screening of candidate eyes for CPV treatment and for managing expectations.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Simulation atomic force microscopy for atomic reconstruction of biomolecular structures from resolution-limited experimental images</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Romain Amyot, Arin Marchesi, Clemens M. Franz, Ignacio Casuso, Holger Flechsig</p>

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) can visualize the dynamics of single biomolecules under near-physiological conditions. However, the scanning tip probes only the molecular surface with limited resolution, missing details required to fully deduce functional mechanisms from imaging alone. To overcome such drawbacks, we developed a computational framework to reconstruct 3D atomistic structures from AFM surface scans, employing simulation AFM and automatized fitting to experimental images. We provide applications to AFM images ranging from single molecular machines, protein filaments, to large-scale assemblies of 2D protein lattices, and demonstrate how the obtained full atomistic information advances the molecular understanding beyond the original topographic AFM image. We show that simulation AFM further allows for quantitative molecular feature assignment within measured AFM topographies. Implementation of the developed methods into the versatile interactive interface of the BioAFMviewer software, freely available at www.bioafmviewer.com, presents the opportunity for the broad Bio-AFM community to employ the enormous amount of existing structural and modeling data to facilitate the interpretation of resolution-limited AFM images.

The most common kind of cancer among women is breast cancer. Understanding the tumor microenvironment and the interactions between individual cells and cytokines assists us in arriving at more effective treatments. Here, we develop a data-driven mathematical model to investigate the dynamics of key cell types and cytokines involved in breast cancer development. We use time-course gene expression profiles of a mouse model to estimate the relative abundance of cells and cytokines. We then employ a least-squares optimization method to evaluate the model’s parameters based on the mice data. The resulting dynamics of the cells and cytokines obtained from the optimal set of parameters exhibit a decent agreement between the data and predictions. We perform a sensitivity analysis to identify the crucial parameters of the model and then perform a local bifurcation on them. The results reveal a strong connection between adipocytes, IL6, and the cancer population, suggesting them as potential targets for therapies.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">SavvyCNV: Genome-wide CNV calling from off-target reads</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Thomas W. Laver, Elisa De Franco, Matthew B. Johnson, Kashyap A. Patel, Sian Ellard, Michael N. Weedon, Sarah E. Flanagan, Matthew N. Wakeling</p>

Identifying copy number variants (CNVs) can provide diagnoses to patients and provide important biological insights into human health and disease. Current exome and targeted sequencing approaches cannot detect clinically and biologically-relevant CNVs outside their target area. We present SavvyCNV, a tool which uses off-target read data from exome and targeted sequencing data to call germline CNVs genome-wide. Up to 70% of sequencing reads from exome and targeted sequencing fall outside the targeted regions. We have developed a new tool, SavvyCNV, to exploit this ‘free data’ to call CNVs across the genome. We benchmarked SavvyCNV against five state-of-the-art CNV callers using truth sets generated from genome sequencing data and Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification assays. SavvyCNV called CNVs with high precision and recall, outperforming the five other tools at calling CNVs genome-wide, using off-target or on-target reads from targeted panel and exome sequencing. We then applied SavvyCNV to clinical samples sequenced using a targeted panel and were able to call previously undetected clinically-relevant CNVs, highlighting the utility of this tool within the diagnostic setting. SavvyCNV outperforms existing tools for calling CNVs from off-target reads. It can call CNVs genome-wide from targeted panel and exome data, increasing the utility and diagnostic yield of these tests. SavvyCNV is freely available at https://github.com/rdemolgen/SavvySuite.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">RosettaSurf—A surface-centric computational design approach</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Andreas Scheck, Stéphane Rosset, Michaël Defferrard, Andreas Loukas, Jaume Bonet, Pierre Vandergheynst, Bruno E. Correia</p>

Proteins are typically represented by discrete atomic coordinates providing an accessible framework to describe different conformations. However, in some fields proteins are more accurately represented as near-continuous surfaces, as these are imprinted with geometric (shape) and chemical (electrostatics) features of the underlying protein structure. Protein surfaces are dependent on their chemical composition and, ultimately determine protein function, acting as the interface that engages in interactions with other molecules. In the past, such representations were utilized to compare protein structures on global and local scales and have shed light on functional properties of proteins. Here we describe RosettaSurf, a surface-centric computational design protocol, that focuses on the molecular surface shape and electrostatic properties as means for protein engineering, offering a unique approach for the design of proteins and their functions. The RosettaSurf protocol combines the explicit optimization of molecular surface features with a global scoring function during the sequence design process, diverging from the typical design approaches that rely solely on an energy scoring function. With this computational approach, we attempt to address a fundamental problem in protein design related to the design of functional sites in proteins, even when structurally similar templates are absent in the characterized structural repertoire. Surface-centric design exploits the premise that molecular surfaces are, to a certain extent, independent of the underlying sequence and backbone configuration, meaning that different sequences in different proteins may present similar surfaces. We benchmarked RosettaSurf on various sequence recovery datasets and showcased its design capabilities by generating epitope mimics that were biochemically validated. Overall, our results indicate that the explicit optimization of surface features may lead to new routes for the design of functional proteins.

                Background: Several systemic diseases manifest themselves in the oral cavity. Dentists who are unaware of these lesions will possibly miss them. This cross-sectional study aimed to assess the prevalence of oral manifestations in patients with LE in a sample of the Egyptian population. Methods: A descriptive study was performed on 189 patients attending the Internal Medicine Department, Rheumatology Clinic in EL Qasr EL Ainy Hospital, Cairo University. Every patient was examined clinically after completing a questionnaire. Moreover, patients’ medical records were also evaluated.  The oral manifestations were recorded according to the WHO guide to physical examination of the oral cavity and classified according to their morphologic aspects and localization. Results: Out of 189 patients, there were 182 females (96.3%) and seven males (3.7%). The prevalence of oral lesions in SLE patients was 55.6%. The most affected site was the tongue 25.7%. The most common clinical aspect was patches, 53%. About 77.1% of the lesions were asymptomatic.  Conclusions: The present study emphasizes the importance of early diagnosis of oral lesions to recognize patients with SLE as the WHO considers oral manifestations of SLE a widespread state. Also, implementation of oral hygiene measures and treatment to improve patients’ nutritional state and health-related quality of life are recommended.

                Pancreatic cancer is a highly lethal malignancy with symptoms such as abdominal pain, back pain, loss of appetite, bloating, weight loss, jaundice, nausea, vomiting, etc. It has a relatively late presentation, which makes its only potentially curative treatment, surgical resection, impractical for most patients. However, the prognosis is poor despite complete resection. The occurrence of depression and anxiety is rather common in patients with pancreatic cancer and a biological basis for this is suspected, although not studied in detail. We herein report a case of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma in a 57-year-old man who suffered from abdominal pain, constipation, and significant weight loss. The computerized tomography (CT) scan and successive endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) guided biopsy with histopathology confirmed a mass arising from the mid-body of the pancreas with tubular and cystic glands lined by moderately pleomorphic columnar epithelial cells. The patient underwent chemotherapy with the FOLFIRINOX regimen. He eventually developed severe depression with psychotic symptoms and catatonia, which further exacerbated the challenges in the management of the malignancy. In spite of widely available therapeutic options for the management of depression described in the literature, the effectiveness of those in pancreatic cancer patients with concomitant depression is not well established. Hence, more studies are imperative in addressing the neuropsychiatric associations of pancreatic cancer and formulating a protocol for their apt management.

<p>In 122 patients with a first demyelinating event associations between 1.) spinal versus (vs) non-spinal clinical syndrome 2.) spinal vs cerebral T2-weighted (T2w) and 3.) contrast-enhancing (CE) lesion counts with IgG<sub>IF</sub>
<sup>+</sup> (vs IgG<sub>IF</sub>
<sup>−</sup>) or IgM<sub>IF</sub>
<sup>+</sup> (vs IgM<sub>IF</sub>
<sup>−</sup>) were investigated by logistic regression adjusted for age and sex, respectively. For serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL) analysis patients were categorized for presence or absence of oligoclonal IgG bands (OCGB), IgG<sub>IF</sub> and IgM<sub>IF</sub> (&gt;0% vs 0%, respectively): 1) OCGB<sup>−</sup>/IgG<sub>IF</sub>
<sup>−</sup>/IgM<sub>IF</sub>
<sup>−</sup>; 2) OCGB<sup>+</sup>/IgG<sub>IF</sub>
<sup>−</sup>/IgM<sub>IF</sub>
<sup>−</sup>; 3) OCGB<sup>+</sup>/IgG<sub>IF</sub>
<sup>+</sup>/IgM<sub>IF</sub>
<sup>−</sup>; and 4) OCGB<sup>+</sup>/IgG<sub>IF</sub>
<sup>+</sup>/IgM<sub>IF</sub>
<sup>+</sup>. Associations between categories 2) to 4) vs category 1 with sNfL concentrations were analyzed by robust linear regression, adjusted for sex and MRI parameters.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Patients with a spinal syndrome had a 8.36-fold higher odds of IgM<sub>IF</sub>
<sup>+</sup> (95%CI 3.03–23.03; p &lt;0.01). Each spinal T2w lesion (odds Ratio 1.39; 1.02–1.90; p = 0.037) and CE lesion (OR 2.73; 1.22–6.09; p = 0.014) was associated with an increased risk of IgM<sub>IF</sub>
<sup>+</sup> (but not of IgG<sub>IF</sub>
<sup>+</sup>); this was not the case for cerebral lesions. OCGB<sup>+</sup>/IgG<sub>IF</sub>
<sup>+</sup>/IgM<sub>IF</sub>
<sup>+</sup> category patients showed highest sNfL levels (estimate:1.80; 0.55–3.06; p &lt;0.01).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Intrathecal IgM synthesis is strongly associated with spinal manifestation and independently more pronounced neuroaxonal injury in early MS, suggesting a distinct clinical phenotype and pathophysiology.</p>

<p>Astrocyte calcium signaling in individual dentate gyrus astrocytes increases with Aß pathology and age. Increased calcium signaling in individual dentate gyrus astrocytes does not affect astrocyte network activity.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Astrocytes are critical for healthy brain function. In Alzheimer’s disease, astrocytes become reactive, which affects their signaling properties. Here, we measured spontaneous calcium transients <i>ex vivo</i> in hippocampal astrocytes in brain slices containing the dentate gyrus of 6- (6M) and 9-month-old (9M) APPswe/PSEN1dE9 (APP/PS1) mice. We investigated the frequency and duration of calcium transients in relation to aging, amyloid-β (Aβ) pathology, and the proximity of the astrocyte to Aβ plaques. The 6M APP/PS1 astrocytes showed no change in spontaneous calcium-transient properties compared to wild-type (WT) astrocytes. 9M APP/PS1 astrocytes, however, showed more hyperactivity compared to WT, characterized by increased spontaneous calcium transients that were longer in duration. Our data also revealed an effect of aging, as 9M astrocytes overall showed an increase in calcium activity compared to 6M astrocytes. Subsequent calcium-wave analysis showed an increase in sequential calcium transients (i.e., calcium waves) in 9M astrocytes, suggesting increased network activity <i>ex vivo</i>. Further analysis using null models revealed that this network effect is caused by chance, due to the increased number of spontaneous transients. Our findings show that alterations in calcium signaling in individual hippocampal astrocytes of APP/PS1 mice are subject to both aging and Aβ pathology but these do not lead to a change in astrocyte network activity. These alterations in calcium dynamics of astrocytes may help to understand changes in neuronal physiology leading to cognitive decline and ultimately dementia.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Concomitant exploration of structural, functional, and neurochemical brain mechanisms underlying age-related cognitive decline is crucial in promoting healthy aging. Here, we present the DopamiNe, Age, connectoMe, and Cognition (DyNAMiC) project, a multimodal, prospective 5-year longitudinal study spanning the adult human lifespan. DyNAMiC examines age-related changes in the brain’s structural and functional connectome in relation to changes in dopamine D1 receptor availability (D1DR), and their associations to cognitive decline. Critically, due to the complete lack of longitudinal D1DR data, the true trajectory of one of the most age-sensitive dopamine systems remains unknown. The first DyNAMiC wave included 180 healthy participants (20–80 years). Brain imaging included magnetic resonance imaging assessing brain structure (white matter, gray matter, iron), perfusion, and function (during rest and task), and positron emission tomography (PET) with the [<sup>11</sup>C]SCH23390 radioligand. A subsample (<i>n</i> = 20, &gt;65 years) was additionally scanned with [<sup>11</sup>C]raclopride PET measuring D2DR. Age-related variation was evident for multiple modalities, such as D1DR; D2DR, and performance across the domains of episodic memory, working memory, and perceptual speed. Initial analyses demonstrated an inverted u-shaped association between D1DR and resting-state functional connectivity across cortical network nodes, such that regions with intermediate D1DR levels showed the highest levels of nodal strength. Evident within each age group, this is the first observation of such an association across the adult lifespan, suggesting that emergent functional architecture depends on underlying D1DR systems. Taken together, DyNAMiC is the largest D1DR study worldwide, and will enable a comprehensive examination of brain mechanisms underlying age-related cognitive decline.</p>

<p>Regulation of ferroptosis is expected to be a new direction for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. And organelles play a role in different cellular interactions with ferroptosis. Targeting organelle metabolic pathways and redox responses may be an effective strategy for disease treatment.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Alzheimerʼs disease (AD), an age-related neurodegenerative disease, is a striking global health problem. Ferroptosis is a newly discovered form of cell death characterized by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation products and the accumulation of lethal reactive oxygen species. Strict regulation of iron metabolism is essential to ensure neuronal homeostasis. Excess and deficiency of iron are both associated with neurodegeneration. Studies have shown that oxidative stress caused by cerebral iron metabolism disorders in the body is involved in the process of AD, ferroptosis may play an important role in the pathogenesis of AD, and regulating ferroptosis is expected to be a new direction for the treatment of AD. Various organelles are closely related to ferroptosis: mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and lysosome are involved in the regulation of ferroptosis from the aspects of iron metabolism and redox imbalance. In this review, the relationship between AD and the dysfunction of organelles (including mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, lysosome, and Golgi apparatus) and the role of organelles in ferroptosis of AD were reviewed to provide insights for understanding the relationship between organelles and ferroptosis in AD and the treatment of AD.</p>

     alt="The role of sex in the association between cannabis use and working memory-related brain activity"/>
<p>Compared to controls, cannabis users show a relatively larger decrease in performance with increasing working memory (WM) load and a relatively smaller reduction in WM related activity in the precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex at higher WM load. No sex differences emerged generally or in cannabis users in WM and WM load related activity or performance.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Although cannabis use patterns differ between men and women, studies on sex differences on the effects of cannabis on the brain and cognitive control are largely lacking. Working memory (WM) is a component of cognitive control believed to be involved in the development and maintenance of addiction. In this study, we evaluated the association between cannabis use and WM (load) related brain activity in a large sample, enabling us to assess sex effects in this association. The brain activity of 104 frequent cannabis users (63% men) and 85 controls (53% men) was recorded during an N-back WM task. Behavioral results showed a significant interaction between WM load and group for both accuracy and reaction time, with cannabis users showing a relatively larger decrease in performance with increasing WM load. Cannabis users compared to controls showed a relatively smaller reduction in WM (load) related activity in the precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex at higher WM load. This WM (load) related activity was not associated with performance nor cannabis use and related problems. An exploratory analysis showed higher WM-related activity in the superior frontal gyrus in men compared to women. While cannabis users showed higher WM (load) related activity in central nodes of the default mode network, this was not directly attributable to group specific worsening of performance under higher cognitive load. Further research is necessary to assess whether observed group differences increase with higher cognitive load, how group differences relate to measures of cannabis use, and how sex affects these group differences.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Recent clinical studies, in both children/adolescents and adults, have shown the extreme neuropsychological heterogeneity of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD): specific neuropsychological deficits have been found only in a minority of individuals, with no direct correlation between discrete cognitive performances and the trajectory of clinical symptoms. Deficits in specific neuropsychological functions may be common in ADHD, but nevertheless no cognitive or neuropsychological profile may fully explain the disorder. Sex differences in the ADHD presentation, both at a neuropsychological and clinical level, also contribute to this clinical and neuropsychological heterogeneity. At a neuropsychological level, females with ADHD may show greater working memory problems, poorer vocabulary skills and worse visual spatial reasoning. Structural and functional imaging study also show discrete differences across sex; however, the great majority of clinical studies mainly or exclusively include male participants with insufficient data to draw firm conclusions on sex differences within the disorder. Here, we report the recent literature data, discussing still open research questions about the clinical presentation, neuroimaging findings, and neuropsychological functioning in ADHD with a focus on the impact of sex differences—a deeper insight in these unresolved issues may have relevant clinical and therapeutic implications for tailored, effective, and long-lasting interventions.</p>

<p>We investigated fiber distribution patterns of corticospinal neurons within the cortical area projecting to the lumbar cord gray matter of mice. The lumbar-cord-projecting area fundamentally innervates the gray matter in the same way as the cervical-cord-projecting area does.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Although corticospinal neurons are known to be distributed in both the primary motor and somatosensory cortices (S1), details of the projection pattern of their fibers to the lumbar cord gray matter remain largely uncharacterized, especially in rodents. We previously investigated the cortical area projecting to the gray matter of the fourth lumbar cord segment (L4) (L4 Cx) in mice. In the present study, we injected an anterograde tracer into multiple sites to cover the entire L4 Cx. We found that (1) the rostromedial part of the L4 Cx projects to the intermediate and ventral zones of the lumbar cord gray matter, (2) the lateral part projects to the medial dorsal horn, and (3) the caudal part projects to the lateral dorsal horn. We also found that the border between the rostromedial and caudolateral parts corresponds to the border between the agranular and granular cortex. Analysis of the somatotopic patterns formed by the cortical projection cells and the primary sensory neurons innervating the skin of the hindlimb and its related area suggests that the lateral part corresponds to the S1 hindlimb area and the caudal part to the S1 trunk area. Examination of thalamic innervation by the L4 Cx revealed that the caudolateral L4 Cx focally projects to the ventrobasal complex (VB) and the posterior complex (PO), while the medial L4 Cx widely projects to the PO but little to the VB. These findings suggest that the L4 Cx is parceled into subregions defined by the cytoarchitecture and subcortical projection.</p>

                In this issue of Neuron, Yu et al. (2022) uncovered a sensory pathway by which social touch can activate oxytocin neurons in the hypothalamus. Their stimulation protocol could deliver pleasant sensory stimuli to juvenile mice, increasing their later-life social interactions.
