              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17274">Practitioner forecasts of technological progress in biostasis</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.17274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biostasis has the potential to extend human lives by offering a bridge to powerful life extension technologies that may be developed in the future. However, key questions in the field remain unresolved, including which biomarkers reliably indicate successful preservation, what technical obstacles pose the greatest barriers, and whether different proposed revival methods are theoretically feasible. To address these gaps, we conducted a collaborative forecasting exercise with 22 practitioners in biostasis, including individuals with expertise in neuroscience, cryobiology, and clinical care. Our results reveal substantial consensus in some areas, for example that synaptic connectivity can serve as a reliable surrogate biomarker for information preservation quality. Practitioners identified three most likely failure modes in contemporary biostasis: inadequate preservation quality even under ideal conditions, geographic barriers preventing timely preservation, and poor procedural execution. Regarding revival strategies, most respondents believe that provably reversible cryopreservation of whole mammalian organisms is most likely decades away, with provably reversible human cryopreservation expected even later, if it is ever achieved. Among revival strategies from contemporary preservation methods, whole brain emulation was considered the most likely to be developed first, though respondents were divided on the metaphysical question of whether it could constitute genuine revival. Molecular nanotechnology was viewed as nearly as likely to be technically feasible, and compatible with both pure cryopreservation and aldehyde-based methods. Taken together, these findings delineate current barriers to high-quality preservation, identify future research priorities, and provide baseline estimates for key areas of uncertainty.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17405">Automatic Blink-based Bad EEG channels Detection for BCI Applications</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.17405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) applications, noise presents a persistent challenge, often compromising the quality of EEG signals essential for accurate data interpretation. This paper focuses on optimizing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to improve BCI performance, with channel selection being a key method for achieving this enhancement. The Eye-BCI multimodal dataset is used to address the issue of detecting and eliminating faulty EEG channels caused by non-biological artifacts, such as malfunctioning electrodes and power line interference. The core of this research is the automatic detection of problematic channels through the Adaptive Blink-Correction and De-Drifting (ABCD) algorithm. This method utilizes blink propagation patterns to identify channels affected by artifacts or malfunctions. Additionally, segmented SNR topographies and source localization plots are employed to illustrate the impact of channel removal by comparing Left and Right hand grasp Motor Imagery (MI). Classification accuracy further supports the value of the ABCD algorithm, reaching an average classification accuracy of 93.81% [74.81%; 98.76%] (confidence interval at 95% confidence level) across 31 subjects (63 sessions), significantly surpassing traditional methods such as Independent Component Analysis (ICA) (79.29% [57.41%; 92.89%]) and Artifact Subspace Reconstruction (ASR) (84.05% [62.88%; 95.31%]). These results underscore the critical role of channel selection and the potential of using blink patterns for detecting bad EEG channels, offering valuable insights for improving real-time or offline BCI systems by reducing noise and enhancing signal quality.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17224">HuiduRep: A Robust Self-Supervised Framework for Learning Neural Representations from Extracellular Spikes</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.17224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extracellular recordings are brief voltage fluctuations recorded near neurons, widely used in neuroscience as the basis for decoding brain activity at single-neuron resolution. Spike sorting, which assigns each spike to its source neuron, is a critical step in brain sensing pipelines. However, it remains challenging under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), electrode drift, and cross-session variability. In this paper, we propose HuiduRep, a robust self-supervised representation learning framework that extracts discriminative and generalizable features from extracellular spike waveforms. By combining contrastive learning with a denoising autoencoder, HuiduRep learns latent representations that are robust to noise and drift. Built on HuiduRep, we develop a spike sorting pipeline that clusters spike representations without supervision. Experiments on hybrid and real-world datasets demonstrate that HuiduRep achieves strong robustness and the pipeline matches or outperforms state-of-the-art tools such as KiloSort4 and MountainSort5. These findings demonstrate the potential of self-supervised spike representation learning as a foundational tool for robust and generalizable processing of extracellular recordings.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17242">High-Density EEG Enables the Fastest Visual Brain-Computer Interfaces</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.17242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brain-computer interface (BCI) technology establishes a direct communication pathway between the brain and external devices. Current visual BCI systems suffer from insufficient information transfer rates (ITRs) for practical use. Spatial information, a critical component of visual perception, remains underexploited in existing systems because the limited spatial resolution of recording methods hinders the capture of the rich spatiotemporal dynamics of brain signals. This study proposed a frequency-phase-space fusion encoding method, integrated with 256-channel high-density electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings, to develop high-speed BCI systems. In the classical frequency-phase encoding 40-target BCI paradigm, the 256-66, 128-32, and 64-21 electrode configurations brought theoretical ITR increases of 83.66%, 79.99%, and 55.50% over the traditional 64-9 setup. In the proposed frequency-phase-space encoding 200-target BCI paradigm, these increases climbed to 195.56%, 153.08%, and 103.07%. The online BCI system achieved an average actual ITR of 472.7 bpm. This study demonstrates the essential role and immense potential of high-density EEG in decoding the spatiotemporal information of visual stimuli.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15225">From DDMs to DNNs: Using process data and models of decision-making to improve human-AI interactions</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2308.15225v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the past decades, cognitive neuroscientists and behavioral economists have recognized the value of describing the process of decision making in detail and modeling the emergence of decisions over time. For example, the time it takes to decide can reveal more about an agent's true hidden preferences than only the decision itself. Similarly, data that track the ongoing decision process such as eye movements or neural recordings contain critical information that can be exploited, even if no decision is made. Here, we argue that artificial intelligence (AI) research would benefit from a stronger focus on insights about how decisions emerge over time and incorporate related process data to improve AI predictions in general and human-AI interactions in particular. First, we introduce a highly established computational framework that assumes decisions to emerge from the noisy accumulation of evidence, and we present related empirical work in psychology, neuroscience, and economics. Next, we discuss to what extent current approaches in multi-agent AI do or do not incorporate process data and models of decision making. Finally, we outline how a more principled inclusion of the evidence-accumulation framework into the training and use of AI can help to improve human-AI interactions in the future.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10094">Theory of enhanced-by-coincidence neural information transmission</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.10094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The activity of neurons within brain circuits has been ubiquitously reported to be correlated. The impact of these correlations on brain function has been extensively investigated. Correlations can in principle increase or decrease the information that neural populations carry about sensory stimuli, but experiments in cortical areas have mostly reported information-limiting correlations, which decrease the information encoded in the population. However, a second stream of evidence suggests that temporal correlations between the spiking activity of different neurons may increase the impact of neural activity downstream, implying that temporal correlations affect both the encoding of information and its downstream readout. The principle of how encoding and readout combine are still unclear. Here, we consider a model of transmission of stimulus information encoded in pre-synaptic input spike trains with information-limiting time-correlations to the output firing of a post-synaptic biologicaly-plausible leaky integrate and fire (LIF) readout neuron. We derive an analytical solution of the model in the diffusion approximation, in which the encoding spiking activity is treated as a continuous-time stochastic variable. An ansatz based on a separation of timescales allows us compute the stimulus information transmitted to the readout over a broad range of parameters. Our analytical results reveal that, for sufficiently low input firing rates, large enough difference in input stimulus-specific activity, and moderately large input temporal correlations, the stimulus discriminability of the firing of the LIF readout neuron can be enhanced by the presence of input time correlations, despite they decrease the stimulus information encoded in its inputs.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16937">Fractional Spike Differential Equations Neural Network with Efficient Adjoint Parameters Training</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2507.16937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) draw inspiration from biological neurons to create realistic models for brain-like computation, demonstrating effectiveness in processing temporal information with energy efficiency and biological realism. Most existing SNNs assume a single time constant for neuronal membrane voltage dynamics, modeled by first-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with Markovian characteristics. Consequently, the voltage state at any time depends solely on its immediate past value, potentially limiting network expressiveness. Real neurons, however, exhibit complex dynamics influenced by long-term correlations and fractal dendritic structures, suggesting non-Markovian behavior. Motivated by this, we propose the Fractional SPIKE Differential Equation neural network (fspikeDE), which captures long-term dependencies in membrane voltage and spike trains through fractional-order dynamics. These fractional dynamics enable more expressive temporal patterns beyond the capability of integer-order models. For efficient training of fspikeDE, we introduce a gradient descent algorithm that optimizes parameters by solving an augmented fractional-order ODE (FDE) backward in time using adjoint sensitivity methods. Extensive experiments on diverse image and graph datasets demonstrate that fspikeDE consistently outperforms traditional SNNs, achieving superior accuracy, comparable energy efficiency, reduced training memory usage, and enhanced robustness against noise. Our approach provides a novel open-sourced computational toolbox for fractional-order SNNs, widely applicable to various real-world tasks.

Abstract: This research introduces an extended application of neural networks for solving nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). A neural network, combined with a pseudo-arclength continuation, is proposed to construct bifurcation diagrams from parameterized nonlinear PDEs. Additionally, a neural network approach is also presented for solving eigenvalue problems to analyze solution linear stability, focusing on identifying the largest eigenvalue. The effectiveness of the proposed neural network is examined through experiments on the Bratu equation and the Burgers equation. Results from a finite difference method are also presented as comparison. Varying numbers of grid points are employed in each case to assess the behavior and accuracy of both the neural network and the finite difference method. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed neural network produces better solutions, generates more accurate bifurcation diagrams, has reasonable computational times, and proves effective for linear stability analysis.

                arXiv:2507.16851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Crack detection is an important task in computer vision. Despite impressive in-dataset performance, deep learning-based methods still struggle in generalizing to unseen domains. The thin structure property of cracks is usually overlooked by previous methods. In this work, we introduce CrackCue, a novel method for robust crack detection based on coarse-to-fine crack cue generation. The core concept lies on leveraging the thin structure property to generate a robust crack cue, guiding the crack detection. Specifically, we first employ a simple max-pooling and upsampling operation on the crack image. This results in a coarse crack-free background, based on which a fine crack-free background can be obtained via a reconstruction network. The difference between the original image and fine crack-free background provides a fine crack cue. This fine cue embeds robust crack prior information which is unaffected by complex backgrounds, shadow, and varied lighting. As a plug-and-play method, we incorporate the proposed CrackCue into three advanced crack detection networks. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CrackCue significantly improves the generalization ability and robustness of the baseline methods. The source code will be publicly available.

                arXiv:2503.15986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) based on Transformers have garnered significant attention due to their superior performance and high energy efficiency. However, the spiking attention modules of most existing Transformer-based SNNs are adapted from those of analog Transformers, failing to fully address the issue of over-allocating attention to irrelevant contexts. To fix this fundamental yet overlooked issue, we propose a Lateral Inhibition-inspired Spiking Transformer (SpiLiFormer). It emulates the brain's lateral inhibition mechanism, guiding the model to enhance attention to relevant tokens while suppressing attention to irrelevant ones. Our model achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across multiple datasets, including CIFAR-10 (+0.45%), CIFAR-100 (+0.48%), CIFAR10-DVS (+2.70%), N-Caltech101 (+1.94%), and ImageNet-1K (+1.6%). Notably, on the ImageNet-1K dataset, SpiLiFormer (69.9M parameters, 4 time steps, 384 resolution) outperforms E-SpikeFormer (173.0M parameters, 8 time steps, 384 resolution), a SOTA spiking Transformer, by 0.46% using only 39% of the parameters and half the time steps. The code and model checkpoints are publicly available at https://github.com/KirinZheng/SpiLiFormer.

                arXiv:2507.07284v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the demand for compute power in traditional neural networks has increased significantly, spiking neural networks (SNNs) have emerged as a potential solution to increasingly power-hungry neural networks. By operating on 0/1 spikes emitted by neurons instead of arithmetic multiply-and-accumulate operations, SNNs propagate information temporally and spatially, allowing for more efficient compute power. To this end, many architectures for accelerating and simulating SNNs have been developed, including Loihi, TrueNorth, and SpiNNaker. However, these chips are largely inaccessible to the wider community. Field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) have been explored to serve as a middle ground between neuromorphic and non-neuromorphic hardware, but many proposed architectures require expensive high-end FPGAs or target a single SNN topology. This paper presents a framework consisting of a robust SNN acceleration architecture and a Pytorch-based SNN model compiler. Targeting any-to-any and/or fully connected SNNs, the FPGA architecture features a synaptic array that tiles across the SNN to propagate spikes. The architecture targets low-end FPGAs and requires very little (6358 LUT, 40.5 BRAM) resources. The framework, tested on a low-end Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA at 100 MHz, achieves competitive speed in recognizing MNIST digits (0.52 ms/img). Further experiments also show accurate simulation of hand coded any-to-any spiking neural networks on toy problems.

                arXiv:2507.14270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose the APTx Neuron, a novel, unified neural computation unit that integrates non-linear activation and linear transformation into a single trainable expression. The APTx Neuron is derived from the APTx activation function, thereby eliminating the need for separate activation layers and making the architecture both computationally efficient and elegant. The proposed neuron follows the functional form $y = \sum_{i=1}^{n} ((\alpha_i + \tanh(\beta_i x_i)) \cdot \gamma_i x_i) + \delta$, where all parameters $\alpha_i$, $\beta_i$, $\gamma_i$, and $\delta$ are trainable. We validate our APTx Neuron-based architecture on the MNIST dataset, achieving up to 96.69% test accuracy in just 20 epochs using approximately 332K trainable parameters. The results highlight the superior expressiveness and computational efficiency of the APTx Neuron compared to traditional neurons, pointing toward a new paradigm in unified neuron design and the architectures built upon it.

                arXiv:2506.00178v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Prompt engineering represents a critical bottleneck to harness the full potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) for solving complex tasks, as it requires specialized expertise, significant trial-and-error, and manual intervention. This challenge is particularly pronounced for tasks involving subjective quality assessment, where defining explicit optimization objectives becomes fundamentally problematic. Existing automated prompt optimization methods falter in these scenarios, as they typically require well-defined task-specific numerical fitness functions or rely on generic templates that cannot capture the nuanced requirements of complex use cases. We introduce DEEVO (DEbate-driven EVOlutionary prompt optimization), a novel framework that guides prompt evolution through a debate-driven evaluation with an Elo-based selection. Contrary to prior work, DEEVOs approach enables exploration of the discrete prompt space while preserving semantic coherence through intelligent crossover and strategic mutation operations that incorporate debate-based feedback, combining elements from both successful and unsuccessful prompts based on identified strengths rather than arbitrary splicing. Using Elo ratings as a fitness proxy, DEEVO simultaneously drives improvement and preserves valuable diversity in the prompt population. Experimental results demonstrate that DEEVO significantly outperforms both manual prompt engineering and alternative state-of-the-art optimization approaches on open-ended tasks and close-ended tasks despite using no ground truth feedback. By connecting LLMs reasoning capabilities with adaptive optimization, DEEVO represents a significant advancement in prompt optimization research by eliminating the need of predetermined metrics to continuously improve AI systems.

                Although Down syndrome (DS), trisomy 21, affects ~6 million people worldwide, the neural circuit mechanisms underlying the neurophenotypes of impaired learning, memory and language are unknown. A prominent candidate mechanism involves dysfunctional GABA-signalling and GABAA receptor ligands have been proposed as therapeutics to reverse the neurophenotypic effects of DS. By investigating GABA neurotransmission in brain regions important for cognition in mouse DS models, we reveal that excessive inhibition is not a ubiquitous feature of DS but instead is brain circuit-specific demonstrating increased phasic and tonic inhibition in the dentate gyrus with no comparative changes to inhibition in CA1 and medial prefrontal cortex. In the dentate, elevated extrasynaptic GABA signalling, and interneuron numbers, likely underpin spike firing defects. We show that increased GABA inhibition is caused by increased dosage of Olig1, Olig2 and Dyrk1a. Overall, DS mice are characterised by circuit-specific dysfunctional inhibition predicted to affect cognition via sparse coding in the hippocampus.

">Differentiated SH-SY5Y Cells Exhibit Neuronal Features but Lack Synaptic Maturity</a></h4>

              
                A vital question in neuroscience is if and how efficiently cellular models may be differentiated into functional neuronal cells in culture. Despite the frequent use of the human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y, differentiation protocols vary extensively, with the most common being differentiation via the addition of retinoic acid and brain-derived neurotrophic factor. However, due to the lack of a reliable evaluation method, their adequacy as synaptic models remains unclear. Here, we investigate whether SH-SY5Y cells constitute a functional model for synaptic studies by phenotypically and ultra structurally analyzing synaptogenesis in SH-SY5Y cells subjected to different differentiation protocols. Electron microscopy (EM) techniques, including conventional EM, cryo-EM, and cryo-electron tomography, were systematically applied to characterize synaptogenesis in SH-SY5Y cells. Further characterization was performed through immunostaining and functional assays, such as live exocytosis assays and whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology. Despite exhibiting some presynaptic-like features, differentiated SH-SY5Y cells do not form morphologically or functionally complete synapses under the conditions tested. Immunostaining results were consistent with previous findings, showing synaptic markers. However, functional investigations did not detect synaptic activity. High-throughput EM analyses revealed an absence of synaptic structures in these cells. Additionally, an alternative differentiation approach incorporating additional neurotrophic factors promoted the formation of pre-synaptic-like compartments containing synapse-like synaptic vesicles (SVLVs). Though these SVLVs exhibited pleomorphic size distributions, differing from typical synaptic vesicles, and lacked connectors. These findings emphasize the need for cautious interpretation of results derived from SH-SY5Y cells when studying molecular synaptic architecture or neurodegenerative diseases.

">KCNQ2 Loss-of-Function variants disrupt neuronal maturation via early hyperexcitability followed by maladaptive network remodeling</a></h4>

              
                Loss-of-function (LOF) variants in the potassium channel subunit KCNQ2 cause a spectrum of neonatal epilepsies from self-limiting familial neonatal epilepsy (SeLFNE) to severe developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE). To dissect the developmental consequences of KCNQ2 LOF, we conducted a longitudinal and multimodal comparative analysis in a human neuronal model generated from patients with KCNQ2-DEE and KCNQ2-SeLFNE. KCNQ2-LOF induced a biphasic network dysfunction, with early Kv7-driven hyperexcitability rescued by acute Retigabine (RTG) treatment, followed by maladaptive remodeling in the opposite direction. Transcriptomic analysis mirrored this biphasic dynamic trajectory, revealing an initial upregulation followed by a subsequent downregulation of synaptic genes. Structural analysis showed a steeper decline in presynaptic density alongside a distal shift in the axon initial segment (AIS) throughout maturation, and impaired AIS plasticity at later stages. Overall, KCNQ2-LOF disrupts human neuronal maturation through dynamic, biphasic changes in function, gene expression and structure, offering insights into disease mechanisms and therapeutic options.

                Premature survivors face increased risk of motor and socio-cognitive impairments, implicating cerebellar dysfunction, though the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. The cerebellums rapid development in late gestation makes it especially vulnerable to preterm birth. This study uses a double-hit (DH) mouse model combining maternal immune activation (MIA) and neonatal hypoxia (Hx), to mimic the sequential insults associated with prematurity. Validation with human postnatal cerebellar tissue demonstrated that the DH model recapitulates key structural and molecular features of early-life cerebellar injury. We characterized the cerebellar response to Hx, identifying motor and social deficits associated with S-phase arrest of mature granule cells and impaired synaptic integration by Purkinje cells. Conversely, DH mice exhibited delayed granule cell progenitor maturation, G2-phase retention, and progressive neuronal mitochondrial dysfunction, leading to motor-cognitive impairments while preserving sociability through distinctive and adaptive social interaction kinematics. These findings reveal insult-specific mechanisms of cerebellar developmental disruption and guide potential neuroprotective strategies.

">Dopamine release effects on striatal blood oxygenation and whole brain plasticity underlying associative learning</a></h4>

              
                Dopaminergic signaling in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) is central to reward-based learning, but its relationship to brain-wide hemodynamics remains unclear. Using concurrent fMRI and dopamine photometry in awake, behaving mice, we reveal that associative learning induces a gradual temporal shift in NAc blood oxygenation responses that mirrors dopamine release dynamics. This shift emerges with cue-reward learning and extends across a distributed network including prefrontal, insular, and hypothalamic regions. Further, dopamine transients tightly correspond with local BOLD signals, and variations in reward value modulate delayed BOLD responses in both the NAc and additional subcortical structures. Removing dopaminergic contributions abolishes this reward-related modulation, demonstrating that BOLD signals encode dopaminergic value prediction. These findings establish a mechanistic link between dopamine signaling and widespread neural plasticity during learning.

">Astrocytic Chromatin Remodeler ATRX Gates Hippocampal Memory Consolidation through Metabolic and Synaptic Regulation</a></h4>

              
                Astrocytes are increasingly recognized as active regulators of synaptic transmission and memory, yet the epigenetic mechanisms underlying their contribution to cognitive processes remain poorly defined. Here, we investigated the role of the chromatin remodeler ATRX in astrocytes by generating mice with inducible, astrocyte-specific Atrx deletion (aiKO) using tamoxifen administration at postnatal days 10-12, resulting in ATRX loss in approximately half of hippocampal and cortical astrocytes. Transcriptomic profiling of hippocampal tissue at one and three months revealed a progressive increase in differentially expressed genes, with early enrichment for cytoskeletal and immune pathways and later dysregulation of energy metabolism, ion transport, and synaptic gene sets. Electrophysiological recordings from CA1 pyramidal neurons in aiKO slices demonstrated increased neuronal excitability, reduced membrane capacitance, and decreased frequency of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents, indicating non-cell-autonomous neuronal dysfunction. Morphological analysis identified a transient reduction in dendritic branching at one month and a selective loss of thin dendritic spines by three months, without changes in total dendrite length or overall spine density. Behaviorally, aiKO mice displayed normal locomotion, anxiety, and short-term memory, but exhibited deficits in 24-hour novel object recognition and long-term spatial memory in the Morris water maze. These findings demonstrate that ATRX-mediated chromatin remodeling in astrocytes is essential for maintaining hippocampal transcriptional homeostasis, neuronal function, and long-term memory. Our results highlight a critical role for astrocytic epigenetic regulation in cognitive processes and suggest that astrocyte dysfunction may contribute to the pathogenesis of ATR-X syndrome and related intellectual disability disorders, underscoring the importance of targeting multiple cell types for therapeutic intervention.

">Elucidating directed neural dynamics of scene construction across memory and imagination</a></h4>

              
                Autobiographical memory (AM) and imagination both rely on the brain's ability to construct vivid, coherent mental representations of past or imagined experiences. A central cognitive process underlying these functions is scene construction - the mental generation of spatially organized, imagery-rich representations of environments. Using ultra-high field 7T fMRI combined with Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM), we examined directed effective connectivity among key nodes of the default mode network: the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), hippocampus, and precuneus during object imagery, single-scene construction, and AM retrieval. Our results revealed distinct patterns of network dynamics depending on task demands. During AM retrieval, effective connectivity was characterized by vmPFC-driven top-down modulation primarily targeting the precuneus, supporting the temporal and self-relevant structuring of episodic memory. In contrast, extended scenario imagination engaged hippocampal bidirectional influences with both vmPFC and precuneus, reflecting the dynamic simulation and integration of unfolding events. Single Scene construction shifted network leadership to the precuneus, which exerted modulatory effects on both vmPFC and hippocampus, consistent with its pivotal role in spatial integration and the generation of coherent mental scenes. Object imagery showed minimal stable connectivity within this network, suggesting limited engagement of the hippocampal-default mode circuit during simpler visual representations. Together, our findings highlight a flexible, task-dependent reorganization of effective connectivity within the vmPFC-hippocampus-precuneus network during the construction of rich mental experiences. Scene construction emerges as a unifying mechanism linking memory and imagination, with the direction and strength of neural interactions adapting according to whether temporal or spatial demands predominate.

">Hippocampal input-driven plasticity of prefrontal interneurons reveals a circuit basis for impaired spatial working memory.</a></h4>

              
                Dynamic functional connectivity between the ventral hippocampus (vHPC) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is essential for spatial working memory (SWM). Interactions between vHPC projections and mPFC interneurons, and their plasticity, are uniquely positioned to influence SWM, yet the nature of these interactions remains unclear. Here, we combined in vivo optical stimulation of vHPC inputs to mPFC with calcium recordings of discrete mPFC interneuron populations in mice, revealing class-specific response profiles and plasticity. Repeated vHPC input stimulation persistently depressed activity in vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-expressing interneurons and potentiated activity in somatostatin-expressing interneurons. Ex vivo whole-cell electrophysiology and computational modeling revealed that these divergent effects likely arise from a primary weakening of monosynaptic vHPC input onto VIP interneurons. Leveraging this plasticity to inform the circuit interactions that support SWM, we found that mice with prior vHPC input stimulation displayed elevated VIP interneuron activity during the delay epoch in early SWM task training, and this enhanced activity correlated with poorer training performance. Accordingly, mice modeling the schizophrenia-predisposing 22q11.2 deletion syndrome with known SWM learning deficits recapitulated this aberrant VIP interneuron activity profile and showed reduced vHPC targeting of mPFC VIP interneurons. Together, these findings reveal novel cell-type-specific plasticity in cognition-supporting circuits and illustrate how reweighting of inputs to VIP interneurons may contribute to working memory dysfunction.

">Distinctive neurophysiological correlates of sound onset and offset perception in humans</a></h4>

              
                Accurate detection of sound onsets and offsets is vital for speech perception. Sound-onset event-related potentials (ERPs) have been well-characterised in electroencephalography (EEG) studies, but the characteristics of sound-offset ERPs have often been obscured by temporal confounds in experimental design. Here, two EEG studies were conducted in human listeners performing an interval duration discrimination task with (i) noise intervals in silence or (ii) silent intervals (gaps) in noise. Stimuli used in the active task were also presented under passive listening conditions. This design enabled us to investigate whether features of the offset ERP could be masked by task demands, and whether the usual temporal precedence of the onset cue in a sound influences the relative magnitude and shape of onset and offset ERPs. The morphology of the offset ERP was distinct from that of the onset ERP in both noise and silent interval duration discrimination tasks, even though the roles of onset and offset cues as initial versus final markers of interval duration were reversed. This observation corroborates evidence from animal studies that there are fundamental differences in brain mechanisms of onset and offset perception. In all experimental conditions, the amplitude of the offset ERP was one-third to one-half that of the onset ERP. Differences between active and passive listening conditions were largely explained by enhancement of ERPs for whichever cue (onset or offset) marked the end of the intervals compared in the duration discrimination task. However, this context dependence emerged in earlier ERP waves for offset than onset responses.

">Charting structural brain asymmetry across the human lifespan</a></h4>

              
                Lateralization is a fundamental principle of structural brain organization. In vivo imaging of brain asymmetry is essential for deciphering lateralized brain functions and their disruption in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. Here, we present a normative framework for benchmarking brain asymmetry across the lifespan, developed from an aggregated sample of 128 primary neuroimaging studies, including 177,701 scans from 138,231 individuals, jointly spanning the age range from 20 post menstrual weeks to 102 years. This resource includes comprehensive, hemisphere-specific brain growth charts for multiple neuroimaging phenotypes: regional cortical grey matter volume, thickness, surface area, and subcortical volumes. Our findings reveal distinct spatial patterns of asymmetry, with early leftward asymmetry observed in association cortices and late rightward asymmetry in sensory regions. These trajectories support theories of the neuroplasticity of asymmetry and the role of both genetic and environmental factors in shaping brain lateralization. Additionally, we provide tools to generate asymmetry centile scores, which allow the quantification of individual deviations from typical asymmetry throughout the lifespan and can be applied to unseen data or clinical populations. We demonstrate the utility of these models by highlighting group-level differences in asymmetry in autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer's disease, and exploring genetic correlations with hemispheric specialization. To facilitate further research, we have made this normative framework freely available as an interactive open-access resource (upon publication), offering an essential tool to advance both basic and clinical neuroscience.

Utilizing the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations, fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations, and voxel-based morphology, the brain function and structure of Wilson’s disease were explored. Compared to healthy controls, Wilson’s disease patients with the p.R778L or p.P992L mutation showed greater atrophy in the bilateral putamen, caudate, globus pallidus, thalamus, amygdala, insula, and hippocampus. And these patients showed altered spontaneous neural activity in many more brain regions than healthy controls in three frequency bands. Significant correlation was found between altered brain volume and Unified Wilson’s Disease Rating Scale neurological subscale scores.

                <p>In everyday life, ambient sounds can disrupt our concentration, interfere with task performance, and contribute to mental fatigue. Even when not actively attended to, salient or changing sounds in the environment can involuntarily divert attention. Understanding how the brain responds to these real-world auditory distractions is essential for evaluating the cognitive consequences of environmental noise. In this study, we recorded electroencephalography while participants performed different tasks during prolonged exposure to a complex urban soundscape. We identified naturally occurring, acoustically salient events and analyzed the corresponding event-related potentials (ERPs). Auditory spectral novelty reliably elicited a P3a response (250&ndash;350 ms), reflecting robust attentional capture by novel environmental sounds. In contrast, the reorienting negativity (RON) window (450&ndash;600 ms) showed no consistent modulation, possibly due to the continuous and largely behaviorally irrelevant nature of the soundscape. Performance in a behavioral task was briefly disrupted following novel sounds, underscoring the functional impact of attentional capture. Noise sensitivity, measured via the Weinstein Noise Sensitivity Scale (  <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B53">1978</cross-ref>), was not associated with ERP amplitudes. Together, these findings demonstrate that the P3a component provides a stable neural marker of attentional shifts in naturalistic contexts and highlight the utility of spectral novelty detection as a tool for investigating auditory attention outside the laboratory.</p>

                <p>The endocannabinoid (eCB) signaling system is robustly expressed in the cerebellum from embryonic developmental stages to adulthood. It plays a key role in regulating cerebellar synaptic plasticity and excitability, suggesting that impaired eCB signaling could lead to deficits in cerebellar adjustments of ongoing behaviors and cerebellar learning. Indeed, human mutations in <I>DAGL&alpha;</I> are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. In this study, we show that selective deletion of the eCB synthesizing enzyme diacylglycerol lipase alpha (Dagl&alpha;) from mouse cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) alters motor and social behaviors, disrupts short-term synaptic plasticity in both excitatory and inhibitory synapses, and reduces PC activity during social exploration. Our results provide the first evidence for cerebellar-specific eCB regulation of social behaviors and implicate eCB regulation of synaptic plasticity and PC activity as the neural substrates contributing to these deficits.</p>

                <p>The development of Schwann cells, which myelinate axons in the peripheral nervous system, is critically dependent on MEK/ERK signaling. While Ets-domain transcription factors (<I>Etv1</I>, <I>Etv4</I>, <I>Etv5</I>) are downstream effectors of this pathway, only <I>Etv1</I> has been specifically linked to Schwann cell development. Here, we examined the functions of <I>Etv5</I>, which is expressed in Schwann cell precursors, neural crest cells and satellite glia, at embryonic stages and at low levels in mature Schwann cells. In hypomorphic <I>Etv5<sup>tm1Kmm</sup></I> homozygous mutant mice, no overt defects in Schwann cell differentiation were observed at embryonic stages. To study the function of <I>Etv5</I> in juvenile (postnatal days 21&ndash;30) and mature adult (6&nbsp;month) mice, we generated <I>Etv5</I> conditional knock-outs (cKOs) using a <I>Sox10-Cre</I> driver. In juvenile male <I>Etv5</I>-cKO mice, Schwann cell numbers increased normally after a peripheral nerve crush injury, a response that was attenuated by 6&nbsp;months. Transmission electron microscopy of the naive sciatic nerve revealed a decline in axonal diameter and perturbed myelination in <I>Etv5</I>-cKO male and female mice. The innervated gastrocnemius muscle declined in area and volume in <I>Etv5</I>-cKO mice of both sexes, suggesting nerve structural abnormalities cause muscle atrophy. However, control and <I>Etv5</I>-cKO male and female mice performed similarly in motor behavior tests after a crush injury. Thus, <I>Etv5</I> is not essential for Schwann cell differentiation, but <I>Etv5</I> plays a crucial role in the age-dependent regulation of Schwann cell function, including nerve repair and the maintenance of axonal integrity in mature peripheral nerves.</p>

                <p>A major challenge in cerebellar physiology is determining how the stereotypic, conserved circuitry of the cerebellar cortex, with its dominant parasagittal and transverse architectures, underlies its fundamental computations and contributions to behavior. Recent advances have allowed for the resolution of Purkinje cell dendritic activity at large scales, but the full roles of these Purkinje cell dynamics during behavior remain undetermined. To interrogate Purkinje cell dynamics at the population level during behavior, we implemented a novel approach for awake, chronic, wide-field Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging of the cerebellar cortex. We performed wide-field cerebellar recordings in mice of both sexes exhibiting sparse expression of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator GCaMP6s, which importantly allowed for the resolution of both dendritic and somatic Purkinje cell activity. Blind source separation of wide-field dynamics using spatial independent component analysis extracts components consisting of either Purkinje cell dendrites or somata, with distinct activity and spatial properties. These independent components (ICs) tend to be either parasagittally organized and likely reflective of dendritic activity or more spatially distributed populations of Purkinje cell somata. We observe broad, bilateral activation of both these dendritic and somatic ICs during behavior, but they exhibit distinct and divergent patterns of spatial correlations occurring primarily along the parasagittal and transverse directions, consistent with the main geometry of the cerebellar cortex. Somatic correlation dynamics are robustly modulated by prediction errors and reflect ultimate behavioral outcomes. These results provide a novel link between cerebellar structure and function, with the correlation dynamics of Purkinje cell activity a key feature during behavior.</p>

                <p>Puberty triggers significant changes. However, besides the pruning of synapses, little is known about more long-range alterations during brain maturation. Actin filament formation&mdash;a process ignited by actin nucleators&mdash;is crucial for life and also a driving force behind cellular morphology changes. Yet, the physiological importance of especially the more recently discovered, evolutionary younger actin nucleators largely remains elusive. We demonstrate the consequences of deficiency for the actin nucleator Cobl in the mouse brain. We identify remarkably layer- and age-restricted cortical <I>Cobl</I> KO phenotypes in dendritic arborization that first transiently emerge in layer V in rather young adolescent male mice and then manifested in a similar but more pronounced manner in layer II/III during the age of emerging adulthood. <I>Cobl</I> KO phenotypes were observed in the somatosensory cortex, prefrontal cortex, and motor cortex. In WT mouse cortices, we discovered an increase in dendritic arbor complexity occurring during emerging adulthood and thereby identified a long-range process for cortical rewiring upon brain maturation. This dendritic arbor expansion is transient and largely erased during mature adulthood. The transient dendritic arbor expansion during emerging adulthood was accompanied by transient length changes of dendritic spines. Molecularly, the process thus seems to relate to alterations in actin dynamics. Importantly, both of these changes were completely absent in <I>Cobl</I> KO mice. Increased risk-taking of <I>Cobl</I> KO mice points toward a lack of maturity. These observations revealed the actin nucleator Cobl as first molecular component crucial for the identified emerging adulthood-related changes of neurons toward brain maturation.</p>

                <p>Structural neuroimaging studies of typical development reveal increases in gray matter volume during childhood, followed by shrinkage in adolescence and early adulthood. With neuropil constituting the bulk of gray matter, these developmental changes may reflect neuropil reorganization accompanied by alterations in cellular membranes, as well as changes in related energy demand. Phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<sup>31</sup>P MRS) allows in vivo assessment of changes in the brain's high-energy phosphates&mdash;phosphocreatine (PCr), inorganic phosphate (Pi), and adenosine triphosphate (ATP)&mdash;as well as metabolites associated with synthesis and degradation of membrane phospholipids (MPLs)&mdash;phosphocholine (PC) and phosphoethanolamine (PE)&mdash;and their breakdown products, glycerophosphocholine (GPC) and glycerophosphoethanolamine (GPE). Forty-nine children and adolescents aged 6&ndash;14&nbsp;years at baseline (37 boys, 12 girls) were assessed on up to three occasions ca. 12&nbsp;months apart. MPL precursor levels decreased across all examined regions over time, including cortical and subcortical gray matter and two major white matter tracts. Breakdown products increased in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in younger children but decreased in their older counterparts. While ATP and Pi decreased across most regions, PCr changes were heterochronic and regional: hippocampal increases were more pronounced in older children, whereas most of the remaining regions showed no change. Changes in MPL precursors were positively associated with change in PFC cortical thickness, suggesting that the expansion and contraction of neuropil are coupled with structural brain changes during childhood and adolescence. Thus, in vivo <sup>31</sup>P MRS provides new insights into the neurobiological mechanisms of normal brain development.</p>

                <p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder that affects normal neuronal functioning and alters neuronal circuits activity and memory formation and storage. Disrupted neuronal calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) signaling is one of the drivers of AD pathogenesis. Previously we suggested that positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPase (SERCA) pump may help to stabilize cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels and exert neuroprotective effects in AD neurons. In the current manuscript, we demonstrate synaptoprotective properties of several SERCA PAMs using an in vitro model of amyloid toxicity. Based on in vitro experiments, we selected the SERCA PAM NDC-9009 for in vivo evaluation in male and female 5xFAD transgenic mice model of Alzheimer's disease. Using the miniscope imaging technique, we observed hyperactivity and abnormal connectivity of hippocampal neuronal ensembles 5xFAD mice. We further discovered that the function of the hippocampal neuronal circuits in 5xFAD mice was normalized by NDC-9009 intraperitoneal administration. NDC-9009 intraperitoneal administration also rescued memory defects in 5xFAD mice as quantified by the fear conditioning behavioral test and significantly reduced accumulation of amyloid plaques in hippocampal region of these mice. The obtained results support the potential utility of NDC-9009 and other SERCA PAMs as lead molecules for development of disease-modifying treatments for AD and potentially other neurodegenerative disorders.</p>

                <p>Microsaccades are miniature saccades performed during visual fixation that were shown to play a pivotal role in active sensing. Recent studies suggested that pre-microsaccadic attention may underlie the enhanced visual processing at the stimulus site. However, the neuronal mechanism underlying this phenomenon at the foveal scale remains unknown. Using voltage-sensitive dye imaging, we investigated the neural responses to uninstructed, spontaneous microsaccades in the fovea of the primary visual cortex (V1) in behaving monkeys (macaque, male). We found that prior to microsaccades onset toward a small visual stimulus, the neuronal activity at the current and future landing stimulus sites was enhanced relative to microsaccades away from the stimulus. This enhancement was spatially confined to the current and future landing stimulus sites, which appeared to merge along the microsaccades (&lt;1&nbsp;deg) trajectory in V1. Finally, we found a pre-microsaccadic increased synchronization at the current stimulus site. Our findings shed new light on neural modulations preceding microsaccades and suggest a link to neural signatures of attention.</p>

                <p>Negative and cognitive symptoms impair functioning in patients with psychotic illnesses [i.e., schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SZ) and bipolar I disorder with psychotic features (BD)]. Disruptions in mesocorticolimbic circuitry are hypothesized to underpin negative symptoms and cognitive impairment in patients with psychosis and may also facilitate reward-motivational deficits. In male and female patients with psychosis (<I>N</I> = 44) and healthy controls (HC = 27), we used neuroimaging to define gray matter morphology and white matter microstructure. We examined negative symptom severity with the Clinical Assessment Interview for Negative Symptoms (CAINS), effort allocation during reward processing with the Effort Expenditure for Rewards Task (EEfRT), and cognitive performance with the MATRICS cognitive consensus battery (MCCB). Reduced nucleus accumbens volumes in patients with psychosis were associated with higher CAINS total and motivation and pleasure subscale scores as well as lower effort expenditure for medium (50%) and high (88%) reward probability conditions during EEfRT. The fornix showed reduced fractional anisotropy in patients with psychosis. Negative associations were present between CAINS motivation and pleasure subscores and MCCB composite and subscale scores. Lower gray matter volume in cerebellar Lobule IV corresponded with impaired effort allocation during medium and high reward probability conditions and lower cognitive performance. However, Lobule IV was not correlated with CAINS scores. While nucleus accumbens volume may serve as a marker of negative symptoms in psychotic illnesses, cerebellar Lobule IV morphology may inform on cognitive impairment in patients with SZ and BD. The nucleus accumbens and Lobule IV may each contribute to reduced effort allocation during reward processing.</p>

                <p>The hippocampal formation (HF) plays a key role in avian spatial navigation. Previous studies suggest that the HF may serve different functions at various stages in pigeons&rsquo; long-distance outdoor homing flight. However, it remains unclear whether the HF exhibits specific neural responses during these stages. In this study, we employed a wearable bimodal data recording system to simultaneously capture flight trajectories and hippocampal local field potential (LFP) signals of pigeons (either sex) during outdoor homing navigation. Our results revealed significant differences in hippocampal neural responses across the initial decision-making (DM) and en route navigation (ER) stages. Specifically, elevated LFP power in theta (4&ndash;12&nbsp;Hz) and beta (12&ndash;30&nbsp;Hz) bands was detected during the DM stage compared with the ER stage, while the high-gamma (60&ndash;120&nbsp;Hz) band exhibited the opposite pattern. In addition, we examined typical theta&ndash;beta phase&ndash;amplitude coupling during the ER stage. Additionally, stage-specific hippocampal responses remained consistent across release sites. Notably, the difference in hippocampal responses across stages diminished along with the accumulation of homing experience. These results offer new insights into the role of the avian HF in homing flight navigation and suggest parallels between avian and mammalian hippocampal mechanisms in spatial learning.</p>

This could have major implications for patients suffering from macular degeneration (MD), one leading cause of vision loss. Here, we performed fMRI recordings in a group of maculopathy patients (<I>N</I> = 7, 3 women, including individuals suffering from age-related macular degeneration or from Stargardt's disease) and a control group to characterize the motion processing cortical network in MD patients and determine whether this network is modified following the onset of the scotoma. We used an experimental protocol based on random-dot kinematograms classically employed to characterize motion-selective areas in the brain. To ensure that the visual information processed by the two groups was equivalent, the visual field in each control participant was masked using an artificial scotoma directly derived from clinical measurements in their paired patient. We found that in MD patients, translational motion elicited significant and robust activations in a restricted cortical network which included the human V5/MT+ complex (hMT+), areas V3A and V6, and a portion of primary visual areas (V1, V2, and V3) connected to peripheral vision. Importantly, the same patterns of responses were also observed in control participants. Moreover, the extent and strength of activation within these motion-selective areas did not differ significantly between the two groups. Altogether, these results suggest that in humans, the motion-selective network does not undergo significant large-scale cortical reorganizations following the onset of MD.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/30/e0922252025?rss=1">Hearing Loss and Audiogenic Seizures Induced by Hypofunctional Prestin Variants</a></h4>

              
                <p>Prestin's voltage-driven motor activity confers sound-elicited somatic electromotility on auditory outer hair cells (OHCs) and is essential for the exquisite sensitivity and frequency selectivity of mammalian hearing. Lack of prestin results in ~50&nbsp;dB hearing threshold shifts across frequency, supporting the causal association of the prestin-coding gene, <I>SLC26A5</I>, with hereditary hearing loss, DFNB61. However, ~50% reduction in prestin-mediated OHC electromotility barely affects cochlear function, and it is currently unknown how much electromotility is minimally required to support normal hearing. We generated mouse models harboring two deafness-associated prestin variants, p.A100T and p.P119S, and found that these missense variants do not deprive prestin of its fast motor function but significantly reduce membrane expression, leading to 70&ndash;80% reductions in OHC electromotility. Homozygous and compound heterozygous mice of either sex for these missense variants suffered congenital hearing loss; however, they still retained relatively low hearing thresholds at lower frequencies, pointing to the clinical possibility that a small augmentation of OHC electromotility could benefit those with DFNB61 hearing loss. These mice were also found to be prone to audiogenic seizures. This study thus provides insights into the minimum OHC electromotility required for normal cochlear operation and reveals the unappreciated importance of prestin for central gain control.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/45/30/e1479242025?rss=1">Shared and Diverging Neural Dynamics Underlying False and Veridical Perception</a></h4>

              
                <p>We often mistake visual noise for meaningful images, which sometimes appear as convincing as veridical percepts. This suggests considerable overlap between the mechanisms that underlie false and veridical perception. Yet, false percepts must arise at least in part from internally generated signals. Here, we apply multivariate analyses to human MEG data to study the overlap between veridical and false perception across two aspects of perceptual inference: discrimination of content (what did I see?) and detection (did I see something?). Male and female participants performed a visual discrimination task requiring them to indicate the orientation of a noisy grating, as well as their confidence in having seen a grating. Importantly, on 50% of trials, only a noise patch was presented. To exclude external signals driving false percepts, noise patches were carefully designed not to contain orientation signal. Still, participants occasionally confidently reported seeing a grating on noise only trials, i.e., false percepts. Decoding analyses revealed a sensory signal reflecting the content of these false percepts, despite no such grating being physically presented. Uniquely, high confidence false, but not veridical, percepts were associated with increased prestimulus high alpha/low beta [11&ndash;14 Hz] power, potentially reflecting enhanced reliance on top-down signaling on false percept trials. Later on, a shared neural code reflecting confidence in stimulus presence emerged for both false and veridical percepts. These findings suggest that false percepts arise through neural signals reflecting both sensory content and detection, similar to veridical percepts, with an increase in prestimulus alpha/beta power uniquely contributing to false percepts.</p>

                <p>by Jong-Yun Park, Mitsuaki Tsukamoto, Misato Tanaka, Yukiyasu Kamitani</p>

Reconstruction of perceptual experiences from brain activity offers a unique window into how population neural responses represent sensory information. Although decoding visual content from functional MRI (fMRI) has seen significant success, reconstructing arbitrary sounds remains challenging due to the fine temporal structure of auditory signals and the coarse temporal resolution of fMRI. Drawing on the hierarchical auditory features of deep neural networks (DNNs) with progressively larger time windows and their neural activity correspondence, we introduce a method for sound reconstruction that integrates brain decoding of DNN features and an audio-generative model. DNN features decoded from auditory cortical activity outperformed spectrotemporal and modulation-based features, enabling perceptually plausible reconstructions across diverse sound categories. Behavioral evaluations and objective measures confirmed that these reconstructions preserved short-term spectral and perceptual properties, capturing the characteristic timbre of speech, animal calls, and musical instruments, while the reconstructed sounds did not reproduce longer temporal sequences with fidelity. Leave-category-out analyses indicated that the method generalizes across sound categories. Reconstructions at higher DNN layers and from early auditory regions revealed distinct contributions to decoding performance. Applying the model to a selective auditory attention (“cocktail party”) task further showed that reconstructions reflected the attended sound more strongly than the unattended one in some of the subjects. Despite its inability to reconstruct exact temporal sequences, which may reflect the limited temporal resolution of fMRI, our framework demonstrates the feasibility of mapping brain activity to auditory experiences—a step toward more comprehensive understanding and reconstruction of internal auditory representations.

                <p>by Kai-Qi Yek, Evie Hodgson, Ching-Seng Ang, Catherine S. Palmer, Ann E. Frazier, Hayley J. Newton, Diana Stojanovski</p>

<i>Legionella pneumophila</i> utilizes a type IVB secretion system (T4SS) to translocate over 300 effector proteins into host cells, hijacking cellular processes, including those within the mitochondrion. Currently, no <i>Legionella</i> effectors have been identified at the mitochondrial outer membrane, a critical interface between the organelle and the rest of the cell. We screened the <i>Legionella</i> effector repertoire for features of mitochondrial tail-anchored (TA) proteins and identified four putative TA effectors. Among them, <i>Lp</i>PIP (Lpg1625) localizes to the mitochondrial outer membrane and interacts with all three isoforms of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) via an RVxF motif. <i>Lp</i>PIP functions as a PP1-interacting protein (PIP) as PP1 remains catalytically active upon interaction with <i>Lp</i>PIP to the dephosphorylate mitochondrial outer membrane proteins. Altering the TA signature to direct <i>Lp</i>PIP to the ER induces ER-recruitment of PP1 and dephosphorylation of ER-resident proteins, indicating that <i>Lp</i>PIP controls PP1 localization and not substrate specificity. This study uncovers a novel pathogen-mediated strategy to modulate PP1 and manipulate the host cell phosphoproteome.

                In this issue of Neuron, Graves et al. report that genetically reducing senescent cells by deleting p16 in a tauopathy mouse model significantly lessens tau pathology, neurovascular dysfunction, and behavioral deficits. Their study highlights the crucial role of p16-dependent senescence in microglia and endothelial cells as active drivers of neurodegeneration.

                Network hyperexcitability is one of the hallmarks of the early stage of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In this issue of Neuron, Papanikolaou and coworkers show that AD-mediated alterations start at the excitatory-inhibitory subcircuit in the deep layers of the cortex.

                Liang et al. characterize the lifespan maturation of human cortical morphometric networks (0–80 years, 33,937 participants), revealing distinct trajectories between sensory and association cortices. These developmental patterns correlate with functional, metabolic, and transcriptomic profiles. Morphometric network-based normative modeling identifies disorder-specific, connectivity-phenotypic deviations, establishing a quantitative benchmark for assessing individual brain variations.

FBLN5 knockdown in CAFs could enhance radiosensitivity by inducing ferroptosis via decreased ACSL4 expression. Their work identified FBLN5 as a biomarker and a therapeutic target for NSCLC radiotherapy.

                Marescal and Cheeseman show that depletion of proteasome 19S lid subunits, but not that of other proteasome components, uniquely leads to the formation of monopolar spindles during mitosis. This phenotype arises from the aberrant ubiquitin-independent degradation of the motor protein KIF11 by the 20S proteasome core upon 19S loss.

                Wang et al. demonstrate that PLCγ1 negatively regulates FGF signaling through both of its SH2 domains. Deletion of PLCγ1 results in increased PIP3 levels and enhanced AKT activation without impacting MAPK signaling. This reveals a novel mechanism by which PLCγ1 controls branching through the modulation of phosphoinositide metabolism.

                Joo et al. demonstrate that constitutive mitotic ATR and Chk1 activity ensures faithful chromosome segregation. In mitosis, Chk1 phosphorylates and inhibits Myt1, a kinase that deactivates CDK1, a necessary step in sustaining proper CDK1 activity. Inhibition of mitotic Chk1 leads to defective Aurora B signaling pathway through CDK1 phosphorylation of INCENP.

                Tenderra et al. show that human intelligence is linked to interindividual differences in relational integration in hippocampal cognitive maps. Map-like representations of information learned piecemeal scaled with fluid intelligence, and this relationship specifically reflected relational integration rather than general mnemonic processing. These findings highlight a neural mechanism underlying general cognitive ability.

The striatal projection neuron (SPN) manipulations that more closely approximate endogenous temporal dynamics demonstrate that SPNs shape future performance based on behavioral history.

Molecular precursors of the CoQ10 headgroup increase the survival of mice that cannot make the headgroup and improve neurological symptoms in an individual with primary CoQ10 deficiency.

A recent study identifies a sparse ensemble of GABAergic neurons in the medial orbitofrontal cortex that is activated during binge drinking. These neurons send inhibitory projections to subcortical regions to limit alcohol intake, suggesting new strategies to reduce binge drinking and protect against alcohol use disorder.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106339">Bioengineering approaches to trained immunity: Physiologic targets and therapeutic strategies</a></h4>

              
                Trained immunity presents a unique target for modulating the immune response against infectious and non-infectious threats to human health. To address the unmet need for training-targeted therapies, we explore bioengineering methods to answer research questions and address clinical applications. Current challenges in trained immunity include self-propagating autoinflammatory disease, a lack of controllable cell and tissue specificity, and the unintentional induction of training by known drugs and diseases. The bioengineering tools discussed in this review (nanotherapeutics, biomechanical modulation, cellular engineering, and machine learning) could address these challenges by providing additional avenues to modulate and interrogate trained immunity. The preferential activation of peripheral or central training has not yet been achieved and could be accessed using nanoparticle systems. Targeted delivery of training stimuli using nanocarriers can enrich the response in various cell and organ systems, while also selectively activating peripheral training in the local tissues or central trained immunity in bone marrow progenitor cells. Beyond chemical- or pathogen-based activation of training, force-based cues, such as interaction with mechanoreceptors, can induce trained phenotypes in many cell types. Mechanotransduction influences immune cell activation, motility, and morphology and could be harnessed as a tool to modulate training states in next-generation therapies. For known genetic and epigenetic mediators of trained immunity, cellular engineering could precisely activate or deactivate programs of training. Genetic engineering could be particularly useful in generating trained cell-based therapies like chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) macrophages. Finally, machine learning models, which are rapidly transforming biomedical research, can be employed to identify signatures of trained immunity in pre-existing datasets. They can also predict protein targets for previously identified inducers of trained immunity by modeling drug-protein or protein-protein interactions in silico. By harnessing the modular techniques of bioengineering for applications in trained immunity, training-based therapies can be more efficiently translated into clinical practice.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92748">Identification of novel human microcephaly-linked protein Mtss2 that mediates cortical progenitor cell division and corticogenesis through Nedd9-RhoA</a></h4>

              
                The cerebral cortex, which is responsible for higher cognitive functions, relies on the coordinated asymmetric division cycles of polarized radial glial progenitor cells for proper development. Defects in the mitotic process of neuronal stem cells have been linked to the underlying causes of microcephaly; however, the exact mechanisms involved are not fully understood. In this study, we present a new discovery regarding the role of the membrane-deforming cytoskeletal regulator protein called Mtss2 (also known as MTSS1L/ABBA) in cortical development. When Mtss2 was absent in the developing brain, it led to a halt in radial glial cell proliferation, disorganized radial fibers, and abnormal migration of neuronal progenitors. During cell division, Mtss2 localized to the cleavage furrow, where it recruited the scaffolding protein Nedd9 and positively influenced the activity of RhoA, a crucial regulator of cell division. Notably, we identified a variant of <i>Mtss2</i> (R671W) in a patient with microcephaly and intellectual disability, further highlighting its significance. The introduction of this mutant Mtss2 protein in mice resulted in phenotypic similarities to the effects of <i>Mtss2</i> knockdown. Overall, these findings offer valuable mechanistic insights into the development of microcephaly and the cerebral cortex by identifying <i>Mtss2</i> as a novel regulator involved in ensuring the accurate progression of mitosis in neuronal progenitor cells.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98372">Targeting the WSB2–NOXA axis in cancer cells for enhanced sensitivity to BCL-2 family protein inhibitors</a></h4>

              
                Anti-apoptotic B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) family proteins are frequently overexpressed in various cancers, playing a pivotal role in cancer initiation and progression, as well as intrinsic or acquired resistance to therapy. Although inhibitors targeting BCL-2, such as Venetoclax, have shown efficacy in hematological malignancies, their therapeutic potential in solid tumors remains limited. Identifying novel molecular targets to overcome resistance to these inhibitors is of significant clinical importance. Here, we provide evidence of a strong synthetic lethality between WSB2, a previously underexplored substrate-binding receptor of the Cullin 5–RBX2–Elongin B/C (CRL5) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, and anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family proteins. Mechanistically, WSB assembles a CRL5 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that facilitates the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of NOXA, a pro-apoptotic BCL-2 family protein. Loss of WSB2 leads to a substantial accumulation of NOXA in both cultured cell lines and knockout mouse tissues. While WSB2 deficiency alone does not significantly impact spontaneous apoptosis, it sensitizes cells to apoptosis when anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family proteins are either genetically depleted or pharmacologically inhibited. Moreover, WSB2 is overexpressed in several human cancer types. These findings identify WSB2 as a critical regulator of mitochondrial apoptosis and reveal the dysregulation of the WSB2–NOXA axis as a key factor contributing to apoptosis resistance in cancer cells. Targeting both WSB2 and anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family proteins holds promising therapeutic potential for overcoming resistance in human cancers.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104887">A dual nature of γδ T cell immune memory responses</a></h4>

              
                Immune memory was considered for decades an exclusive hallmark of the adaptive immune response. However, recent studies have revealed that innate immune cells can also ‘recall’ information of a primary insult during infection or vaccination and deploy robust antigen-agonistic immune reactivity upon secondary challenge. This <i>de-facto</i> innate immune memory response is designated as ‘trained immunity’. γδ T cells are unconventional T cells that possess unique immunologic features of both adaptive and innate immunity. Their immune memory responses to various bacterial and viral agents were originally described to be of an adaptive immune nature. Nevertheless, growing evidence shows that γδ T cells can also mount antigen-independent memory responses resembling trained immunity. In this review, we discuss the dual nature of immune memory responses of γδ T cells and provide insights into their important role in protection against bacterial, viral, and parasitic infections in humans and animals.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105094">Sexual failure decreases sweet taste perception in male Drosophila via dopaminergic signaling</a></h4>

              
                Sweet taste perception, a critical aspect of the initiation of feeding behavior, is primarily regulated by an animal’s internal metabolic state. However, non-metabolic factors, such as motivational and emotional states, can also influence peripheral sensory processing and hence feeding behavior. While mating experience is known to induce motivational and emotional changes, its broader impact on other innate behaviors, such as feeding, remains largely uncharacterized. In this study, we demonstrated that the mating failure of male fruit flies suppressed sweet taste perception via dopamine signaling in specific neural circuitry. Upon repetitive failure in courtship, male flies exhibited a sustained yet reversible decline of sweet taste perception, as measured by the proboscis extension reflex (PER) towards sweet tastants as well as the neuronal activity of sweet-sensing Gr5a<sup>+</sup> neurons in the proboscis. Mechanistically, we identified a small group of dopaminergic neurons projecting to the subesophageal zone (SEZ) and innervating with Gr5a<sup>+</sup> neurons as the key modulator. Repetitive sexual failure decreased the activity of these dopaminergic neurons and in turn, suppressed Gr5a<sup>+</sup> neurons via Dop1R1 and Dop2R receptors. Our findings revealed a critical role for dopaminergic signaling in integrating reproductive experience with appetitive sensory processing, providing new insights into the complex interactions between different innate behaviors and the role of brain’s reward systems in regulating internal motivational and emotional states.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100885">Stochastic cell-intrinsic stem cell decisions control colony growth in planarians</a></h4>

              
                Stem cells contribute to organismal homeostasis by balancing division, self-renewal, and differentiation. Elucidating the strategies by which stem cells achieve this balance is critical for understanding homeostasis and for addressing pathogenesis associated with the disruption of this balance (e.g. cancer). Planarians, highly regenerative flatworms, use pluripotent stem cells called neoblasts to maintain and regrow organs. A single neoblast can rescue an entire animal depleted from stem cells and regenerate all cell lineages. How neoblast differentiation and clonal expansion are governed to produce all the required cell types remains unclear. Here, we integrated experimental and computational approaches to develop a quantitative model revealing basic principles of clonal growth of individual neoblasts. By experimentally suppressing differentiation to major lineages, we elucidated the interplay between colony growth and lineage decisions. Our findings suggest that neoblasts select their progenitor lineage based on a cell-intrinsic fate distribution. Arresting differentiation into specific lineages disrupts neoblast proliferative capacity without inducing compensatory expression of other lineages. Our analysis of neoblast colonies is consistent with a cell-intrinsic decision model that can operate without memory or communication between neoblasts. This simple cell fate decision process breaks down in homeostasis, likely because of the activity of feedback mechanisms. Our findings uncover essential principles of stem cell regulation in planarians, which are distinct from those observed in many vertebrate models. These mechanisms enable robust production of diverse cell types and facilitate regeneration of missing tissues.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101153">Subtypes and proliferation patterns of small intestine neuroendocrine tumors revealed by single-cell RNA sequencing</a></h4>

              
                Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) occur primarily in the small intestine, lung, and pancreas. Due to their rarity compared to other malignancies in these organs, their complex biology remains poorly understood, including their oncogenesis, tumor composition, and the intriguing phenomena of mixed neuroendocrine non-neuroendocrine neoplasms (MiNEN). Here, we profiled ten low-grade small intestine NET (SiNET) samples as well as one mixed lung tumor by single-cell or single-nuclei RNA-seq. We find that SiNETs are largely separated into two distinct subtypes, in which the neuroendocrine cells upregulate epithelial or neuronal markers, respectively. Surprisingly, in both subtypes, the neuroendocrine cells are largely non-proliferative while higher proliferation is observed in multiple non-malignant cell types. Specifically, B and plasma cells are highly proliferative in the epithelial-like SiNET subtype, potentially reflecting the outcome of high Migration Inhibitory Factor (MIF) expression in those tumors, which may constitute a relevant target. Finally, our analysis of a mixed lung neuroendocrine tumor identifies a population of putative progenitor cells that may give rise to both neuroendocrine and non-neuroendocrine (squamous) cells, potentially explaining the origin of the mixed histology. Taken together, our results provide important insights and hypotheses regarding the biology of neuroendocrine neoplasms.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98119">Microtubule networks in zebrafish hair cells facilitate presynapse transport and fusion during development</a></h4>

              
                Sensory cells in the retina and inner ear rely on specialized ribbon synapses for neurotransmission. Disruption of these synapses is linked to visual and auditory dysfunction, but it is unclear how these unique synapses form. Ribbon synapses are defined by a presynaptic density called a ribbon. Using live imaging in zebrafish hair cells, we find that numerous small ribbon precursors are present throughout the cell early in development. As development progresses, fewer large ribbons remain, and localize at the presynaptic active zone (AZ). Using tracking analyses, we show that ribbon precursors exhibit directed motion along an organized microtubule network to reach the presynaptic AZ. In addition, we show that ribbon precursors can fuse together on microtubules. Using pharmacology, we find that microtubule disruption interferes with ribbon motion, fusion, and normal synapse formation. Overall, this work demonstrates a dynamic series of events that underlies the formation of a critical synapse required for sensory function.

">Exploring neural mechanisms underlying error-related impairments in active working memory suggests an adaptive shielding of contents during cognitive control</a></h4>

              
                Goal-directed behavior relies on cognitive flexibility - the ability to rapidly adapt ongoing thoughts and behaviors while preserving task-relevant information. The performance monitoring system optimizes such behavior by detecting and evaluating errors, while the working memory (WM) system maintains relevant information and protects it from interference. We investigated how these two systems interact. In prior work (Wessel et al., 2022), we found that motor errors impaired active WM maintenance (Error-Related Impairment of Active working Memory; ERIAM). Here, we aimed to identify the source of ERIAM by tracking a neurophysiological marker of visual WM maintenance - the contralateral delay activity (CDA) - throughout the error-making process. Forty-two human participants maintained visual information in WM while performing a motoric task during the delay period. Consistent with prior results, a significant ERIAM effect occurred: motor errors impaired WM performance. Critically, CDA amplitudes did not differ between motor correct and error trials before the flanker task, ruling out a general performance deficit. The CDA was also unaffected immediately after flankers, ruling out a perceptual interference explanation. Significant CDA differences only emerged after motor errors, supporting a genuinely error-related origin of the ERIAM effect. Contrary to prediction, however, CDA was more disrupted after correct responses than errors, and greater disruptions predicted a smaller ERIAM effect. These findings suggest that participants might store WM in multiple states to reduce interference from errors and that the CDA dynamics reflect these adaptive shielding strategies. These findings provide new insights into the source of error-related interference in active WM.

">When word order matters: human brains represent sentence meaning differently from large language models</a></h4>

              
                Large language models based on the transformer architecture are now capable of producing human-like language. But do they encode and process linguistic meaning in a human-like way? Here, we address this question by analysing 7T fMRI data from 30 participants reading 108 sentences each. These sentences are carefully designed to disentangle sentence structure from word meaning, thereby testing whether transformers are able to represent aspects of sentence meaning above the word level. We found that while transformer models match brain representations better than models that completely ignore word order, all transformer models performed poorly overall. Further, transformers were significantly inferior to models explicitly designed to encode the structural relations between words. Our results provide insight into the nature of sentence representation in the brain, highlighting the critical role of sentence structure. They also cast doubt on the claim that transformers represent sentence meaning similarly to the human brain.

">Internalization of exogenous myelin by oligodendroglia promotes lineage progression</a></h4>

              
                Oligodendrocytes, traditionally recognized for their role in central nervous system myelination, have emerged during the last decades as key participants maintaining brain homoeostasis in response to metabolic demands and stress. In addition, injury to myelin prompts a regenerative response that leads to the formation of new myelin sheaths. However, the signals regulating effective remyelination by oligodendrocytes are still not completely understood. Here, we report that oligodendrocytes can internalize exogenous myelin both in vitro and in vivo, which leads to an increase in their proliferation and differentiation when their functions are not compromised. RNA sequencing reveals that myelin debris alters oligodendrocyte transcriptional profile, suppressing immune-related pathways and de novo cholesterol and fatty acid biosynthesis, while inducing lipid droplet formation to store and process internalized myelin particles. As a result, progression of the oligodendroglial lineage is enhanced in primary cell cultures, as shown by increased viability, proliferation and differentiation. Oligodendrocytes also acquire a more differentiated phenotype, with larger cell areas, a more complex morphology and myelination of synthetic nanofibers. Stereotaxic injection of fluorescent myelin into mouse cortex shows internalization by microglia and, to a lesser extent, by oligodendroglia. Notably, in the zebrafish model, ventricular injections of myelin also increase the number of ventral oligodendrocytes in the spinal cord, further supporting that myelin can promote lineage progression. These findings challenge the classical view that myelin debris intrinsically inhibits oligodendrocyte proliferation, suggesting instead that oligodendrocytes can use myelin to support self-renewal and maturation, acting as a trophic factor in the absence of pathological cues.

">Correctness is its own reward: bootstrapping error signals in self-guided reinforcement learning</a></h4>

              
                Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a compelling account of how agents learn complex behaviors by trial and error, yet RL is predicated on the existence of a reward function provided by the agent's environment. By contrast, many skills are learned without external guidance, posing a challenge to RL's ability to account for self-directed learning. For instance, juvenile male zebra finches first memorize and then train themselves to reproduce the song of an adult male tutor through extensive practice. This process is believed to be guided by an internally computed assessment of performance quality, though the mechanism and development of this signal remain unknown. Here, we propose that, contrary to prevailing assumptions, tutor song memorization and performance assessment are subserved by the same neural circuit, one trained to predictively cancel tutor song. To test this hypothesis, we built models of a local forebrain circuit that learns to use contextual input from premotor regions to cancel tutor song auditory input via plasticity at different synaptic loci. We found that, after learning, excitatory projection neurons in these circuits exhibited population error codes signaling mismatches between the tutor song memory and birds' own performance, and these signals best matched experimental data when networks were trained with anti-Hebbian plasticity in the recurrent pathway through inhibitory interneurons. We also found that model learning proceeds in two stages, with an initial phase of sharpening error sensitivity followed by a fine-tuning period in which error responses to the tutor song are minimized. Finally, we showed that the error signal produced by this model can train a simple RL agent to replicate the spectrograms of adult bird songs. Together, our results suggest that purely local learning via predictive cancellation suffices for bootstrapping error signals capable of guiding self-directed learning of natural behaviors.

">Mapping the visual cortex with Zebra noise and wavelets</a></h4>

              
                Studies of the early visual system often require characterizing the visual preferences of large populations of neurons. This task typically requires multiple stimuli such as sparse noise and drifting gratings, each of which probe only a limited set of visual features. Here we introduce a new dynamic stimulus with sharp-edged stripes called Zebra noise and a new analysis model based on wavelets, and show that in combination they are highly efficient for mapping multiple aspects of the visual preferences of thousands of neurons. We used two-photon calcium imaging to record the activity of neurons in the mouse visual cortex. Zebra noise elicited strong responses that were more repeatable than those evoked by traditional stimuli. The wavelet-based model captured the repeatable aspects of the resulting responses, providing measures of neuronal tuning for multiple stimulus features: position, orientation, size, spatial frequency, drift rate, and direction. The method proved efficient, requiring only 3 minutes of stimulation (repeated 3 times) to characterize the tuning of thousands of neurons across visual areas. In combination, the Zebra noise stimulus and the wavelet-based model provide a broadly applicable toolkit for the rapid characterization of visual representations, promising to accelerate future studies of visual function.

">Goal Uncertainty Attenuates Sensorimotor Adaptation</a></h4>

              
                Implicit sensorimotor adaptation - the automatic correction of movement errors through feedback and practice - is driven by a perceptual prediction error, the mismatch between the perceived movement outcome and its intended goal. While perceptual uncertainty is known to attenuate adaptation, the impact of goal uncertainty on adaptation remains unknown. We employed a visuomotor adaptation task that isolates implicit adaptation (N = 180), manipulating goal uncertainty by varying how precisely the goal's midpoint could be identified. Display format was varied independently to control for the objective size of visual features, and targets were hidden at movement onset, ensuring identical visual input at the moment the error was experienced. We found that goal uncertainty significantly attenuated implicit adaptation, independent of low-level visual and kinematic features. Together, these results demonstrate that a precise internal representation of the goal is essential for supporting implicit sensorimotor adaptation.

">No Risky Bets: The Brain Avoids All-In Predictions During Naturalistic Multitalker Listening</a></h4>

              
                Speech comprehension requires dealing with variability and uncertainty, especially when we are not familiar with the talker. Listeners achieve robust speech comprehension by tracking acoustic variability across talkers and implementing predictions based on their prior knowledge and contextual information. However, how perceptual adaptation to speech and predictive processing influence each other is still largely unknown. In this EEG study, we examined how listeners process continuous speech when exposed to a single familiar talker (Single condition) versus multiple unfamiliar talkers (Multi condition), all with native Italian pronunciation. By applying multivariate Temporal Response Function (TRF), we aimed to determine whether increased talker variability in the Multi condition influences phonemic encoding and predictive processing, as indexed by neural responses to cohort entropy (phonological uncertainty among lexical candidates) and semantic surprisal (lexical prediction error). Results showed increased neural responses to phonemic categories and to cohort entropy in the Multi than in the Single condition. These effects suggest that acoustic variability across talkers increases uncertainty in perceiving individual phonemes, prompting the brain to avoid committing to specific lexical candidates during word processing. Importantly, semantic surprisal responses were comparable between conditions, indicating that the modulation primarily affects early stages of processing. This study provided a critical test for how listeners compensate for increased bottom-up uncertainty by implementing probabilistic predictions during language comprehension. Our findings also offer insights into the flexibility of the human speech processing system in dynamically adapting to variable social and acoustic environments.

">Cortical tracking of connected speech is interactively modulated by top-down predictions and bottom-up signal quality</a></h4>

              
                Prediction facilitates speech comprehension, but how predictions are combined with sensory input during perception remains unclear. Prior studies suggest that prediction error computations, which represent the difference between heard and expected speech sound, play a central role in speech perception. However, these studies often rely on non-ecological listening conditions, involving isolated words predicted by artificial cues. In two experiments, we presented male and female participants with semantically coherent sentences that ended in words of varying predictability. We also manipulated the signal quality of the final word by applying time-specific degradation. Using linear encoding models of EEG responses, we found that neural representations of speech features were jointly influenced by top-down predictions and bottom-up signal quality. Specifically, for unpredicted final words, increasing signal quality resulted in enhanced neural tracking of spectral and temporal modulations. In contrast, for strongly predicted final words, greater signal quality led to reduced tracking of speech modulations. Computational simulations revealed that this interaction is consistent with prediction error computations, but not with alternative models such as signal sharpening. These findings extend the evidence for prediction error computations to more naturalistic listening situations.

">Proprioceptive integration in motor control</a></h4>

              
                Muscle vibration alters both perceived limb position and velocity by increasing type Ia afferent firing rates, although these afferents mainly encode velocity. Predictive frameworks of sensori-motor control, such as Active Inference and Optimal Feedback Control, suggest that velocity signals should inform position estimates. Such a function would predict that errors in perceived limb position and velocity should be correlated, but this prediction remains empirically underexplored. We hypothesized that an online evaluation of the integral of sensed velocity influences the perceived arm position during active movements. Such a mechanism would explain how vibratory stimulation of velocity-sensitive Ia afferents leads to the classic pattern of biased movement endpoint accuracy. Using a virtual reality-based reaching task, we investigated how vibration-biased proprioceptive feedback influences voluntary movement control. Our results suggest that muscle vibration biases perceived movement velocity, with downstream effects on perceived limb position and reflexive corrections of movement speed. We found that (i) antagonist vibration during active movement caused participants to both overestimate their movement speed while also slowing down, (ii) movement speed and endpoint errors were correlated, with muscle vibration affecting both, and (iii) adjustments in movement speed to muscle vibration are sufficiently fast to be reflexive. Together, these findings support the hypothesis that proprioceptive velocity signals are integrated to augment inference of position, consistent with predictive frameworks of sensorimotor control.

">Longitudinal Investigation of Structural and Resting-State Effective Connectivity Alterations in a Non-Human Primate Model of Huntington's Disease</a></h4>

              
                Huntington's disease (HD) is a genetic neurodegenerative disorder caused by expanded CAG repeats in the huntingtin gene which produce a mutant huntingtin (mHTT) protein that contributes to progressive striatal, cortical, and white-matter atrophy, resulting in motor dysfunction and cognitive decline. Recently, a non-human primate (NHP) model of HD was developed via stereotaxic delivery of an adeno-associated viral vector expressing 85 CAG repeats (85Q) into the striatum. This model recapitulates several neuropathological changes and symptoms observed in people with HD (PwHD) including chorea and mild cognitive impairment. A previous longitudinal, multimodal MRI investigation in this model revealed volumetric and resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC) changes compared to controls, in key regions involved in HD, over the course of 30 months. We aimed to study longitudinal changes in structural connectivity (SC), obtained from diffusion MRI scans from the same animals, comparing the 85Q animals to the control (Buffer) group. Additionally, going beyond the correlative rs-FC analyses, we investigated changes in causal, inter-regional functional interactions by estimating effective connectivity (EC) from rs functional MRI scans, constrained to strong structural connections. We found that the SC between basal ganglia regions and the cortex was reduced in the 85Q primates compared to the Buffer group at 14-months post virus injection, aligning with the pathological process observed in PwHD at later stages of the disease. EC from the caudate and putamen to the motor cortex was significantly reduced in the 85Q animals as early as 3-months post-injection providing novel insights into early alterations in causal functional interactions.

">Off-target effects of PLX5622 revealed: mixing microglial function in anesthesia and addiction withdrawal</a></h4>

              
                Microglia have gained increasing attention as important regulators in the brain. Acute microglial depletion using the colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) inhibitor, PLX5622, has become a popular approach to uncover microglial function. PLX5622 treatment has been recently shown to significantly promote anesthetic emergence. In characterizing underlying mechanisms, we found that PLX5622 treatment did not change the global neuronal activity during anesthesia, but robustly enhanced anesthetic metabolism. Moreover, PLX5622 dramatically induced the expression of hepatic enzymes that extensively modify xenobiotic and endobiotic metabolism. Blocking increased enzymatic activity significantly reduced the arousal-promoting effects of PLX5622 in anesthesia, irrespective of microglial elimination. In addition, we demonstrate that enhanced drug metabolism also contributed to PLX5622-induced attenuation in nicotine-withdrawal anxiety. By revealing previously unrecognized effects of PLX5622, our findings raise caution in interpreting data generated from PLX5622 treatment and bring forward the need for designing more specific CSF1R inhibitors.

">Spine-brain dynamics during human defensive threat-reactions</a></h4>

              
                Synchrony between central and autonomic nervous system responses during threat rely on spine-brain interactions. Activation of the parasympathetic autonomic nervous system during acute threat has been linked to optimized action preparation and longer-term stress-resilience. However, it is unclear how this is orchestrated by spine-brain interactions during our widely used models of threat conditioning. Here we used a well-established threat conditioning procedure to test whether freezing-related bradycardia modulates the strength of motor- and sensory-relevant spinal-brain connectivity patterns. Conditioning elicited the expected autonomic and psychophysiological responses, with significant bradycardia and heightened differentiation between conditioned stimuli. Heart rate bradycardia modulated activity in the cingulate cortex and spinal cord, emphasizing their role in freezing. Notably, bradycardia-modulated spinal cord activity during threat was functionally coupled with motor cortex activity, suggesting a preparatory response for defensive actions. Establishing these effects for the first time in humans helps discovery of biomarkers for threat coping-relevant body-brain interactions, essential for clinical evaluations.

">Mild subcortical stroke induces widespread astrogliosis independent of microglia and age</a></h4>

              
                Ischemic stroke induces a plethora of pathophysiological changes, including neuroinflammation and chronic cerebrovascular dysfunction. In humans, even small, silent strokes can trigger these pathologies, which can spread to brain regions far beyond the infarct and persist chronically, ultimately worsening prognosis and increasing the risk for vascular dementia and Alzheimers disease. The cause of this extensive pathology is unknown, but reactive astrocytes and microglia are likely contributors. Here, we describe an optimized short-duration middle cerebral artery occlusion model that produces a clinically relevant small stroke confined to subcortical regions, similar to most silent strokes in humans. We termed this model the mild subcortical infarct (MSCI). We then mapped the spatiotemporal extent of reactive astrocytes and microglia during the sub-acute period (1, 3, and 7 days) following MSCI. We observed that reactive astrogliosis develops more rapidly and spreads more extensively, permeating the entire middle cerebral artery territory, compared to the reactive microglial response following this small infarct. Microglial depletion resulted in larger infarct sizes but did not prevent the reactive astrocytes, suggesting that ischemia-driven astrogliosis is largely microglia-independent. Lastly, we show that aging mice exposed to MSCI exhibit a comparably strong response of reactive astrocytes and microglia as young mice. We propose that MSCI is a novel and valuable model for examining the subtle yet highly important chronic effects of stroke. It may be especially useful for investigating the influence of reactive astrogliosis on pathologies like neuroinflammation and cerebrovascular dysfunction in regions distal from the primary injury site.

">Complexes between Netrin G Ligands and Chiral Nanoparticles Promote Axons Regeneration under Near-Infrared Illumination</a></h4>

              
                Chiral nanoparticles combine functionalities of inorganic materials and large biomacromolecules enabling stimulation of neurons. However, multiple challenges remain in their use for central nervous system including identifying suitable cell signaling pathways and traversing the blood-brain barrier. In this study, we show that glutathione-coated Ni(OH)2; nanoparticles form nanoscale complexes with netrin-G1 ligands (NGL-1), critical for neuronal regeneration. NGL-1 features a semispherical pocket with a 2.5 nm radius of curvature, fitting well with nanoparticles sized ca. 3 nm. D-NPs with D-glutathione surface ligands activate D-glutathione receptors on epithelial cells, facilitating their transport into the brain. When illuminated with 980 nm light, the nanoparticle-protein complex stimulates axon regeneration through localized IGF-1 production. This approach successfully regenerated (a) hippocampal neurons in Alzheimer's disease mice and (b) dorsal root ganglion neurons in spinal cord-injured mice. The nanoparticles were thoroughly tested for safety and excreted intact. The local, rather than systemic, IGF-1 up-regulation minimizes its side effects.

">Reduced Model-Based Control in Gambling Disorder Despite Intact Neural Value and Task Structure Representations</a></h4>

              
                Disordered gambling has been linked to impairments in goal-directed (model-based) control and reinforcement learning. Here we investigated the potential neural basis of this impairment using a sequential reinforcement learning task (modified two-step-task), computational modeling, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in individuals exhibiting symptoms of disordered gambling (GD) and matched healthy controls (HC, n=30 per group). Model-agnostic analyses replicated the effects of reduced performance and reduced model-based control in the gambling group, both in terms of choice and response time effects. Computational modeling of choice behavior confirmed that this effect was due to reduced model-based control in the gambling group. Analyses of choices and response times using drift diffusion modeling revealed a more complex pattern, where behavioral impairments in the gambling group were linked to changes across several parameters reflecting drift rate modulation and asymptote, as well as non-decision time. Despite these pronounced behavioral differences, the gambling group exhibited largely intact neural effects related to the task transition structure, reward feedback and trial-to-trial behavioral adjustments. Results are discussed with respect to current neurocomputational models of behavioral dysregulation in disordered gambling.

">Distinct neurogenic pathways shape the diversification and mosaic organization of cortical output channels</a></h4>

              
                A hallmark of the mammalian cerebral cortex is its vast and diverse efferent projections across cortical areas mediated by extratelencephalic (ET) neurons that broadcast to myriad subcortical regions. ET neurons are generated from two fundamentally distinct neurogenic pathways: direct neurogenesis (dNG-ETd) from radial glia progenitors and indirect neurogenesis (iNG-ETi) from intermediate progenitors, but the contribution of ETd and ETi to the organization of cortical output channels is unknown. Leveraging a novel lineage-based genetic strategy enabling differential viral access to ETd and ETi in the same mouse, we show that iNG-ETi massively amplifies and diversifies dNG-ETd across the cortex. While ETd projections are largely restricted to the forebrain and midbrain structures, ETi greatly amplifies and diversifies these projections and overwhelmingly dominates the innervation of hindbrain and spinal cord. This is exemplified in an area-specific pattern by ETi dominance to brainstem and spinal action diversification and execution centers from motor areas, to major sensory processing stations along lemniscal pathways from sensory areas, and to pallial, hypothalamic and neuromodulatory structures from high order areas. Corticofugal subpopulations in multiple areas are derived from only ETi, indicating the generation of novel projection types by iNG over dNG. Furthermore, area-specific ETi, but not ETd, spinal projection pattern is sculpted from the massive pruning of an early cortex-wide population during postnatal development. Together, these results uncover that two foundational neurogenic pathways with distinct evolutionary history differentially shape the area-specific diversification and mosaic organization of cortical output channels.

">Dynamic prioritization reshapes neural geometries for action in human working memory</a></h4>

              
                Prior work has shown that control brain regions encode upcoming novel instructed actions. Similarly, visual working memory (WM) representations can reflect different priority states. However, it remains unknown whether the priority status of WM-guided novel actions similarly modulates their neural coding format, and how such dynamics unfold over time. We addressed these questions using EEG while human participants performed two consecutive choice reaction tasks. At the start of each trial, participants encoded two novel stimulus-response (S-R) mappings. A cue then indicated whether these mappings would be relevant immediately ("current" condition), later after an intervening task ("prospective"), or after a free delay ("delayed"). Using multivariate pattern analysis, we found that the S-R category was decodable in all conditions during relevant time windows. Critically, pattern similarity analyses revealed that while mere maintenance demands allow for temporary preservation of neural codes (i.e., between current and delayed trials), shielding from interference (i.e., prospective trials) induced significant alterations to the neural code. Further exploration of the representational geometry revealed that priority status gained prominence dynamically over S-R category coding when preparing for such shielding demands. Importantly, some of these changes emerged anticipatorily, prior to target onset. Overall, our results show that, similar to visual WM, the priority of intended actions dynamically and anticipatorily reshapes their neural format. They further reveal how different demands induce content geometries compatible with previously proposed coding schemes, and that such representational changes can be implemented flexibly in time.

">A Bioinformatic Analysis of BAG Protein Interactors and Pathways in Alzheimers and Parkinsons Disease</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are the two most common neurodegenerative disorders. While the symptoms and general etiology may be different, these two diseases share significant common features in terms of their disease pathogenesis. Within the scope of neurodegenerative disorders, the Bcl-2 associated athanogene (BAG) family proteins and associated interactors have been a key area of focus. The BAG family is a group of proteins that contain at least one evolutionarily conserved BAG domain. Despite this similarity, their interactions and functions can vary widely. So far, research has predominantly scrutinized individual BAG proteins, rather than explore potential cooperative actions among family members. Some BAG family members may function together thereby indicating potential interactions within this family. Although connections among BAG members have been observed, their role in neurodegenerative disorders, such as AD and PD, remains largely uncharacterized. This mini review explores the common pathways, intersections, and differences within these interactions as well as their link to AD and PD. Using computational techniques to mine transcriptomic data, several groupings of pathways that these BAG family members are involved in were identified in the context of AD and PD. Understanding these pathways and their relationships may uncover potential gaps in current research and help identify novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of these neurodegenerative diseases.

">Modulation of huntingtin S421 phosphorylation in a Huntington's disease mouse model and its detection in nonhuman primate cerebrospinal fluid</a></h4>

              
                Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease caused by the pathologic expansion of a CAG repeat in the first exon of the huntingtin (HTT) gene, resulting in a huntingtin (HTT) protein with an expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) tract. Phosphorylation at residue S421 (pS421) is one of the post-translational modifications proposed to influence the biology of wild-type and mutant (m)HTT, such as HTT stability and clearance, HTT subcellular localization, mHTT toxicity, and regulation of HTT function in axonal transport. However, the detection and quantification of S421-HTT phosphorylation in relevant biological contexts have remained challenging and the consequences of pS421 in HD pathogenesis remains unclear. Here we report the development of a novel ultrasensitive immunoassay enabling the specific and sensitive detection of pS421-HTT in a variety of biologically relevant contexts. With this assay we conducted a longitudinal assessment of pS421 levels in tissues from a mouse model of HD to investigate the relationship between S421 phosphorylation and phenotypic progression. We also identified PRKACA, the cAMP-regulated catalytic  subunit of PKA, as a kinase capable of phosphorylating S421-HTT, demonstrating its ability to regulate endogenous pS421 in human cells. Finally, we exploited the sensitivity of the assay to detect endogenous pS421-HTT in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from nonhuman primates, showing for the first time that phosphorylation at S421-HTT can be detected in this bio-fluid. These reagents and assay will enable investigation of the biological consequence and the relevance of pS421 in the natural history of HD.

Using a quiet and motion-tolerant zero-echo time functional magnetic resonance imaging technique, we examined brain-wide cross-sensory responses to whisker pad stimulation in awake and anesthetized rats. Our results indicate that whisker pad stimulation activated not only the whisker-mediated tactile system, but also auditory, visual, high-order, and cerebellar regions, demonstrating brain-wide cross-sensory and associative activity. Based on response characteristics, non-core regions responded to stimulation in a markedly different way compared to the primary sensory system, likely reflecting distinct encoding modes among primary sensory, cross-sensory, and integrative processing. Lastly, while low-order sensory activity was detectable under anesthesia, high-order processing and the complex differences between primary, cross-sensory, and associative systems were evident only in the awake state.

                <p>by Ruihao Gong, Zijian Feng, Yanyun Zhang</p>

The resurgence of H5Nx reassortment has caused multiple epidemics resulting in severe disease even death in wild birds and poultry. Assessing H5Nx reassortment risk is crucial for designing targeted interventions and enhancing preparedness efforts to manage H5Nx outbreaks effectively. However, the complexity in H5Nx reassortment, driven by the diversity of influenza A viruses (IAVs) and wide range of hosts, has hindered the effective quantification of reassortment risk. In this study, we utilized a network approach to explore the reassortment history using a large-scale dataset. By inferring genomic homogeneity among IAVs, we constructed an IAVs homologous network with reassortment history embedded within it. We estimated the communities within the IAVs homologous network to represent the reassortment risk of various viruses, revealing diverse reassortment risks across different H5Nx viruses. Our analysis also identified the primary hosts contributing to reassortment: domestic poultry in China, and wild birds in North America and Europe. These primary hosts are critical targets for future H5Nx reassortment interventions. Our study provides a framework for quantifying and ranking H5Nx reassortment risk, contributing to enhanced preparedness and prevention efforts.

                <p>by Shingo Gibo, Teiji Kunihiro, Tetsuo Hatsuda, Gen Kurosawa</p>

Numerous biological processes accelerate as temperatures increase, but the period of circadian rhythms remains constant, known as temperature compensation, while synchronizing with the 24h light-dark cycle. We theoretically explore the possible relevance of waveform distortions in circadian gene-protein dynamics to the temperature compensation and synchronization. Our analysis of the Goodwin model provides a coherent explanation of most of temperature compensation hypotheses. Using the renormalization group method, we analytically demonstrate that the decreasing phase of circadian protein oscillations should lengthen with increasing temperature, leading to waveform distortions to maintain a stable period. This waveform-period correlation also occurs in other oscillators like Lotka-Volterra, van der Pol models, and a realistic model for mammalian circadian rhythms. A reanalysis of known data nicely confirms our findings on waveform distortion and its impact on synchronization range. Thus we conclude that circadian rhythm waveforms are fundamental to both temperature compensation and synchronization.

                <p>by Shunxiang Fan, Tim Newbold, Jan C. Axmacher, Charlotte L. Outhwaite, Yi Zou, Zhenrong Yu, Yunhui Liu</p>

Nitrogen (N) deposition is known to strongly modify biogeochemical cycles and trophic interactions, in turn altering ecosystem functioning and plant diversity around the globe. However, our understanding of N deposition effects on arthropod diversity remains limited. Here, we investigate how N deposition impacts the diversity of arthropods by combining biodiversity data from the PREDICTS database with data on global N deposition and land cover using mixed-effects models. We then explore the potential for semi-natural and natural habitats (‘SNH’) to buffer against potential N deposition-linked biodiversity losses. N deposition has a negative effect on arthropod biodiversity. Both, species richness and abundance are significantly reduced in areas of high levels of N deposition when compared to areas of low N deposition, with responses varying across different land-use types. The strongest negative effects of N deposition on arthropod diversity were observed in locations where the local land use entails the least anthropogenic modification. At the same time, with the exception of cropland-dominated landscapes, increases in the amount of SNH in the surrounding landscape reduced arthropod biodiversity losses associated with N deposition. We conclude that SNH can play an important role in mitigating the negative effects of N deposition on arthropod diversity, with the conservation and creation of these habitats promoting arthropod diversity even under high levels of N deposition.

In Gram-negative bacteria, the uptake and export of a wide range of molecules, including antibiotics, is facilitated by porins and efflux pumps. Because of their role in regulating small molecule permeability of the outer and inner membrane, these transport machineries are tightly regulated at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. However, regulation of transport by external chemical cues remains poorly understood. Here we investigated transcriptional regulation of three prominent transporter genes in <i>Escherichia coli</i> across 94 defined chemical cues, and simultaneously mapped the contributions of the key regulators MarA, SoxS and Rob to promoter activity. One third of all tested compounds triggered transcriptional changes, the majority of which were previously unknown. Importantly, we exposed main drivers of transport control in <i>E. coli</i>, e.g., bacteriostatic but not bactericidal antibiotics trigger the expression of efflux pumps, and Rob contributes to ~1/3 of all measured transcriptional changes, thereby emerging as a more prominent regulator of transport than previously thought. We showcase the potential of our resource by elucidating the molecular mechanism of antibiotic antagonisms with widely consumed caffeine in <i>E. coli</i>. Altogether, our analysis provides a quantitative overview of how different regulators orchestrate the transcriptional response of major transport determinants to environmental chemical cues.
