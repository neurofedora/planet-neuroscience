<p>by Annett Erkes, Stefanie Mücke, Maik Reschke, Jens Boch, Jan Grau</p>

Plant-pathogenic <i>Xanthomonas</i> bacteria secrete transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs) into host cells, where they act as transcriptional activators on plant target genes to support bacterial virulence. TALEs have a unique modular DNA-binding domain composed of tandem repeats. Two amino acids within each tandem repeat, termed repeat-variable diresidues, bind to contiguous nucleotides on the DNA sequence and determine target specificity. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for TALE target prediction to identify potential virulence targets. Our approach accounts for recent findings concerning TALE targeting, including frame-shift binding by repeats of aberrant lengths, and the flexible strand orientation of target boxes relative to the transcription start of the downstream target gene. The computational model can account for dependencies between adjacent RVD positions. Model parameters are learned from the wealth of quantitative data that have been generated over the last years. We benchmark the novel approach, termed PrediTALE, using RNA-seq data after <i>Xanthomonas</i> infection in rice, and find an overall improvement of prediction performance compared with previous approaches. Using PrediTALE, we are able to predict several novel putative virulence targets. However, we also observe that no target genes are predicted by any prediction tool for several TALEs, which we term orphan TALEs for this reason. We postulate that one explanation for orphan TALEs are incomplete gene annotations and, hence, propose to replace promoterome-wide by genome-wide scans for target boxes. We demonstrate that known targets from promoterome-wide scans may be recovered by genome-wide scans, whereas the latter, combined with RNA-seq data, are able to detect putative targets independent of existing gene annotations.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/zalOH3GnNWw" width="1" />

<p>by Emma D. Wilson, Sean R. Anderson, Paul Dean, John Porrill</p>

Substantial experimental evidence suggests the cerebellum is involved in calibrating sensorimotor maps. Consistent with this involvement is the well-known, but little understood, massive cerebellar projection to maps in the superior colliculus. Map calibration would be a significant new role for the cerebellum given the ubiquity of map representations in the brain, but how it could perform such a task is unclear. Here we investigated a dynamic method for map calibration, based on electrophysiological recordings from the superior colliculus, that used a standard adaptive-filter cerebellar model. The method proved effective for complex distortions of both unimodal and bimodal maps, and also for predictive map-based tracking of moving targets. These results provide the first computational evidence for a novel role for the cerebellum in dynamic sensorimotor map calibration, of potential importance for coordinate alignment during ongoing motor control, and for map calibration in future biomimetic systems. This computational evidence also provides testable experimental predictions concerning the role of the connections between cerebellum and superior colliculus in previously observed dynamic coordinate transformations.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/f7heAWtqEn8" width="1" />

<p>by Jennifer Crodelle, Sofia H. Piltz, Megan Hastings Hagenauer, Victoria Booth</p>

Experimental studies show that human pain sensitivity varies across the 24-hour day, with the lowest sensitivity usually occurring during the afternoon. Patients suffering from neuropathic pain, or nerve damage, experience an inversion in the daily modulation of pain sensitivity, with the highest sensitivity usually occurring during the early afternoon. Processing of painful stimulation occurs in the dorsal horn (DH), an area of the spinal cord that receives input from peripheral tissues via several types of primary afferent nerve fibers. The DH circuit is composed of different populations of neurons, including excitatory and inhibitory interneurons, and projection neurons, which constitute the majority of the output from the DH to the brain. In this work, we develop a mathematical model of the dorsal horn neural circuit to investigate mechanisms for the daily modulation of pain sensitivity. The model describes average firing rates of excitatory and inhibitory interneuron populations and projection neurons, whose activity is directly correlated with experienced pain. Response in afferent fibers to peripheral stimulation is simulated by a Poisson process generating nerve fiber spike trains at variable firing rates. Model parameters for fiber response to stimulation and the excitability properties of neuronal populations are constrained by experimental results found in the literature, leading to qualitative agreement between modeled responses to pain and experimental observations. We validate our model by reproducing the wind-up of pain response to repeated stimulation. We apply the model to investigate daily modulatory effects on pain inhibition, in which response to painful stimuli is reduced by subsequent non-painful stimuli. Finally, we use the model to propose a mechanism for the observed inversion of the daily rhythmicity of pain sensation under neuropathic pain conditions. Underlying mechanisms for the shift in rhythmicity have not been identified experimentally, but our model results predict that experimentally-observed dysregulation of inhibition within the DH neural circuit may be responsible. The model provides an accessible, biophysical framework that will be valuable for experimental and clinical investigations of diverse physiological processes modulating pain processing in humans.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/66XoGNgHN1w" width="1" />

<p>by Tsuyoshi Mikkaichi, Michael R. Yeaman, Alexander Hoffmann, MRSA Systems Immunobiology Group </p>

Persistent bacteremia caused by <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (SA), especially methicillin-resistant SA (MRSA), is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Despite susceptibility phenotypes <i>in vitro</i>, persistent MRSA strains fail to clear with appropriate anti-MRSA therapy during bacteremia <i>in vivo</i>. Thus, identifying the factors that cause such MRSA persistence is of direct and urgent clinical relevance. To address the dynamics of MRSA persistence in the face of host immunity and typical antibiotic regimens, we developed a mathematical model based on the overarching assumption that phenotypic heterogeneity is a hallmark of MRSA persistence. First, we applied an ensemble modeling approach and obtained parameter sets that satisfied the condition of a minimum inoculum dose to establish infection. Second, by simulating with the selected parameter sets under vancomycin therapy which follows clinical practices, we distinguished the models resulting in resolving or persistent bacteremia, based on the total SA exceeding a detection limit after five days of treatment. Third, to find key determinants that discriminate resolving and persistent bacteremia, we applied a machine learning approach and found that the immune clearance rate of persister cells is a key feature. But, fourth, when relapsing bacteremia was considered, the growth rate of persister cells was also found to be a key feature. Finally, we explored pharmacological strategies for persistent and relapsing bacteremia and found that a persister killer, but not a persister formation inhibitor, could provide for an effective cure the persistent bacteremia. Thus, to develop better clinical solutions for MRSA persistence and relapse, our modeling results indicate that we need to better understand the pathogen-host interactions of persister MRSAs <i>in vivo</i>.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/aVMsQDX9bf4" width="1" />

<p>by Guido Zampieri, Supreeta Vijayakumar, Elisabeth Yaneske, Claudio Angione</p>

Omic data analysis is steadily growing as a driver of basic and applied molecular biology research. Core to the interpretation of complex and heterogeneous biological phenotypes are computational approaches in the fields of statistics and machine learning. In parallel, constraint-based metabolic modeling has established itself as the main tool to investigate large-scale relationships between genotype, phenotype, and environment. The development and application of these methodological frameworks have occurred independently for the most part, whereas the potential of their integration for biological, biomedical, and biotechnological research is less known. Here, we describe how machine learning and constraint-based modeling can be combined, reviewing recent works at the intersection of both domains and discussing the mathematical and practical aspects involved. We overlap systematic classifications from both frameworks, making them accessible to nonexperts. Finally, we delineate potential future scenarios, propose new joint theoretical frameworks, and suggest concrete points of investigation for this joint subfield. A multiview approach merging experimental and knowledge-driven omic data through machine learning methods can incorporate key mechanistic information in an otherwise biologically-agnostic learning process.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/WSLW814PUw0" width="1" />

Abstract
<p>Brain computations involve multiple processes by which sensory information is encoded and transformed to drive behavior. These computations are thought to be mediated by dynamic interactions between populations of neurons. Here, we demonstrate that human brains exhibit a reliable sequence of neural interactions during speech production. We use an autoregressive Hidden Markov Model (ARHMM) to identify dynamical network states exhibited by electrocorticographic signals recorded from human neurosurgical patients. Our method resolves dynamic latent network states on a trial-by-trial basis. We characterize individual network states according to the patterns of directional information flow between cortical regions of interest. These network states occur consistently and in a specific, interpretable sequence across trials and subjects: the data support the hypothesis of a fixed-length visual processing state, followed by a variable-length language state, and then by a terminal articulation state. This empirical evidence validates classical psycholinguistic theories that have posited such intermediate states during speaking. It further reveals these state dynamics are not localized to one brain area or one sequence of areas, but are instead a network phenomenon.</p>

Abstract<p>Grasping is an action engraved in the human genome, enabling newborn infants to hang from a monkey-bar immediately after birth. The grasp force provides rich information about the brain’s control of arm movements. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the grasp force increases to improve the hand’s movement precision during reaching. In two reaching experiments, subjects increased grasp force to suppress movement imprecision that arose from both self-generated motor noise and from an unpredictable environment. Furthermore, the grasp force did not increase constantly, but increased specifically along the movement where the hand’s deviation was greatest. The increased grasp was premeditated and wasn’t a reaction to environmental forces, suggesting that the central nervous system has a predictive, state-dependent model of movement precision during reaching. The grasp force provides a high temporal resolution and calibration-less estimate of movement precision adaptation.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Humans use their hands on a daily basis to interact with the environment. Many tasks require the hand’s movement to be precise. Standard measures of movement precision resort to measuring the stiffness of the arm, which is notoriously difficult to measure during motion. We show that the power grasp force is correlated with movement precision, and that it provides a real-time measure of movement precision adaptation. Furthermore, the grasp force measure reveals that the brain has a state-dependent adaptation of movement precision, such that it increased grasped force in locations where the hand’s deviation was greatest.</p>

<p>Global brain activity self-organizes into discrete patterns characterized by
distinct behavioral observables and modes of information processing. The human
thalamocortical system is a densely connected network where local neural
activation reciprocally influences coordinated collective dynamics. We
introduce a semi-empirical model to investigate the relationship between
regional activation and long-range functional connectivity in the different
brain states visited during the natural wake-sleep cycle. Our model combines
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, in vivo estimates of
structural connectivity, and anatomically-informed priors that constrain the
independent variation of regional activation. As expected, priors based on
functionally coherent networks resulted in the best fit between empirical and
simulated brain activity. We show that sleep progressively divided the cortex
into regions presenting opposite dynamical behavior: frontoparietal regions
approached a bifurcation towards local oscillatory dynamics, while sensorimotor
regions presented stable dynamics governed by noise. In agreement with human
electrophysiological experiments, sleep onset induced subcortical deactivation
and uncoupling, which was subsequently reversed for deeper stages. Finally, we
introduced external forcing of variable intensity to simulate external
perturbations, and identifiedthe key regionsespecially relevant for the
recovery of wakefulness from deep sleep. Our model represents sleep as a state
where long-range decoupling and regional deactivation coexist with the latent
capacity for a rapid transition towards wakefulness. The mechanistic insights
provided by our simulations allow the in silico parametric exploration of such
transitions in terms of external perturbations, with potential applications for
the control of physiological and pathological brain states.

<p>Sleep slow waves are known to participate in memory consolidation, yet slow
waves occurring under anesthetized states present no positive effects on
memory. Here, we shed light onto this paradox, based on a combination of
extracellular recordings in vivo, in vitro and computational models. We find
two types of slow waves, based on analyzing the temporal patterns of successive
slow-wave events. The first type of slow waves is seen during sleep, while the
second type prevails in anesthetized states. Network models of spiking neurons
predict that the two slow wave types emerge due to a different gain on
inhibitory vs excitatory cells and that different levels of spike-frequency
adaptation in excitatory cells can account for dynamical distinctions between
the two types. This prediction was tested in vitro by varying adaptation
strength using an agonist of acetylcholine receptors, which demonstrated a
neuromodulatory switch between the two types of slow waves. Finally, we show
that the first type of slow-wave dynamics is more sensitive to external
stimuli, which can explain how slow waves in sleep and anesthesia
differentially affect memory consolidation, as well as provide a link between
slow-wave dynamics and memory diseases.

Background: There is accumulating evidence suggesting a connection between the gut and Parkinson’s disease (PD). Gut microbiota may play an important role in the intestinal lesions in PD patients.
Objective: This study aims to determine whether gut microbiota differs between PD patients and healthy controls in Northeast of China, and to identify the factors that influence the changes in the gut microbiota. 
Methods: We enrolled 51 PD patients and 48 healthy controls in this study. Microbial species in stool samples were determined through 16S-rRNA gene sequencing. Dietary intakes were collected from subset of 42 patients and 23 controls using a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Gut microbiota species richness, diversity, differential abundance of individual taxa between PD patients and controls, and the relationship between the gut microbiota abundance and the dietary and clinical factors were analyzed.
Results: PD patients showed decreased species richness, phylogenetic diversity, β-diversity, and altered relative abundance in several taxa compared to the controls. PD-associated clinical scores appeared to be the most influential factors that correlated with the abundance of a variety of taxa. The most consistent findings suggested by multiple analyses used in this study were the increase of Akkermansia and the decrease of Lactobacillus in PD patients in Northeast China.
Conclusion: Gut microbiota significantly differed between a group of PD patients and healthy controls in Northeast China, with decreased species richness, phylogenetic diversity, β-diversity, and altered relative abundance in several taxa compared to the controls.

Indirect traumatic optic neuropathy (ITON) is a condition that is often associated with traumatic brain injury and can result in significant vision loss due to degeneration of retinal ganglion cell axons at the time of injury or within the ensuing weeks. We used a mouse model of eye-directed air-blast exposure to characterize the histopathology of blast-induced ITON. This injury caused a transient elevation of intraocular pressure with subsequent retinal ganglion cell death and axon degeneration that was similar throughout the length of the optic nerve. Deficits in active anterograde axon transport to the superior colliculus accompanied axon degeneration and first appeared in peripheral representations of the retina. Glial area in the optic nerve increased early after injury and involved a later period of additional expansion. The increase in area involved a transient change in astrocyte organization independent of axon degeneration. While levels of many cytokines and chemokines did not change, IL-1α and IL-1β increased in both the optic nerve and retina. In contrast, glaucoma shows distal to proximal axon degeneration with astrocyte remodeling and increases in many cytokines and chemokines. Further, direct traumatic optic neuropathies have a clear site of injury with rapid, progressive axon degeneration and cell death. These data show that blast-induced ITON is a distinct neuropathology from other optic neuropathies.

The choice of the reference electrode scheme is an important step in event-related potential (ERP) analysis. In order to explore the optimal electroencephalogram reference electrode scheme for the ERP signal related to facial recognition, we investigated the influence of average reference (AR), mean mastoid reference (MM) and Reference Electrode Standardization Technique (REST) on the N170 component via statistical analysis, statistical parametric scalp mappings (SPSM) and source analysis. The statistical results showed that the choice of reference electrode scheme has little effect on N170 latency (p&gt;0.05), but has a greater impact on N170 amplitude (p&lt;0.05). ANOVA results show that, for the three references scheme, there was statistically significant difference between N170 latency and amplitude induced by the unfamiliar face and that induced by the scrambled face (p&lt;0.05). Specifically, the SPSM results show an anterior and a temporo-occipital distribution for AR and REST, with just anterior distribution shown for MM. However, the circumstantial evidence provided by source analysis is more consistent with SPSM of AR and REST. These results indicate that the experimental results under the AR and REST references are more objective and appropriate. Thus, it is more appropriate to use AR and REST reference scheme settings in future facial recognition experiments.

To maximize brain plasticity after stroke, several rehabilitation strategies have been explored, including the use of intensive motor training, motor imagery, and action observation. Growing evidence of the positive impact of virtual reality (VR) techniques on recovery following stroke has been shown. However, most VR tools are designed to exploit active movement, and hence patients with low level of motor control cannot fully benefit from them. Consequently, the idea of directly training the central nervous system has been promoted by utilizing motor-imagery (MI) based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). To date, detailed information on which VR strategies lead to successful functional recovery is still largely missing, and very little is known about how to optimally integrate BCI and VR paradigms for stroke rehabilitation. The purpose of this study was to examine the efficacy of a BCI-VR system using a MI paradigm for post-stroke upper limb rehabilitation on functional assessments, and related changes in MI ability and brain imaging. To achieve this, a 60 years old male chronic stroke patient was recruited. The patient underwent a 3-week intervention in a clinical environment, resulting in 10 BCI-VR training sessions. The patient was assessed before and after intervention, as well as on a one-month follow-up, in terms of clinical scales and brain imaging using functional MRI (fMRI). Consistent with prior research, we found important improvements in upper extremity scores (Fugl-Meyer) and identified increases in brain activation measured by fMRI that suggest neuroplastic changes in brain motor networks. This study expands on the current body of evidence as more data are needed on the effect of this type of interventions not only on functional improvement but also through brain imaging to study the effect of the intervention on plasticity.

Human motor response time is determined by the matureness of the preceding neural motor preparation process.  In the current study, we characterize the optimal temporal boundaries required for the motor preparation process, and its impact on the overall motor response time. In particular, we contrasted short and long preparation durations by measuring the resulting differences in motor response times, in an attempt to find whether an optimal preparation time exists. Using a “Timed Response” paradigm, we presented participants with varying planning intervals prior to a requested motor response, and studied their effect on the timing of initiation of the following movement. We found that, as expected, reaction time shortens as more planning time is provided, yet only until reaching a minimal response time, after which additional preparation time increases the motor response time, thus creating a U-shaped behavioral function. Furthermore, since the minimal response time was found to be an individual characteristic, we suggest that there is an individual optimal time window for motor planning. The existence and personal timing of an optimal timing window can assist in the characterization and medical surveillance of patients with neurological disorders.

Children with Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD) have difficulty performing and learning motor skills. Automatic activation of the mirror neuron system (MNS) during action observation and its coupling to the motor output system are important neurophysiological processes that underpin observational motor learning. In the present study we tested the hypothesis that MNS function is disrupted in children with DCD by using sensitive EEG-based measures of MNS activation during action observation. Specifically, we predicted reduced mu-suppression and coherence in DCD compared with typically developing children.  
Neural activation of the motor network was measured by EEG, specifically event-related desynchronization (ERD) of mu rhythms and fronto-parietal coherence. Children (15 DCD / 15 controls) were tested under two task conditions: observational learning (imitation of an observed action) and detection (report a deviant movement after observation). EEG-metrics were compared between groups using linear mixed-effects models.  
As predicted, children with DCD showed lower levels of mu suppression and reduced modulation of coherence during the observational learning task compared with their non-DCD peers. Notably, mu suppression was reduced in DCD over the entire imitation task (repetitions, and both observation and pause intervals).
Action observation can be used for the acquisition of new motor skills. This form of learning entails the transposition of the observed action to the existing internal representations of the observer’s own motor system. The present neurophysiological results suggest that this process of learning is impaired in children with DCD. Results are discussed in relation to current hypotheses on mechanisms of DCD.

Orientation selectivity is a fundamental property of visual cortical neurons and plays a crucial role in pattern perception. Although many studies have dedicated to explain how the orientation selectivity emerged, the mechanism underlying orientation selectivity is still not clear. In this work, we investigated the synchronization between spikes and local field potentials (LFP) in gamma band, with the aim of providing a new avenue to analyze the orientation selectivity. The experimental data were recorded by utilizing two chronically implanted multi-electrode arrays, where each array consisted of 48 electrodes and was placed over V1 and V4 respectively in two macaques performing a selective visual attention task. An unbiased and robust measure for quantifying the synchronization between spikes and LFP was employed in the analysis process, which is termed as spike-triggered correlation matrix synchronization (SCMS) and performs reliably for limited samples of data. We observed the spike-LFP synchronization in three cases, i.e. spikes and LFP in V1, spikes and LFP in V4, spikes in V4 and LFP in V1. From the orientation tuning curves based on the spike-LFP synchronization, it is found that there is a strong correlation between the synchronization and grating orientation. The neurons in both V1 and V4 exhibit orientation selectivity, but V1 is stronger. In addition, the spike-LFP synchronization strength between V1 and V4 also shows orientation selectivity to drifting gratings. It means that the synchronization not only reflects the basic features of visual stimulation, but also describes the orientation tuning characteristics of neurons in different regions. Our results suggest that the spike-LFP synchronization can be used as an alternative and effective method to study the mechanism for generating orientation selectivity of visual neurons.

Group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) mediate a range of signaling and plasticity processes in the brain and are of growing importance as potential therapeutic targets in clinical trials for neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders. Fundamental knowledge regarding the functional effects of mGluRs upon pyramidal neurons and interneurons is derived largely from rodent brain, and their effects upon human neurons are predominantly untested. We therefore addressed how group I mGluRs affect microcircuits in human neocortex. We show that activation of group I mGluRs elicits action potential firing in Martinotti cells, which leads to increased synaptic inhibition onto neighboring neurons. Other interneuron types, including fast-spiking interneurons, are depolarized but do not fire action potentials in response to group I mGluR activation. Furthermore, we confirm the existence of group I mGluR-mediated LTD of excitatory synapses in human pyramidal neurons. We propose that the strong increase in inhibition and depression of excitatory synapses upon group I mGluR activation likely results in a shift in the balance between excitation and inhibition in the human cortical network.

What type of principle features intrinsic inside of the fluctuated input signals could drive neurons with the maximal excitations is one of the crucial neural coding issues. In this article, we examined both experimentally and theoretically the cortical neuronal responsivity (including firing rate and spike timing reliability) to input signals with different intrinsic correlational statistics (e.g., white-type noise, showed 1/f0 power spectrum, pink noise 1/f and brown noises 1/f2) and different frequency ranges. Our results revealed that the response sensitivity and reliability of cortical neurons is much higher in response to 1/f noise stimuli with long-term correlations than 1/f0 with short-term correlations for a broad frequency range, and also higher than 1/f2 for all frequency ranges. In addition, we found that neuronal sensitivity diverges to opposite directions for 1/f noise comparing with 1/f0 white noise as a function of cutoff frequency of input signal. As the cutoff frequency is progressively increased from 50 to 1000 Hz, the neuronal responsiveness increased gradually for 1/f noise, while decreased exponentially for white noise. Computational simulations of a general cortical model revealed that, neuronal sensitivity and reliability to input signal statistics was majorly dominated by fast sodium inactivation, potassium activation and membrane time constants.

Objective: The aim of this review was to synthesize, using random-effects model of meta-analysis, the link between dopaminergic system and Alzheimer’s disease.
Methods: A detailed analysis protocol was registered at the PROSPERO database prior to data extraction (CRD42018110798). Electronic databases of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Psyc-ARTICLES were searched up to December 2018 for studies that examined dopamine and dopamine receptors in relation to Alzheimer’s disease. Standardized mean differences (SMD) were calculated to assess group differences in the levels of dopaminergic neurometabolites.
Results: Seventeen studies met the eligibility criteria. Collectively, they included 512 patients and 500 healthy controls. There were significantly lower levels of dopamine in patients with Alzheimer’s disease compared with controls (SMD= -1.56, 95% CI: -2.64 to -0.49). In addition, dopamine 1 receptor (SMD=-5.05, 95% CI: -6.14 to -3.97) and dopamine 2 receptor (SMD=-1.13, 95% CI: -1.52 to -0.74) levels were decreased in patients with Alzheimer’s disease compared with controls. The results of network meta-analysis indicated that the rank of correlation with Alzheimer’s disease from highest to lowest was dopamine (0.74), dopamine 2 receptor (0.49), dopamine 3 receptor (0.46), dopamine 4 receptor (0.33), dopamine 5 receptor (0.31), and dopamine 1 receptor (0.64).
Conclusions: Overall, decreased levels of dopaminergic neurotransmitters were linked with the pathophysiology of Alzheimer’s disease. Nonetheless, there is a clear need for more prospective studies to validate these hypotheses.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/46814">A quantitative model of conserved macroscopic dynamics predicts future motor commands</a></h4>

In simple organisms such as <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>, whole brain imaging has been performed. Here, we use such recordings to model the nervous system. Our model uses neuronal activity to predict expected time of future motor commands up to 30 s prior to the event. These motor commands control locomotion. Predictions are valid for individuals not used in model construction. The model predicts dwell time statistics, sequences of motor commands and individual neuron activation. To develop this model, we extracted loops spanned by neuronal activity in phase space using novel methodology. The model uses only two variables: the identity of the loop and the phase along it. Current values of these macroscopic variables predict future neuronal activity. Remarkably, our model based on macroscopic variables succeeds despite consistent inter-individual differences in neuronal activation. Thus, our analytical framework reconciles consistent individual differences in neuronal activation with macroscopic dynamics that operate universally across individuals.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/45916">In vivo identification of GTPase interactors by mitochondrial relocalization and proximity biotinylation</a></h4>

The GTPases of the Ras superfamily regulate cell growth, membrane traffic and the cytoskeleton, and a wide range of diseases are caused by mutations in particular members. They function as switchable landmarks with the active GTP-bound form recruiting to the membrane a specific set of effector proteins. The GTPases are precisely controlled by regulators that promote acquisition of GTP (GEFs) or its hydrolysis to GDP (GAPs). We report here MitoID, a method for identifying effectors and regulators by performing in vivo proximity biotinylation with mitochondrially-localized forms of the GTPases. Applying this to 11 human Rab GTPases identified many known effectors and GAPs, as well as putative novel effectors, with examples of the latter validated for Rab2, Rab5, Rab9 and Rab11. MitoID can also efficiently identify effectors and GAPs of Rho and Ras family GTPases such as Cdc42, RhoA, Rheb, and N-Ras, and can identify GEFs by use of GDP-bound forms.

Flavodiiron proteins (FDPs) constitute a group of modular enzymes widespread in all life Domains. <i>Synechocystis </i>sp. PCC 6803 has four FDPs (Flv1-4), which are essential for the photoprotection of photosynthesis. A direct comparison of light-induced O<sub>2 </sub>reduction (Mehler-like reaction) under high (3% CO<sub>2</sub>, HC) and low (air level CO<sub>2</sub>, LC) inorganic carbon conditions demonstrated that the Flv1/Flv3 heterodimer is solely responsible for an efficient steady-state O<sub>2</sub> photoreduction under HC, with <i>flv2 </i>and <i>flv4 </i>expression strongly down-regulated. Conversely, under LC conditions, Flv1/Flv3 acts only as a transient electron sink, due to the competing withdrawal of electrons by the highly induced NDH-1 complex. Further, <i>in vivo </i>evidence is provided indicating that Flv2/Flv4 contributes to the Mehler-like reaction when naturally expressed under LC conditions, or, when artificially overexpressed under HC. The O<sub>2 </sub>photoreduction driven by Flv2/Flv4 occurs down-stream of PSI in a coordinated manner with Flv1/Flv3 and supports slow and steady-state O<sub>2</sub> photoreduction.

The non-destructive collection of ultrathin sections onto silicon wafers for post-embedding staining and volumetric correlative light and electron microscopy traditionally requires exquisite manual skills and is tedious and unreliable. In MagC introduced here, sample blocks are augmented with a magnetic resin enabling remote actuation and collection of hundreds of sections on wafer. MagC allowed the correlative visualization of neuroanatomical tracers within their ultrastructural volumetric electron microscopy context.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/45325">Multi-enhancer transcriptional hubs confer phenotypic robustness</a></h4>

We previously showed in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> embryos that low-affinity Ultrabithorax (Ubx)-responsive <i>shavenbaby</i> (<i>svb</i>) enhancers drive expression using localized transcriptional environments and that active <i>svb</i> enhancers on different chromosomes tended to colocalize (Tsai et al., 2017). Here, we test the hypothesis that these multi-enhancer 'hubs' improve phenotypic resilience to stress by buffering against decreases in transcription factor concentrations and transcriptional output. Deleting a redundant enhancer from the <i>svb</i> locus led to reduced trichome numbers in embryos raised at elevated temperatures. Using high-resolution fluorescence microscopy, we observed lower Ubx concentration and transcriptional output in this deletion allele. Transcription sites of the full <i>svb</i> <i>cis</i>-regulatory region inserted into a different chromosome colocalized with the <i>svb</i> locus, increasing Ubx concentration, the transcriptional output of <i>svb</i>, and partially rescuing the phenotype. Thus, multiple enhancers could reinforce a local transcriptional hub to buffer against environmental stresses and genetic perturbations, providing a mechanism for phenotypical robustness.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/44830">Neuronal integration in the adult mouse olfactory bulb is a non-selective addition process</a></h4>

Adult neurogenesis in the olfactory bulb (OB) is considered as a competition in which neurons scramble during a critical selection period for integration and survival. Moreover, newborn neurons are thought to replace pre-existing ones that die. Despite indirect evidence supporting this model, systematic in vivo observations are still scarce. We used 2-photon in vivo imaging to study neuronal integration and survival. We show that loss of new neurons in the OB after arrival at terminal positions occurs only at low levels. Moreover, long-term observations showed that no substantial cell death occurred at later stages. Neuronal death was induced by standard doses of thymidine analogs, but disappeared when low doses were used. Finally, we demonstrate that the OB grows throughout life. This shows that neuronal selection during OB-neurogenesis does not occur after neurons reached stable positions. Moreover, this suggests that OB neurogenesis does not represent neuronal turnover but lifelong neuronal addition.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/44288">The CUL5 ubiquitin ligase complex mediates resistance to CDK9 and MCL1 inhibitors in lung cancer cells</a></h4>

Overexpression of anti-apoptotic proteins MCL1 and Bcl-xL are frequently observed in many cancers. Inhibitors targeting MCL1 are in clinical development, however numerous cancer models are intrinsically resistant to this approach. To discover mechanisms underlying resistance to MCL1 inhibition, we performed multiple flow-cytometry based genome-wide CRISPR screens interrogating two drugs that directly (MCL1i) or indirectly (CDK9i) target MCL1. Remarkably, both screens identified three components (CUL5, RNF7 and UBE2F) of a cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase complex (CRL5) that resensitized cells to MCL1 inhibition. We find that levels of the BH3-only pro-apoptotic proteins Bim and Noxa are proteasomally regulated by the CRL5 complex. Accumulation of Noxa caused by depletion of CRL5 components was responsible for re-sensitization to CDK9 inhibitor, but not MCL1 inhibitor. Discovery of a novel role of CRL5 in apoptosis and resistance to multiple types of anti-cancer agents suggests the potential to improve combination treatments.

Many physiological processes exhibit circadian rhythms driven by cellular clocks composed of interlinked activating and repressing elements. To investigate temporal regulation in this molecular oscillator, we combined mouse genetic approaches and analyses of interactions of key circadian proteins with each other and with clock gene promoters. We show that transcriptional activators control BRD4-PTEFb recruitment to <i>E-box</i>-containing circadian promoters. During the activating phase of the circadian cycle, the lysine acetyltransferase TIP60 acetylates the transcriptional activator BMAL1 leading to recruitment of BRD4 and the pause release factor P-TEFb, followed by productive elongation of circadian transcripts. We propose that the control of BRD4-P-TEFb recruitment is a novel temporal checkpoint in the circadian clock cycle.

Medial ganglionic eminence (MGE)-derived somatostatin (SST)+ and parvalbumin (PV)+ cortical interneurons (CINs), have characteristic molecular, anatomical and physiological properties. However, mechanisms regulating their diversity remain poorly understood. Here, we show that conditional loss of the Tuberous Sclerosis (TS) gene, Tsc1, which inhibits mammalian target of rapamycin (MTOR), causes a subset of SST+ CINs, to express PV and adopt fast-spiking (FS) properties, characteristic of PV+ CINs. These changes also occur when only one allele of Tsc1 is deleted, making these findings relevant to individuals with TS. Notably, treatment with rapamycin, which inhibits MTOR, reverses these changes in adult mice. These data reveal novel functions of MTOR signaling in regulating PV expression and FS properties, which may contribute to some neuropsychiatric symptoms observed in TS. Moreover, they suggest that CINs can exhibit properties intermediate between those classically associated with PV+ or SST+ CINs, which may be dynamically regulated by the MTOR signaling.

Spike and wave discharges (SWDs) are the characteristic manifestation of childhood absence epilepsy (CAE). It has long been believed that they unpredictably emerge from otherwise almost normal interictal EEG. Herein, we demonstrate that pretreatment closed-eyes theta and beta EEG wavelet powers of CAE patients (20 girls and 10 boys, mean age 7.4 {+/-} 1.9 years) are much higher than those of age-matched controls at multiple sites of 10-20 system. For example, at C4 site, we observed a 91% and 62% increase in power of theta and beta rhythms, respectively. We were able to compare the baseline and posttreatment wavelet power in 16 patients. The pharmacotherapy brought about a statistically significant decrease in delta and theta wavelet power in all the channels, e.g. for C4 the reduction was equal to 45% (delta) and 65% (theta). We also observed a less pronounced attenuation of posttreatment beta rhythm in several channels. We hypothesize that the increased theta and beta powers result from cortical hyperexcitability and propensity for epileptic spikes generation, respectively. We argue that the distinct features of CAE wavelet power spectrum may be used to define an EEG biomarker which could be used for diagnosis and monitoring of patients.

The increasing use of gold nanoparticles (NPs) raises concerns about the potential effect of gold NPs exposure on human health. Therefore, gold NPs exposure is hard to evaluate at the organ level with current measurement technology. The bio-distribution assay showed that intestine was the organ with most gold NPs accumulated. However, our data indicated that 62.8% of the significant altered genes were function in the nervous system using tissue enrichment analysis. Notably, gene ontology analysis has demonstrated that NP exposure interfered with the development of animals. Furthermore, the transcription factors DAF-16 and HSF-1 were regulating the oxidative stress genes induced by gold NPs. Therefore, we proposed the localization of the oxidative stress genes in the neuron cells and how their expression affect neuron communication. Our results demonstrate that the gold NPs-induced oxidative stress affects the nervous system via physical damage to the neurons and disruption of cell-to-cell communication. Future toxicology research on gold NPs should focus on neurons.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/699736v1?rss=1">Contributions of spatial and temporal control of step length symmetry in the transfer of locomotor adaptation from a motorized to a non-motorized split-belt treadmill</a></h4>

The ability to transfer locomotor learning to novel contexts is essential for effective gait rehabilitation. Locomotor adaptation is dependent upon independent processes for spatial and temporal limb control during motorized split-belt walking, where individual belt speeds are fixed with one belt moving faster than the other. Here we investigated the relative contributions of spatial and temporal learning strategies to the transfer of a motorized split-belt adaptation to a non-motorized split-belt treadmill, where each belt is independently user-propelled. In 10 healthy subjects, adaptation of step length symmetry was driven by changes to temporal and spatial motor outputs during motorized split-belt treadmill walking. We found robust after-effects in step length symmetry during transfer to non-motorized split-belt treadmill walking that were driven by changes in temporal motor outputs. We also observed residual after-effects during motorized tied-belt treadmill walking (post-transfer) that were mainly driven by changes in spatial motor outputs. These results suggest independent transfer and de-adaptation of spatial and temporal motor outputs. In addition, our results showed that step length after-effects were mediated by unique patterns of muscle activity during motorized versus non-motorized treadmill walking post-adaptation, suggesting that redundant locomotor outputs are expressed in a context-dependent manner. In sum, this is the first study to show that adaptive learning on a motorized split-belt treadmill is transferable to a non-motorized split-belt treadmill. Future research aims to unravel the independent contributions of spatial and temporal control to gait adaptation and transfer.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/699728v1?rss=1">BOLD differences normally attributed to inhibitory control predict symptoms, not task-directed inhibitory control in ADHD</a></h4>

Background: Altered brain activity that has been observed in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) while performing cognitive control tasks like the stop signal task (SST), has generally been interpreted as reflecting either weak (under-active) or compensatory (over-active) versions of the same functions as in healthy controls. If so, then regional activities that correlate with the efficiency of inhibitory control (i.e. stop signal reaction time, SSRT) in healthy subjects should also correlate with SSRT in ADHD. Here we test the alternate hypothesis that BOLD differences might instead reflect the redirection of neural processing resources normally used for task-directed inhibitory control, toward actively managing symptomatic behavior. If so, then activities that correlate with SSRT in TD should instead correlate with inattentive and hyperactive symptoms in ADHD. Methods: We used fMRI in 14 typically developing (TD) and 14 ADHD adolescents performing the SST, and in a replication sample of 14 healthy adults. First we identified significant group BOLD differences during all phases of activity in the SST (i.e. warning, response, reactive inhibition, error detection and post-error slowing). Next, we correlated these phases of activity with SSRT in TD, and with SSRT, inattentive and hyperactive symptom scores in ADHD. We then identified whole brain significant correlations in regions of significant group difference in activity. Results: Only three regions of significant group difference were correlated with SSRT in TD and replication groups (left and right inferior frontal gyri (IFG) during error detection, and hypothalamus during post-error slowing). Consistent with regions of altered activity managing symptomatic behavior instead of task-directed behavior, left IFG correlated with greater inattentive score, right IFG correlated with lower hyperactive score, and hypothalamus correlated with greater inattentive score and oppositely correlated with SSRT compared to TD. Conclusions: Results are consistent with stimuli that elicit task-directed integration of neural processing in healthy subjects, instead directing integrated function towards managing symptomatic behavior in ADHD. The ability of the current approach to determine whether altered neural activities reflect comparable functions in ADHD and control groups has broad implications for the development and monitoring of therapeutic interventions.

The rhesus macaque is the closest animal model to the human, and investigations into the brain of the rhesus monkey has shed light on the function and organization of the primate brain at a scale and resolution not yet possible in studies of the human brain. A cornerstone of the linkage between non-human primate and human studies of the brain is magnetic resonance imaging, which allows for an association to be made between the detailed structural and physiological analysis of the non-human primate and that of the human brain. To further this end, we present a novel parcellation system for the rhesus monkey brain, referred to as the monkey Harvard Oxford Atlas (mHOA) which is based on the human Harvard-Oxford Atlas (HOA) and grounded in an ontological and taxonomic framework. Consistent anatomical features were used to delimit and parcellate brain regions in the macaque, which were then categorized according to functional systems. This system of parcellation will be expanded with advances in technology and like the HOA, will provide a framework upon which the results from other experimental studies (e.g., functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), physiology, connection, graph theory) can be interpreted.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/699678v1?rss=1">Functional harmonics reveal multi-dimensional basis functions underlying cortical organization</a></h4>

The human brain consists of functionally specialized areas, which flexibly interact and integrate forming a multitude of complex functional networks. The principles underlying this functional differentiation and integration remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that a fundamental principle ubiquitous in nature - harmonic modes - explains the orchestration of brain's functional organization. Applied to the functional connectivity in resting state averaged across 812 participants, harmonic modes give rise to functional harmonics revealing the communication channels of the human brain. Each associated with a different spatial frequency, the functional harmonics provide the frequency-ordered building blocks, which can reconstruct any pattern of brain activity. We show that 47 brain activation patterns elicited by 7 different task categories in the Human Connectome Project task battery can be reconstructed from a very small subset of functional harmonics, uncovering a parsimonious description of the previously unknown relationship between task and resting state brain activity. Our findings evidence that the functional specialization of the human cortex occurs in a gradiental manner across multiple dimensions in the functional harmonic basis, where isolines of gradients follow the borders of functional areas as defined in a state-of-the-art parcellation of the human cortex. Hence, the multi-dimensional functional harmonic representation unifies two competing views of the brain's functional organization, i.e. modular vs gradiental perspective.

Recent findings suggest that acetylcholine mediates uncertainty-seeking behaviors through its projection to dopamine neurons -- another neuromodulatory system known for its major implication in reinforcement learning and decision-making. In this paper, we propose a leaky-integrate-and-fire model of this mechanism. It implements a softmax-like selection with an uncertainty bonus by a cholinergic drive to dopaminergic neurons, which in turn influence synaptic currents of downstream neurons. The model is able to reproduce experimental data in two decision-making tasks. It also predicts that i) in the absence of cholinergic input, dopaminergic activity would not correlate with uncertainty, and that ii) the adaptive advantage brought by the implemented uncertainty-seeking mechanism is most useful when sources of reward are not highly uncertain. Moreover, this modeling work allows us to propose novel experiments which might shed new light on the role of acetylcholine in both random and directed exploration. Overall, this study thus contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of the roles of the cholinergic system and its involvement in decision-making in particular.

The hippocampus and dorsal striatum are both associated with temporal processing, but they are thought to play distinct roles. The hippocampus has been reported to contribute to storing temporal structure of events in memory, whereas the striatum contributes to temporal motor preparation and reward anticipation. Here, we asked whether the striatum cooperates with the hippocampus in processing the temporal context of memorized visual associations. In our task, participants were trained to implicitly form temporal expectations for one of two possible time intervals associated to specific cue-target associations, and subsequently were scanned using 7T functional magnetic resonance imaging. During scanning, learned temporal expectations could be violated when the pairs were presented at either the learned or not-learned time intervals. When temporal expectations were not met during testing trials, activity in hippocampal subfields CA3/CA2 and CA1 decreased while right putamen activity increased, compared to when temporal expectations were met. Further, psycho-physiological interactions showed that functional connectivity between left CA1 and caudate, as well as between putamen and caudate, decreased when temporal expectations were not met. Our results indicate that the hippocampus and striatum cooperate to process implicit temporal expectation from mnemonic associations, with different but complementary contributions from caudate and putamen. Our findings provide further support for a hippocampal-striatal network in temporal associative processing.

One of the most popular tools for quantifying protein expression is Immunofluorescence (IF). Although IF is widely applied in drug discovery research and assessing disease mechanisms, it has great room for improvement on the task of analyzing human postmortem brain samples. IF analysis of postmortem human tissue relies mostly on manual interaction, which is often error-prone and leading to low inter and intra-observer reproducibility. The high level of autofluorescence caused by accumulation of lipofuscin pigment during aging impedes systematic analyses of human postmortem brain samples. A method for automating cell counting and classification in IF microscopy of human postmortem brains was proposed before, which speeds up the quantification task while improving reproducibility. To correct for misclassified cells by the algorithm, we created HBFMTool, a software package that ease the process of editing the result produced by cell detection/classification algorithm.

Deposits of abnormal Tau inclusions in the brain are a well-known Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathological feature and are the best predictor for neuronal loss and clinical decline. As such, Tau is a potential in-vivo imaging biomarker that could leverage earlier AD diagnosis. In fact, there are several research initiatives to develop PET tracers for imaging Tau in the human brain. Validation of such studies, however, is only reliably performed using histological data, where Tau inclusion can be accurately located. Manually locating and segmenting Tau in such images is unfeasible since a whole human brain slice, at the adequate resolution, spans several Gigabytes of data and carries thousands of inclusions. In this study, we present our preliminary results on using convolutional neural networks (CNN) to automatically locate and segment Tau in whole human brain histological slides. CNNs are multi-layered representation-learning methods capable of automatically discover unknown patterns that best characterize a raw data set. Moreover, they model data in a bottom-up approach, where data is characterized by small low-level features, such as edges and connected objects, in lower layers and increases in abstraction and complexity in the following layers. Our dataset is composed of histological slices stained for AT100, AT8. Each slide was imaged in our in-house built slide scanner at 1.22um resolution. Each image is about 82000x37000 pixel wide. On average, a whole human brain dataset has 16Tb of data. Images were preprocessed and stitched using the UCSF Wynton cluster. A UNet variant was used for Tau localization and segmentation on the full-resolution images, which was performed using an NVIDIA Titan X 12Gb GPU. We then computed Tau 'heatmaps' based on the segmented images that, in turn, were registered to the MRI.

Acoustic overexposure, such as listening to music too loud and too often, results in noise-induced hearing loss. The pathologies of this prevalent sensory disorder begin in the synapses of the primary auditory receptors, their postsynaptic partners and supporting cells. The extent of noise-induced damage, however, is determined by over-stimulation of primary auditory receptors. When over-stimulated, an excessive amount of positive ions flood into the primary auditory receptors, triggering the activation of ion channels and possibly disrupting their ability to encode sound. A systematic characterisation of the electrophysiological function of primary auditory receptors is warranted to understand how noise-exposure impacts on downstream targets, where the pathologies of hearing loss begin. Here, we used the experimentally-accessible locust ear to characterise noise-induced changes in the auditory receptors. Although, we found a decrease in ability of the primary auditory neurons to encode sound, this is probably due to pathologies of their supporting cells.

The frontal cortical areas critical for human speech production, i.e. the ventrolateral frontal cortex (cytoarchitectonic areas 44 and 45; VLF) and the dorsomedial frontal cortex (DMF) comprising the mid-cingulate cortex (MCC) and the pre-supplementary motor area (preSMA), exist in non-human primates and are implicated in cognitive vocal control functions. The present functional neuroimaging study seeks to define the basic roles of these VLF-DMF network regions in primate vocal production and how they might have been adapted for human speech. We demonstrate that area 44 and the MCC are respectively involved in the cognitive selection of orofacial, non-speech vocal and verbal responses, and the feedback-driven adaptation of these responses - roles that are likely preserved across primates. In contrast, area 45 and preSMA have roles that are specific to human speech: area 45 contributes to active verbal retrieval during learning, while preSMA is involved in processing verbal feedback during orofacial/vocal adaptations.

Jellyfish nerve nets provide insight into the origins of nervous systems, as both their taxonomic position and their evolutionary age imply that jellyfish resemble some of the earliest neuron-bearing, actively-swimming animals. Here we develop the first neuronal network model for the nerve nets of jellyfish. Specifically, we focus on the moon jelly Aurelia aurita and the control of its energy-efficient swimming motion. The proposed single neuron model disentangles the contributions of different currents to a spike. The network model identifies factors ensuring non-pathological activity and suggests an optimization for the transmission of signals. After modeling the jellyfish's muscle system and its bell in a hydrodynamic environment, we explore the swimming elicited by neural activity. We find that different delays between nerve net activations lead to well-controlled, differently directed movements. Our model bridges the scales from single neurons to behavior, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of jellyfish neural control.

Vertebrate behavior is strongly influenced by light. Photoreceptors, encoded by Opsins, are present inside the vertebrate brain and peripheral tissues. Their non-visual functions are largely enigmatic. We focus on tmt-opsin1b and 2, c-Opsins with ancestral-type sequence features, conserved across several vertebrate phyla and with partly similar expression. Their loss-of-function mutations differentially modulate medakafish behavior in a context-dependent manner. Specifically, differences in light conditions have differential effects depending on age and frequency of the light changes, part of which are mediated by TMT-Opsin1b acting outside the eyes, while the pre-pro-hormone sst1b is regulated by daylength via TMT-opsin1b in an eye-dependent manner. Analyses of tmt-opsin1b;tmt-opsin2 double mutants reveals partial complementation of single mutant behavioral and molecular phenotypes. Our work starts to disentangle the highly complex interactions of vertebrate non-visual Opsins, suggesting that tmt-opsin-expressing cells together with other Opsins provide detailed light information to the organism for behavioral fine-tuning.

The ability to manipulate dopamine in vivo through non-invasive, reversible mechanisms has the potential to impact clinical, translational, and basic research. A recent PET study demonstrated that a single session of prefrontal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) increased striatal dopamine binding. We sought to extend this work by examining whether prefrontal tDCS could increase both dopamine levels and behavior. We conducted a between-subjects study (n=30) using active and sham tDCS and used spontaneous eye blink rate as an indirect proxy for dopamine functioning. The initial design and analyses were pre-registered (https://osf.io/gmnpc). While stimulation did not show an effect for any of the basic pre-registered analyses, we identified individual differences suggesting that baseline dopamine has an effect on tDCS stimulation. Baseline dopamine was positively related to change in dopamine within the active stimulation group but negatively related to change within the sham stimulation group. While this pre-registered design involved a small sample size, it provides critical information about how studies of tDCS need to account for baseline dopamine levels when interpreting tDCS stimulation response.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/696856v1?rss=1">Resting-state network topology and planning ability in healthy adults</a></h4>

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have been used extensively to investigate the brain areas that are recruited during the Tower of London (ToL) task. Nevertheless, little research has been devoted to study the neural correlates of the ToL task using a network approach. Here we investigated the association between functional connectivity and network topology during resting-state fMRI and ToL task performance, that was performed outside the scanner. Sixty-two (62) healthy subjects (21-74 years) underwent eyes-closed rsfMRI and performed the task on a laptop. We studied global (whole-brain) and within subnetwork resting-state topology as well as functional connectivity between subnetworks, with a focus on the default-mode, fronto-parietal and dorsal and ventral attention networks. Efficiency and clustering coefficient were calculated to measure network integration and segregation, respectively, at both the global and subnetwork level. Our main finding was that higher global efficiency was associated with slower performance ({beta} = .22, Pbca = .04) and this association seemed mainly driven by inter-individual differences in default-mode network connectivity. The reported results were independent from age, sex, education-level and motion. Although this finding is contrary to earlier findings on general cognition, we tentatively hypothesize that the reported association may indicate that individuals with a more integrated brain during the resting-state are less able to further increase network efficiency when transitioning from a rest to task state, leading to slower responses. This study also adds to a growing body of literature supporting a central role for the default-mode network in individual differences in cognitive performance.

Studies on the Bin-Amphiphysin-Rvs (BAR) domain have advanced a fundamental understanding of how proteins deform membrane. We previously showed that a BAR domain in tandem with a Pleckstrin Homology (PH domain) underlies the assembly of ACAP1 (Arfgap with Coil-coil, Ankryin repeat, and PH domain I) into an unusual lattice structure that also uncovers a new paradigm for how a BAR protein deforms membrane. Here, we initially pursued computation-based refinement of the ACAP1 lattice to identify its critical protein contacts. Simulation studies then revealed how ACAP1, which dimerizes into a symmetrical structure in solution, is recruited asymmetrically to the membrane through dynamic behavior. We also pursued electron microscopy (EM)-based structural studies, which shed further insight into the dynamic nature of the ACAP1 lattice assembly. As ACAP1 is an unconventional BAR protein, our findings broaden the understanding of the mechanistic spectrum by which proteins assemble into higher-ordered structures to achieve membrane deformation.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/niya2q5wcbg" width="1" />

<p>Myelination of axons facilitates the rapid propagation of electrical signals and the long-term integrity of axons. The ubiquitin-proteasome system is essential for proper protein homeostasis, which is particularly crucial for interactions of postmitotic cells. In our study, we examined how the E3 ubiquitin ligase FBXO7-SCF (SKP1, Cul1, F-box protein) expressed in myelinating cells affects the axon-myelin unit. Deletion of <i>Fbxo7</i> in oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells in mice using the Cnp1-<i>Cre</i> driver line led to motor impairment due to hindlimb paresis. It did not result in apoptosis of myelinating cells, nor did it affect the proper myelination of axons or lead to demyelination. It however triggered axonal degeneration in the CNS and resulted in the severe degeneration of axons in the PNS, inducing a full-blown neuropathy. Both the CNS and PNS displayed inflammation, while the PNS was also characterized by fibrosis, massive infiltration of macrophages, and edema. Tamoxifen-induced deletion of <i>Fbxo7</i>, after myelination using the Plp1-<i>CreERT2</i> line, led to a small number of degenerated axons and hence a very mild peripheral neuropathy. Interestingly, loss of <i>Fbxo7</i> also resulted in reduced proteasome activity in Schwann cells but not in cerebellar granule neurons, indicating a specific sensitivity of the former cell type. Together, our results demonstrate an essential role for FBXO7 in myelinating cells to support associated axons, which is fundamental to the proper developmental establishment and the long-term integrity of the axon-myelin unit.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The myelination of axons facilitates the fast propagation of electrical signals and the trophic support of the myelin-axon unit. Here, we report that deletion of <i>Fbxo7</i> in myelinating cells in mice triggered motor impairment but had no effect on myelin biogenesis. Loss of Fbxo7 in myelinating glia, however, led to axonal degeneration in the CNS and peripheral neuropathy of the axonal type. In addition, we found that Schwann cells were particularly sensitive to Fbxo7 deficiency reflected by reduced proteasome activity. Based on these findings, we conclude that Fbxo7 is essential for the support of the axon-myelin unit and long-term axonal health.</p>

<p>Chronic social defeat (CSD) in male mice can produce anxiety and aberrant socialization. Animals susceptible to CSD show activation of microglia, which have elevated levels of oxidative stress markers. We hypothesized that microglia and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production contribute to the CSD stress-induced changes in affective behavior. First, we selectively depleted microglia (99%) by administering the CSF1R (colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor) antagonist PLX5622 before and during the 14 d CSD procedure. Microglia-depleted mice in contrast to nondepleted mice were protected from the stress effects measured by light/dark and social interaction tests. ROS production, measured histochemically following dihydroethidium administration, was elevated by CSD, and the production was reduced to basal levels in mice lacking microglia. The deleterious stress effects were also blocked in nondepleted mice by continuous intracerebral administration of <i>N</i>-acetylcysteine (NAC), a ROS inhibitor. In a second experiment, at the end of the CSD period, PLX5622 was discontinued to allow microglial repopulation. After 14 d, the brain had a full complement of newly generated microglia. At this time, the mice that had previously been protected now showed behavioral deficits, and their brain ROS production was elevated, both in all brain cells and in repopulated microglia. NAC administration during repopulation prevented the behavioral decline in the repopulated mice, and it supported behavioral recovery in nondepleted stressed mice. The data suggest that microglia drive elevated ROS production during and after stress exposure. This elevated ROS activity generates a central state supporting dysregulated affect, and it hinders the restoration of behavioral and neurochemical homeostasis after stress cessation.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Chronic psychosocial stress is associated with psychiatric disorders such as depression and anxiety. Understanding the details of CNS cellular contributions to stress effects could lead to the development of intervention strategies. Inflammation and oxidative stress are positively linked to depression severity, but the cellular nature of these processes is not clear. The chronic social defeat (CSD) paradigm in mice produces mood alterations and microglial activation characterized by elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. The depletion of microglia or ROS inhibition prevented adverse stress effects. Microglial repopulation of the brain post-CSD reintroduced adverse stress effects, and ROS inhibition in this phase protected against the effects. The results suggest that stress-induced microglial ROS production drives a central state that supports dysregulated affective behavior.</p>

<p>Rhodopsin mislocalization is frequently observed in retinitis pigmentosa (RP) patients. For example, class I mutant rhodopsin is deficient in the VxPx trafficking signal, mislocalizes to the plasma membrane (PM) of rod photoreceptor inner segments (ISs), and causes autosomal dominant RP. Mislocalized rhodopsin causes photoreceptor degeneration in a manner independent of light-activation. In this manuscript, we took advantage of <i>Xenopus laevis</i> models of both sexes expressing wild-type human rhodopsin or its class I Q344ter mutant fused to Dendra2 fluorescent protein to characterize a novel light-independent mechanism of photoreceptor degeneration caused by mislocalized rhodopsin. We found that rhodopsin mislocalized to the PM is actively internalized and transported to lysosomes where it is degraded. This degradation process results in the downregulation of a crucial component of the photoreceptor IS PM: the sodium-potassium ATPase α-subunit (NKAα). The downregulation of NKAα is not because of decreased NKAα mRNA, but due to cotransport of mislocalized rhodopsin and NKAα to lysosomes or autophagolysosomes. In a separate set of experiments, we found that class I mutant rhodopsin, which causes NKAα downregulation, also causes shortening and loss of rod outer segments (OSs); the symptoms frequently observed in the early stages of human RP. Likewise, pharmacological inhibition of NKAα led to shortening and loss of rod OSs. These combined studies suggest that mislocalized rhodopsin leads to photoreceptor dysfunction through disruption of the PM protein homeostasis and compromised NKAα function. This study unveiled a novel role of lysosome-mediated degradation in causing inherited disorders manifested by mislocalization of ciliary receptors.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Retinal ciliopathy is the most common form of inherited blinding disorder frequently manifesting rhodopsin mislocalization. Our understanding of the relationships between rhodopsin mislocalization and photoreceptor dysfunction/degeneration has been far from complete. This study uncovers a hitherto uncharacterized consequence of rhodopsin mislocalization: the activation of the lysosomal pathway, which negatively regulates the amount of the sodium-potassium ATPase (NKAα) on the inner segment plasma membrane. On the plasma membrane, mislocalized rhodopsin extracts NKAα and sends it to lysosomes where they are co-degraded. Compromised NKAα function leads to shortening and loss of the photoreceptor outer segments as observed for various inherited blinding disorders. In summary, this study revealed a novel pathogenic mechanism applicable to various forms of blinding disorders caused by rhodopsin mislocalization.</p>

<p>We previously identified that <i>ngr1</i> allele deletion limits the severity of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) by preserving axonal integrity. However, whether this favorable outcome observed in EAE is a consequence of an abrogated neuronal-specific pathophysiological mechanism, is yet to be defined. Here we show that, Cre-loxP-mediated neuron-specific deletion of <i>ngr1</i> preserved axonal integrity, whereas its re-expression in <i>ngr1<sup>–/–</sup></i> female mice potentiated EAE-axonopathy. As a corollary, myelin integrity was preserved under Cre deletion in <i>ngr1<sup>flx/flx</sup></i>, retinal ganglion cell axons whereas, significant demyelination occurred in the <i>ngr1<sup>–/–</sup></i> optic nerves following the re-introduction of NgR1. Moreover, Cre-loxP-mediated axon-specific deletion of <i>ngr1</i> in <i>ngr1<sup>flx/flx</sup></i> mice also demonstrated efficient anterograde transport of fluorescently-labeled ChTxβ in the optic nerves of EAE-induced mice. However, the anterograde transport of ChTxβ displayed accumulation in optic nerve degenerative axons of EAE-induced <i>ngr1<sup>–/–</sup></i> mice, when NgR1 was reintroduced but was shown to be transported efficiently in the contralateral non- recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 2-transduced optic nerves of these mutant mice. We further identified that the interaction between the axonal motor protein, Kinesin-1 and collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2) was unchanged upon Cre deletion of <i>ngr1</i>. Whereas, this Kinesin-1/CRMP2 association was reduced when NgR1 was re-expressed in the <i>ngr1<sup>–/–</sup></i> optic nerves. Our data suggest that NgR1 governs axonal degeneration in the context of inflammatory-mediated demyelination through the phosphorylation of CRMP2 by stalling axonal vesicular transport. Moreover, axon-specific deletion of <i>ngr1</i> preserves axonal transport mechanisms, blunting the induction of inflammatory demyelination and limiting the severity of EAE.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Multiple sclerosis (MS) is commonly induced by aberrant immune-mediated destruction of the protective sheath of nerve fibers (known as myelin). However, it has been shown that MS lesions do not only consist of this disease pattern, exhibiting heterogeneity with continual destruction of axons. Here we investigate how neuronal NgR1 can drive inflammatory-mediated axonal degeneration and demyelination within the optic nerve by analyzing its downstream signaling events that govern axonal vesicular transport. We identify that abrogating the NgR1/pCRMP2 signaling cascade can maintain Kinesin-1-dependent anterograde axonal transport to limit inflammatory-mediated axonopathy and demyelination. The ability to differentiate between primary and secondary mechanisms of axonal degeneration may uncover therapeutic strategies to limit axonal damage and progressive MS.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/28/5551?rss=1">Boosting Learning Efficacy with Noninvasive Brain Stimulation in Intact and Brain-Damaged Humans</a></h4>

<p>Numerous behavioral studies have shown that visual function can improve with training, although perceptual refinements generally require weeks to months of training to attain. This, along with questions about long-term retention of learning, limits practical and clinical applications of many such paradigms. Here, we show for the first time in female and male human participants that just 10 d of visual training coupled with transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS) over visual areas causes dramatic improvements in visual motion perception. Relative to control conditions and anodal stimulation, tRNS-enhanced learning was at least twice as fast, and, crucially, it persisted for 6 months after the end of training and stimulation. Notably, tRNS also boosted learning in patients with chronic cortical blindness, leading to recovery of motion processing in the blind field after just 10 d of training, a period too short to elicit enhancements with training alone. In sum, our results reveal a remarkable enhancement of the capacity for long-lasting plastic and restorative changes when a neuromodulatory intervention is coupled with visual training.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Our work demonstrates that visual training coupled with brain stimulation can dramatically reduce the training period from months to weeks, and lead to fast improvement in neurotypical subjects and chronic cortically blind patients, indicating the potential of our procedure to help restore damaged visual abilities for currently untreatable visual dysfunctions. Together, these results indicate the critical role of early visual areas in perceptual learning and reveal its capacity for long-lasting plastic changes promoted by neuromodulatory intervention.</p>

<p>Healthy aging is accompanied by disruptions in the functional modular organization of the human brain. Cross-sectional studies have shown age-related reductions in the functional segregation and distinctiveness of brain networks. However, less is known about the longitudinal changes in brain functional modular organization and their associations with aging-related cognitive decline. We examined age- and aging-related changes in functional architecture of the cerebral cortex using a dataset comprising a cross-sectional healthy young cohort of 57 individuals (mean ± SD age, 23.71 ± 3.61 years, 22 males) and a longitudinal healthy elderly cohort of 72 individuals (mean ± baseline age, 68.22 ± 5.80 years, 39 males) with 2–3 time points (18–24 months apart) of task-free fMRI data. We found both cross-sectional (elderly vs young) and longitudinal (in elderly) global decreases in network segregation (decreased local efficiency), integration (decreased global efficiency), and module distinctiveness (increased participation coefficient and decreased system segregation). At the modular level, whereas cross-sectional analyses revealed higher participation coefficient across all modules in the elderly compared with young participants, longitudinal analyses revealed focal longitudinal participation coefficient increases in three higher-order cognitive modules: control network, default mode network, and salience/ventral attention network. Cross-sectionally, elderly participants also showed worse attention performance with lower local efficiency and higher mean participation coefficient, and worse global cognitive performance with higher participation coefficient in the dorsal attention/control network. These findings suggest that healthy aging is associated with whole-brain connectome-wide changes in the functional modular organization of the brain, accompanied by loss of functional segregation, particularly in higher-order cognitive networks.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Cross-sectional studies have demonstrated age-related reductions in the functional segregation and distinctiveness of brain networks. However, longitudinal aging-related changes in brain functional modular architecture and their links to cognitive decline remain relatively understudied. Using graph theoretical and community detection approaches to study task-free functional network changes in a cross-sectional young and longitudinal healthy elderly cohort, we showed that aging was associated with global declines in network segregation, integration, and module distinctiveness, and specific declines in distinctiveness of higher-order cognitive networks. Further, such functional network deterioration was associated with poorer cognitive performance cross-sectionally. Our findings suggest that healthy aging is associated with system-level changes in brain functional modular organization, accompanied by functional segregation loss particularly in higher-order networks specialized for cognition.</p>

<p>The auditory system converts the physical properties of a sound waveform to neural activities and processes them for recognition. During the process, the tuning to amplitude modulation (AM) is successively transformed by a cascade of brain regions. To test the functional significance of the AM tuning, we conducted single-unit recording in a deep neural network (DNN) trained for natural sound recognition. We calculated the AM representation in the DNN and quantitatively compared it with those reported in previous neurophysiological studies. We found that an auditory-system-like AM tuning emerges in the optimized DNN. Better-recognizing models showed greater similarity to the auditory system. We isolated the factors forming the AM representation in the different brain regions. Because the model was not designed to reproduce any anatomical or physiological properties of the auditory system other than the cascading architecture, the observed similarity suggests that the AM tuning in the auditory system might also be an emergent property for natural sound recognition during evolution and development.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> This study suggests that neural tuning to amplitude modulation may be a consequence of the auditory system evolving for natural sound recognition. We modeled the function of the entire auditory system; that is, recognizing sounds from raw waveforms with as few anatomical or physiological assumptions as possible. We analyzed the model using single-unit recording, which enabled a fair comparison with neurophysiological data with as few methodological biases as possible. Interestingly, our results imply that frequency decomposition in the inner ear might not be necessary for processing amplitude modulation. This implication could not have been obtained if we had used a model that assumes frequency decomposition.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/28/5506?rss=1">Interactions between Conscious and Subconscious Signals: Selective Attention under Feature-Based Competition Increases Neural Selectivity during Brain Adaptation</a></h4>

<p>Efficient perception in natural environments depends on neural interactions between voluntary processes within cognitive control, such as attention, and those that are automatic and subconscious, such as brain adaptation to predictable input (also called repetition suppression). Although both attention and adaptation have been studied separately and there is considerable knowledge of the neurobiology involved in each of these processes, how attention interacts with adaptation remains equivocal. We examined how attention interacts with visual and auditory adaptation by measuring neuroimaging effects consistent with changes in either neural gain or selectivity. Male and female human participants were scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) first while they discriminated repetition of morphed faces or voices and either directed their attention to stimulus identity or spatial location. Attention to face or voice identity, while ignoring stimulus location, solely increased the gain of respectively face- or voice-sensitive cortex. The results were strikingly different in an experiment when participants attended to voice identity versus stimulus loudness. In this case, attention to voice while ignoring sound loudness increased neural selectivity. The combined results show that how attention affects adaptation depends on the level of feature-based competition, reconciling prior conflicting observations. The findings are theoretically important and are discussed in relation to neurobiological interactions between attention and different types of predictive signals.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Adaptation to repeated environmental events is ubiquitous in the animal brain, an automatic typically subconscious, predictive signal. Cognitive influences, such as by attention, powerfully affect sensory processing and can overcome brain adaptation. However, how neural interactions occur between adaptation and attention remains controversial. We conducted fMRI experiments regulating the focus of attention during adaptation to repeated stimuli with perceptually balanced stimulus expectancy. We observed an interaction between attention and adaptation consistent with increased neural selectivity, but only under conditions of feature-based competition, challenging the notion that attention interacts with brain adaptation by only affecting response gain. This demonstrates that attention retains its full complement of mechanistic influences on sensory cortex even as it interacts with more automatic or subconscious predictive processes.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/28/5493?rss=1">Neuronal Effects of Spatial and Feature Attention Differ Due to Normalization</a></h4>

<p>Although spatial and feature attention have differing effects on neuronal responses in visual cortex, it remains unclear why. Response normalization has been implicated in both types of attention (Carandini and Heeger, 2011), and single-unit studies have demonstrated that the magnitude of spatial attention effects on neuronal responses covaries with the magnitude of normalization effects. However, the relationship between feature attention and normalization remains largely unexplored. We recorded from individual neurons in the middle temporal area of rhesus monkeys using a task that allowed us to isolate the effects of feature attention, spatial attention, and normalization on the responses of each neuron. We found that the magnitudes of neuronal response modulations due to spatial attention and feature attention are correlated; however, whereas modulations due to spatial attention are correlated with normalization strength, those due to feature attention are not. Additionally, spatial attention modulations are stronger with multiple stimuli in the receptive field, whereas feature attention modulations are not. These findings are captured by a model in which spatial and feature attention share common top-down attention signals that nonetheless result in differing sensory neuron response modulations because of a spatially tuned sensory normalization mechanism. This model explains previously reported commonalities and differences between these two types of attention by clarifying the relationship between top-down attention signals and sensory normalization. We conclude that similar top-down signals to visual cortex can have distinct effects on neuronal responses due to distinct interactions with sensory mechanisms.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Subjects use attention to improve their visual perception in several ways, including by attending to a location in space or to a visual feature. Prior studies have found both commonalities and differences between the effects of spatial and feature attention on neuronal responses in visual cortex, although it is unclear what mechanisms could explain this range of effects. Normalization, a computation by which neuronal responses are modified by stimulus context, has been implicated in many neuronal mechanisms throughout the brain. Here we propose that normalization provides a simple explanation for how spatial and feature attention could share common top-down attention signals that still affect sensory neuron responses differently.</p>

<p>Myelin loss occurring in demyelinating diseases, including multiple sclerosis, is the leading cause of long-lasting neurological disability in adults. While endogenous remyelination, driven by resident oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), might partially compensate myelin loss in the early phases of demyelinating disorders, this spontaneous reparative potential fails at later stages. To investigate the cellular mechanisms sustaining endogenous remyelination in demyelinating disorders, we focused our attention on endogenous neural precursor cells (eNPCs) located within the subventricular zone (SVZ) since this latter area is considered one of the primary sources of new OPCs in the adult forebrain. First, we fate mapped SVZ-eNPCs in cuprizone-induced demyelination and found that SVZ endogenous neural stem/precursor cells are recruited during the remyelination phase to the corpus callosum (CC) and are capable of forming new oligodendrocytes. When we ablated SVZ-derived eNPCs during cuprizone-induced demyelination in female mice, the animals displayed reduced numbers of oligodendrocytes within the lesioned CC. Although this reduction in oligodendrocytes did not impact the ensuing remyelination, eNPC-ablated mice experienced increased axonal loss. Our results indicate that, in toxic models of demyelination, SVZ-derived eNPCs contribute to support axonal survival.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> One of the significant challenges in MS research is to understand the detrimental mechanisms leading to the failure of CNS tissue regeneration during disease progression. One possible explanation is the inability of recruited oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) to complete remyelination and to sustain axonal survival. The contribution of endogenous neural precursor cells (eNPCs) located in the subventricular zone (SVZ) to generate new OPCs in the lesion site has been debated. Using transgenic mice to fate map and to selectively kill SVZ-derived eNPCs in the cuprizone demyelination model, we observed migration of SVZ-eNPCs after injury and their contribution to oligodendrogenesis and axonal survival. We found that eNPCs are dispensable for remyelination but protect partially from increased axonal loss.</p>

<p>cAMP signaling is known to be critical in neuronal survival and axon growth. Increasingly the subcellular compartmentation of cAMP signaling has been appreciated, but outside of dendritic synaptic regulation, few cAMP compartments have been defined in terms of molecular composition or function in neurons. Specificity in cAMP signaling is conferred in large part by A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs) that localize protein kinase A and other signaling enzymes to discrete intracellular compartments. We now reveal that cAMP signaling within a perinuclear neuronal compartment organized by the large multivalent scaffold protein mAKAPα promotes neuronal survival and axon growth. mAKAPα signalosome function is explored using new molecular tools designed to specifically alter local cAMP levels as studied by live-cell FRET imaging. In addition, enhancement of mAKAPα-associated cAMP signaling by isoform-specific displacement of bound phosphodiesterase is demonstrated to increase retinal ganglion cell survival <i>in vivo</i> in mice of both sexes following optic nerve crush injury. These findings define a novel neuronal compartment that confers cAMP regulation of neuroprotection and axon growth and that may be therapeutically targeted in disease.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> cAMP is a second messenger responsible for the regulation of diverse cellular processes including neuronal neurite extension and survival following injury. Signal transduction by cAMP is highly compartmentalized in large part because of the formation of discrete, localized multimolecular signaling complexes by A-kinase anchoring proteins. Although the concept of cAMP compartmentation is well established, the function and identity of these compartments remain poorly understood in neurons. In this study, we provide evidence for a neuronal perinuclear cAMP compartment organized by the scaffold protein mAKAPα that is necessary and sufficient for the induction of neurite outgrowth <i>in vitro</i> and for the survival of retinal ganglion cells <i>in vivo</i> following optic nerve injury.</p>

<p>Sleep deprivation (SD) interferes with hippocampal structural and functional plasticity, formation of long-term memory and cognitive function. The molecular mechanisms underlying these effects are incompletely understood. Here, we show that SD impaired synaptic tagging and capture and behavioral tagging, two major mechanisms of associative learning and memory. Strikingly, mutant male mice lacking the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75<sup>NTR</sup>) were resistant to the detrimental effects of SD on hippocampal plasticity at both cellular and behavioral levels. Mechanistically, SD increased p75<sup>NTR</sup> expression and its interaction with phosphodiesterase. p75<sup>NTR</sup> deletion preserved hippocampal structural and functional plasticity by preventing SD-mediated effects on hippocampal cAMP–CREB-BDNF, cAMP-PKA-LIMK1-cofilin, and RhoA-ROCK2 pathways. Our study identifies p75<sup>NTR</sup> as an important mediator of hippocampal structural and functional changes associated with SD, and suggests that targeting p75<sup>NTR</sup> could be a promising strategy to limit the memory and cognitive deficits that accompany sleep loss.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The lack of sufficient sleep is a major health concern in today's world. Sleep deprivation (SD) affects cognitive functions such as memory. We have investigated how associative memory mechanisms, synaptic tagging and capture (STC), was impaired in SD mice at cellular and behavioral level. Interestingly, mutant male mice that lacked the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75<sup>NTR</sup>) were seen to be resistant to the SD-induced impairments in hippocampal synaptic plasticity and STC. Additionally, we elucidated the molecular pathways responsible for this rescue of plasticity in the mutant mice. Our study has thus identified p75<sup>NTR</sup> as a promising target to limit the cognitive deficits associated with SD.</p>

<p>The Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase (NKA) is a ubiquitous membrane-bound enzyme responsible for generating and maintaining the Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> electrochemical gradients across the plasmalemma of living cells. Numerous studies in non-neuronal tissues have shown that this transport mechanism is reversibly regulated by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of the catalytic α subunit and/or associated proteins. In neurons, Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> transport by NKA is essential for almost all neuronal operations, consuming up to two-thirds of the neuron's energy expenditure. However, little is known about its cellular regulatory mechanisms. Here we have used an electrophysiological approach to monitor NKA transport activity in male rat hippocampal neurons <i>in situ</i>. We report that this activity is regulated by a balance between serine/threonine phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. Phosphorylation by the protein kinases PKG and PKC inhibits NKA activity, whereas dephosphorylation by the protein phosphatases PP-1 and PP-2B (calcineurin) reverses this effect. Given that these kinases and phosphatases serve as downstream effectors in key neuronal signaling pathways, they may mediate the coupling of primary messengers, such as neurotransmitters, hormones, and growth factors, to the NKAs, through which multiple brain functions can be regulated or dysregulated.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase (NKA), known as the "Na<sup>+</sup> pump," is a ubiquitous membrane-bound enzyme responsible for generating and maintaining the Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> electrochemical gradients across the plasma membrane of living cells. In neurons, as in most types of cells, the NKA generates the negative resting membrane potential, which is the basis for almost all aspects of cellular function. Here we used an electrophysiological approach to monitor physiological NKA transport activity in single hippocampal pyramidal cells <i>in situ</i>. We have found that neuronal NKA activity is oppositely regulated by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, and we have identified the main protein kinases and phosphatases mediating this regulation. This fundamental form of NKA regulation likely plays a role in multiple brain functions.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/28/5424?rss=1">CAMK2-Dependent Signaling in Neurons Is Essential for Survival</a></h4>

<p>Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CAMK2) is a key player in synaptic plasticity and memory formation. Mutations in <i>Camk2a</i> or <i>Camk2b</i> cause intellectual disability in humans, and severe plasticity and learning deficits in mice, indicating unique functions for each isoform. However, considering the high homology between CAMK2A and CAMK2B, it is conceivable that for critical functions, one isoform compensates for the absence of the other, and that the full functional spectrum of neuronal CAMK2 remains to be revealed.</p>
<p>Here we show that germline as well as adult deletion of both CAMK2 isoforms in male or female mice is lethal. Moreover, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent activity as well as autonomous activity of CAMK2 is essential for survival. Loss of both CAMK2 isoforms abolished LTP, whereas synaptic transmission remained intact. The double-mutants showed no gross morphological changes of the brain, and in contrast to the long-considered role for CAMK2 in the structural organization of the postsynaptic density (PSD), deletion of both CAMK2 isoforms did not affect the biochemical composition of the PSD. Together, these results reveal an essential role for CAMK2 signaling in early postnatal development as well as the mature brain, and indicate that the full spectrum of CAMK2 requirements cannot be revealed in the single mutants because of partial overlapping functions of CAMK2A and CAMK2B.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> CAMK2A and CAMK2B have been studied for over 30 years for their role in neuronal functioning. However, most studies were performed using single knock-out mice. Because the two isoforms show high homology with respect to structure and function, it is likely that some redundancy exists between the two isoforms, meaning that for critical functions CAMK2B compensates for the absence of CAMK2A and vice versa, leaving these functions to uncover. In this study, we generated <i>Camk2a/Camk2b</i> double-mutant mice, and observed that loss of CAMK2, as well as the loss of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent activity of CAMK2 is lethal. These results indicate that despite 30 years of research the full spectrum of CAMK2 functioning in neurons remains to be unraveled.</p>

Abstract
<p>The intrinsic vasopressin system of the olfactory bulb is involved in social odor processing and consists of glutamatergic vasopressin cells (VPCs) located at the medial border of the glomerular layer. To characterize VPCs in detail, we combined various electrophysiological, neuroanatomical, and two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging techniques in acute bulb slices from juvenile transgenic rats with eGFP-labeled VPCs. VPCs showed regular non-bursting firing patterns, and displayed slower membrane time constants and higher input resistances versus other glutamatergic tufted cell types. VPC axons spread deeply into the external plexiform and superficial granule cell layer (GCL). Axonal projections fell into two subclasses, with either denser local columnar collaterals or longer-ranging single projections running laterally within the internal plexiform layer and deeper within the granule cell layer. VPCs always featured lateral dendrites and a tortuous apical dendrite that innervated a single glomerulus with a homogenously branching tuft. These tufts lacked Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in response to single somatically-evoked action potentials and showed a moderate Ca<sup>2+</sup> increase upon prolonged action potential trains.</p>
<p>Notably, electrical olfactory nerve stimulation did not result in synaptic excitation of VPCs, but triggered substantial GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor-mediated IPSPs that masked excitatory barrages with yet longer latency. Exogenous vasopressin application reduced those IPSPs, as well as olfactory nerve-evoked EPSPs recorded from external tufted cells. In summary, VPCs can be classified as non-bursting, vertical superficial tufted cells. Moreover, our findings imply that sensory input alone cannot trigger excitation of VPCs, arguing for specific additional pathways for excitation or disinhibition in social contexts.</p>

<p>Physical activity is a critical behavioral variable in many research studies and is, therefore, important to quantify. However, existing methods for measuring physical activity have limitations which include high expense, specialized caging or equipment, and high computational overhead. To address these limitations, we present an open-source, cost-effective, device for measuring rodent activity. Our device is battery powered and designed to be placed in vivarium home cages to enable high-throughput, long-term operation with minimal investigator intervention. The primary aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of using passive infrared (PIR) sensors and microcontroller-based dataloggers in a rodent home cages to collect physical activity records. To this end, we developed an open-source PIR based data-logging device called the rodent activity detector (RAD). We publish the design files and code so others can readily build the RAD in their own labs. To demonstrate its utility, we used the RAD to collect physical activity data from 40 individually housed mice for up to 10 weeks. This dataset demonstrates the ability of the RAD to (1) operate in a high-throughput installation, (2) detect high-fat diet (HFD)-induced changes in physical activity, and (3) quantify circadian rhythms in individual animals. We further validated the data output of the RAD with simultaneous video tracking of mice in multiple caging configurations, to determine the features of physical activity that it detects. The RAD is easy to build, economical, and fits in vivarium caging. The scalability of such devices will enable high-throughput studies of physical activity in research studies.</p>

Abstract
<p>The transentorhinal cortex (TEC) is an obliquely oriented cortex located in the medial temporal lobe and, together with the entorhinal cortex, is one of the first affected areas in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). One of the most widely accepted hypotheses is that synaptopathy (synaptic alterations and loss) represents the major structural correlate of the cognitive decline observed in AD. However, very few electron microscope (EM) studies are available; the most common method to estimate synaptic density indirectly is by counting, at the light microscopic level, immunoreactive puncta using synaptic markers. To investigate synaptic morphology and possible alterations related to AD, a detailed three-dimensional (3D) ultrastructural analysis using focused ion beam/scanning EM (FIB/SEM) was performed in the neuropil of Layer II of the TEC in human brain samples from non-demented subjects and AD patients. Evaluation of the proportion and shape of asymmetric synapses (AS) and symmetric synapses (SS) targeting spines or dendritic shafts was performed using 3D reconstructions of every synapse. The 3D analysis of 4722 synapses revealed that the preferable targets were spine heads for AS and dendritic shafts for SS, both in control and AD cases. However, in AD patients, we observed a reduction in the percentage of synapses targeting spine heads. Regarding the shape of synapses, in both control cases and AD samples, the vast majority of synapses had a macular shape, followed by perforated or horseshoe-shaped synapses, with fragmented synapses being the least frequent type. Moreover, comparisons showed an increased number of fragmented AS in AD patients.</p>

Abstract
<p>Thanks to patients Phineas Gage and Henry Molaison, we have long known that behavioral control depends on the frontal lobes, whereas declarative memory depends on the medial temporal lobes (MTL). For decades, cognitive functions—behavioral control, declarative memory—have served as labels for characterizing the division of labor in cortex. This approach has made enormous contributions to understanding how the brain enables the mind, providing a systems-level explanation of brain function that constrains lower-level investigations of neural mechanism. Today, the approach has evolved such that functional labels are often applied to brain networks rather than focal brain regions. Furthermore, the labels have diversified to include both broadly-defined cognitive functions (declarative memory, visual perception) and more circumscribed mental processes (recollection, familiarity, priming). We ask whether a process—a high-level mental phenomenon corresponding to an introspectively-identifiable cognitive event—is the most productive label for dissecting memory. For example, recollection conflates a neurocomputational <i>operation</i> (pattern completion-based retrieval) with a class of <i>representational content</i> (associative, high-dimensional memories). Because a full theory of memory must identify operations and representations separately, and specify how they interact, we argue that processes like recollection constitute inadequate labels for characterizing neural mechanisms. Instead, we advocate considering the component operations and representations of processes like recollection in isolation. For the organization of memory, the evidence suggests that pattern completion is recapitulated widely across the ventral visual stream and MTL, but the division of labor between sites within this pathway can be explained by representational content.</p>

Abstract
<p>Microglia play a pivotal role in maintaining homeostasis of the CNS. There is growing interest in understanding how microglia influence normal brain function and disease progression. Several microglia-specific Cx3cr1-Cre lines have been developed and have become indispensable tools in many investigations of microglial function. However, some recent studies have reported that these lines may have significant leakage into neurons. Other studies have reported that Cx3cr1 is expressed in non-microglial cells, including neurons and astrocytes, in vitro or in vivo either during brain development or upon neurological insult. All these reports raise serious concerns about the trustworthiness of these Cre-lines and whether the conclusions drawn from previous studies are valid. Here, we found that a floxed fluorescent reporter mouse line which has been frequently used to verify Cre lines displayed spontaneous expression of the GFP reporter, independent of Cre recombinase, thus revealing a potential caveat in assessing cre lines. We further confirmed that two Cx3cr1-Cre mouse lines can drive fluorescent reporter expression largely restrictively in microglia. Finally, we clarified that these two mouse lines maintain microglia-specific expression even following excitatory injury. Together, our findings confirm that two previously created Cx3cr1-Cre lines remain as invaluable tools for studying microglia. Moreover, to ensure the quality of data generated and the soundness of conclusions drawn from such data, it should be compulsory to thoroughly examine reporter lines for spontaneous leakiness when labeling cells to study CNS function and diseases.</p>

Abstract
<p>In the parkinsonian state, the motor cortex and basal ganglia (BG) undergo dynamic remodeling of movement representation. One such change is the loss of the normal contralateral lateralized activity pattern. The increase in the number of movement-related neurons responding to ipsilateral or bilateral limb movements may cause motor problems, including impaired balance, reduced bimanual coordination, and abnormal mirror movements. However, it remains unknown how individual types of motor cortical neurons organize this reconstruction. To explore the effect of dopamine depletion on lateralized activity in the parkinsonian state, we used a partial hemiparkinsonian model [6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesion] in Long–Evans rats performing unilateral movements in a right–left pedal task, while recording from primary (M1) and secondary motor cortex (M2). The lesion decreased contralateral preferred activity in both M1 and M2. In addition, this change differed among identified intratelencephalic (IT) and pyramidal tract (PT) cortical projection neurons, depending on the cortical area. We detected a decrease in lateralized activity only in PT neurons in M1, whereas in M2, this change was observed in IT neurons, with no change in the PT population. Our results suggest a differential effect of dopamine depletion in the lateralized activity of the motor cortex, and suggest possible compensatory changes in the contralateral hemisphere.</p>

Abstract
<p>The aging of the human brain in the absence of diseases is accompanied by subtle changes of neuronal morphology, such as dendrite restructuring, neuronal sprouting, and synaptic deteriorations, rather than neurodegeneration or gross deterioration. Similarly, the nervous system of <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> does not show neurodegeneration or gross deterioration during normal aging, but displays subtle alterations in neuronal morphology. The occurrence of these age-dependent abnormalities is stochastic and dynamic, which poses a major challenge to fully capture them for quantitative comparison. Here, we developed a semi-automated pipeline for quantitative image analysis of these features during aging. We employed and evaluated this pipeline herein to reproduce findings from previous studies using visual inspection of neuronal morphology. Importantly, our approach can also quantify additional features, such as soma volume, the length of neurite outgrowths, and their location along the aged neuron. We found that, during aging, the soma of neurons decreases in volume, whereas the number and length of neurite outgrowths from the soma both increase. Long-lived animals showed less decrease in soma volume, fewer and shorter neurite outgrowths, and protection against abnormal sharp bends preferentially localized at the distal part of the dendrites during aging. We found a correlation of sharp bends with neurite outgrowth, suggesting the hypothesis that sharp bends might proceed neurite outgrowths. Thus, our semi-automated pipeline can help researchers to obtain and analyze quantitative datasets of this stochastic process for comparison across genotypes and to identify correlations to facilitate the generation of novel hypothesis.</p>

Abstract
<p>Conditioned taste aversion (CTA) is an essential behavior for animal survival. Conditioned animals show avoidance and decreased palatability to a conditioned stimulus (CS) on CTA retrieval. In this study, we aimed to determine whether the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (BLA) is involved in CTA retrieval and whether avoidance and palatability in CTA retrieval are processed in the BLA. We developed an experimental chamber for time-course analysis of the behavior to approach a spout and lick a CS. In this experimental chamber, we analyzed the behavior of male rats following microinjections of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor agonist muscimol or saline into the BLA. The rats showed two types of approach behavior: they either (1) approached and licked the spout or (2) approached but did not lick the spout. Muscimol injection into the BLA decreased the frequency of the latter type of approach behavior, indicating that BLA inactivation reduced avoidance to the CS. The muscimol injection into the BLA also significantly increased the consumption of the CS. Lick microstructure analysis demonstrated that intra-BLA muscimol significantly increased licking burst number and size, indicating that BLA inactivation attenuated aversion to the CS as large burst licking is an indicator of high palatability. These results suggest that the increase in CS consumption with intra-BLA muscimol injection was due to alterations in approach and aversive responses to the CS. Therefore, we conclude that the BLA plays an essential role in CTA retrieval by parallel processing of avoidance and palatability.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To investigate whether soluble ST2, a prognostic marker in cardiovascular and inflammatory disorders, is associated with neurological injury after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH).</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We studied SAH patients from two independent cohorts. Outcome assessments included functional status at 90 days using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS), mortality, and delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI). The relationships between sST2 plasma level and outcome measures were assessed in both cross sectional and longitudinal analysis. Primary blood mononuclear cells from SAH patients and elective aneurysm controls were analyzed by multiparameter flow cytometry.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In the discovery cohort sST2 predicted 90‐day mRS 3‐6 (C index 0.724, p &lt; 0.001) and mortality in Kaplan‐Meier analysis (p &lt; 0.001). The association with functional status was independent of age, sex, World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies (WFNS) score, modified Fisher score, treatment modality and cardiac comorbidities (adjusted OR 2.28, 95% CI 1.04 to 5.00, p = 0.039). Higher sST2 concentration was observed in those patients with DCI (90.8 vs 53.7ng/mL, p = 0.003). These associations were confirmed in a replication cohort. In patients with high sST2, flow cytometry identified decreased expression of CD14 (4.27x10<sup>5</sup> ± 2950 A.U. vs. 5.64x10<sup>5</sup> ± 1290 A.U., p &lt; 0.001), and increased expression of CD16 (39,960 ± 272 A.U. vs. 34,869 ± 183 A.U., p &lt; 0.001).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Plasma sST2 predicts DCI, functional outcome and mortality after SAH, independent of clinical and radiographic markers. Elevated sST2 is also associated with changes in CD14+CD16+ monocytes.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Anticoagulation reversal, intensive blood pressure lowering, neurosurgery and access to critical care might all be beneficial in acute intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). We combined and implemented these as the ‘ABC’ hyperacute care bundle and sought to determine whether the implementation was associated with lower case fatality.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The ABC bundle was implemented from 1 June 2015 to 31 May 2016. Key process targets were set and a registry captured consecutive patients. We compared 30‐day case fatality before, during and after bundle implementation with multivariable logistic regression and used mediation analysis to determine which care process measures mediated any association. Difference‐in‐difference analysis compared 30‐day case fatality with 32,295 patients with ICH from 214 other hospitals in England and Wales using Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme data.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>973 ICH patients were admitted in the study period. Compared to before implementation, the adjusted odds of death by 30 days were lower in the implementation period (odds ratio [OR] 0·62; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0·38 to 0·97; p=0·03) and this was sustained after implementation (OR 0·40; 95%CI: 0·24 to 0·61; p&lt;0·0001). Implementation of the bundle was associated with a 10·8 pp (95%CI ‐17·9 to ‐3·7; p=0·003) reduction in 30‐day case fatality in difference‐in‐difference analysis. The total effect of the care bundle was mediated by a reduction in do‐not‐resuscitate orders within 24 h (52·8%) and increased admission to critical care (11·1%).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Implementation of the ABC care bundle was significantly associated with lower 30‐day case fatality after ICH.</p>

<p>This paper presents methods that quantify the structure of statistical
interactions within a given data set, and was first used in \cite{Tapia2018}.
It establishes new results on the k-multivariate mutual-informations (I_k)
inspired by the topological formulation of Information introduced in. In
particular we show that the vanishing of all I_k for 2\leq k \leq n of n random
variables is equivalent to their statistical independence. Pursuing the work of
Hu Kuo Ting and Te Sun Han, we show that information functions provide
co-ordinates for binary variables, and that they are analytically independent
on the probability simplex for any set of finite variables. The maximal
positive I_k identifies the variables that co-vary the most in the population,
whereas the minimal negative I_k identifies synergistic clusters and the
variables that differentiate-segregate the most the population. Finite data
size effects and estimation biases severely constrain the effective computation
of the information topology on data, and we provide simple statistical tests
for the undersampling bias and the k-dependences following. We give an example
of application of these methods to genetic expression and unsupervised
cell-type classification. The methods unravel biologically relevant subtypes,
with a sample size of 41 genes and with few errors. It establishes generic
basic methods to quantify the epigenetic information storage and a unified
epigenetic unsupervised learning formalism. We propose that higher-order
statistical interactions and non identically distributed variables are
constitutive characteristics of biological systems that should be estimated in
order to unravel their significant statistical structure and diversity. The
topological information data analysis presented here allows to precisely
estimate this higher-order structure characteristic of biological systems.

<p>Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) helps constructing functional
brain networks by using brain activity information. Principal component
analysis (PCA) and independent component analysis (ICA) are widely used methods
to generate functional brain networks. However, these methods lack modeling
dependencies of the constructed methods. In this study as alternative to these
conventional methods, we model dependencies of the network via correlated
sparsity patterns. We formulate this challenge as a new dictionary learning
problem and propose two approaches to solve the problem effectively.

<p>Preventing early progression of epilepsy and so the severity of seizures
requires an effective diagnosis. Epileptic transients indicate the ability to
develop seizures but humans overlook such brief events in an
electroencephalogram (EEG) what compromises patient treatment. Traditionally,
training of the EEG event detection algorithms has relied on ground truth
labels, obtained from the consensus of the majority of labelers. In this work,
we go beyond labeler consensus on EEG data. Our event descriptor integrates EEG
signal features with one-hot encoded labeler category that is a key to improved
generalization performance. Notably, boosted decision trees take advantage of
singly-labeled but more varied training sets. Our quantitative experiments show
the proposed labeler-hot epileptic event detector consistently outperforms a
consensus-trained detector and maintains confidence bounds of the detection.
The results on our infant EEG recordings suggest datasets can gain higher event
variety faster and thus better performance by shifting available human effort
from consensus-oriented to separate labeling when labels include both, the
event and the labeler category.

The sensory recruitment model envisages visual working memory (VWM) as an emergent property that is encoded and maintained in sensory (visual) regions. The model implies that enhanced sensory-perceptual functions, as in synaesthesia, entail a dedicated VWM-system, showing reduced visual cortex activity as a result of neural specificity. By contrast, sensory-perceptual decline, as in old age, is expected to show enhanced visual cortex activity as a result of neural broadening. To test this model, young grapheme-colour synaesthetes, older adults and young controls engaged in a delayed pair-associative retrieval and a delayed matching-to-sample task, consisting of achromatic fractal stimuli that do not induce synaesthesia. While a previous analysis of this dataset (Pfeifer et al., 2016) has focused on cued retrieval and recognition of pair-associates (i.e. long-term memory), the current study focuses on visual working memory and considers, for the first time, the crucial delay period in which no visual stimuli are present, but working memory processes are engaged. Participants were trained to criterion and demonstrated comparable behavioural performance on VWM tasks. Whole-brain and region-of-interest-analyses revealed significantly lower activity in synaesthetes’ middle frontal gyrus and visual regions (cuneus, inferior temporal cortex) respectively, suggesting greater neural efficiency relative to young and older adults in both tasks. The results support the sensory recruitment model and can explain age and individual WM-differences based on neural specificity in visual cortex.

Over the past 2,500 years, contemplative traditions have explored the nature of the mind using meditation. More recently, neuroimaging research on meditation has revealed differences in brain function and structure in meditators. Nevertheless, the underlying neural mechanisms are still unclear. In order to understand how meditation shapes global activity through the brain, we investigated the spatiotemporal dynamics across the whole-brain functional network using the Intrinsic Ignition Framework. Recent neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that different states of consciousness differ in their underlying dynamical complexity, i.e., how the broadness of communication is elicited and distributed through the brain over time and space. In this work, controls and experienced meditators were scanned using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during resting-state and meditation (focused attention on breathing). Our results evidenced that the dynamical complexity underlying meditation shows less complexity than during resting-state in the meditator group but not in the control group. Furthermore, we report that during resting-state, the brain activity of experienced meditators showed higher metastability (i.e., a wider dynamical regime over time) than the one observed in the control group. Overall, these results indicate that the meditation state operates in a different dynamical regime compared to the resting-state.

Objective
In children screened for dizziness with vergence disorders, we tested short and long term efficacy of orthoptic vergence training (OVT) and instructions to reduce screen usage.
Methods
Prospective study. Of the 179 children referred for vertigo or dizziness (over 3 years) and ophthalmological disorder as the only problem after complete oto-neuro-vestibular testing, 69 presented vergence insufficiency, and 49 accepted to participate to this study. 109 healthy children served as controls. All subjects performed classic orthoptic evaluation and video binocular movement recordings during various oculomotor tasks. Patients were evaluated before OVT (M0), after the end of OVT (M3) and 6 months later (M9). Statistics compared orthoptic and oculomotor parameters between patients and controls over time with one-way ANCOVA, and mixed models, controlling for age and gender.
Results
Patients reported vertigo that was usually rotatory, lasting &lt;15 min, associated or alternating with headache (50%). Their exposure to small videoscreens and TV was intensive (~3.6 h per day). At M0, all orthoptic and oculomotor parameters were statistically different in patients relative to controls (p&lt;0.0001) except for divergence. At M3, vertigo symptoms had disappeared in all of the patients, and all eye movement parameters improved significantly (p&lt;0.0001). At M9, this improvement remained stable or continued. 
Conclusion
Vergence disorders (assessed by abnormal orthoptic and oculomotor parameters) can generate symptoms of dizziness in children. Orthoptic treatment and instruction to reduce screen usage has a significant and long term effect on vertigo symptoms as well as oculomotor performances. Dizzy children should be screened for vergence disorders.

Limited in part by the spatial resolution of typical in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, recent neuroimaging studies have only identified a connectivity-based shell-core-like partitioning of the nucleus accumbens (Acb) in humans. This has hindered the process of making a more refined description of the Acb using non-invasive neuroimaging technologies and approaches. In this study, high-resolution ex vivo macaque brain diffusion MRI data were acquired to investigate the tractography-based parcellation of the Acb. Our results identified a shell-core-like partitioning in macaques that is similar to that in humans as well as an alternative solution that subdivided the Acb into four parcels, the medial shell, the lateral shell, the ventral core, and the dorsal core. Furthermore, we characterized the specific anatomical and functional connectivity profiles of these Acb subregions and generalized their specialized functions to establish a fine-grained macaque Acb brainnetome atlas. This atlas should be helpful in neuroimaging, stereotactic surgery, and comparative neuroimaging studies to reveal the neurophysiological substrates of various diseases and cognitive functions associated with the Acb.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00690">Simultaneous EEG-fMRI: Evaluating the Effect of the EEG Cap-Cabling Configuration on the Gradient Artifact</a></h4>

Electroencephalography (EEG) data recorded during simultaneous EEG-fMRI experiments are contaminated by large gradient artefacts (GA). The amplitude of the GA depends on the area of the wire loops formed by the EEG leads, as well as on the rate of switching of the magnetic field gradients, which are essential for MR imaging. Average artefact subtraction (AAS), the method most commonly used method for GA correction, relies on the EEG amplifier having a large enough dynamic range to characterize the artefact voltages. Low-pass filtering (250 Hz cut-off) is generally used to attenuate the high-frequency voltage fluctuations of the GA, but even with this precaution channel saturation can occur, particularly during acquisition of high spatial resolution MRI data. Previous work has shown that the ribbon cable, used to connect the EEG cap and amplifier, makes a significant contribution to the GA, since the cable geometry produces large effective wire-loop areas. However, by appropriately connecting the wires of the ribbon cable to the EEG cap it should be possible to minimize the overall range and root mean square (RMS) amplitude of the GA by producing partial cancellation of the cap and cable contributions. Here by modifying the connections of the EEG cap to a 1 m ribbon cable we were able to reduce the range of the GA for a high-resolution coronal echo planar Imaging (EPI) acquisition by a factor of ~ 1.6 and by a factor of ~ 1.15 for a standard axial EPI acquisition. These changes could potentially be translated into a reduction in the required dynamic range, an increase in the EEG bandwidth or an increase in the achievable image resolution without saturation, all of which could be beneficially exploited in EEG-fMRI studies. The re-wiring could also prevent the system from saturating when small subject movements occur using the standard recording bandwidth.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00683">On the Role of Adenosine A2A Receptor Gene Transcriptional Regulation in Parkinson’s Disease</a></h4>

Adenosine A2A receptors (A2ARs) have attracted considerable attention as an important molecular target for the design of Parkinson’s disease (PD) therapeutic compounds. Here, we studied the transcriptional regulation of the A2AR gene in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from PD patients and in the striatum of the well-validated, 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced PD mouse model.  We report an increase in A2AR mRNA expression and protein levels in both human cells and mice striata, and in the latter we could also observe a consistent reduction in DNA methylation at gene promoter and an increase in histone H3 acetylation at lysine 9. Of particular relevance in clinical samples, we also observed higher levels in the receptor gene expression in younger subjects, as well as in those with less years from disease onset and less severe disease according to clinical scores. In conclusion, the present findings provide further evidence of the relevant role of A2AR in PD and, based on the clinical data, highlight its potential role as disease biomarker for PD especially at the initial stages of disease development. Furthermore, our preclinical results also suggest selective epigenetic mechanisms targeting gene promoter as tool for the development of new treatments.

Objectives: To evaluate white matter hyperintensities (WMH) quantification reproducibility from multiple aspects of view, examine the effects of scan-rescan procedure, types of scanner, imaging protocols, scanner software upgrade, and automatic segmentation tools on WMH quantification results using MRI. 
Methods: Six post-stroke subjects (4 males; mean age 62.8, range 58-72 years) were scanned and rescanned with both 3D T1-weighted, 2D and 3D T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (T2-FLAIR) MRI across four different MRI scanners within 12 hours. Two automated WMH segmentation and quantification tools were used to measure WMH volume based on each MR scan. Robustness was assessed using the coefficient of variation (CV).
Results: Experimental results show that the best reproducibility was achieved by using 3D T2-FLAIR MRI under intra-scanner setting with CV ranging from 2.69% to 2.97%, while the largest variability resulted from comparing WMH volumes measured based on 2D T2-FLAIR MRI with those of 3D T2-FLAIR MRI, with CV values in the range of 15.62%-29.33%. The WMH quantification variability based on 2D MRIs is larger than 3D MRIs due to their large slice thickness. In addition to image acquisition, the choice of automatic WMH segmentation tool also has a large impact on WMH quantification.
Conclusions: WMH reproducibility is one of the primary issues to be considered in multicenter and longitudinal studies. The study provides solid guidance in assisting multicenter and longitudinal study design to achieve meaningful results with enough power.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00668">Identifying Imaging Markers for Predicting Cognitive Assessments Using Wasserstein Distances Based Matrix Regression</a></h4>

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a severe type of neurodegeneration which worsens human memory, thinking and cognition along a temporal continuum. How to identify the informative  phenotypic neuroimaging markers and accurately predict cognitive assessment are crucial for early detection and diagnosis Alzheimer's disease. Regression models are widely used to predict the relationship between imaging biomarkers and cognitive assessment, and identify discriminative neuroimaging markers. Most existing methods use different matrix norms as the similarity measures of the empirical loss or regularization to improve the prediction performance, but ignore the inherent geometry of the cognitive data. To tackle this issue, in this paper we propose a novel robust matrix regression model with imposing Wasserstein distances on both loss function and regularization. It successfully integrate Wasserstein distance into the regression model, which can excavate the latent geometry of cognitive data. We introduce an efficient algorithm to solve the proposed new model with convergence analysis. Empirical results on cognitive data of the  ADNI cohort demonstrate the great effectiveness of the proposed method for clinical cognitive predication.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00618">Characterizing Rapid Fluctuations of Resting State Functional Connectivity in Demyelinating, Neurodegenerative, and Psychiatric Conditions: From Static to Time-Varying Analysis</a></h4>

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at resting state (RS) has been widely used to characterize the main brain networks. Functional connectivity (FC) has been mostly assessed assuming that FC is stationary across the whole fMRI examination. However, FC is highly variable at a very fast time-scale, as demonstrated by neurophysiological techniques. Dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) is a novel approach that allows capturing reoccurring patterns of interaction among functional brain networks. Aim of this review is to provide a description of the methods currently used to assess dFC on RS fMRI data, and to summarize the main results of studies applying dFC in healthy controls and patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). An overview of the main results obtained in neurodegenerative and psychiatric conditions is also provided.
The most popular dFC approach is based on the so-called “sliding windows”, in which the RS fMRI acquisition is divided in small temporal segments (windows). A window of fixed length is shifted over RS fMRI time courses, and data within each window are used to calculate FC and its variability over time. Sliding windows can be combined with clustering techniques to identify recurring FC states or used to assess global dFC properties of large-scale functional networks or specific brain regions. 
dFC studies have used heterogeneous methodologies so far. Despite this, similar results have been obtained across investigations. In healthy subjects, the default-mode network (DMN) exhibited the highest degree of connectivity dynamism. In MS patients, abnormal global dFC properties and dFC strengths were found mainly in sensorimotor, DMN and salience networks, and were associated with more severe structural MRI damage and with more severe physical and cognitive disability. Conversely, abnormal dFC measures of the temporal network were correlated with better cognitive performances and less severe fatigue. In patients with neurodegenerative and psychiatric conditions, dFC abnormalities of the DMN, attention and executive networks were associated to more severe clinical manifestations.
Dynamic FC helps to provide novel insights into fundamental properties of functional networks, and improves the understanding of brain reorganization mechanisms. Future technical advances might help to clarify dFC association with disease prognosis and response to treatment.

To become acquainted with large-scale environments such as cities people combine direct
experience and indirect sources such as maps. To ascertain which type of spatial knowledge is
acquired by which source is difficult to evaluate. Using virtual reality enables the possibility
to investigate whether knowledge is learned by direct experience or the use of a map
differentially. Therefore, we designed a large virtual city, comprised of over 200 houses, and
evaluated spatial knowledge acquisition after city exploration with an interactive map
following one and three 30-minute exploration sessions. We tested subjects’ knowledge of the
orientation of houses facing directions towards cardinal north, of orientations of houses facing
directions relative to each other and pointing from one house to another. Our results revealed
that increased familiarity after extended exploration with the map improved task accuracy.
Further, it revealed task differences, caused mainly by a better accuracy in the relative
orientation task than the pointing task. Time for cognitive reasoning improved overall task
accuracy. Learning with our VR city map revealed an absence of distance effect, an alignment
effect of tested house orientation towards map north and an angular difference effect between
tested stimuli. Self-reported knowledge of cardinal directions learned in the real environment
was positively correlated with task accuracy testing houses orientations towards cardinal
north. Overall, our results suggest that participants learned spatial information that is directly
available in the interactive map, while a spatial task that needed integration of learned
knowledge stayed at lower accuracy levels.

There is sufficient evidence to believe that variations in the error-related negativity (ERN) are linked to dispositional characteristics in individuals. However, explanations of individual differences in the amplitude of the ERN cannot be derived from functional theories of the ERN. The ERN has a counterpart that occurs after correct responses (correct-response negativity, CRN). Based on the assumption that ERN and CRN reflect an identical cognitive process, variations in CRN might be associated with dispositional characteristics as well. Higher CRN amplitudes have been found to reflect task engagement. In the present study, a simple-choice-reaction task was used to investigate ERN and CRN amplitudes in relation to their score on a conscientiousness scale. The task consisted of a simple rule that required pressing the left or right key when a circle or square appeared, respectively. During alternative conditions that occur infrequently, participants were instructed to violate or reverse the previously established response rules. Smaller ΔERN amplitudes (manifested in almost equal CRN and ERN amplitudes) and a tendency of better task performance from participants scoring high on the conscientiousness scale might indicate a greater focus on the task and higher motivation of responding correctly. In addition, higher Pc amplitudes directly following the CRN indicated that the response monitoring system of less conscientious participants showed a higher disengagement. The role of individual differences in CRN amplitude should be studied in future experiments on performance monitoring.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00237">Promoting Psychological Well-Being Through an Evidence-Based Mindfulness Training Program</a></h4>

Psychological well-being is a core feature of mental health, and may be defined as including hedonic (enjoyment, pleasure) and eudaimonic (meaning, fulfilment) happiness, as well as resilience (coping, emotion regulation, healthy problem solving). To promote psychological well-being, it is helpful to understand the underlying mechanisms associated with this construct and then develop targeted and effective training programs. In this perspective paper, we discuss key components and potential brain-body mechanisms related to psychological well-being and propose mindfulness training as a promising way to improve it. Based on a series of RCT studies of one form of mindfulness training in adolescents and adults, the integrative body-mind training (IBMT), we use IBMT as an exemplar to provide research evidence of the positive effects of mindfulness training on psychological well-being. We focus on one of the mechanisms by which IBMT enhances psychological well-being – the interaction between mind (mindfulness) and body (bodifulness) -- which involves both the central nervous system and the autonomic nervous system. We also highlight the role of brain self-control networks, including the anterior cingulate cortex/prefrontal cortex (ACC/PFC), in improving psychological well-being. We suggest that mindfulness training may be a promising program that promotes the synergistic engagement of mind and body to achieve the goals of enhancing psychological well-being.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2019.00040">A Computational Model of Attention Control in Multi-Attribute, Context-Dependent Decision Making</a></h4>

Real-life decisions often require a comparison of multi-attribute options with various benefits and costs, and the evaluation of each option depends partly on the other ones in the choice set (i.e., the choice context). Although reinforcement learning models have successfully described choice behavior, it remains unclear how multi-attribute information is taken into account for making a context-dependent decision in reinforcement learning algorithms. Here we develop a computational model of attention control that includes context effects on multi-attribute decisions, linking a context-dependent choice model with a reinforcement learning model. The overall model suggests that the distinctiveness of attributes guides an individual’s preferences among multi-attribute options via an attention-control mechanism that determines whether choices are selectively biased toward the most distinctive attribute (selective attention) or proportionally distributed based on the relative distinctiveness of attributes (divided attention). To test the model, we conducted a behavioral experiment in rhesus monkeys, in which they made simple multi-attribute decisions over three conditions that manipulated the degree of distinctiveness between alternatives: (1) four foods of different size and calorie; (2) four pieces of the same food in different colors; and (3) four identical pieces of food. The model simulation of the choice behavior captured the preference bias (i.e., overall preference structure) and the choice persistence (repeated choices) in the empirical data, providing evidence for the respective influences of attention and memory on preference bias and choice persistence. Our study provides insights into computations underlying multi-attribute decisions, linking attentional control to decision-making processes.

Spiking activities of midbrain dopaminergic neurons are critical for key brain functions including motor control and affective behaviors. Voltage-gated Na+ channels determine neuronal excitability and action potential (AP) generation. Previous studies on dopaminergic neuron excitability mainly focused on Na+ channels at the somatodendritic compartments. Properties of axonal Na+ channels, however, remain largely unknown. Using patch-clamp recording from somatic nucleated patches and isolated axonal blebs from the axon initial segment (AIS) of dopaminergic neurons in mouse midbrain slices, we found that AIS channel density is approximately 4-9 fold higher than that at the soma. Similar voltage dependence of channel activation and inactivation was observed between somatic and axonal channels in both SNc and VTA cells, except that SNc somatic channels inactivate at more hyperpolarized membrane potentials (Vm). In both SNc and VTA, axonal channels take longer time to inactivate at a subthreshold depolarization Vm level, but are faster to recover from inactivation than somatic channels. Moreover, we found that immunosignals of Nav1.2 accumulate at the AIS of dopaminergic neurons. In contrast, Nav1.1 and Nav1.6 immunosignals are not detectible. Together, our results reveal a high density of Na+ channels at the AIS and their molecular identity. In general, somatic and axonal channels of both SNc and VTA dopaminergic neurons share similar biophysical properties. The relatively delayed inactivation onset and faster recovery from inactivation of axonal Na+ channels may ensure AP initiation at high frequencies and faithful signal conduction along the axon.

Mitochondria are the critical organelles for energy metabolism and cell survival in eukaryotic cells. Recent studies demonstrated that mitochondria can intercellularly transfer between mammalian cells. In neural cells, astrocytes transfer mitochondria into neurons in a CD38-dependent manner. Here, using co-culture system of neural cell lines, primary neural cells, and human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived neural cells, we further revealed that mitochondria dynamically transferred between astrocytes and also from neuronal cells into astrocytes, to which CD38/cADPR signaling and mitochondrial Rho GTPases (MIRO1 and MIRO2) contributed. The transfer consequently elevated mitochondrial membrane potential in the recipient cells. By introducing Alexander disease (AxD)-associated hotspot mutations (R79C, R239C) into GFAP gene of hPSCs and subsequently inducing astrocyte differentiation, we found that GFAP mutations impaired mitochondrial transfer from astrocytes and reduced astrocytic CD38 expression. Thus, our study suggested that mitochondria dynamically transferred between neural cells and revealed that AxD-causing mutations disrupted the astrocytic transfer, providing a potential pathogenic mechanism in AxD.

Trans-synaptic neurotransmission of both electrical and neurochemical information in the central nervous system (CNS) is achieved through a highly interactive network of neuron-specific synaptic proteins that include pre-synaptic and post-synaptic elements. These elements include a family of several well-characterized integral- and trans-membrane synaptic core proteins necessary for the efficient operation of this complex signaling network, and include the pre-synaptic proteins: (i) neurexin-1 (NRXN-1); (ii) the synaptosomal-associated phosphoprotein-25 (SNAP-25); and (iii) the phosphoprotein synapsin-2 (SYN-2); and the post-synaptic elements: (iv) neuroligin (NLGN), a critical cell adhesion protein; and (v) the SH3-ankyrin repeat domain, proline-rich cytoskeletal scaffolding protein SHANK3. All five of these pre- and post-synaptic proteins have been found to be significantly down-regulated in primary human neuronal-glial (HNG) cell co-cultures after exposure to Bacteroides fragilis lipopolysaccharide (BF-LPS). Interestingly, LPS has also been reported to be abundant in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) affected brain cells where there are significant deficits in this same family of synaptic components. This ‘Perspectives‘ paper will review current research progress and discuss the latest findings in this research area. Overall these experimental results provide evidence (i) that gastrointestinal (GI) tract-derived Gram-negative bacterial exudates such as BF-LPS express their neurotoxicity in the CNS in part through the directed down-regulation of neuron-specific neurofilaments and synaptic signaling proteins; and (ii) that this may explain the significant alterations in immune-responses and cognitive deficits observed after bacterial-derived LPS exposure to the human CNS.

The incoming signals from injured sensory neurons upon peripheral inflammation are processed in the dorsal horn of spinal cord, where glial cells accumulate and play a critical role in initiating allodynia (increased pain in response to light-touch). However, how painful stimuli in the periphery engage glial reactivity in the spinal cord remains unclear. Here, we found that a hind paw inflammation induced by CFA produce robust morphological changes in spinal astrocytes and microglia compatible with the reactive phenotype. Strikingly, we discovered that a single intrathecal injection with venom peptides that inhibit calcium channels reversed all the glial pathological features of the peripheral inflammation. These effects were more apparent in rats treated with the Phα1β spider toxin (non-specific calcium channel antagonist) than ω-MVIIA cone snail toxin (selective N-type calcium channel antagonist). These data reveal for the first time a venom peptide acting on glial structural remodeling in vivo. We, therefore, suggest that calcium-dependent plasticity is an essential trigger for glial cells to initiate reactivity, which may represent a new target for the antinociceptive effects of Phα1β and ω-MVIIA toxins in inflammatory pain conditions

Sepsis-associated encephalopathy induces cognitive dysfunction via mechanisms that commonly involve neuroinflammation and synaptic plasticity impairment of the hippocampus. The β2–adrenoceptor (β2–AR) is a G–protein coupled receptor that regulates immune response and synaptic plasticity, whereas its dysfunction has been implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, we hypothesized abnormal β2–AR signaling is involved in sepsis–induced cognitive impairment. In the present study, C57BL/6 mice were subjected to cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) to mimic the clinical human sepsis-associated encephalopathy. The levels of hippocampal β2–AR, proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF–α), interleukin–1β (IL–1β), IL–6, cAMP–response element binding protein (CREB), brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), post–synaptic density protein 95 (PSD95), and NMDA receptor 2 B subtypes (GluN2B) were determined at 6 h, 12 h, 24 h, 7 d, and 16 d after CLP. For the interventional study, mice were treated with β2–AR agonist clenbuterol in two ways: early treatment (immediately following CLP) and delayed treatment (on the eighth day following CLP). Neurobehavioral performances were assessed by open field and fear conditioning tests. Here, we found that hippocampal β2–AR expression was significantly decreased starting from 12 h and persisted until 16 d following CLP. Besides, sepsis mice also exhibited increasing neuroinflammation, down-regulated CREB/BDNF, decreasing PSD95 and GluN2B expression, and displayed hippocampus–dependent cognitive impairments. Notably, early clenbuterol treatment alleviated sepsis–induced cognitive deficits by polarizing microglia toward an anti–inflammatory phenotype, reducing proinflammatory cytokines including IL–1β, TNF–α , and up–regulating CREB/BDNF, PSD95 and GluN2B. Intriguingly, delayed clenbuterol treatment also improved cognitive impairments by normalization of hippocampal CREB/BDNF, PSD95 and GluN2B. In summary, our results support the beneficial effects of both early and delayed clenbuterol treatment, which suggests that activation of β2–AR has a translational value in sepsis–associated organ dysfunction including cognitive impairments.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/47454">The mechanosensitive Piezo1 channel is required for bone formation</a></h4>

Mechanical load of the skeleton system is essential for the development, growth, and maintenance of bone. However, the molecular mechanism by which mechanical stimuli are converted into osteogenesis and bone formation remains unclear. Here we report that Piezo1, a bona fide mechanotransducer critical for various biological processes, plays a critical role in bone formation. Knockout of Piezo1 in osteoblast lineage cells disrupts osteogenesis of osteoblasts and severely impairs bone structure and strength. Mechanical unloading induced bone loss is blunted in the Piezo1 knockout mice. Intriguingly, simulated microgravity treatment reduced the function of osteoblasts via suppressing the expression of Piezo1. Furthermore, osteoporosis patients show reduced expression of Piezo1, which is closely correlated with osteoblast dysfunction. These data collectively suggest that Piezo1 functions as a key mechanotransducer for conferring mechanosensitivity to osteoblasts and determining mechanical-load-dependent bone formation, and represents a novel therapeutic target for treating osteoporosis or mechanical unloading-induced severe bone loss.

The bacterial Sec translocon is a multi-protein complex responsible for translocating diverse proteins across the plasma membrane. For post-translational protein translocation, the Sec-channel - SecYEG - associates with the motor protein SecA to mediate the ATP-dependent transport of pre-proteins across the membrane. Previously, a diffusional based Brownian ratchet mechanism for protein secretion has been proposed [Allen et al. eLife 2016;5:e15598]; the structural dynamics required to facilitate this mechanism remain unknown. We employ hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) to reveal striking nucleotide-dependent conformational changes in the Sec protein-channel from <i>Escherichia coli</i>. In addition to the ATP-dependent opening of SecY, reported previously, we observe a counteracting, and ATP-dependent, constriction of SecA around the pre-protein. ATP binding causes SecY to open and SecA to close; while, ADP produced by hydrolysis, has the opposite effect. This alternating behaviour could help impose the directionality of the Brownian ratchet for protein transport through the Sec machinery.

Congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (CHH) is a condition characterized by absent puberty and infertility due to gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) deficiency, which is often associated with anosmia (Kallmann syndrome, KS). We identified loss-of-function heterozygous mutations in anti-Müllerian hormone (<i>AMH</i>) and its receptor, <i>AMHR2</i>, in 3% of CHH probands using whole-exome sequencing. We showed that during embryonic development, AMH is expressed in migratory GnRH neurons in both mouse and human fetuses and unconvered a novel function of AMH as a pro-motility factor for GnRH neurons. Pathohistological analysis of <i>Amhr2</i>-deficient mice showed abnormal development of the peripheral olfactory system and defective embryonic migration of the neuroendocrine GnRH cells to the basal forebrain, which results in reduced fertility in adults. Our findings highlight a novel role for AMH in the development and function of GnRH neurons and indicate that AMH signaling insufficiency contributes to the pathogenesis of CHH in humans.

Non-segmented negative-strand RNA viruses, such as Measles, Ebola and Newcastle disease viruses (NDV), encapsidate viral genomic RNAs into helical nucleocapsids which serve as the template for viral replication and transcription. Here, the clam-shaped nucleocapsid structure, where the NDV viral genome is sequestered, was determined at 4.8 Å resolution by cryo-electron microscopy. The clam-shaped structure is composed of two single-turn spirals packed in a back-to-back mode, and the tightly packed structure functions as a seed for nucleocapsid to assemble from both directions and grows into double-headed filaments with two separate RNA strings inside. Disruption of this structure by mutations on its loop interface yielded a single-headed unfunctional filament.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/45045">Task-induced functional brain connectivity mediates the relationship between striatal D2/3 receptors and working memory</a></h4>

Working memory performance is thought to depend on both striatal dopamine 2/3 receptors (D2/3Rs) and task-induced functional organisation in key cortical brain networks. Here, we combine functional magnetic resonance imaging and D2/3R positron emission tomography in 51 healthy volunteers, to investigate the relationship between working memory performance, task-induced default mode network (DMN) functional connectivity changes, and striatal D2/3R availability. Increasing working memory load was associated with reduced DMN functional connectivity, which was itself associated with poorer task performance. Crucially, the magnitude of the DMN connectivity reduction correlated with striatal D2/3R availability, particularly in the caudate, and this relationship mediated the relationship between striatal D2/3R availability and task performance. These results inform our understanding of natural variation in working memory performance, and have implications for understanding age-related cognitive decline and cognitive impairments in neuropsychiatric disorders where dopamine signalling is altered.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/44752">Translational regulation of protrusion-localized RNAs involves silencing and clustering after transport</a></h4>

Localization of RNAs to various subcellular destinations is a widely used mechanism that regulates a large proportion of transcripts in polarized cells. In many cases, such localized transcripts mediate spatial control of gene expression by being translationally silent while in transit and locally activated at their destination. Here, we investigate the translation of RNAs localized at dynamic cellular protrusions of human and mouse, migrating, mesenchymal cells. In contrast to the model described above, we find that protrusion-localized RNAs are not locally activated solely at protrusions, but can be translated with similar efficiency in both internal and peripheral locations. Interestingly, protrusion-localized RNAs are translated at extending protrusions, they become translationally silenced in retracting protrusions and this silencing is accompanied by coalescence of single RNAs into larger heterogeneous RNA clusters. This work describes a distinct mode of translational regulation of localized RNAs, which we propose is used to regulate protein activities during dynamic cellular responses.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/42271">Conformational change within the extracellular domain of B cell receptor in B cell activation upon antigen binding</a></h4>

B lymphocytes use B cell receptors (BCRs) to recognize antigens. It is still not clear how BCR transduces antigen-specific physical signals upon binding across cell membrane for the conversion to chemical signals, triggering downstream signaling cascades. It is hypothesized that through a series of conformational changes within BCR, antigen engagement in the extracellular domain of BCR is transduced to its intracellular domain. By combining site-specific labeling methodology and FRET-based assay, we monitored conformational changes in the extracellular domains within BCR upon antigen engagement. Conformational changes within heavy chain of membrane-bound immunoglobulin (mIg), as well as conformational changes in the spatial relationship between mIg and Igβ were observed. These conformational changes were correlated with the strength of BCR activation and were distinct in IgM- and IgG-BCR. These findings provide molecular mechanisms to explain the fundamental aspects of BCR activation and a framework to investigate ligand-induced molecular events in immune receptors.

Microglial receptors CD33 and TREM2 exhibit opposite effects on Aβ pathology and microglial activity in AD mice. In crosstalk between these receptors, TREM2 is required for differential gene expression in 5xFAD mice deficient for CD33 and acts downstream of CD33.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/698282v1?rss=1">A mathematical model of ephaptic interactions in neuronal fiber pathways: could there be more than transmission along the tracts?</a></h4>

In the past several decades, there has been numerous experimental and modeling efforts to study ephaptic interactions in neuronal systems. While studies on the matter have looked at either axons of the peripheral nervous system or cortical neuronal structures, no attention has be given to the possibility of ephaptic interactions in the white matter tracts of the brain. Inspired by the highly organized and tightly packed geometry of axons in neuronal fiber pathways, we aim to theoretically investigate the potential effects of ephaptic interactions along these structures that are resilient to experimental probing. For that end, we use axonal cable theory to derive a minimal model of a sheet of N ephaptically coupled axons. We numerically solve the equations and explore the dynamics of the system as the ephaptic coupling parameter is varied. We demonstrate that ephaptic interactions can lead to local phase locking between impulses traveling along adjacent axons. As ephaptic coupling is increased, traveling impulses trigger new impulses along adjacent axons resulting in finite size traveling fronts. For strong enough coupling, impulses propagate laterally and backwards, resulting in complex spatio-temporal patterns. While it is common for large scale brain network models to assume the role of brain fiber pathways to be that of mere transmission of signals between different brain regions, our work calls for a closer re-examination of the validity of such a view. The results suggest that in the presence of significant ephaptic interactions the brain fiber tracts can act as a dynamic active medium.nnAuthor summaryStarting from local circuit theory and the Fitzhugh-Nagumo cable model of an axon, we derive a system of nonlinear coupled partial differential equations (PDEs) to model a sheet of N ephaptically coupled axons. We also put forward a continuous limit approximation that transforms the model into a field equation in the form of a two-dimensional PDE that allows for the extension of the model to a 3D domain. We numerically solve the equations and explore the dynamic responses as the ephaptic coupling strength is varied. We observe that ephaptic interaction allows for phase locking of adjacent impulses and coordination of subthreshold dynamics. In addition, when strong enough, ephaptic interaction can lead to the generation of new impulses along the axons as well as lateral and backward propagation in the form of traveling fronts and complex spatio-temporal patterns. The transition between different dynamic regimes happens abruptly at critical values of the parameter. We also compare the dynamics of the two models and find good qualitative correspondence in certain parameter regimes. The results put into question the validity of assuming the role of fiber pathways to be that of mere interneuronal transmission and calls for further investigation of the matter.

Striatal dopamine (DA) is critical for action and learning. Recent data show DA release is under tonic inhibition by striatal GABA. Ambient striatal GABA tone on striatal projection neurons can be governed by plasma membrane GABA uptake transporters (GATs) on astrocytes. However, whether striatal GATs and astrocytes determine DA output are unknown. We reveal that DA release in mouse dorsolateral striatum, but not nucleus accumbens core, is governed by GAT-3 and GAT-1. These GATs are partly localized to astrocytes, and are enriched in dorsolateral striatum compared to accumbens core. In a mouse model of parkinsonism, GATs become downregulated and tonic GABAergic inhibition of DA release augmented, despite attenuated GABA co-release from dopaminergic axons. These data define previously unappreciated and important roles for GATs and astrocytes in determining DA release in striatum, and reveal that they underlie maladaptive plasticity in early parkinsonism that impairs DA output in vulnerable striatal regions.

Annotation of cell identity is an essential process in neuroscience that allows for comparing neural activities across different animals. In C. elegans, although unique identities have been assigned to all neurons, the number of annotatable neurons in an intact animal is limited in practice and comprehensive methods for cell annotation are required. Here we propose an efficient annotation method that can be integrated with the whole-brain imaging technique. We systematically identified neurons in the head region of 311 adult worms using 35 cell-specific promoters and created a dataset of the expression patterns and the positions of the neurons. The large positional variations illustrated the difficulty of the annotation task. We investigated multiple combinations of cell-specific promoters to tackle this problem. We also developed an automatic annotation method with human interaction functionality that facilitates annotation for whole-brain imaging.

<p>by Aravind Chandrasekaran, Arpita Upadhyaya, Garegin A. Papoian</p>

Bundled actin structures play a key role in maintaining cellular shape, in aiding force transmission to and from extracellular substrates, and in affecting cellular motility. Recent studies have also brought to light new details on stress generation, force transmission and contractility of actin bundles. In this work, we are primarily interested in the question of what determines the stability of actin bundles and what network geometries do unstable bundles eventually transition to. To address this problem, we used the MEDYAN mechano-chemical force field, modeling several micron-long actin bundles in 3D, while accounting for a comprehensive set of chemical, mechanical and transport processes. We developed a hierarchical clustering algorithm for classification of the different long time scale morphologies in our study. Our main finding is that initially unipolar bundles are significantly more stable compared with an apolar initial configuration. Filaments within the latter bundles slide easily with respect to each other due to myosin activity, producing a loose network that can be subsequently severely distorted. At high myosin concentrations, a morphological transition to aster-like geometries was observed. We also investigated how actin treadmilling rates influence bundle dynamics, and found that enhanced treadmilling leads to network fragmentation and disintegration, while this process is opposed by myosin and crosslinking activities. Interestingly, treadmilling bundles with an initial apolar geometry eventually evolve to a whole gamut of network morphologies based on relative positions of filament ends, such as sarcomere-like organization. We found that apolar bundles show a remarkable sensitivity to environmental conditions, which may be important in enabling rapid cytoskeletal structural reorganization and adaptation in response to intracellular and extracellular cues.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/FjN9IniVQbo" width="1" />

Abstract<p>Despite the importance of the prefrontal-amygdala network for emotion processing, valence-dependent coupling within this network remains elusive. In this study, we assessed the effect of emotional valence on brain activity and effective connectivity. We tested which functional pathways within the prefrontal-amygdala network are specifically engaged during the processing of emotional valence. Thirty-three healthy adults were examined with functional magnetic resonance imaging while performing a dynamic faces and dynamic shapes matching task. The valence of the facial expressions varied systematically between positive, negative, and neutral across the task. Functional contrasts determined core areas of the emotion processing circuitry, comprising the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), the right lateral prefrontal cortex, the amygdala and the right fusiform face area. Dynamic causal modelling demonstrated that the bidirectional coupling within the prefrontal-amygdala circuitry is modulated by emotional valence. Additionally, Bayesian model averaging showed significant bottom-up connectivity from the amygdala to the MPFC during negative and neutral, but not positive, valence. Thus, our study provides strong evidence for alterations of bottom-up coupling within the prefrontal-amygdala network as a function of emotional valence. Thereby our results not only advance the understanding of the human prefrontal-amygdala circuitry in varying valence context, but, moreover, provide a model to examine mechanisms of valence-sensitive emotional dysregulation in neuropsychiatric disorders.</p><p><b>Significance statement</b> Recent neuroimaging studies have emphasized the importance of valence-sensitivity within the prefrontal-amygdala network during emotion processing. Yet, it remains elusive which specific pathways are involved in processing affective information, and how this information is integrated in the brain’s network. In particular, the amygdala’s role in signaling valence information to the cortex is subject to ongoing discussions. Moreover, as aberrant brain function has been found in the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex in various debilitating psychiatric disorders, understanding the mechanisms of processing emotional stimuli with different valence (positive, negative, neutral) is particularly relevant for the field. Our findings indicate changes in coupling strength as a function of emotional valence within the prefrontal-amygdala network.</p>

<p>Understanding neurocognitive computations will require not just localizing
cognitive information distributed throughout the brain but also determining how
that information got there. We review recent advances in linking (empirical and
simulated) brain network organization with cognitive information processing.
Building on these advances, we offer a new framework for understanding the role
of connectivity in cognition - network coding (encoding/decoding) models. These
models utilize connectivity to specify the transfer of information via neural
activity flow processes, successfully predicting the formation of cognitive
representations (e.g., face selectivity in the fusiform face area). The success
of these models supports the possibility that localized neural functions
mechanistically emerge (are computed) from distributed activity flow processes
that are specified primarily by connectivity patterns.

<p>Bounded diffusion processes are models of transport phenomena with wide
applicability across many fields. These processes are described by their
probability density functions (PDFs), which often obey Fokker-Planck equations
(FPEs). While obtaining analytical solutions is often possible in unbounded
regions, obtaining closed-form solutions to the FPE is more challenging once
absorbing boundaries are present. As a result, analyses of these processes have
largely relied on approximations or direct simulations. In this paper, we
studied two-dimensional, time-homogeneous, spatially-correlated diffusion with
absorbing boundaries. Our main results is the explicit construction of a full
family of closed-form solutions for their PDFs using the method of images
(MoI). We found that such solutions can be built if and only if the correlation
coefficient $\rho$ between the two diffusing processes takes one of a numerable
set of values. Using a geometric argument, we derived the complete set of
$\rho$'s where such solutions can be found. Solvable $\rho$'s are given by
$\rho = - \cos \left( \frac{\pi}{k} \right)$, where $k \in \mathbb{Z}^+ \cup \{
-1\}$. Solutions were validated in simulations. Qualitative behaviors of the
process appear to vary smoothly over $\rho$, allowing extrapolation from our
solutions to cases with unsolvable $\rho$'s.

<p>The scientific study of consciousness is a new field which has emerged as a
response to groundbreaking developments in neuroscience, cognitive psychology
and analytic philosophy. Its aim is to develop a scientific account, formulated
in terms of formal mathematical laws or regularities, of how conscious
experience relates to the physical domain (e.g. to brain processes). Even
though several models of consciousness have been proposed in the literature,
details of the underlying conceptual terminology and formal framework remain
poorly understood. This paper aims to improve this situation by proposing a
grounding of the scientific study of consciousness which is based on a concise
definition of the object of investigation and gives rise to a clear-cut
mathematical framework for models of consciousness. Several examples are
studied and an application of this framework is given. The underlying
definitions are a further development of the grounding of the scientific study
of consciousness developed by David Chalmers and Thomas Nagel.

<p>In lieu of an abstract here is the first paragraph: No other species remotely
approaches the human capacity for the cultural evolution of novelty that is
accumulative, adaptive, and open-ended (i.e., with no a priori limit on the
size or scope of possibilities). By culture we mean extrasomatic
adaptations--including behavior and technology--that are socially rather than
sexually transmitted. This chapter synthesizes research from anthropology,
psychology, archaeology, and agent-based modeling into a speculative yet
coherent account of two fundamental cognitive transitions underlying human
cultural evolution that is consistent with contemporary psychology. While the
chapter overlaps with a more technical paper on this topic (Gabora &amp; Smith
2018), it incorporates new research and elaborates a genetic component to our
overall argument. The ideas in this chapter grew out of a non-Darwinian
framework for cultural evolution, referred to as the Self-other Reorganization
(SOR) theory of cultural evolution (Gabora, 2013, in press; Smith, 2013), which
was inspired by research on the origin and earliest stage in the evolution of
life (Cornish-Bowden &amp; C\'ardenas 2017; Goldenfeld, Biancalani, &amp; Jafarpour,
2017, Vetsigian, Woese, &amp; Goldenfeld 2006; Woese, 2002). SOR bridges
psychological research on fundamental aspects of our human nature such as
creativity and our proclivity to reflect on ideas from different perspectives,
with the literature on evolutionary approaches to cultural evolution that
aspire to synthesize the behavioral sciences much as has been done for the
biological scientists. The current chapter is complementary to this effort, but
less abstract; it attempts to ground the theory of cultural evolution in terms
of cognitive transitions as suggested by archaeological evidence.

<p>The common view that our creativity is what makes us uniquely human suggests
that incorporating research on human creativity into generative deep learning
techniques might be a fruitful avenue for making their outputs more compelling
and human-like. Using an original synthesis of Deep Dream-based convolutional
neural networks and cognitive based computational art rendering systems, we
show how honing theory, intrinsic motivation, and the notion of a 'seed
incident' can be implemented computationally, and demonstrate their impact on
the resulting generative art. Conversely, we discuss how explorations in deep
learn-ing convolutional neural net generative systems can inform our
understanding of human creativity. We conclude with ideas for further
cross-fertilization between AI based computational creativity and psychology of
creativity.

<p>As both our external world and inner worlds become more complex, we are faced
with more novel challenges, hardships, and duress. Creative thinking is needed
to provide fresh perspectives and solve new problems.Because creativity can be
conducive to accessing and reliving traumatic memories, emotional scars may be
exacerbated by creative practices before these are transformed and released.
Therefore, in preparing our youth to thrive in an increasingly unpredictable
world, it could be helpful to cultivate in them an understanding of the
creative process and its relationship to hardship, as well as tools and
techniques for fostering not just creativity but self-awareness and
mindfulness. This chapter is a review of theories of creativity through the
lens of their capacity to account for the relationship between creativity and
hardship, as well as the therapeutic effects of creativity. We also review
theories and research on aspects of mindfulness attending to potential
therapeutic effects of creativity. Drawing upon the creativity and mindfulness
literatures, we sketch out what an introductory 'creativity and mindfulness'
module might look like as part of an educational curriculum designed to address
the unique challenges of the 21st Century.

<p>Immersion in a creative task can be an intimate experience. It can feel like
a mystery: intangible, inexplicable, and beyond the reach of science. However,
science is making exciting headway into understanding creativity. While the
mind of a highly uncreative individual consists of a collection of items
accumulated through direct experience and enculturation, the mind of a creative
individual is self-organizing and self-mending; thus, experiences and items of
cultural knowledge are thought through from different perspectives such that
they cohere together into a loosely integrated whole. The reweaving of items in
memory is elicited by perturbations: experiences that increase psychological
entropy because they are inconsistent with one's web of understandings. The
process of responding to one perturbation often leads to other perturbations,
i.e., other inconsistencies in one's web of understandings. Creative thinking
often requires the capacity to shift between divergent and convergent modes of
thought in response to the ever-changing demands of the creative task. Since
uncreative individuals can reap the benefits of creativity by imitating
creators, using their inventions, or purchasing their artworks, it is not
necessary that everyone be creative. Agent based computer models of cultural
evolution suggest that society functions best with a mixture of creative and
uncreative individuals. The ideal ratio of creativity to imitation increases in
times of change, such as we are experiencing now. Therefore it is important to
educate the next generation in ways that foster creativity. The chapter
concludes with suggestions for how educational systems can cultivate
creativity.

<p>This paper proposes that the distinctively human capacity for cumulative,
adaptive, open-ended cultural evolution came about through two
temporally-distinct cognitive transitions. First, the origin of Homo-specific
culture over two MYA was made possible by the onset of a finer-grained
associative memory that allowed episodes to be encoded in greater detail. This
in turn meant more overlap amongst the distributed representations of these
episodes, such that they could more readily evoke one another through
self-triggered recall (STR). STR enabled representational redescription, the
chaining of thoughts and actions, and the capacity for a stream of thought.
Second, fully cognitive modernity following the appearance of anatomical
modernity after 200,000 BP, was made possible by the onset of contextual focus
(CF): the ability to shift between an explicit convergent mode conducive to
logic and refinement of ideas, and an implicit divergent mode conducive to
free-association, viewing situations from radically new perspectives, concept
combination, analogical thinking, and insight. This paved the way for an
integrated, creative internal network of understandings, and behavioral
modernity. We discuss feasible neural mechanisms for this two-stage proposal,
and outline how STR and CF differ from other proposals. We provide
computational evidence for the proposal obtained with an agent-based model of
cultural evolution in which agents invent ideas for actions and imitate the
fittest of their neighbors' actions. Mean fitness and diversity of actions
across the artificial society increased with STR, and even more so with CF, but
CF was only effective if STR was already in place. CF was most effective
following a change in task, which supports its hypothesized role in escaping
mental fixation. The proposal is discussed in the context of transition theory
in the life sciences.

<p>The ideas that we forge creatively as individuals and groups build on one
another in a manner that is cumulative and adaptive, forming open-ended
lineages across space and time. Thus, human culture is believed to evolve. The
pervasiveness of cross-domain creativity--as when a song inspires a
painting--would appear indicative of discontinuities in cultural lineages.
However, if what evolves through culture is our worldviews--the webs of
thoughts, ideas, and attitudes that constitutes our way of seeing being in the
world--then the problem of discontinuities is solved. The state of a worldview
can be affected by information assimilated in one domain, and this
change-of-state can be expressed in another domain. In this view, the gesture,
narrative, or artifact that constitutes a specific creative act is not what is
evolving; it is merely the external manifestation of the state of an evolving
worldview. Like any evolutionary process, cultural evolution requires a balance
between novelty, via the generation of variation, and continuity, via the
preservation of variants that are adaptive. In cultural evolution, novelty is
generated through creativity, and continuity is provided by social learning
processes, e.g., imitation. Both the generative and imitative aspects of
cultural evolution are affected by social media. We discuss the trajectory from
social ideation to social innovation, focusing on the role of
self-organization, renewal, and perspective-taking at the individual and social
group level.

<p>Although Darwinian models are rampant in the social sciences, social
scientists do not face the problem that motivated Darwin's theory of natural
selection: the problem of explaining how lineages evolve despite that any
traits they acquire are regularly discarded at the end of the lifetime of the
individuals that acquired them. While the rationale for framing culture as an
evolutionary process is correct, it does not follow that culture is a Darwinian
or selectionist process, or that population genetics provides viable starting
points for modeling cultural change. This paper lays out step-by-step arguments
as to why a selectionist approach to cultural evolution is inappropriate,
focusing on the lack of randomness, and lack of a self-assembly code. It
summarizes an alternative evolutionary approach to culture: self-other
reorganization via context-driven actualization of potential.

<p>Convergent thought is defined and measured in terms of the ability to perform
on tasks where there is a single correct solution, and divergent thought is
defined and measured in terms of the ability to generate multiple different
solutions. However, this characterization of them presents inconsistencies, and
despite that they are promoted as key constructs of creativity, they do not
capture the capacity to reiteratively modify an idea in light of new
perspectives arising out of an overarching conceptual framework. Research on
formal models of concepts and their interactions suggests that different
creative outputs may be projections of the same underlying idea at different
phases of this kind of 'honing' process. This leads us to redefine convergent
thought as thought in which the relevant concepts are considered from
conventional contexts, and divergent thought as thought in which they are
considered from unconventional contexts. Implications for the assessment of
creativity are discussed.

<p>This paper proposes an explanation of the cognitive change that occurs as the
creative process proceeds. During the initial, intuitive phase, each thought
activates, and potentially retrieves information from, a large region
containing many memory locations. Because of the distributed,
content-addressable structure of memory, the diverse contents of these many
locations merge to generate the next thought. Novel associations often result.
As one focuses on an idea, the region searched and retrieved from narrows, such
that the next thought is the product of fewer memory locations. This enables a
shift from association-based to causation-based thinking, which facilitates the
fine-tuning and manifestation of the creative work.

<p>Simonton (2006) makes the unwarranted assumption that nonmonotonicity
supports a Darwinian view of creativity. Darwin's theory of natural selection
was motivated by a paradox that has no equivalent in creative thought: the
paradox of how change accumulates when acquired traits are not inherited. To
describe a process of cumulative change in which acquired traits are retained
is outside of the scope of the theory of natural selection. Even the early
evolution of life itself (prior to genetically mediated template replication)
cannot be described by natural selection. Specifically, natural selection
cannot describe change of state that involves horizontal (Lamarckian) exchange,
or occurs through interaction with an incompletely specified context. It cannot
describe change wherein variants are evaluated sequentially, and wherein this
evaluation can itself change the state space and/or fitness function, because
no two variants are ever evaluated according to the same selection criterion.
Concerns are also raised as to the methodology used in Simonton's study.

Prions are lethal pathogens, which cause fatal neurodegenerative diseases in mammals. They are unique infectious agents and are composed of self-propagating multi-chain assemblies of misfolded host-encoded prion protein (PrP). Understanding prion structure is fundamental to understanding prion disease pathogenesis however to date, the high-resolution structure of authentic ex vivo infectious prions remains unknown. Advances in determining prion structure have been severely impeded by the difficulty in recovering relatively homogeneous prion particles from infected brain and definitively associating infectivity with the PrP assembly state. Recently however, images of highly infectious ex vivo PrP rods that produce prion-strain specific disease phenotypes in mice have been obtained using cryo-electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. These images have provided the most detailed description of ex vivo mammalian prions reported to date and have established that prions isolated from multiple strains have a common hierarchical structure. Misfolded PrP is assembled into 20 nm wide rods containing two fibres, each with double helical repeating substructure, separated by a characteristic central gap 8–10 nm in width. Irregularly structured material with adhesive properties distinct to that of the fibres is present within the central gap of the rod. Prions are clearly distinguishable from non-infectious recombinant PrP fibrils generated in vitro and from all other propagating protein structures so far described in other neurodegenerative diseases. The basic architecture of mammalian prions appears to be exceptional and fundamental to their lethal pathogenicity.

Glutamate transporter-1 (GLT-1) is a Na+-dependent transporter that plays a key role in glutamate homeostasis by removing excess glutamate in the central nervous system (CNS).  GLT-1 dysregulation occurs in various neurological diseases including Huntington’s disease (HD), Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and epilepsy.  Downregulation or dysfunction of GLT-1 has been a common finding across these diseases but how this occurs is still under investigation.  This review aims to highlight post-translational regulation of GLT-1 which leads to its downregulation including sumoylation, palmitoylation, nitrosylation, ubiquitination and subcellular localization.  Various therapeutic interventions to restore GLT-1, their proposed mechanism of action and functional effects will be examined as potential treatments to attenuate the neurological symptoms associated with loss or downregulation of GLT-1.

Numerous neurodegenerative diseases including prion, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases are characterized by accumulation of protein aggregates in brain. Prion disease is unique in that the natively folded prion protein forms diverse misfolded aggregates with distinct molecular conformations (strains), which underlie different disease phenotypes. In addition, the conformational strains are able to self-propagate their unique conformations by recruiting normal protein monomers and converting their conformations to misfolded conformers. There is an increasing body of evidence that suggests other aggregation-prone proteins including tau and alpha-synuclein associated with Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases, respectively, also behave like a prion that has conformational strains with self-propagation (seeding) property. Moreover, misfolded protein aggregates can promote misfolding and aggregation of different proteins through cross-seeding, which might be associated with co-occurrence of multiple neurodegenerative diseases in the same patient. Elucidation of diverse conformational strains with self-propagation capability and of molecular basis for the cross-talk between misfolded proteins is essential to the development of effective therapeutic intervention.

Although maladaptive sensory processing has been observed among individuals with persistent heightened anxiety, it is unclear if difficulties processing sensory input early in life lead to anxiety disorders in adulthood and what mechanisms would drive this progression. In a transdiagnostic clinical sample of 231 adults characterized by heightened difficulties with emotion regulation, the present study sought to examine whether (a) childhood sensory processing disorder (SPD) symptoms predict an increased probability of an anxiety disorder diagnosis in adulthood and (b) difficulties with emotion regulation and adult SPD symptoms mediate this relationship. Participants were administered the Structured Clinical Interview for Axis-I disorders and self-reported symptoms of SPD experienced in childhood and adulthood. Results from suggested that childhood SPD symptoms were significantly associated with a higher likelihood of a lifetime anxiety disorder diagnosis. Difficulties with emotion regulation fully mediated the relationship between childhood SPD and (a) any anxiety disorder in adulthood and, specifically (b) current generalized anxiety disorder. Further, we found evidence for a candidate model accounting for the relationship among childhood SPD, adulthood SPD, difficulties with emotion regulation, and anxiety disorders in adulthood. Specifically, our data indicated that high symptoms of SPD in childhood may lead to high SPD symptoms in adulthood, which then lead to high emotion dysregulation, ultimately conferring vulnerability for an anxiety disorder diagnosis. Taken together, these findings provide preliminary evidence for how sensory processing impairments in childhood may relate to anxiety through difficulties regulating emotion regulation.

Objectives: Trigeminal postherpetic neuralgia (TPHN) often presents with moderate to severe pain, hyperalgesia, and allodynia. Conventional analgesic treatments are poorly effective, which seriously affects the quality of life. This retrospective study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) for the treatment of TPHN. 
Methods: A total of 90 TPHN patients were selected between January 2014 and December 2016 in the Department of Pain Management, Shengjing Hospital, China Medical University. Patients were randomly divided into 2 groups according to the order of enrollment (n=45 per group): group A, peripheral nerve (supraorbital nerve, infraorbital nerve and mental nerve) PRF; group B, gasserian ganglion PRF. Follow-up assessments of Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) pain assessment, SF-36 health status questionnaire, total efficiency rate, and drug dosage of anticonvulsants and opioid analgesics were performed at time points of 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year after surgery. 
Results: At each postsurgery time point, the VAS decreased, SF-36 (physical and mental components) increased, and drug dosage of anticonvulsants and opioids analgesics decreased in both treatment groups; values at each time point were significantly different from presurgery values (P&lt;0.05). Compared with group A, VAS decreased, SF-36 increased, and dosage of anticonvulsants and opioids analgesics decreased significantly in group B (P&lt;0.05). The total efficiency rates one year after surgery in group A and group B were 68.9% and 86.7%, respectively. The total efficiency rate of group B was statistically higher than that of group A (P&lt;0.05).
Conclusion: PRF relieved TPHN, and gasserian ganglion PRF was more effective than peripheral nerve PRF. The method was effective and improved the quality of life of the patients. PRF is recommended as a treatment for TPHN.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00703">The Effects of Stimulator, Waveform, and Current Direction on Intracortical Inhibition and Facilitation: A TMS Comparison Study</a></h4>

Background: Cortical function is dependent on the balance between excitatory and inhibitory influences. In the human motor cortex, surrogates of these interactions can be measured in-vivo, non-invasively with double-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). To compare results from data acquired with different available setups and bring data together, it is inevitable to determine whether different TMS setups lead to comparable or differential results.
Objective: We assessed and compared short intracortical inhibition (SICI) and intracortical facilitation (ICF) testing four different experimental conditions.
Methods: SICI and ICF were studied with different stimulators (Magstim BiStim² or MagVenture MagPro X100), waveforms (monophasic or biphasic), current directions (anterior-posterior or posterior-anterior) at interstimulus intervals (ISIs) of 1, 3, 10, 15 ms.
Results: We were not able to detect differences for SICI and ICF, when comparing the tested conditions, except for 3 ms SICI in which the anterior-posterior current direction led to stronger modulation. Correlation analysis suggested comparability for 3 ms SICI for the Magstim monophasic posterior-anterior condition with both tested MagVenture conditions. 
Conclusions: 3 ms SICI data sets obtained with two different, commonly used stimulators (Magstim BiStim² or MagVenture MagPro X100) with conventionally used stimulation parameters are largely comparable.  This may allow the combination of data sets in an open science view.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00699">Fingolimod for Irradiation-Induced Neurodegeneration</a></h4>

Background:
Cranial irradiation is a common therapy for the treatment of brain tumors, but unfortunately patients suffer from side effects, particularly cognitive impairment, caused by neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory mechanisms. Finding a therapeutic agent protecting hippocampal neurons would be beneficial. Fingolimod (FTY720), a sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulator approved for multiple sclerosis, is an immunosuppressant and known to enhance proliferation and differentiation of neuronal precursor cells (NPCs). 
Objectives:
To investigate whether pre-treatment with FTY720 protects NPCs in vitro and in vivo from irradiation-induced damage. 
Methods:
NPCs were isolated from E13 C57BL/6 wildtype mice, treated at day 0 of differentiation with FTY720 and irradiated on day 6 with 1 Gy. NPCs were analyzed for markers of cell death (PI, Caspase 3), proliferation (Ki67), and differentiation (DCX, βIII-tubulin). Adult C57BL/6 wildtype mice were treated with FTY720 (1 mg/kg) and received a single dose of 6 Gy cranial irradiation at day 7. Using immunohistochemistry, we analyzed DCX and BrdU as markers of neurogenesis and Iba1, GFAP, and CD3 to visualize inflammation in the dentate gyrus and the subventricular zone. B6(Cg)-Tyrc-2J/J DCX-luc reporter mice were used for bioluminescence imaging to evaluate the effect of FTY720 on neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus and the spinal cord of naïve mice. 
Results:
FTY720 protected NPCs against irradiation induced cell death in vitro. Treatment with FTY720 dose-dependently reduced the number of PI+ cells 24 and 96 h after irradiation without effecting proliferation or neuronal differentiation. In vivo treatment resulted in a significant survival of DCX+ neurons in the dentate gyrus and the subventricular zone 4 weeks after irradiation as well as a slight increase of proliferating cells. FTY720 inhibited microglia activation 24 h after X-ray exposure in the dentate gyrus, while astrocyte activation was unaffected and no lymphocyte infiltrations were found. In naïve mice, FTY720 treatment for 4 weeks had no effect on neurogenesis. 
Conclusions:
FTY720 treatment of NPCs prior to X-ray exposure and of mice prior to cranial irradiation is neuroprotective. No effects on neurogenesis were found.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00685">Tracking the Main States of Dynamic Functional Connectivity in Resting State</a></h4>

Dynamical changes have been recently tracked in functional connectivity (FC) calculated from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (R-fMRI), when a person is conscious but not carrying out a directed task during scanning. Diverse dynamical FC states (dFC) are believed to represent different internal states of brain, in terms of brain-regional interactions. In this paper, we propose a novel protocol, the signed community clustering with the optimized modularity by two-step procedures, to track dynamical whole brain functional connectivity (dWFC) states. This protocol is assumption free without a priori threshold for the number of clusters. By applying our method on sliding window based dWFC’s with automated anatomical labeling 2 (AAL2), three main dWFC states were extracted from R-fMRI datasets in Human Connectome Project, that are independent on window size. Through extracting the FC features of these states, we found the functional links in state 1 (WFC-C1) mainly involved visual, somatomotor, attention and cerebellar (posterior lobe) modules. State 2 (WFC-C2) was similar to WFC-C1, but more FC’s linking limbic, default mode and frontoparietal modules and less linking the cerebellum, sensory and attention modules. State 3 had more FC’s linking default mode, limbic, and cerebellum, compared to WFC-C1 and WFC-C2. With test of robustness and stability, our work provides a solid, hypothesis-free tool to detect dWFC states for the possibility of tracking rapid dynamical change in FCs among large data set.

Background and Purpose: Cerebral edema and elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) are the leading cause of death in the first week following stroke. Despite this, current treatments are limited and fail to address the underlying mechanisms of swelling, highlighting the need for targeted treatments. When screening promising novel agents, it is essential to use clinically-relevant large animal models to increase the likelihood of successful clinical translation.  As such, we sought to develop a survival model of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) in the sheep and subsequently characterize the temporal profile of cerebral edema and elevated ICP following stroke in this novel, clinically-relevant model. 

Methods: Merino-sheep (27M;31F) were anesthetized and subject to 2 hours tMCAO with reperfusion or sham surgery. Following surgery, animals were allowed to recover and returned to their home pens. At preselected times points ranging from 1 to 7 days post-stroke, animals were re-anesthetized, ICP measured for 4 hours, followed by imaging with MRI to determine cerebral edema, midline shift and infarct volume (T2, FLAIR, DWI). Animals were subsequently euthanized and their brain removed for immunohistochemical analysis. Serum and cerebrospinal fluid samples were also collected and analyzed for substance P (SP) using ELISA.

Results: ICP and MRI scans were normal in sham animals. Following stroke, ICP rose gradually over time and by 5 days was significantly (p&lt;0.0001) elevated above sham levels. Profound cerebral edema was observed as early as 2 days post-stroke and continued to evolve out to 6 days, resulting in significant midline shift which was most prominent at 5 days post-stroke (p&lt;0.01), in keeping with increasing ICP. Serum SP levels were significantly elevated (p&lt;0.01) by 7 days post tMCAO.

Conclusion: We have successfully developed a survival model of ovine tMCAO and characterized the temporal profile of ICP. Peak ICP elevation, cerebral edema and midline shift occurred at day 5-6 following stroke, accompanied by an elevation in serum SP. Our findings suggest that novel therapeutic agents screened in this model targeting cerebral edema and elevated ICP would most likely be effective when administered prior to 5 days, or as early as possible following stroke onset.

Oxytocin is known to play an important role in trust, whereas the involvement of other peptide hormones has not been evaluated. In this study, we focused on microsatellite polymorphisms in the intron of the arginine-vasopressin receptor 1a (AVPR1a) gene and examined whether the association between the repeat lengths in the intron of AVPR1a is associated with trust and reciprocity in humans. Four hundred and thirty-three participants played the trust game, answered the attitudinal trust question, and their buccal cells were collected. Results showed that men with a short form of AVPR1a tend to send more money to the opponent, even if there is a possibility of being betrayed by the opponent. Additionally, people with a short form of AVPR1a tended to return money to the opponent who trusts them. However, attitudinal trust was not associated with AVPR1a. These results indicate that arginine-vasopressin receptor 1a plays an important role in trust and reciprocal behaviors.

Identifying neurocognitive mechanisms underlying optimism bias is essential to understand its benefits for well-being and mental health. The combined cognitive biases hypothesis suggests that biases (e.g., in expectancies and attention) interact and mutually enforce each other. Whereas, in line with this hypothesis, optimistic expectancies have been shown to guide attention to positive information, reverse causal effects have not been investigated yet. Revealing such bidirectional optimism-attention interactions both on a behavioral and neural level could explain how cognitive biases contribute to a self-sustaining upward spiral of positivity. In this behavioral study, we hypothesized that extensive training to direct attention to positive information enhances optimism bias. To test this hypothesis, for two weeks 149 participants underwent a daily on-line 80-trial attention bias modification training (ABMT) to accepting and away from rejecting faces or a neutral control training. Participants in the ABMT group were instructed to click as quickly as possible on the accepting face among 15 rejecting faces randomly displayed on a 4-by-4 matrix; participants in the control group were instructed to click on the five-petaled flower depicted among 15 seven-petaled flowers. Comparative optimism bias and state optimism were measured via questionnaires before, after one, and after two training weeks. ABMT enhanced comparative optimism bias, whereas control training did not. Our findings reveal that ABMT to positive social information causally influences comparative optimism bias and may, thereby, trigger the biases’ benefits for well-being and mental health. These results can (a) stimulate future neurophysiological research in the area of positive psychology and (b) reveal an innovative low-cost and easy-to-access intervention that may support psychotherapy in times of rising numbers of patients with psychological disorders.

Brain training is a large and expanding industry, and yet there is a recurrent and ongoing debate concerning its scientific basis or evidence for efficacy. Much of evidence for the efficacy of brain training within this debate is from small-scale studies that do not assess the type of ‘brain training’, the specificity of transfer effects, or the length of training required to achieve a generalised effect. To explore these factors, we analyse cross-sectional data from two large Internet-cohort studies (total N=60,222) to determine whether cognition differs at the population level for individuals who report that they brain train on different devices, and across different timeframes, with programmes in common use circa 2010-2013. Examining scores for an assessment of working-memory, reasoning and verbal abilities shows no cognitive advantages for individuals who brain train. This contrasts unfavourably with significant advantages for individuals who regularly undertake other cognitive pursuits such as computer, board and card games. However, finer grained analyses reveal a more complex relationship between brain training and cognitive performance. Specifically, individuals who have just begun to brain train start from a low cognitive baseline compared to individuals who have never engaged in brain training, whereas those who have trained for a year or more have higher working-memory and verbal scores compared to those who have just started, thus suggesting an efficacy for brain training over an extended period of time. The advantages in global function, working memory, and verbal memory after several months of training are plausible and of clinically relevant scale. However, this relationship is not evident for reasoning performance or self-report measures of everyday function (e.g., employment status and problems with attention). These results accord with the view that although brain training programs can produce benefits, these might extend to tasks that are operationally similar to the training regime. Furthermore, the duration of training regime required for effective enhancement of cognitive performance is longer than that applied in most previous studies.

Studying and understanding human brain structures and functions have become one of the most challenging issues in neuroscience today. However, the mammalian nervous system is made up of hundreds of millions of neurons and billions of synapses.
This complexity made it impossible to reconstruct such a huge nervous system in the laboratory. So, most researchers focus on C.elegans neural network. The C.elegans neural network is the only biological neural network that is fully mapped. This nervous system is the simplest neural network that exists. However, many fundamental behaviors like movement emerge from this basic network. These features made C.elegans a convenient case to study the nervous systems. Many studies try to propose a network formation model for C.elegans neural network. However, these studies could not meet all characteristics of C.elegans neural network such as significant factors that play a role in the formation of C.elegans neural network. Thus, new models are needed to be proposed in order to explain all aspects of C.elegans neural network.

In this paper, a new model based on game theory is proposed in order to understand the factors affecting the formation of nervous systems, which meet the C.elegans frontal neural network characteristics. In this model, neurons are considered to be agents. The strategy for each neuron includes either making or removing links to other neurons.
 After choosing the basic network, the utility function is built using structural and functional factors. In order to find the coefficients for each of these factors, linear programming is used. Finally, the output network is compared with C.elegans frontal neural network and previous models. The results implicate that the game-theoretical model proposed in this paper can better predict the influencing factors in the formation of C.elegans neural network compared to previous models.

Malformations of the human neocortex in development constitute a heterogeneous group of complex disorders, resulting in pathologies such as intellectual disability and abnormal neurological/psychiatric conditions such as epilepsy or autism. Advances in genomic sequencing and genetic techniques have allowed major breakthroughs in the field, revealing the molecular basis of several of these malformations. Here, we focus on those malformations of the human neocortex, notably microcephaly and macrocephaly, where an underlying basis has been established at the level of the neural stem/progenitor cells (NPCs) from which neurons are directly or indirectly derived. Particular emphasis is placed on NPC cell biology and NPC markers. A second focus of this review is on experimental model systems used to dissect the underlying mechanisms of malformations of the human neocortex in development at the cellular and molecular level. The most commonly used model system have been genetically modified mice. However, although basic features of neocortical development are conserved across the various mammalian species, some important differences between mouse and human exist. These pertain to the abundance of specific NPC types and/or their proliferative capacity, as exemplified in the case of basal radial glia. These differences limit the ability of mouse models to fully recapitulate the phenotypes of malformations of the human neocortex. For this reason, additional experimental model systems, notably the ferret, non-human primates and cerebral organoids, have recently emerged as alternatives and shown to be of increasing relevance. It is therefore important to consider the benefits and limitations of each of these model systems for studying malformations of the human neocortex in development.

Schwann cells (SCs) de-differentiate in Wallerian degeneration (WD) following nerve injury and, by doing so, can actively promote nerve repair and functional recovery. An innate-immune response is an important component of the complex of events referred to as WD. Damaged PNS SCs produce IL-1β and other inflammatory cytokines. We hypothesized that, in addition to a role in immune responses, IL-1β participates in de-differentiation and proliferation of SCs. 
qPCR and ELISA demonstrated that expression of Il-1β mRNAs and protein increased after nerve injury. Immunofluorescent staining and western blotting demonstrated that expression of the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) was significantly increased and levels of myelin protein zero (MPZ) were significantly decreased after IL-1β exposure compared with control groups in vitro WD. Additionally, qPCR demonstrated that IL-1β elevated expression of the de-differentiation gene p75NTR and decreased expression of myelination locus MPZ and promoted SCs de-differentiation. Furthermore, immunofluorescent staining, western blotting, qPCR and ELISA revealed that IL-1β promoted c-JUN expression and activation of AP-1 activity of SCs in an in vitro WD model. Finally, Immunofluorescent staining illustrated that IL-1β elevated expression of Ki67 in Schwann cells nuclei, the apoptosis of Schwann cells were detected by TUNEL. SCs of WD produce IL-1β which promotes SCs de-differentiation and proliferation.

The definition of consciousness remains a difficult issue that requires urgent understanding and resolution. Currently, consciousness research is an intensely focused area of neuroscience. However, to establish a greater understanding of the concept of consciousness, more detailed, intrinsic neurobiological research is needed. Additionally, an accurate assessment of the level of consciousness may strengthen our awareness of this concept and provide new ideas for patients undergoing clinical treatment of consciousness disorders. In addition, research efforts that help elucidate the concept of consciousness have important scientific and clinical significance. This review presents the latest progress in consciousness research and proposes our assumptions with regard to the network of consciousness.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00300">Local Drug Delivery for Prevention of Hearing Loss</a></h4>

Systemic delivery of therapeutics for targeting the cochlea to prevent or treat hearing loss is challenging. Systemic drugs have to cross the blood-labyrinth barrier (BLB).  BLB can significantly prevent effective penetration of drugs in appropriate concentrations to protect against hearing loss caused by inflammation, ototoxic drugs or acoustic trauma. This obstacle may be obviated by local administration of protective agents. This route can deliver higher concentration of drug compared to systemic application and preclude systemic side effects. Protective agents have been administered by intra-tympanic injection in numerous preclinical studies. Drugs such as steroids, etanercept, D and L-methionine, pifithrin-alpha, adenosine agonists, melatonin, kenpaullone (a cyclin-dependent kinase 2 inhibitor) have been reported to show efficacy against cisplatin ototoxicity in animal models. Several siRNAs have been shown to ameliorate cisplatin ototoxicity when administered by intra-tympanic injection. The application of corticosteroids and a number of other drugs with adjuvants appears to enhance efficacy. Administration of siRNAs to knock down AMPK kinase, liver kinase B1 (LKB1) or G9a in the cochlea have been found to ameliorate noise-induced hearing loss. The local administration of these compounds appears to be effective in protecting the cochlea against damage from cisplatin or noise trauma.  Furthermore the intra-tympanic route yields maximum protection in the basal turn of the cochlea which is most vulnerable to drug ototoxicity and noise trauma. There appears to be very little transfer of these agents to the systemic circulation.  This would avoid potential side effects including interference with anti-tumor efficacy of cisplatin. Nanotechnology offers strategies to effectively deliver protective agents to the cochlea. This review summarizes the pharmacology of local drug delivery by intra-tympanic injection to prevent hearing loss caused by cisplatin and noise exposure in animals. Future refinements in local protective agents provide exciting prospects for amelioration of hearing loss resulting from cisplatin or noise exposure.

Background：Exogenous insulin like growth factor-1 (IGF-I) is known to be neuroprotective in animal models with brain insults, while it can also cause hyperexcitability in rodents. In this regard, the role of endogenous IGF-1 in brain responses to brain insults like excitotoxicity, a common pathology in brain injuries remains to be elucidated. Here, we investigated the potential role of cell-specific endogenous IGF-I in the kainic acid (KA) -induced degeneration of the neurons. 
Methods: KA was given to primary cultured cortical neurons and co-cultured astrocytes were added as a supportive system. We evaluated the cell proliferation rate, IGF-1 level in different groups and applied the PCR-Chip assay to explore the downstream of IGF-1. In addition, we applied the viral transfer of astrocytic IGF-1 to rodents treated with KA and assessed the associated molecular marker and behavioural outcomes in these rodents.
Results: We found KA induced increased cell death and hyperphosphorylated tau in neurons; co-cultured astrocytes could prevent these pathologies, and this rescuing effect was abrogated with blockade of the astrocytic IGF-1 with AG1024 (IGF-1R inhibitor). PCR-Chip assay identified that astrocytic IGF-1 could decrease the p-GSK-3 at Tyr 216 in neurons treated with KA and this effect was abrogated with AG1024 as well. In addition, in-vivo study showed that gene transfer of astrocytic IGF-1 decreased p-tau and cognitive dysfunction in KA mice. 
Conclusion: Our results show astrocytic IGF-1 exhibit neuroprotective properties in neurodegenerative processes in the CNS.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00296">Distinct Conformations, Aggregation and Cellular Internalization of Different Tau Strains</a></h4>

The inter-cellular propagation of tau aggregates in several neurodegenerative diseases involves, in part, recurring cycles of extracellular tau uptake, initiation of endogenous tau aggregation, and extracellular release of at least part of this protein complex. However, human brain tau extracts from diverse tauopathies exhibit variant or “strain” specificity in inducing inter-cellular propagation in both cell and animal models. It is unclear if these distinctive properties are affected by disease-specific differences in aggregated tau conformation and structure. We have used a combined structural and cell biological approach to study if two frontotemporal dementia (FTD)-associated pathologic mutations, V337M and N279K, affect the aggregation, conformation and cellular internalization of the tau four-repeat domain (K18) fragment. In both heparin-induced and native-state aggregation experiments, each FTD variant formed soluble and fibrillar aggregates with remarkable morphological and immunological distinctions from the wild type (WT) aggregates. Exogenously-applied oligomers of the FTD tau-K18 variants (V337M and N279K) were significantly more efficiently taken up by SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells than WT tau-K18, suggesting mutation-induced changes in cellular internalization. However, shared internalization mechanisms were observed: endocytosed oligomers were distributed in the cytoplasm and nucleus of SH-SY5Y cells and the neurites and soma of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons where they co-localized with endogenous tau and the nuclear protein nucleolin. Altogether, evidence of conformational and aggregation differences between WT and disease-mutated tau K18 is demonstrated, which may explain their distinct cellular internalization potencies. These findings may account for critical aspects of the molecular pathogenesis of tauopathies involving WT and mutated tau.

Hibernation is a natural phenomenon in many species which helps them to survive under extreme ambient conditions, such as cold temperatures and reduced availability of food in the winter months. It is characterized by a dramatic and regulated drop of body temperature, which in some cases can be near 0°C. Additionally, neural control of hibernation is maintained over all phases of a hibernation bout, including entrance into, during and arousal from torpor, despite a marked decrease in overall neural activity in torpor. In the present review we provide an overview on what we know about neuronal activity in the hibernating brain focusing on cold-induced adaptations. We discuss pioneer and more recent in vitro and in vivo electrophysiological data and molecular analyses of activity markers which strikingly contributed to our understanding of the brain’s sensitivity to dramatic changes in temperature across the hibernation cycle. Neuronal activity is markedly reduced with decreasing body temperature, and many neurons may fire infrequently in torpor at low brain temperatures. Still, there is convincing evidence that specific regions maintain their ability to generate action potentials in deep torpor, at least in response to adequate stimuli. Those regions include the peripheral system and primary central regions. However, further experiments on neuronal activity are needed to more precisely determine temperature effects on neuronal activity in specific cell types and specific brain nuclei.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/47047">Response to comment on 'Naked mole-rat mortality rates defy Gompertzian laws by not increasing with age'</a></h4>

For most adult mammals, the risk of death increases exponentially with age, an observation originally described for humans by Benjamin Gompertz. We recently performed a Kaplan–Meier survival analysis of naked mole-rats (<i>Heterocephalus glaber</i>) and concluded that their risk of death remains constant as they grow older (Ruby et al., 2018). Dammann et al. suggest incomplete historical records potentially confounded our demographic analysis (Dammann et al., 2019). In response, we applied the left-censorship technique of Kaplan and Meier to exclude all data from the historical era in which they speculate the records to be confounded. Our new analysis produced indistinguishable results from what we had previously published, and thus strongly reinforced our original conclusions.

The medaka is a fish that has served as a model organism for over a century, yet there is still much to learn about its life in the wild. Here we summarize the current knowledge, highlight recent progress and outline remaining gaps in our understanding of the natural history of medaka. It has also become clear over time that rather than being a single species, medaka comprises an entire species complex, so disentangling the species boundaries is an important goal for future research. Moreover, medaka and other ricefishes exhibit striking functional diversity, little of which has been investigated to date. As such, there are opportunities to use the resources developed for medaka to study other ricefishes, and to learn more about medaka itself in an evolutionary context.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/46793">Genetic interactions of G-quadruplexes in humans</a></h4>

G-quadruplexes (G4) are alternative nucleic acid structures involved in transcription, translation and replication. Aberrant G4 formation and stabilisation is linked to genome instability and cancer. G4 ligand treatment disrupts key biological processes leading to cell death. To discover genes and pathways involved with G4s and gain mechanistic insights into G4 biology, we present the first unbiased genome-wide study to systematically identify human genes that promote cell death when silenced by shRNA in the presence of G4-stabilising small molecules. Many novel genetic vulnerabilities were revealed opening up new therapeutic possibilities in cancer, which we exemplified by an orthogonal pharmacological inhibition approach that phenocopies gene silencing. We find that targeting the WEE1 cell cycle kinase or USP1 deubiquitinase in combination with G4 ligand treatment enhances cell killing. We also identify new genes and pathways regulating or interacting with G4s and demonstrate that the DDX42 DEAD-box helicase is a newly discovered G4-binding protein.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/46767">KHNYN is essential for the zinc finger antiviral protein (ZAP) to restrict HIV-1 containing clustered CpG dinucleotides</a></h4>

CpG dinucleotides are suppressed in most vertebrate RNA viruses, including HIV-1, and introducing CpGs into RNA virus genomes inhibits their replication. The zinc finger antiviral protein (ZAP) binds regions of viral RNA containing CpGs and targets them for degradation. ZAP does not have enzymatic activity and recruits other cellular proteins to inhibit viral replication. We found that KHNYN, a protein with no previously known function, interacts with ZAP. KHNYN overexpression selectively inhibits HIV-1 containing clustered CpG dinucleotides and this requires ZAP and its cofactor TRIM25. KHNYN requires both its KH-like domain and NYN endonuclease domain for antiviral activity. Crucially, depletion of KHNYN eliminated the deleterious effect of CpG dinucleotides on HIV-1 RNA abundance and infectious virus production and also enhanced the production of murine leukemia virus. Overall, we have identified KHNYN as a novel cofactor for ZAP to target CpG-containing retroviral RNA for degradation.

Neurodevelopmental disorders, including those involving intellectual disability, are characterized by abnormalities in formation and functions of synaptic circuits. Traditionally, research on synaptogenesis and synaptic transmission in health and disease focused on neurons, however, a growing number of studies have highlighted the role of astrocytes in this context. Tight structural and functional interactions of astrocytes and synapses indeed play important roles in brain functions, and the repertoire of astroglial regulations of synaptic circuits is large and complex.

<p>by Elyse H. Norton, Luigi Acerbi, Wei Ji Ma, Michael S. Landy</p>

Optimal sensory decision-making requires the combination of uncertain sensory signals with prior expectations. The effect of prior probability is often described as a shift in the decision criterion. Can observers track sudden changes in probability? To answer this question, we used a change-point detection paradigm that is frequently used to examine behavior in changing environments. In a pair of orientation-categorization tasks, we investigated the effects of changing probabilities on decision-making. In both tasks, category probability was updated using a sample-and-hold procedure: probability was held constant for a period of time before jumping to another probability state that was randomly selected from a predetermined set of probability states. We developed an ideal Bayesian change-point detection model in which the observer marginalizes over both the current run length (i.e., time since last change) and the current category probability. We compared this model to various alternative models that correspond to different strategies—from approximately Bayesian to simple heuristics—that the observers may have adopted to update their beliefs about probabilities. While a number of models provided decent fits to the data, model comparison favored a model in which probability is estimated following an exponential averaging model with a bias towards equal priors, consistent with a conservative bias and a flexible variant of the Bayesian change-point detection model with incorrect beliefs. We interpret the former as a simpler, more biologically plausible explanation suggesting that the mechanism underlying change of decision criterion is a combination of on-line estimation of prior probability and a stable, long-term equal-probability prior, thus operating at two very different timescales.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/It-Ebd4v1rU" width="1" />

Abstract<p>Navigating through natural environments requires localizing objects along three distinct spatial axes. Information about position along the horizontal and vertical axes is available from an object’s position on the retina, while position along the depth axis must be inferred based on second-order cues such as the disparity between the images cast on the two retinae. Past work has revealed that object position in 2D retinotopic space is robustly represented in visual cortex, and can be robustly predicted using a multivariate encoding model, in which an explicit axis is modeled for each spatial dimension. However, no study to date has used an encoding model to estimate a representation of stimulus position in depth. Here, we recorded BOLD fMRI while human subjects viewed a stereoscopic random-dot sphere at various positions along the depth (Z) and the horizontal (X) axes, and the stimuli were presented across a wider range of disparities (out to ~40 arcmin) compared to previous neuroimaging studies. In addition to performing decoding analyses for comparison to previous work, we built encoding models for depth position and for horizontal position, allowing us to directly compare encoding between these dimensions. Our results validate this method of recovering depth representations from retinotopic cortex. Furthermore, we find convergent evidence that depth is encoded most strongly in dorsal area V3A.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Estimating the position of objects in depth is essential for human behaviors such as reaching and navigating in a 3D environment. Single neurons in visual cortex appear to support these abilities by encoding the depth position of stimuli, however, only a few studies have investigated how depth information is encoded by population-level representations in the human brain. Here, we collected fMRI data and used two multivariate analysis methods to examine the accuracy of depth encoding in retinotopic visual cortex. Our results show that depth representations are widespread in retinotopic cortex, with most accurate and robust encoding in intermediate dorsal region V3A. These findings are in agreement with past work, and may inform future studies of human 3D spatial perception.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The aim of the study was to report 12‐month changes after treatment with nusinersen in a cohort of 85 type I spinal muscular atrophy patients of ages ranging from 2 months to 15 years and 11 months.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>All patients were assessed using the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Infant Test of Neuromuscular Disorders (CHOP INTEND) and the Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination‐Section 2 (HINE‐2).</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Two of the 85 patients had 1 <i>SMN2</i> copy, 61 had 2 copies, and 18 had 3 copies. In 4 patients the <i>SMN2</i> copy number was not available. At baseline, the mean CHOP INTEND scores ranged between 0 and 52 (mean = 15.66, standard deviation [SD] = ±13.48), and the mean HINE‐2 score was between 0 and 5 (mean = 0.69, SD = ±1.23). There was a difference between baseline and the 12‐month scores on both the CHOP INTEND and the HINE‐2 for the whole group (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), the subgroups with 2 <i>SMN2</i> copies (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), and those with 3 <i>SMN2</i> copies (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). The difference was found not only in patients younger than 210 days at baseline (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) but also in those younger than 5 years on the CHOP INTEND and younger than 2 years on the HINE‐2.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results, expanding the age range and the severity of type I patients treated with nusinersen over 1 year, provide additional data on the range of efficacy of the drug that will be helpful in making an informed decision on whether to start treatment in patients of different ages and severity.

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The substantial clinical improvement in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients treated with mechanical thrombectomy (MT), combined with the poor response of proximal intracranial occlusions to intravenous thrombolysis (IVT), led to questions regarding the utility of bridging therapy (BT;IVT followed by MT), compared to direct mechanical thrombectomy (dMT) for AIS patients with large vessel occlusions (LVO).</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We aimed to investigate the comparative safety and efficacy of BT and dMT in AIS patients. We included all observational studies and post‐hoc analyses from RCTs that provided data on the outcomes of AIS patients with LVO stratified by the IVT treatment status prior to MT.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified 38 eligible observational studies (11,798 LVO patients, mean age 68 years, 56% treated with BT). In unadjusted analyses BT was associated with a higher likelihood of three‐month functional independence (OR=1.52,95%CI:1.32‐1.76), three‐month functional improvement (cOR for 1‐point decrease in mRS‐score=1.52,95%CI:1.18‐1.97), early neurological improvement (OR=1.21,95%CI:1.83‐1.76), successful recanalization (OR=1.22,95%CI:1.02‐1.46) and successful recanalization with less than two device passes (OR=2.28,95%CI:1.43‐3.64) compared to dMT. BT was also related to a lower likelihood of three‐month mortality (OR=0.64, 95%CI: 0.57‐0.73). In the adjusted analyses, BT was independently associated with a higher likelihood of three‐month functional independence (adjusted OR=1.55, 95%CI:1.26‐1.91) and a lower odds of three‐month mortality (adjusted OR=0.80,95%CI:0.66‐0.97) compared to dMT. The two groups did not differ in functional improvement (adjusted cOR=1.24,95%CI:0.89‐1.74) or symptomatic ICH (adjusted OR=0.87,95%CI:0.61‐1.25).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>BT appears to be associated with improved functional independence without evidence for safety concerns, compared to dMT, for AIS patients with LVO.</p>

Homozygous and heterozygous mutations in GBA1, the gene implicated in Gaucher disease, increase the risk and severity of Parkinson disease (PD). We evaluated the design, phenotype, strengths, and limitations of current GBA1-associated PD mouse models. Although faithful modeling of a genetic risk factor poses many challenges, the different approaches taken were successful in revealing predisposing abnormalities in heterozygotes for GBA1 mutations and demonstrating the deleterious effects of GBA1 impairment on the PD course in PD models.

<p>by Peter Vincent, Thomas Parr, David Benrimoh, Karl J Friston</p>

Living creatures must accurately infer the nature of their environments. They do this despite being confronted by stochastic and context sensitive contingencies—and so must constantly update their beliefs regarding their uncertainty about what might come next. In this work, we examine how we deal with uncertainty that evolves over time. This prospective uncertainty (or imprecision) is referred to as volatility and has previously been linked to noradrenergic signals that originate in the locus coeruleus. Using pupillary dilatation as a measure of central noradrenergic signalling, we tested the hypothesis that changes in pupil diameter reflect inferences humans make about environmental volatility. To do so, we collected pupillometry data from participants presented with a stream of numbers. We generated these numbers from a process with varying degrees of volatility. By measuring pupillary dilatation in response to these stimuli—and simulating the inferences made by an ideal Bayesian observer of the same stimuli—we demonstrate that humans update their beliefs about environmental contingencies in a Bayes optimal way. We show this by comparing general linear (convolution) models that formalised competing hypotheses about the causes of pupillary changes. We found greater evidence for models that included Bayes optimal estimates of volatility than those without. We additionally explore the interaction between different causes of pupil dilation and suggest a quantitative approach to characterising a person’s prior beliefs about volatility.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/igJm9qjK6Ho" width="1" />

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/CjIns0WTCck/article">Systematic discovery of the functional impact of somatic genome alterations in individual tumors through tumor-specific causal inference</a></h4>

Cancer is mainly caused by somatic genome alterations (SGAs). Precision oncology involves identifying and targeting tumor-specific aberrations resulting from causative SGAs. We developed a novel tumor-specific computational framework that finds the likely causative SGAs in an individual tumor and estimates their impact on oncogenic processes, which suggests the disease mechanisms that are acting in that tumor. This information can be used to guide precision oncology. We report a tumor-specific causal inference (TCI) framework, which estimates causative SGAs by modeling causal relationships between SGAs and molecular phenotypes (e.g., transcriptomic, proteomic, or metabolomic changes) within an individual tumor. We applied the TCI algorithm to tumors from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and estimated for each tumor the SGAs that causally regulate the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in that tumor. Overall, TCI identified 634 SGAs that are predicted to cause cancer-related DEGs in a significant number of tumors, including most of the previously known drivers and many novel candidate cancer drivers. The inferred causal relationships are statistically robust and biologically sensible, and multiple lines of experimental evidence support the predicted functional impact of both the well-known and the novel candidate drivers that are predicted by TCI. TCI provides a unified framework that integrates multiple types of SGAs and molecular phenotypes to estimate which genome perturbations are causally influencing one or more molecular/cellular phenotypes in an individual tumor. By identifying major candidate drivers and revealing their functional impact in an individual tumor, TCI sheds light on the disease mechanisms of that tumor, which can serve to advance our basic knowledge of cancer biology and to support precision oncology that provides tailored treatment of individual tumors.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/CjIns0WTCck" width="1" />

<p>by Juan J. Cáceres, Alberto Paccanaro</p>

Network medicine approaches have been largely successful at increasing our knowledge of molecularly characterized diseases. Given a set of disease genes associated with a disease, neighbourhood-based methods and random walkers exploit the interactome allowing the prediction of further genes for that disease. In general, however, diseases with no known molecular basis constitute a challenge. Here we present a novel network approach to prioritize gene-disease associations that is able to also predict genes for diseases with no known molecular basis. Our method, which we have called Cardigan (ChARting DIsease Gene AssociatioNs), uses semi-supervised learning and exploits a measure of similarity between disease phenotypes. We evaluated its performance at predicting genes for both molecularly characterized and uncharacterized diseases in OMIM, using both weighted and binary interactomes, and compared it with state-of-the-art methods. Our tests, which use datasets collected at different points in time to replicate the dynamics of the disease gene discovery process, prove that Cardigan is able to accurately predict disease genes for molecularly uncharacterized diseases. Additionally, standard leave-one-out cross validation tests show how our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods at predicting genes for molecularly characterized diseases by 14%-65%. Cardigan can also be used for disease module prediction, where it outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 87%-299%.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/8WzpOXWlG88" width="1" />

<p>by Jane Loveless, Konstantinos Lagogiannis, Barbara Webb</p>

The <i>Drosophila</i> larva executes a stereotypical exploratory routine that appears to consist of stochastic alternation between straight peristaltic crawling and reorientation events through lateral bending. We present a model of larval mechanics for axial and transverse motion over a planar substrate, and use it to develop a simple, reflexive neuromuscular model from physical principles. The mechanical model represents the midline of the larva as a set of point masses which interact with each other via damped translational and torsional springs, and with the environment via sliding friction forces. The neuromuscular model consists of: 1. segmentally localised reflexes that amplify axial compression in order to counteract frictive energy losses, and 2. long-range mutual inhibition between reflexes in distant segments, enabling overall motion of the model larva relative to its substrate. In the absence of damping and driving, the mechanical model produces axial travelling waves, lateral oscillations, and unpredictable, chaotic deformations. The neuromuscular model counteracts friction to recover these motion patterns, giving rise to forward and backward peristalsis in addition to turning. Our model produces spontaneous exploration, even though the nervous system has no intrinsic pattern generating or decision making ability, and neither senses nor drives bending motions. Ultimately, our model suggests a novel view of larval exploration as a deterministic superdiffusion process which is mechanistically grounded in the chaotic mechanics of the body. We discuss how this may provide new interpretations for existing observations at the level of tissue-scale activity patterns and neural circuitry, and provide some experimental predictions that would test the extent to which the mechanisms we present translate to the real larva.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/JJidlxXe2c4" width="1" />

Electrocommunication and -localization behaviors of weakly electric fish have been studied extensively in the lab, mostly by means of short-term observations on constrained fish. Far less is known about their behaviors in more natural-like settings, where fish are less constrained in space and time. We tracked individual fish in a population of fourteen brown ghost knifefish (Apteronotus leptorhynchus) housed in a large 2  indoor tank based on their electric organ discharges (EOD). The tank contained four different natural-like microhabitats (gravel, plants, isolated stones, stacked stones). In particular during the day individual fish showed preferences for specific habitat which provided appropriate shelter. Male fish with higher EOD frequencies spent more time in their preferred habitat during the day, moved more often between habitats during the night, and less often during the day in comparison to low-frequency males. Our data thus revealed a link between dominance indicated by higher EOD frequency, territoriality, and a more explorative personality in male A. leptorhynchus. In females, movement activity during both day and night correlated positively with EOD frequency. In the night, fish of either sex moved to another habitat after about 6 seconds on average. During the day, the average transition time was also very short at about 20 seconds. However, these activity phases were interrupted by phases of inactivity that lasted on average about 20 minutes during the day, but only 3 minutes in the night. The individual preference for daytime retreat sites did not reflect the frequent explorative movements at night.

Accumulation of misfolded proteins results in cellular stress, and is detected by specific sensors in the endoplasmic reticulum, collectively known as the unfolded protein response (UPR). It has been prominently proposed that the UPR is involved in the pathophysiology of Parkinson’s disease (PD). In the present study, the levels of the UPR proteins and mRNA transcripts were quantified in post mortem brain tissue from PD patients and matched controls. The level of a key mediator of the UPR pathway, glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), was significantly decreased in temporal cortex and cingulate gyrus, whereas there were no significant changes in the caudate nucleus, prefrontal or parietal cortex regions. On the other hand, GRP78 mRNA level was significantly increased in caudate nucleus, cingulate gyrus, prefrontal, and parietal cortex regions. GRP78 protein level was also measured in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid, but there were no differences in these levels between PD patients and control subjects.  Furthermore, immunofluorescence labelling of the CD4+ T cells from PD patients showed that GRP78 protein is found in the cytoplasm. However, GRP78 level in PD patients was not significantly different from control subjects. Unlike the previous Lewy body dementia study, the present investigation reports reduced cortical protein, but increased transcript levels of GPR78 in PD. In summary, these data provide further evidence that GRP78 regulation is dysfunctional in the brains of PD patients.

The development of implantable neuroelectrodes is advancing rapidly as these tools are becoming increasingly ubiquitous in clinical practice, especially for the treatment of traumatic and neurodegenerative disorders. Electrodes have been exploited in a wide number of neural interface devices, such as deep brain stimulation, which is one of the most successful therapies with proven efficacy in the treatment of diseases like Parkinson or epilepsy. However, one of the main caveats related to the clinical application of electrodes is the nervous tissue response at the injury site, characterized by a cascade of inflammatory events, which culminate in chronic inflammation, and, in turn, result in the failure of the implant over extended periods of time. To overcome current limitations of the most widespread macroelectrode based systems, new design strategies and the development of innovative materials with superior biocompatibility characteristics are currently being investigated. 
This review describes the current state of the art of in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo models available for the study of neural tissue response to implantable microelectrodes. We particularly highlight new models with increased complexity that closely mimic in vivo scenarios and that can serve as promising alternatives to animal studies for investigation of microelectrodes in neural tissues. Additionally, we also express our view on the impact of the progress in the field of neural tissue engineering on neural implant research.

Background and Purpose: The morbidity and early mortality associated with stroke is largely attributable to cerebral edema and elevated intracranial pressure (ICP). Existing pharmacotherapies do not target the underlying pathophysiology and are often ineffective in sustainably lowering ICP whilst decompressive craniectomy (DC) surgery is life-saving yet with surgical/peri-operative risk and increased morbidity in the elderly. Accordingly, there is an urgent need for therapies that directly target the mechanisms of edema genesis. Neurogenic inflammation, mediated by substance P (SP) binding to the tachykinin NK1 receptor (NK1-r), is associated with blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, cerebral edema and poor outcome post-stroke. NK1-r antagonist treatment ameliorates BBB dysfunction and cerebral edema in rodent stroke models. However, treatment has not been investigated in a large animal model, an important step towards clinical translation. Consequently, the current study compared the efficacy of NK1-r antagonist treatment to DC surgery in reducing ICP post-stroke in a clinically-relevant ovine model. 

Methods: Anaesthetized female Merino sheep (65±6 kg, 18-24 months) underwent sham surgery (n=4) or permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (n=22). Stroke animals were randomized into one of 5 treatments: 1xNK1 bolus (4h), 2xNK1 bolus (4h;9h), 3xNK1 bolus (4h;9h;14h), DC surgery (performed at 4h) or saline vehicle. ICP, blood pressure and blood gases were monitored for 24h post-stroke. At 24h post-stroke anaesthetized animals underwent MRI, followed by perfusion and brains removed and processed for histological assessment. 

Results: 2xNK1, 3xNK1 administration or DC surgery significantly (p&lt;0.05) reduced ICP compared to vehicle. 1xNK1 was ineffective in sustainably lowering ICP. On MRI, midline shift and cerebral edema were more marked in vehicles compared to NK1-r treatment groups. 

Conclusion: Two or 3 boluses of NK1-r antagonist reduced ICP comparable to DC surgery, suggesting it may provide a novel alternative to invasive surgery for management of elevated ICP.

Arterial input function (AIF) is estimated from perfusion images as a basic curve for the calculus of hemodynamic variables used as surrogate markers of the vascular status of tissues. However, at present, identification of AIF is made manually leading by prior knowledge. We propose an automatic estimation of  AIF in perfusion images, which is based on a multi-stream 3D CNN, which combined spatial and temporal features together to estimate AIF ROI. The model is trained by manual annotations. The proposed method was trained and tested by 100 cases of PWI images. The result was evaluated by dice similarity coefficient (DSC), which reached to 0.79. The trained model had a better performance than the traditional method. After segmentation of AIF ROI, AIF was calculated by average of all voxels in ROI. We compared AIF result with manual and traditional method, and father process parameter maps such as Tmax and rCBF. The result had a better performance. We had applied the method on a cloud platform Estroke, which can  evaluation ischemic penumbra to help make treatment decision.

A major challenge in neuroscience is to understand what happens to a brain as it ages. Such insights could make it possible to distinguish between individuals who will undergo typical aging and those at risk for neurodegenerative disease. Over the last quarter century, thousands of human brain imaging studies have probed the neural basis of age-related cognitive decline.  “Aging” studies generally enroll adults over the age of 65, a historical precedent rooted in the average retirement age of U.S. wage-earners. A consequence of this research tradition is that it overlooks one of the most significant neuroendocrine changes in a woman’s life: the transition to menopause. The menopausal transition is marked by an overall decline in ovarian sex steroid production – up to 90% in the case of estradiol – a dramatic endocrine change that impacts multiple biological systems, including the brain. Despite sex differences in the risk for dementia, the influence that biological sex and sex hormones have on the aging brain is historically understudied, leaving a critical gap in our understanding of the aging process. In this Perspective, we highlight the influence that endocrine factors have on the aging brain. We devote particular attention to the neural and cognitive changes that unfold in the middle decade of life, as a function of reproductive aging. Next, we consider emerging evidence from animal and human studies that other endocrine factors occurring earlier in life (e.g. pregnancy, hormonal birth control use) also shape the aging process.

The amygdala, which is involved in human social information processing and social emotional response neuronal circuits, is segmented into three subregions that are responsible for perception, affiliation, and aversion. Though there is different functional and effective connectivity (EC) among these networks, age-related structural changes and associations between structure and function within the amygdala remain unclear. Here, we used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data (106 participants) to investigate age-related structural changes in fractional anisotropy (FA) of amygdalar subregions. We also examined the relationship between FA and EC within the subregions. We found that the FA of the amygdalar subregions exhibited inverted-U shape trends with age. Moreover, over the human lifespan, there were negative correlations between the FA of the right ventrolateral amygdala (VLA.R) and the Granger-based EC (GC) of VLA.R → perception network (PerN), the FA of the VLA.R and the GC of the net flow from VLA.R → PerN, and the FA of the left dorsal amygdala (DorA.L) and the GC of the aversion network (AveN). Conversely, there was a positive correlation between the FA of the DorA.L and the GC of the net flow from DorA.L → AveN. Our results suggest that age-related changes in function of brain are constrained by the underlying white matter architectures, while the functional information flow changes influence white matter structure. This work increases our understanding of the neuronal mechanisms in the maturation and aging process.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2019.00043">Histogram of Gradient Orientations of Signal Plots Applied to P300 Detection</a></h4>

The analysis of Electroencephalographic (EEG) signals is of ulterior importance to aid in the diagnosis of mental disease and to increase our understanding of the brain.  Traditionally, clinical EEG has been analyzed in terms of temporal waveforms, looking at rhythms in spontaneous activity, subjectively identifying troughs and peaks in Event-Related Potentials (ERP), or by studying graphoelements in pathological sleep stages.
Additionally, the discipline of Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI) requires new methods to decode patterns from non-invasive EEG signals.  This field is developing alternative communication pathways to transmit volitional information from the Central Nervous System. The technology could potentially enhance the quality of life of patients affected by neurodegenerative disorders and other mental illness. This work mimics what electroencephalographers have been doing clinically, visually inspecting and categorizing phenomena within the EEG by the extraction of features from images of signal plots.  These features are constructed based on the calculation of histograms of oriented gradients from pixels around the signal plot. It aims to provide a new objective framework to analyze, characterize and classify EEG signal waveforms. The feasibility of the method is outlined by detecting the P300, an ERP elicited by the oddball paradigm of rare events, and implementing an offline P300-based BCI Speller.  The validity of the proposal is shown by offline processing a public dataset of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) patients and an own dataset of healthy subjects.

The protein parkin, encoded by the PARK2 gene, is vital for mitochondrial homeostasis, and although it has been implicated in Parkinson’s disease (PD), the disease mechanisms remain unclear. We have applied mass spectrometry-based proteomics to investigate the effects of parkin dysfunction on the mitochondrial proteome in human isogenic induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons with and without PARK2 knockout (KO). The proteomic analysis quantified nearly 60% of all mitochondrial proteins, 119 of which were dysregulated in neurons with PARK2 KO. The protein changes indicated disturbances in oxidative stress defense, mitochondrial respiration and morphology, cell cycle control  and cell viability. Structural and functional analyses revealed an increase in mitochondrial area and the presence of elongated mitochondria as well as impaired glycolysis and lactate-supported respiration in PARK2 KO neurons. Furthermore, PARK2 KO caused decreased proliferation and impaired cell survival. This demonstrates the efficiency of mitochondrial proteomics for identifying and elucidating disease-relevant phenotypes in human iPSC-derived neurons.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00294">Mast Cell/Proteinase Activated Receptor 2 (PAR2) Mediated Interactions in the Pathogenesis of Discogenic Back Pain</a></h4>

Mast cells (MCs) are present in the painful degenerate human intervertebral disc (IVD) and are associated with disease pathogenesis. MCs release granules containing enzymatic and inflammatory factors in response to stimulants or allergens.  The serine protease, tryptase, is unique to MCs and its activation of the G-protein coupled receptor, Protease Activated Receptor 2 (PAR2), induces inflammation and degradation in osteoarthritic cartilage. Our previously published work has demonstrated increased levels of MC marker tryptase in IVD samples from discogenic back pain patients compared to healthy control IVD samples including expression of chemotactic agents that may facilitate MC migration into the IVD. To further elucidate MCs’ role in the IVD and mechanisms underlying its effects, we investigated whether 1) human IVD cells can promote MC migration, 2) MC tryptase can mediate up-regulation of inflammatory/catabolic process in human IVD cells and tissue, and 3) the potential of PAR2 antagonist to function as a therapeutic drug in in vitro human and ex vivo bovine pilot models of disease. MC migration was quantitatively assessed using conditioned media from primary human IVD cells and MC migration examined through matrigel. Exposure to soluble IVD factors significantly enhanced MC migration, suggesting IVD cells can recruit MCs. We also demonstrated significant upregulation of MC chemokine SCF and angiogenic factor VEGFA gene expression in human IVD cells in vitro in response to recombinant human tryptase, suggesting tryptase can enhance recruitment of MCs and promotion of angiogenesis into the usually avascular IVD. Furthermore, tryptase can degrade proteoglycans in IVD tissue as demonstrated by significant increases in glycosaminoglycans released into surrounding media. This can create a catabolic microenvironment compromising structural integrity and facilitating vascular migration usually inhibited by the anti-angiogenic IVD matrix. Finally, as a “proof of concept” study, we examined the therapeutic potential of PAR2 antagonist (PAR2A) on human IVD cells and bovine organ culture IVD model. While preliminary data shows promise and points toward structural restoration of the bovine IVD including down-regulation of VEGFA, effects of PAR2 antagonist on human IVD cells differ between gender and donors suggesting that further validation is required with larger cohorts of human specimens.

The artiodactyl brain has multiple levels of vascular pooling and the rostral epidural rete mirabile (RERM) at its base. The current study is the first of its kind to precisely demonstrate the arterial vasculature of the dromedary brain, utilizing a new casting method with coloured latex and epoxy paint.
In total, 35 freshly slaughtered dromedary heads were injected with coloured latex or coloured epoxy paint prior to dissection in order to reveal cerebral vasculature; Ten processed heads were chemically digested with 5% potassium hydroxide to obtain hard casts of cerebral arteries and anastomosing structures. 
The outcomes of this study ascertain the distinct vascular features of dromedaries that set them apart from other artiodactyls. In addition to the RERM, the dromedary possesses a well-developed ophthalmic and chiasmatic rete. The dromedary is similar to giraffe, goat, cat and pig in the contribution of middle meningeal artery to the rete mirabile; however, dromedaries have several arteries emerging directly from the cerebral arterial circle that supply the choroid plexus and pineal gland. Additionally, dromedaries exhibit a dominant basilar system that dominates the, blood supply to the medulla oblongata, pons, and cerebellum. In our study, we were able to graphically prove the lack of connection between the areas supplied by vertebrobasilar system and carotid system in the dromedary. Furthermore, the vertebral artery does not branch into the basilar artery; instead, it acts as a contributing vessel to the ventral spinal artery that later fuse to form the basilar artery. 
This study employed the new casting method to illustrate a new arterial source to RERM and the various anastomoses among arterial sources supplying the brain in the dromedary. These anastomoses play an important role in maintaining an uninterrupted cerebral blood supply, decreasing the vulnerability of the fragile brain against ischaemia and stroke, as well as, play an important role in maintaining blood pressure and flow in long-necked dromedaries when they raise or lower their heads.

Stroke patients have only limited therapeutic options and often remain with considerable disabilities. To promote neurological recovery, angiogenesis in the ischemic peri-infarct region has been recognized as an encouraging therapeutic target. Despite advances in mechanistic understanding of vascular growth and repair, effective and safe angiogenic treatments are currently missing. Besides the most intensively studied angiogenic growth factors, recent research has indicated that the process of vascular sprouting and migration also requires the participation of guidance molecules, many of which were initially identified as regulators of axonal growth.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Compared to older Caucasians, older African Americans have higher risks of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD), and lower cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tau biomarker levels. It is not known whether tau‐related differences begin earlier in life, and whether race modifies other AD‐related biomarkers such as inflammatory proteins.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed multiplex cytokine analysis in a healthy middle‐aged cohort with family history of AD (n=68) and an older cohort (n=125) with normal cognition (NC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or AD dementia. After identifying baseline IL‐9 level and AD‐associated IL‐9 change to differ according to race, we performed immunohistochemical analysis for proteins mechanistically linked to IL‐9 in brains of African Americans and Caucasians (n=38), and analyzed post‐mortem IL‐9‐related gene expression profiles in the publically available Mount Sinai cohort (26 African Americans and 180 Caucasians).</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Compared to Caucasians with NC, African Americans with NC had lower CSF tau, p‐Tau<sub>181</sub>, and IL‐9 levels in both living cohorts. Conversely, AD was only correlated with increased CSF IL‐9 levels in African Americans but not Caucasians. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed peri‐vascular, neuronal, and glial cells immunoreactive to IL‐9, and quantitative analysis in two independent US cohorts showed AD to correlate with molecular changes (upstream differentiation marker and downstream effector cell marker) of IL‐9 upregulation only in African Americans but not Caucasians.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Baseline and AD‐associated IL‐9 differences between African Americans and Caucasians point to distinct molecular phenotypes for AD according to ancestry. Genetic and non‐genetic factors need to be considered in future AD research involving unique populations.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Higher plasma total‐tau level is associated with incident dementia but its relationship with stroke risk is unknown. In this prospective community‐based study, we evaluated plasma total‐tau level as a biomarker of stroke risk in 2794 Framingham Heart Study participants. Persons with plasma total‐tau levels in the top quintile, versus the bottom four, had an increased risk of incident stroke over a mean follow‐up of 8.3 years (Hazard Ratio, 2.01; 95% Confidence Interval, 1.32‐3.08) following adjustments for age, sex, and stroke risk factors. Our findings demonstrate that plasma total‐tau relates to the risk of stroke in a community sample.</p>

Neural correlates of consciousness (for brevity NCC) are foundational to the scientific study of consciousness. David Chalmers (2000) has provided the most informative and influential definition of NCC, according to which neural correlates are minimally sufficient for consciousness. However, the sense of sufficiency needs further clarification since there are several relevant senses with different entailments. In section one of this article, we give an overview of the desiderata for a good definition of NCC and Chalmers’s definition. The second section analyzes the merit of understanding the sufficiency of neural correlates for corresponding consciousness according to three relevant types of sufficiency: logical, metaphysical, and physical. In section three, a theoretical approach to consciousness studies is suggested in light of the sense in which NCC are sufficient for consciousness. Section four addresses a concern some might have about this approach. By the end, it will become apparent that our conception of NCC has important implications for research methodology, neuroethics, and the vitality of the search for NCC.

The tendency of customers’ preference to their local brands over the foreign ones is known as the consumer ethnocentrism, and it is one of the important issues in international marketing. This study aims at identifying the behavioral and neural correlates of Consumer Ethnocentrism in the field of brand preference by using Event-Related Potential (ERP). We sampled subjects from two ethnic groups, the Chinese ethnic group and the sub-Sahara black Africans group from the Zhejiang University. The subjects faced two sequential stimuli, S1 followed by S2. The S1 consisted of 40 pictures of 20 Chinese and 20 Africans black peoples wearing traditional clothes, and S2 consisted of 40 fake brand-logos which were divided randomly into two groups of 20 each. The subjects were informed that the people in the S1 purchased and recommended the products with the brand-logos presented in S2, and the subjects were asked to rate their preference degree toward these logos. The brand-logos were called the “in-group recommended logos” if the recommender in S1 were the same race as the subjects, otherwise, the “out-group recommended logos”.The results revealed that the race of the brand-logo recommender highly impacted the Chinese subjects’ preference for the brand-logos. The N200 component elicited by in-group recommended logos were significantly lower than those elicited by out-group recommended logos. Besides, there was evidence that being familiar with foreign cultures reduces consumer ethnocentrism. The African subjects were familiar with Chinese people and adopted Chinese culture, as a result, they did not differ in showing preferences between in-group and out-group recommended logos.

Language could not exist without memory, in all its forms: working memory for sequential production and understanding, implicit memory for grammatical rules, semantic memory for knowledge, and episodic memory for communicating personal experience. Episodic memory is part of a more general capacity for mental travel both forward and backward in time, and even into fantasy and stories. I argue that the generativity of mental time travel underlies the generativity of language itself, and could be the basis of what Chomsky calls I-language, or universal grammar, a capacity for recursive thought independent of communicative language itself. Whereas Chomsky proposed that I-language evolved in a single step well after the emergence of Homo sapiens, I suggest that generative imagination, extended in space and time, has a long evolutionary history, and that it was the capacity to share internal thoughts, rather than the nature of the thoughts themselves, that more clearly distinguishes humans from other species.

Sensory experiences, such as sound, often result from our motor actions. Over time, repeated sound-producing performance can generate sensorimotor associations. However, it is not clear how sensory and motor information are associated. Here, we explore if sensory prediction is associated with the formation of sensorimotor associations during a learning task. We recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) while participants produced index and little finger-swipes on a bespoke device, generating novel sounds. ERPs were also obtained as participants heard those sounds played back. Peak suppression was compared to assess sensory prediction. Additionally, transcranial magnetic stimulation was used during listening to generate finger-motor evoked potentials (MEPs). MEPs were recorded before and after training upon hearing these sounds, and then compared to reveal sensorimotor associations. Finally, we explored the relationship between these components. Results demonstrated that an increased positive-going peak (e.g., P2) and a suppressed negative-going peak (e.g., N2) were recorded during action, revealing some sensory prediction outcomes (P2: p = 0.050, p2 = 0.208; N2: p = 0.001, p2 = 0.474). Increased MEPs were also observed upon hearing congruent compared with incongruent sounds (i.e., associated to a finger), demonstrating precise sensorimotor associations not present before learning (Index finger: p &lt; 0.001, p2 = 0.614; Little finger: p &lt; 0.001, p2 = 0.529). Consistent with our broad hypotheses, a negative association between the MEPs in one finger during listening and ERPs during performance of the other was observed (Index finger MEPs and Fz N1 action ERPs; r = -.655, p = .003). Overall, data suggest predictive mechanisms are associated with fine-tuning of sensorimotor associations.

Increasing evidence supports a role for cerebrovasculature dysfunction in the aetiology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Blood vessels in the brain are composed of a collection of cells and acellular material that comprise the neurovascular unit (NVU). The NVU in the hippocampus and cortex receives innervation from cholinergic neurons that originate in the basal forebrain.  Death of these neurons and their nerve fibres is an early feature of AD. However, the effect of the loss of cholinergic innervation on the NVU is not well characterised. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of the loss of cholinergic innervation of components of the NVU at capillaries, arteries and veins in the hippocampus and cortex. Adult male C57BL/6 mice received an intracerebroventricular injection of the immunotoxin p75NTR mu-saporin to induce the loss of cholinergic neurons. Quadruple labelling immunohistochemistry and 3D reconstruction were carried out to characterise specific points of contact between cholinergic fibres and collagen IV, smooth muscle cells and astrocyte endfeet. Innate differences were observed between vessels of the hippocampus and cortex of control mice, including a greater amount of cholinergic contact with perivascular astrocytes in hippocampal capillaries and a thicker basement membrane in hippocampal veins. Saporin treatment induced a loss of cholinergic innervation at the arterial basement membrane and smooth muscle cells of both the hippocampus and the cortex. In the cortex, there was an additional loss of innervation at the astrocytic endfeet. The current results suggest that cortical arteries are more strongly affected by cholinergic denervation than arteries in the hippocampus. This regional variation may have implications for the etiology of the vascular pathology that develops in AD.

Although genetic factors contribute to neurodegenerative diseases such as dementia, the etiology of these disorders is complex and incompletely understood. Thus, a growing interest in different approaches including a developmental perspective to these pathologies is gaining momentum. Including environmental factors offers the possibility to enhance our understanding of the etiological factors resulting in the emergence of neurodegenerative processes.
Brain, cognitive, and affective reserves can constitute protective factors against the manifestation of symptoms or signs related to cognitive decline in elderly people. These reserves are shaped by the interactions between the person and their environment. Therefore, they are influenced by the quality of the individual’s socio-economic situation, their level of education, the variety and quality of intellectual stimulations and social interactions. 
Both current and past environment may be of importance. Attachment theory appears to be a valuable candidate to approach the study of the relational early-life environment, as it bears on numerous facets of a person’s development. Besides its established impact on the development of social and affective competencies, recent results highlight that the quality of attachment relations between the child and their caregivers also influences the development of cognitive competencies and, thus, may influence the cognitive reserve in later life. Furthermore, attachment is likely to be involved in neurobiological aspects of brain development as well as in certain epigenetic processes. 
Through the lens of the attachment theory, this review will attempt to show how the previously mentioned components participate in the development of affective, cognitive and brain reserves, which can in turn act as protective factors against cognitive decline in elderly people.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Astrocytes play key roles in brain functions through dynamic interactions with neurons. One of their typical features is to express high levels of connexins (Cxs), Cx43 and Cx30, the gap junction (GJ)-forming proteins. Cx30 is involved in basic cognitive processes and shapes synaptic and network activities, as shown by recent studies in transgenic animals. Yet it remains unknown whether astroglial Cx30 expression, localization, and functions are endogenously and dynamically regulated by neuronal activity and could therefore play physiological roles in neurotransmission. We here show that neuronal activity increased hippocampal Cx30 protein levels via a posttranslational mechanism regulating lysosomal degradation. Neuronal activity also increased Cx30 protein levels at membranes and perisynaptic processes, as revealed by superresolution imaging. This translated at the functional level in the activation of Cx30 hemichannels and in Cx30-mediated remodeling of astrocyte morphology independently of GJ biochemical coupling. Altogether, these data show activity-dependent dynamics of Cx30 expression, perisynaptic localization, and functions.</span>

<p>by Andrea Komljenovic, Hao Li, Vincenzo Sorrentino, Zoltán Kutalik, Johan Auwerx, Marc Robinson-Rechavi</p>

The evolutionarily conserved nature of the few well-known anti-aging interventions that affect lifespan, such as caloric restriction, suggests that aging-related research in model organisms is directly relevant to human aging. Since human lifespan is a complex trait, a systems-level approach will contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying aging landscape. Here, we integrate evolutionary and functional information of normal aging across human and model organisms at three levels: gene-level, process-level, and network-level. We identify evolutionarily conserved modules of normal aging across diverse taxa, and notably show proteostasis to be conserved in normal aging. Additionally, we find that mechanisms related to protein quality control network are enriched for genes harboring genetic variants associated with 22 age-related human traits and associated to caloric restriction. These results demonstrate that a systems-level approach, combined with evolutionary conservation, allows the detection of candidate aging genes and pathways relevant to human normal aging.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/n__Vy_y-Nug" width="1" />

Genetic predisposition to smoking initiation (ever smoking regularly), based on up to 372 single‐nucleotide polymorphisms, was statistically significantly positively associated with any ischemic stroke, large artery stroke, and small vessel stroke but not cardioembolic stroke or intracerebral hemorrhage.

Abstract<p>Identified neurons and the networks they compose produce stereotypical, albeit individually unique, activity across members of a species. We propose, for a motor circuit driven by a central pattern generator (CPG), that the uniqueness derives mainly from differences in synaptic strength rather than from differences in intrinsic membrane conductances. We studied a dataset of recordings from six leech (Hirudo sp.) heartbeat control networks, containing complete spiking activity patterns from inhibitory premotor interneurons, motor output spike patterns, and synaptic strength patterns to investigate the source of uniqueness. We used a conductance-based multi-compartmental motor neuron model to construct a bilateral motor circuit model, and controlled it by playing recorded input spike trains from premotor interneurons to generate output inhibitory synaptic patterns similar to experimental measurements. By generating different synaptic conductance parameter sets of this circuit model, we found that relative premotor synaptic strengths impinging onto motor neurons must be different across individuals to produce animal-specific output burst phasing. Obtaining unique outputs from each individual’s circuit model did not require different intrinsic ionic conductance parameters. Furthermore, changing intrinsic conductances failed to compensate for modified synaptic strength patterns. Thus the pattern of synaptic strengths of motor neuron inputs is critical for the phasing of this motor circuit and can explain individual differences. When intrinsic conductances were allowed to vary, they exhibited the same conductance correlations across individuals, suggesting a motor neuron ’type’ required for proper network function. Our results are general and may translate to other systems and neuronal networks that control output phasing.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Each member of a species is unique, down to its neurons. The ability to experimentally identify a specific neuron across individuals allows investigating the neuron’s variability in spiking activity patterns and therefore its function. Identified neuron types produce stereotypical, albeit individually unique, activity patterns. Uniqueness of activity can be caused by variability observed in the intrinsic properties of neurons and the synaptic connections of the circuit. Here, we propose that, for a rhythmic neuronal motor circuit, the uniqueness derives mainly from differences in synaptic strength rather than from differences in intrinsic membrane conductances. The neuron types that we studied are from the leech heartbeat system. However, our results are general and can translate to other neuronal networks that control output phasing.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To determine whether maternal Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) IgG antibody levels are associated with risk of multiple sclerosis (MS) in the offspring.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We conducted a prospective nested case–control study in the Finnish Maternity Cohort (FMC) with serum samples from &gt;800,000 women collected during pregnancy since 1983. Cases of MS among offspring born between 1983 and 1991 were identified via hospital and prescription registries; 176 cases were matched to up to 3 controls (n = 326) on region and dates of birth, sample collection, and mother's birth. We used conditional logistic regression to estimate relative risks (RRs) and adjusted models for sex of the child, gestational age at sample collection, and maternal serum 25‐hydroxyvitamin D and cotinine levels. Similar analyses were conducted among 1,049 women with MS and 1,867 matched controls in the FMC.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Maternal viral capsid antigen IgG levels during pregnancy were associated with an increased MS risk among offspring (RR<sub>top vs bottom quintile</sub> = 2.44, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.20–5.00, <i>p</i> trend = 0.004); no associations were found between maternal EBV nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA‐1), diffuse early antigen, or cytomegalovirus IgG levels and offspring MS risk. Among women in the FMC, those in the highest versus lowest quintile of EBNA‐1 IgG levels had a 3‐fold higher risk of MS (RR = 3.21, 95% CI = 2.37–4.35, <i>p</i> trend &lt;1.11e‐16). These associations were not confounded or modified by 25‐hydroxyvitamin D.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Offspring of mothers with high viral capsid antigen IgG during pregnancy appear to have an increased risk of MS. The increase in MS risk among women with elevated prediagnostic EBNA‐1 IgG levels is consistent with previous results. ANN NEUROL 2019</p>

The investigation of GABAergic inhibitory circuits has substantially expanded over the past few years. The development of new tools and technology has allowed investigators to classify many diverse groups of inhibitory neurons by several delineating factors: these include their connectivity motifs, expression of specific molecular markers, receptor diversity, and ultimately their role in brain function. Despite this progress, however, there is still limited understanding of how GABAergic neurons are recruited by their input and how their activity is modulated by behavioral states. This limitation is primarily due to the fact that studies of GABAergic inhibition are mainly geared toward determining how, once activated, inhibitory circuits regulate the activity of excitatory neurons. In this review, we will outline recent work investigating the anatomical and physiological properties of inputs that activate cortical GABAergic neurons, and discuss how these inhibitory cells are differentially recruited during behavior.

Our memories are essential in our daily lives. The frontal and cingulate cortices, hippocampal system and medial temporal lobes are key brain regions. In addition, severe amnesia also occurs after damage or dysfunction to the anterior thalamic nuclei; this subcortical thalamic hub is interconnected to these key cortical memory structures. Behavioural, anatomical, and physiological evidence across mammalian species has shown that interactions between the anterior thalamic nuclei, cortex and hippocampal formation are vital for spatial memory processing. Furthermore, the adjacent laterodorsal thalamic nucleus, interconnected to the retrosplenial cortex and visual system, also contributes to spatial memory in mammals. However, how these thalamic nuclei contribute to memory still remains largely unknown. Fortunately, our understanding of the importance of the thalamus in cognitive processes is being redefined, as widespread evidence challenges the established view of the thalamus as a passive relay of sensory and subcortical information to the cortex. In this review, we examine whether the anterior thalamic nuclei and the adjacent laterodorsal thalamic nuclei are suitable candidates for ‘higher-order’ thalamic nuclei, as defined by the Sherman and Guillery model. Rather than simply relaying information to cortex, ‘higher-order’ thalamic nuclei have a prominent role in cognition, as they can regulate how areas of the cortex interact with one another. These considerations along with a review of the latest research will be used to suggest future studies that will clarify the contributions that the anterior and laterodorsal thalamic nuclei have in supporting cortical functions during cognitive processes.

A field’s priorities are reflected by the contents of its high-impact journals. Researchers in turn may choose to pursue research objectives based on what is believed to be most highly valued by their peers. However, these assessments of the field’s priorities are often subjective, owing to a lack of formal quantification of high-impact journals’ contents. By compiling a corpus of abstracts from within the field neuroscience, I was able to analyze which terms had differential frequencies between 12 high-impact and 13 medium-impact journals. Approximately 50,000 neuroscience abstracts were analyzed over the years 2014-2018. Several broad trends emerged from the analysis of which terms were biased towards high-impact journals. Generally speaking, high-impact journals tended to feature: genetic or psychiatric studies, use of the latest and most sophisticated methods, examinations of the orbitofrontal cortex or amygdala, and/or use of human or non-mammalian subjects. Medium-impact journals tended to feature motor or cardiovascular studies, use of older methods, examinations of caudal brain regions, and/or rats as subjects. This approach also allowed for the comparison of high-impact bias among: brain regions, methods, neurotransmitters, study species, and broad themes within neuroscience. A systematic approach to the contents of high-impact journals offers the field an objective view of itself.

Objective: White matter hyperintensities (WMH) is an important cause of vascular cognitive impairment (CI). However, a considerable portion of individuals with WMH do not develop CI. The present study aimed to investigate distinctive regional brain activity and connectivity patterns in WMH subjects with and without CI, who displayed comparable WMH burden. 
Methods: Fourteen WMH subjects with CI, 16 WMH subjects without CI and 37 healthy subjects underwent multimodal MRI scans and neuropsychological tests. All WMH subjects displayed Fazekas grade 2 of WMH. Regional Homogeneity (ReHo) and functional connectivity (FC) patterns were identified based on resting-state functional MRI data. 
Results: No significant differences in WMH volume, the number of WMH lesions and brain volume were shown between the 2 WMH groups. In contrast, the WMH with CI group showed higher ReHo in bilateral superior parietal gyrus (SPG)/superior occipital gyrus (SOG) than the WMH without CI group. Compared with the WMH without CI group, the WMH with CI group also displayed higher FC of the left SPG/SOG with frontal regions, and higher FC of the right SPG/SOG with parietal regions. Furthermore, higher FC of the left SPG/SOG with frontal regions were significantly associated with less worse executive dysfunction in WMH with CI subjects, suggesting a compensatory effect. 
Conclusions: Higher local coherence of activities in the SPG/SOG and higher connectivity of the SPG/SOG with parietal and frontal regions are related to CI in WMH subjects. The findings provide novel insights into functional alterations underlying the cognitive variety in WMH subjects.

Aggregation of α-synuclein (αSyn) plays a central role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, which consist mainly of aggregated αSyn, are widely observed in the affected regions of patient brains. Except for some familial forms of PD, most sporadic PD patients express the wild-type αSyn protein without any mutations, and the mechanisms as to how wild-type αSyn gains the propensity to pathologically aggregate still remains unclear. Furthermore, the mechanisms by which the same αSyn protein can cause different synucleinopathies with distinct phenotypes and pathologies, such as PD, DLB, and multiple system atrophy, still remain largely unknown. Recently, mutations in the GBA1 gene have been reported be the strongest risk factor for developing sporadic PD. Furthermore, decreased glucocerebrosidase activity has also been reported in the brains of patients with sporadic PD. Moreover, αSyn pathology have also been shown in the brains of lysosomal storage disorder patients, which show glycosphingolipid accumulation. These observations suggest the possibility that altered lipid metabolism and lipid accumulation play roles in αSyn aggregation and PD pathogenesis. Indeed, several previous studies have demonstrated that lipid interactions affect the conformation of αSyn and induces its oligomerization and aggregation. In this review, we will give an overview of the association between αSyn aggregation and lipid interactions from the viewpoints of the etiology, pathology, and genetics of PD. We also discuss the distinct species of αSyn aggregates and their association with specific types of synucleinopathies, and introduce our hypothesis that lipid interactions play a role as trans-acting effectors in producing distinct strains of αSyn fibrils.

Image characteristics of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data (e.g. signal-to-noise ratio, SNR) may change over the course of a study. To monitor these changes a quality assurance (QA) protocol is necessary. QA can be realized both by performing regular phantom measurements and by controlling the human MRI datasets (e.g. noise detection in structural or movement parameters in functional datasets). Several QA tools for the assessment of MRI data quality have been developed. Many of them are freely available. This allows in principle the flexible set-up of a QA protocol specifically adapted to the aims of one’s own study. However, setup and maintenance of these tools bind time, in particular since the installation and operation often require a fair amount of technical knowledge. In this article we present a light-weighted virtual machine, named LAB-QA2GO, which provides scripts for fully automated QA analyses of phantom and human datasets. This virtual machine is ready for analysis by starting it the first time. With minimal configuration in the guided web-interface the first analysis can start within 10 minutes, while adapting to local phantoms and needs is easily possible. The usability and scope of LAB–QA2GO is illustrated using a data set from the QA protocol of our lab. With LAB–QA2GO we hope to provide an easy-to-use toolbox that is able to calculate QA statistics without high effort.

Brain inflammation can result in functional disorders observed in several neurodegenerative diseases and that can be also associated with reduced neurogenesis. In this study, we investigate the effect of mild inflammation, induced by unilateral injection of Endotoxin (ET) in the substantia nigra (SN)/ ventral tegmental area (VTA), on the proliferation and survival of stem/progenitor cells in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus. Adult female rats received unilateral injection of ET (2 µg/2 µl saline) or sterile saline (2 µl) in the right SN followed by 5’-Bromo-2’-deoxyuridine (BrdU) injections (66 mg/kg/injection). Intranigral ET injection induced bilateral decrease in the number of newly born BrdU positive cells in the DG. This effect was paralleled by a significant decrease in the exploratory behavior of rats, as assessed by the Y-maze novel arm exploration task. ET also induced a transient decrease in the number of tyrosine hydroxylase -positive cells in the injected SN, impaired motor behavior, and caused microglial activation in the SN. This study provides an experimental simulation of the remote effects of moderate and reversible neuroinflammation resulting in impaired communication between midbrain dopaminergic neurons and the hippocampus.

Digital pathology is increasingly prominent in neurodegenerative disease research, but variability in immunohistochemical staining intensity between staining batches prevents large-scale comparative studies. Here we provide a statistically rigorous method to account for staining batch effects in a large sample of brain tissue with frontotemporal lobar degeneration with tau inclusions (FTLD-Tau, N=39) or TDP-43 inclusions (FTLD-TDP, N=53). We analyzed the relationship between duplicate measurements of digital pathology, i.e. percent area occupied by pathology (%AO) for grey matter (GM) and white matter (WM), from two distinct staining batches. We found a significant difference in duplicate measurements from distinct staining batches in FTLD-Tau (mean difference: GM=1.13±0.44, WM=1.28±0.56; p&lt;0.001) and FTLD-TDP (GM=0.95±0.66, WM=0.90±0.77; p&lt;0.001), and these measurements were linearly related (R-squared [Rsq]: FTLD-Tau GM=0.92, WM=0.92; FTLD-TDP GM=0.75, WM=0.78; p&lt;0.001 all). We therefore used linear regression to transform %AO from distinct staining batches into equivalent values. Using a train-test set design, we examined transformation prerequisites (i.e. Rsq) from linear-modeling in training sets, and we applied equivalence factors (i.e. beta, intercept) to independent testing sets to determine transformation outcomes (i.e. intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC]). First, random iterations (x100) of linear regression showed that smaller training sets (N=12-24), feasible for prospective use, have acceptable transformation prerequisites (mean Rsq: FTLD-Tau≥0.9; FTLD-TDP≥0.7). When cross-validated on independent complementary testing sets, in FTLD-Tau, N=12 training sets resulted in 100% of GM and WM transformations with optimal transformation outcomes (ICC≥0.8), while in FTLD-TDP N=24 training sets resulted in optimal ICC in testing sets (GM=72%, WM=98%). We therefore propose training sets of N=12 in FTLD-Tau and N=24 in FTLD-TDP for prospective transformations. Finally, the transformation enabled us to significantly reduce batch-related difference in duplicate measurements in FTLD-Tau (GM/WM: p&lt;0.001 both) and FTLD-TDP (GM/WM: p&lt;0.001 both), and to decrease the necessary sample size estimated in a power analysis in FTLD-Tau (GM:-40%; WM:-34%) and FTLD-TDP (GM:-20%; WM:-30%). Finally, we tested generalizability of our approach using a second, open-source, image analysis platform and found similar results. We concluded that a small sample of tissue stained in duplicate can be used to account for pre-analytical variability such as staining batch effects, thereby improving methods for future studies.

Drug-seeking in opioid dependence is due in part to the severe negative emotion associated with the withdrawal syndrome. It is well-established that negative emotional states emerge from activity in the amygdala. More recently, gut microflora have been shown to contribute substantially to such emotions. We measured gene expression in single glia and neurons gathered from the amygdala using laser capture microdissection and simultaneously measured gut microflora in morphine-dependent and withdrawn rats to investigate drivers of negative emotion in opioid withdrawal. We found that neuroinflammatory genes, notably Tnf, were upregulated in the withdrawal condition and that astrocytes, in particular, were highly active. We also observe a decreased Firmicutes to Bacteroides ratio in opioid withdrawal indicating gut dysbiosis. We speculate that these inflammatory and gut microflora changes contribute to the negative emotion experienced in opioid withdrawal that motivates dependence.

Collecting multiple modalities of neuroimaging data on the same subject is increasingly becoming the norm in clinical practice and research. Fusing multiple modalities to find related patterns is a challenge in neuroimaging analysis. Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is commonly used as a symmetric data fusion technique to find related patterns among multiple modalities. In CCA-based data fusion, principal component analysis (PCA) is frequently applied as a preprocessing step to reduce data dimension followed by CCA on dimension-reduced data. PCA, however, does not differentiate between informative voxels from non-informative voxels in the dimension reduction step. Sparse PCA (sPCA) extends traditional PCA by adding sparse regularization that assigns zero weights to non-informative voxels. In this study, sPCA is incorporated into CCA-based fusion analysis and applied on neuroimaging data. A cross-validation method is developed and validated to optimize the parameters in sPCA. Different simulations are carried out to evaluate the improvement by introducing sparsity constraint to PCA. Four fusion methods including sPCA+CCA, PCA+CCA, parallel ICA and sparse CCA were applied on structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging data of mild cognitive impairment subjects and normal controls. Our results indicate that sPCA significantly can reduce the impact of non-informative voxels and lead to improved statistical power in uncovering disease-related patterns by a fusion analysis.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00227">Individual Differences in Math Ability Determine Neurocognitive Processing of Arithmetic Complexity: A Combined fNIRS-EEG Study</a></h4>

Some individuals experience more difficulties with math than others, in particular when arithmetic problems get more complex. Math ability on one hand and arithmetic complexity on the other hand seem to partly share neural underpinnings. This study addresses the question of whether this leads to an interaction of math ability and arithmetic complexity for multiplication and division on behavioral and neural levels. Previously screened individuals with high and low math ability solved multiplication and division problems in a written production paradigm while brain activation was assessed by combined functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and electroencephalography (EEG). Arithmetic complexity was manipulated by using single-digit operands for simple multiplication problems and operands between 2 and 19 for complex multiplication problems and the corresponding division problems. On the behavioral level, individuals with low math ability needed more time for calculation, especially for complex arithmetic. On the neural level, fNIRS results revealed that these individuals showed less activation in the left supramarginal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus and inferior frontal gyrus than individuals with high math ability when solving complex compared to simple arithmetic. This reflects the greater use of arithmetic fact retrieval and also the more efficient processing of arithmetic complexity by individuals with high math ability. Oscillatory EEG analysis generally revealed theta and alpha desynchronization with increasing arithmetic complexity but showed no interaction with math ability. Because of the discovered interaction for behavior and brain activation, we conclude that the consideration of individual differences is essential when investigating the neurocognitive processing of arithmetic.

In typical infants, the achievement of independent locomotion has a positive impact on the development of both small-scale and large-scale spatial cognition. Here we investigated whether this association between the motor and spatial domain: 1) persists into childhood and 2) is detrimental to the development of spatial cognition in individuals with motor deficits, namely, individuals with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and individuals with Williams syndrome (WS). Despite evidence of a co-occurring motor impairment in many individuals with ADHD, little is known about the developmental consequences of this impairment. Individuals with WS demonstrate impaired motor and spatial competence, yet the relationship between these two impairments is unknown. Typically developing (TD) children (N=71), individuals with ADHD (N=51) and individuals with WS (N=20) completed a battery of motor tasks, a measure of independent exploration, and a virtual reality spatial navigation task. Retrospective motor milestone data was collected for the ADHD and WS groups. Results demonstrated a relationship between fine motor ability and spatial navigation in the TD group, which could reflect the developmental impact of the ability to manually manipulate objects, on spatial knowledge. In contrast, no relationships between the motor and spatial domains were observed for the ADHD or WS groups. Indeed, whilst there was evidence of motor impairment in both groups, only the WS group demonstrated an impairment in large-scale spatial navigation. The motor-spatial relationship in the TD, but not the ADHD and WS groups, suggests that spatial cognition can develop via a developmental pathway which bypasses input from the motor domain.

Split-belt treadmills that move the legs at different speeds are thought to update internal representations of the environment, such that this novel condition generates a new locomotor pattern with distinct spatio-temporal features compared to those of regular walking. It is unclear the degree to which such recalibration of movements in the spatial and temporal domains is interdependent. In this study, we explicitly altered subjects’ limb motion in either space or time during split-belt walking to determine its impact on the adaptation of the other domain. Interestingly, we observed that motor adaptation in the spatial domain was susceptible to altering the temporal domain, whereas motor adaptation in the temporal domain was resilient to modifying the spatial domain. This nonreciprocal relation suggests a hierarchical organization such that the control of timing in locomotion has an effect on the control of limb position. This is of translational interest because clinical populations often have a greater deficit in one domain compared to
14 the other. Our results suggest that explicit changes to temporal deficits cannot occur without modifying the spatial control of the limb.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2019.00042">Auditory Stream Segregation Can Be Modeled by Neural Competition in Cochlear Implant Listeners</a></h4>

Auditory stream segregation is a perceptual process by which the human auditory system groups sounds from different sources into perceptually meaningful elements (e.g. a voice or a melody). The perceptual segregation of sounds is important, for example, for the understanding of speech in noisy scenarios, a particularly challenging task for listeners with a cochlear implant (CI). It has been suggested that some aspects of stream segregation may be explained by relatively basic neural mechanisms at a cortical level. During the past decades, a variety of models have been proposed to account for the data from stream segregation experiments in normal-hearing (NH) listeners. However, little attention has been given to corresponding findings in CI listeners. The present study investigated whether a neural model of sequential stream segregation, proposed to describe the behavioral effects observed in NH listeners, can account for behavioral data from CI listeners. The model operates on the stimulus features at the cortical level and includes a competition stage between the neuronal units encoding the different percepts. The competition arises from a combination of mutual inhibition, adaptation and additive noise. The model was found to capture the main trends in the behavioral data from CI listeners, such as the larger probability of a segregated percept with increasing the feature difference between the sounds as well as the build-up effect. Importantly, this was achieved without any modification to the model’s competition stage, suggesting that stream segregation could be mediated by a similar mechanism in both groups of listeners.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2019.00044">Stimulus-Specific Adaptation Decreases the Coupling of Spikes to LFP Phase</a></h4>

Stimulus repetition suppresses the neural activity in different sensory areas of the brain. This mechanism of so-called stimulus-specific adaptation has been observed in both spiking activity and local field potential (LFP) responses. However, much remains to be known about the effect of stimulus-specific adaptation on the spike-LFP relation. In this study, we approached this issue by investigating the spike-phase coupling (SPC) in control and adapting paradigms. For the control paradigm, pure tones were presented in a random unbiased sequence. In the adapting paradigm, the same stimuli were presented in a random pattern but it was biased to an adapter stimulus. In fact, the adapter occupied 80% of the adapting sequence. During the tasks, LFP and multi-unit activity were recorded simultaneously from the primary auditory cortex of 15 anesthetized rats. To clarify the effect of adaptation on the relation between spike and LFP responses, the SPC of the adapter stimulus in these two paradigms were evaluated. Here, we employed phase locking value (PLV) method for calculating the SPC. Our data shows a strong coupling of spikes to LFP phase most prominently in beta band. This coupling was observed to decrease in the adapting condition compared to the control one. Importantly, we found that adaptation reduces spikes dominantly from the preferred phase of LFP in which spikes are more likely to be present there. This highlights the crucial role of LFP phase and its relation to spikes in neural adaptation mechanism. This finding is important for interpretation of the underlying neural mechanism of adaptation and also can be used in the context of the network and related connectivity models.

Mast cells and their mediators play a role in the control of homeostasis and in the pathogenesis of several disorders. The concept of rodent mast cell heterogeneity, initially established in the mid-1960s has been extended in humans. Human mast cells isolated and purified from different anatomic sites can be activated via aggregation of cell surface high affinity IgE receptors (FcRI) by antigens, superantigens, anti-IgE, and anti-FcRI. MAS-related G protein-coupled receptor-X2 (MRGPRX2) is expressed at high level in human skin mast cells (MCs) (HSMCs), synovial MCs (HSyMCs), but not in lung MCs (HLMCs). MRGPX2 can be activated by neuropeptide substance P, several opioids, cationic drugs, and 48/80. Substance P (5 x 10-7 M - 5 x 10-6 M) induced histamine and tryptase release from HSMCs and to a lesser extent from HSyMCs, but not from HLMCs and human cardiac MCs (HHMCs). Morphine (10-5 M - 3 x 10-4 M) selectively induced histamine and tryptase release from HSMCs, but not from HLMCs and HHMCs. SP and morphine were incomplete secretagogues because they did not induce the de novo synthesis of arachidonic acid metabolites from human mast cells. In the same experiments anti-IgE (3 g/ml) induced the release of histamine and tryptase and the de novo synthesis of prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) from HLMCs, HHMCs, HSyMCs, and HSMCs. By contrast, anti-IgE induced the production of leukotriene C4 (LTC4) from HLMCs, HHMCs, HSyMCs, but not from HSMCs. These results are compatible with the heterogeneous expression and function of MRGPRX2 receptor on primary human mast cells isolated from different anatomic sites.

Methyl Cytosine Binding Protein 2 (MeCP2) is a structural chromosomal protein involved in the regulation of gene expression. Mutations in the gene encoding MeCP2 result in Rett Syndrome, (RTT) a pervasive neurodevelopmental disorder. RTT is one of few Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs) whose cause was identified as a single gene mutation. Remarkably, abnormal levels of MeCP2 have been associated to other neurodevelopmental disorders, as well as neuropsychiatric disorders. Therefore, many studies have been oriented to investigate the role of MeCP2 in the nervous system.
In the present work, we explore cellular and molecular mechanisms affecting synaptic plasticity events in vivo in the hippocampus of MeCP2 mutant mice. While most studies addressed postsynaptic defects in the absence of MeCP2, we took advantage of an in vivo activity-paradigm (seizures), two models of MeCP2 deficiency, and neurobiological assays to reveal novel defects in presynaptic structural plasticity in the hippocampus in RTT rodent models. These approaches allowed us to determine that: MeCP2 mutations alter presynaptic components, i. e., disrupts the plastic response of mossy fibers to synaptic activityand results in reduced axonal growth which is correlated with imbalanced trophic and guidance support, associated with aberrant expression of BDNF and Sema3F. Our results also revealed that adult-born granule cells recapitulate maturational defects that have been only shown at early postnatal ages. As these cells do not mature timely, they may not integrate properly into the adult hippocampal circuitry. Finally, we performed a hippocampal-dependent test that revealed defective spatial memory in these mice. 
Altogether, our studies establish a model that allows us to evaluate the effect of the manipulation of specific pathways involved in axonal guidance, synaptogenesis, or maturation in specific circuits and correlate it with changes in behavior. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the neuronal compromise caused by mutations in MeCP2 will provide information on the pathogenic mechanism of autistic spectrum disorders and improve our understanding of brain development and molecular basis of behavior.

Iron levels in the brain can be estimated using newly developed specific magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences. This technique has several applications, especially in neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer’s disease or Parkinson’s disease. Coupling ex vivo MRI with histology allows neuroscientists to better understand what they see in the images. Iron is one of the most extensively studied elements, both by MRI and using histological or physical techniques. Researchers were initially only able to make visual comparisons between MRI images and different types of iron staining, but the emergence of specific MRI sequences like R2* or quantitative susceptibility mapping meant that quantification became possible, requiring correlations with physical techniques. Today, with advances in MRI and image post-processing, it is possible to look for MRI/histology correlations by matching the two sorts of images. For the result to be acceptable, the choice of methodology is crucial, as there are hidden pitfalls every step of the way. In order to review the advantages and limitations of ex vivo MRI correlation with iron-based histology, we reviewed all the relevant articles dealing with the topic in humans. We provide separate assessments of qualitative and quantitative studies, and after summarizing the significant results, we emphasize all the pitfalls that may be encountered.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Pyramidal neurons are the most common cell type and are considered the main output neuron in most mammalian forebrain structures. In terms of function, differences in the structure of the dendrites of these neurons appear to be crucial in determining how neurons integrate information. To further shed light on the structure of the human pyramidal neurons we investigated the geometry of pyramidal cells in the human and mouse CA1 region—one of the most evolutionary conserved archicortical regions, which is critically involved in the formation, consolidation, and retrieval of memory. We aimed to assess to what extent neurons corresponding to a homologous region in different species have parallel morphologies. Over 100 intracellularly injected and 3D-reconstructed cells across both species revealed that dendritic and axonal morphologies of human cells are not only larger but also have structural differences, when compared to mouse. The results show that human CA1 pyramidal cells are not a stretched version of mouse CA1 cells. These results indicate that there are some morphological parameters of the pyramidal cells that are conserved, whereas others are species-specific.</span>

Whether dynamic changes in genome architecture underlie transcriptional and functional plasticity in mature neurons has been technically challenging to address. A recent study (Yamada et al., Nature, 2019) exploited experimental advantages of the cerebellum to reveal cell type-specific changes in chromatin architecture that coordinate neural activity-induced changes in gene transcription and contribute to sensorimotor learning.

<p>by Jakob Ruess, Maroš Pleška, Cǎlin C. Guet, Gašper Tkačik</p>

Mathematical models have been used successfully at diverse scales of biological organization, ranging from ecology and population dynamics to stochastic reaction events occurring between individual molecules in single cells. Generally, many biological processes unfold across multiple scales, with mutations being the best studied example of how stochasticity at the molecular scale can influence outcomes at the population scale. In many other contexts, however, an analogous link between micro- and macro-scale remains elusive, primarily due to the challenges involved in setting up and analyzing multi-scale models. Here, we employ such a model to investigate how stochasticity propagates from individual biochemical reaction events in the bacterial innate immune system to the ecology of bacteria and bacterial viruses. We show analytically how the dynamics of bacterial populations are shaped by the activities of immunity-conferring enzymes in single cells and how the ecological consequences imply optimal bacterial defense strategies against viruses. Our results suggest that bacterial populations in the presence of viruses can either optimize their initial growth rate or their population size, with the first strategy favoring simple immunity featuring a single restriction modification system and the second strategy favoring complex bacterial innate immunity featuring several simultaneously active restriction modification systems.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/4oVil-jENIA" width="1" />

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Cytochrome <i>c</i> oxidase (COX) deficiency is a major mitochondrial respiratory chain defect that has vast genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity. This study aims to identify novel causative genes of COX deficiency with only striated muscle–specific symptoms.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Whole exome sequencing was performed in 2 unrelated individuals who were diagnosed with congenital myopathy and presented COX deficiency in muscle pathology. We assessed the <i>COX6A2</i> variants using measurements of enzymatic activities and assembly of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes in the samples from the patients and knockout mice.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Both patients presented muscle weakness and hypotonia in 4 limbs along with facial muscle weakness. One patient had cardiomyopathy. Neither patient exhibited involvement from other organs. Whole exome sequencing identified biallelic missense variants in <i>COX6A2</i>, which is expressed only in the skeletal muscle and heart. The variants detected were homozygous c.117C &gt; A (p.Ser39Arg) and compound heterozygous c.117C &gt; A (p.Ser39Arg) and c.127T &gt; C (p.Cys43Arg). We found specific reductions in complex IV activities in the skeletal muscle of both individuals. Assembly of complex IV and its supercomplex formation were impaired in the muscle.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This study indicates that biallelic variants in <i>COX6A2</i> cause a striated muscle–specific form of COX deficiency. ANN NEUROL 2019</p>

Selection starts in the primary visual cortex (V1), which creates a bottom-up saliency map to guide the fovea to selected visual locations via gaze shifts. This motivates a new framework that views vision as consisting of encoding, selection, and decoding stages, placing selection on center stage. It suggests a massive loss of non-selected information from V1 downstream along the visual pathway. Hence, feedback from downstream visual cortical areas to V1 for better decoding (recognition), through analysis-by-synthesis, should query for additional information and be mainly directed at the foveal region. Accordingly, non-foveal vision is not only poorer in spatial resolution, but also more susceptible to many illusions.</p></div>

The application of super-resolution optical microscopy to investigating synaptic structures has revealed a highly heterogeneous and variable intra-synaptic organization. Dense subsynaptic protein assemblies named subsynaptic domains or SSDs have been proposed as structural units that regulate the efficacy of neuronal transmission. However, an in-depth characterization of subsynaptic domains has been hampered by technical limitations of super-resolution microscopy of synapses, namely the stochasticity of the signals during the imaging procedures and the variability of the synaptic structures. Here, we synthetize the available evidence for the existence of subsynaptic domains at central synapses, as well as the possible functional relevance of SSDs. In particular, we discuss the possible regulation of co-transmission at mixed inhibitory synapses as a consequence of the subsynaptic distribution of glycine receptors (GlyRs) and GABAA receptors (GABAARs).

Methamphetamine abuse has become a serious public health problem. However, effective treatment for methamphetamine addiction still remains elusive, especially considering its high rate of relapse after treatment. A conditioned stimulus (CS) memory retrieval-extinction procedure has been demonstrated to decrease reinstatement of cocaine, heroin and alcohol seeking in rats, and to reduce cue-induced craving in heroin and nicotine addicts. The goal of the present study was to explore the effect of CS memory retrieval-extinction procedure on methamphetamine seeking in rats and the underlying mechanisms. We found that daily presenting extinction training within reconsolidation time window attenuated subsequent drug priming-induced reinstatement, spontaneous recovery, and renewal of methamphetamine seeking. We also found retrieval of methamphetamine-associated memories induced neuronal activation in basolateral amygdala (BLA), while presenting extinction within the time window of reconsolidation abolished the neuronal activation in BLA. These results indicated that the CS memory retrieval-extinction procedure could prevent reconsolidation of methamphetamine memory traces in BLA and subsequent methamphetamine craving and relapse.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00698">Propagation of Tau via Extracellular Vesicles</a></h4>

Extracellular vesicles (EVs), like exosomes, play a critical role in physiological processes, including synaptic transmission and nerve regeneration. However, exosomes in particular can also contribute to the development of neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease, and prion diseases. All of these disorders are characterized by protein aggregation and deposition in specific regions of the brain. Several lines of evidence indicate that protein in exosomes is released from affected neurons and propagated along neuroanatomically connected regions of the brain, thus spreading the neurodegenerative disease. Also, different cell types contribute to the progression of tauopathy, such as microglia.  Several groups have reported tau release via exosomes by cultured neurons or cells overexpressing human tau. Although the exact mechanisms underlying the propagation of protein aggregates are not fully understood, recent findings have implicated EVs in this process. The AD brain has two hallmarks, namely the presence of amyloid--containing plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, the latter formed by hyperphosphorylated tau protein. Both amyloid peptide and tau protein are present in specific exosomes. This review summarizes recent advances in our understanding of exosomes in the pathology of AD, with a special focus on tau protein.

Computer aided diagnosis systems based on brain imaging are an important tool to assist in the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, whose ultimate goal is the detection by automatic recognizing of patterns that characterize the disease. In recent times Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have proved to be amazingly useful for that task. The drawback, however, is that 3D brain images contain a huge amount of information that leads to complex CNN architectures. When these architectures become too complex, classification performances often degrades because the limitations of the training algorithm and overfitting. Thus, this paper proposes the use of isosurfaces as a way to reduce such amount of data while keeping the most relevant information. These isosurfaces are then used to implement a classification system which uses two of the most well-known CNN architectures, LeNet and AlexNet, to classify DaTScan images with an average accuracy of 95.1% and AUC=97%, obtaining comparable (slightly better) values to those obtained for most of the recently proposed systems. It can be concluded therefore that the computation of isosurfaces reduces the complexity of the inputs significantly, resulting in high classification accuracies with reduced computational burden.

Introduction: Striatal dopamine depletion disrupts basal ganglia function and causes Parkinson´s disease (PD). The pathophysiology of the dopamine-dependent relationship between basal ganglia signalling and motor control, however, is not fully understood. We obtained simultaneous recordings of local field potentials (LFP) from the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and electromyograms (EMG) in patients with PD to investigate the impact of dopaminergic state and movement on long-range beta functional connectivity between basal ganglia and lower motor neurons. 
Methods: 8 PD patients were investigated three months after implantation of a DBS-system capable of recording LFPs via chronically-implanted leads (Medtronic, ACTIVA PC + S®). We analysed STN spectral power and its coherence with EMG in the context of two different movement paradigms (tonic wrist extension versus alternating wrist extension and flexion) and the effect of L-Dopa intake using an unbiased data-driven approach to determine regions of interest (ROI). 
Results Two ROIs capturing prominent coherence within a grand average coherogram were identified. A trend of a dopamine effect was observed for the first ROI (50–150 ms after movement start) with higher STN-EMG coherence in medicated patients. Concerning the second ROI (300–500 ms after movement start), an interaction effect of L-Dopa medication and movement task was observed with higher coherence in the isometric contraction task compared to alternating movements in the medication ON state, a pattern which was reversed in L-Dopa OFF.
Discussion: L-Dopa medication may normalize functional connectivity between remote structures of the motor system with increased upper beta coherence reflecting a physiological restriction of the amount of information conveyed between remote structures. This may be necessary to maintain simple movements like isometric contraction. Our study adds dynamic properties to the complex interplay between STN spectral beta power and the nucleus’ functional connectivity to remote structures of the motor system as a function of movement and dopaminergic state. This may help to identify markers of neuronal activity relevant for more individualised programming of DBS therapy.

BACKGROUND: Destruction of the afferents by dorsal root entry zone (DREZ) surgery may be an effective treatment of intractable neuropathic pain, though it remains a high risk surgical intervention. Potential complications due to the lesioning of structures within the cervical spinal cord other than the DREZ can be minimized by accurate knowledge of the optimal insertion angle (i.e., the angle between the DREZ and the posterior median sulcus). The employed insertion angle has based on measurements between the DREZ and the posterior median sulcus on post-mortem transverse slices. However, new, more sophisticated imaging techniques are currently available and are thought to yield higher spatial resolution and more accurate images. 
OBEJCTIVE: This paper measures the angle between the DREZ and the posterior median sulcus on 11.7T post-mortem magnetic resonance images and compares these findings with polarized light imaging (PLI) microscopy images of the same specimens in order to quantify fiber orientation within the DREZ. 
METHODS: To visualize the anatomy of the cervical DREZ, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI), probabilistic tractography, and polarized light imaging (PLI)) were performed on 3 post-mortem human cervical spinal cords at level C5-C6. The MR data was used to measure the angle between the DREZ and the posterior median sulcus. MR images were complemented by probabilistic tractography results. Then, the orientation of fibers within the DREZ was quantified by use of PLI microscopy. 
RESULTS: Median angle between the DREZ and the posterior median sulcus, as measured on MR-images, was found to be 40.1° (ranging from 34.2-49.1°) and 39.8°  (ranging from 31.1-47.8°) in the left and right hemicord, respectively. Median fiber orientation within the DREZ, as quantified by PLI, was 28.5° (ranging from 12.0-44.3°) and 27.7° (ranging from 8.5-38.1°) in the left and right hemicord, respectively. 
CONCLUSION: Our study, which provides an improved understanding of the anatomy of the DREZ, the angle between the DREZ and the posterior median sulcus and the median fiber orientation within the DREZ, could contribute to safer DREZ-lesioning surgery to treat chronic neuropathic pain in the future.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00169">Cerebral Blood Flow in Community-Based Older Twins Is Moderately Heritable: An Arterial Spin Labeling Perfusion Imaging Study</a></h4>

Adequate cerebral blood flow (CBF) is necessary to maintain brain metabolism and function. Arterial spin labelling (ASL) is an emerging MRI technique offering a non-invasive and reliable quantification of CBF. The genetic basis of CBF has not been well documented, and one approach to investigate this is to examine its heritability. The current study aimed to examine the heritability of CBF using ASL data from a cohort of community-dwelling older twins (41 monozygotic and 25 dizygotic twin pairs; age range, 65-93 years; 56.4% female). Results showed that the cortex had higher CBF than subcortical grey matter (GM) regions, and CBF in the GM regions of the anterior cerebral artery (ACA) territory was lower than that of the middle (MCA) and posterior (PCA) cerebral arteries. After accounting for the effects of age, sex and scanner, moderate heritability was identified for global CBF (h2 = 0.611; 95% CI = 0.380-0.761), as well as for cortical and subcortical GM and the GM in the major arterial territories (h2 = 0.500-0.612). Strong genetic correlations were found between CBF in subcortical and cortical GM regions, as well as among the three arterial territories (ACA, MCA, PCA), suggesting a largely convergent genetic control for the CBF in brain GM. The moderate heritability of CBF warrants future investigations to uncover the genetic variants and genes that regulate CBF.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00166">Differential Associations Between Distinct Components of Cognitive Function and Mobility: Implications for Understanding Aging, Turning and Dual-Task Walking</a></h4>

Objective: Cognition and mobility are interrelated. However, this association can be impacted by the specific facets of cognition and mobility that are measured, and further by the different task conditions, single- versus dual-task walking, under which these associations are evaluated. Systematically studying the multiple facets of cognitive-mobility associations under both the task conditions is critical because both cognition and mobility change with age and pose significant risks associated with falls, morbidity, and disability. Methods: Using a cross-sectional, prospective study design, data from 124 healthy adults (mean age (SD) = 61.51 (11.90); mean education (SD) = 15.94 (2.18)) was collected. A comprehensive battery of cognitive tests was administered, and gait was assessed using a small, lightweight, three-axis accelerometer with a gyroscope. Analytical Plan: Data was transformed, and only relatively strong relationships survived after strict statistical criteria adjusting for multiple comparisons was applied. Spearman rho correlation coefficients were used to examine the matrix of correlations between the cognitive-motor variables while adjusting for age and gender. Results: Executive functions, processing speed, and language were associated with distinct facets of variability, pace, asymmetry, especially under the dual-task walking condition. Both turns and transitions were also associated with cognition during the Timed Up and Go task. Conclusion: Our results extend converging evidence for the involvement of executive functions and processing speed in specific aspects of mobility, along with the role of language. The study has important implications for aging in terms of both assessment and rehabilitation of cognition and gait as well as for the emerging dual-tasking theories and the role of the neural pathways involved in mobility.

Stroke patients often exhibit difficulties performing a cognitive task while walking, defined as a dual task (DT). Their prefrontal cortex (PFC) activity is higher in DT than in single task (ST). The effects of an increasing load on PFC activity during DT in subacute stroke patients remains unexplored. Our objective was to assess the effects of N-back tasks (low/high load) on cerebral activity, gait parameters and cognitive performances. Eleven subacute stroke patients (days post-stroke 45.8±31.6) participated in this study (71.4±10 yrs, BMI 26.7±4.8 kg.m-2, Barthel index 81.8±11.0). Patients completed a STwalk, and 4 conditions with 1-back (low load) and 2-back (high load): STlow, SThigh, DTlow and DThigh. Overground walking was performed at a comfortable pace and -N-back conditions were carried out verbally. Both gait (speed, stride variability) and cognitive (rate of correct answers) performances were recorded. Changes in PFC oxyhemoglobin (∆O2Hb) and deoxyhemoglobin (∆HHb) were measured by functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Results showed an increase of ∆O2Hb while walking, which was not augmented by cognitive loads in DT. Walking speed was reduced by low and high cognitive loads in DT compared to STwalk (P&lt;0.05), but was not different between DTlow and DThigh. Cognitive performances were negatively impacted by both walking (P&lt;0.05) and cognitive load (between ‘low’ and ‘high’, P&lt;0.001). These data highlight a “ceiling” effect in ∆O2Hb levels while walking, leaving no available resources for simultaneous cognitive tasks, during the early recovery period following stroke. In these patients, cognitive, but not motor, performances declined with a higher cognitive load.

Large-scale brain networks exhibit changes in functional connectivity during the aging process. Recent literature data suggests that Yoga and other contemplative practices may revert, at least in part, some of the aging effects in brain functional connectivity, including of the Default Mode Network (DMN). The aim of this cross-sectional investigation was to compare resting-state functional connectivity of the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and posterior cingulate cortex - precuneus (PCC-Precuneus) in long-term elderly Yoga practitioners and healthy paired Yoga-naïve controls. Two paired groups: yoga (Y-20 women, Hatha Yoga practitioners; minimum twice a week of practice frequency for at least 8 years) and control group (C-20 women, Yoga-naïve, matched by age, years of formal education, and physical activity) were evaluated for: Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL), and open-eyes resting-state fMRI - seed to voxel connectivity analysis (CONN toolbox 17.f) with pre-processing - realignment and unwarping, slice-timing correction, segmentation, normalization, outlier detection, and spatial filtering. Analysis included a priori regions of interest (ROI) of DMN main nodes – MPFC and PCC-Precuneus. There was no difference between groups for: age, years of formal education, MMSE, BDI and IADL. Yoga group had higher correlation between MPFC and right angular gyrus, compared to controls. Elderly women with at least 8 years of yoga practice presented greater intra-network anteroposterior brain functional connectivity of the default mode network. This finding may contribute for the understanding of the influences of Yoga practice for a healthier cognitive aging process.

Platelets are anucleate cells that circulate in blood and are essential components of the hemostatic system. During aging, platelet numbers decrease and their aggregation capacity is reduced. Platelet dysfunctions associated with aging can be linked to molecular alterations affecting several cellular systems that include cytoskeleton rearrangements, signal transduction, vesicular trafficking and protein degradation. Age platelets may adopt a phenotype characterized by robust secretion of extracellular vesicles that could in turn account for about 70-90% of blood circulating vesicles. Interestingly these extracellular vesicles are loaded with messenger RNAs and microRNAs that may have a profound impact on protein physiology at the systems level. Age platelet dysfunction is also associated with accumulation of reactive oxygen species. Thereby understanding the mechanisms of aging in platelets as well as their age-dependent dysfunctions may be of interest when evaluating the contribution of aging to the onset of age-dependent pathologies, such as those affecting the nervous system. In this review we summarize the findings that link platelet dysfunctions to neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s Disease, Parkinson’s Disease, Multiple Sclerosis, Huntington’s Disease and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. We discuss the role of platelets as drivers of protein dysfunctions observed in these pathologies, their association with aging and the potential clinical significance of platelets, and related miRNAs, as peripheral biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis of neurodegenerative diseases.

Abstract

Objective: the purpose of this study was to analyze quantitative sleep changes and their implication in subjective cognitive decline (SCD). Objective sleep pattern was investigated through actigraphy recorded at the baseline and at the follow-up after two years. The aim of the study was to examine specific sleep alterations in SCD. 

Background: sleep disorders are very common among average elderly adults and an altered sleep pattern is known to be a risk factor for future development of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and dementia. Recent studies have shown how sleep is objectively altered in average senior adults with Subjective Cognitive Decline (SCD), without any other significant change in cognition and behavior or brain structure. Considering that both SCD and disrupted sleep are risk factors for future MCI and dementia, with sleep only as a modifiable risk factor, further research is required to deeply investigate the interaction between sleep and SCD.

Methods:  among seventy community-dwelling elderly individuals who had been enrolled at baseline, thirty-five (64.6 5.6 y, 15M/20F) underwent a complete neuropsychological battery and one-week wrist actigraphy recording two years later during the follow-up stage.  Individuals were divided into two groups according to their Subjective Cognitive Decline Questionnaire (SCD-Q) score. Sleep hours, sleep efficiency and onset latency, napping and time awake after sleep onset (WASO) were collected. All individuals underwent structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) examination to exclude brain disorders. Data collection was performed at baseline and after two years at the follow-up phase.

Results:  a significantly different night sleep time between the two groups was observed: SCD showed a lower total sleep time (TST) than non-SCD subjects. Moreover, a total time spent in bed (TIB) was significantly lower in SCD subjects over two years of observation.

Conclusions:  objective changes over time of the sleep pattern, specifically total time spent in bed and total sleep time, are present in SCD individuals. The results of the study show that sleep alterations are common in SCD and underline the clinical importance of screening in order to assess sleep alterations as well as improve sleep in average adults with SCD complaints.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Neuroimaging studies show that ventral face-selective regions, including the fusiform face area (FFA) and occipital face area (OFA), preferentially respond to faces presented in the contralateral visual field (VF). In the current study we measured the VF response of the face-selective posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS). Across 3 functional magnetic resonance imaging experiments, participants viewed face videos presented in different parts of the VF. Consistent with prior results, we observed a contralateral VF bias in bilateral FFA, right OFA (rOFA), and bilateral human motion-selective area MT+. Intriguingly, this contralateral VF bias was absent in the bilateral pSTS. We then delivered transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over right pSTS (rpSTS) and rOFA, while participants matched facial expressions in both hemifields. TMS delivered over the rpSTS disrupted performance in both hemifields, but TMS delivered over the rOFA disrupted performance in the contralateral hemifield only. These converging results demonstrate that the contralateral bias for faces observed in ventral face-selective areas is absent in the pSTS. This difference in VF response is consistent with face processing models proposing 2 functionally distinct pathways. It further suggests that these models should account for differences in interhemispheric connections between the face-selective areas across these 2 pathways.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Down syndrome (DS) is the most common liveborn autosomal chromosomal anomaly and is a major cause of developmental disability. Atypical brain development and the resulting intellectual disability originate during the fetal period. Perinatal interventions to correct such aberrant development are on the horizon in preclinical studies. However, we lack tools to sensitively measure aberrant structural brain development in living human fetuses with DS. In this study, we aimed to develop safe and precise neuroimaging measures to monitor fetal brain development in DS. We measured growth patterns of regional brain structures in 10 fetal brains with DS (29.1 ± 4.2, weeks of gestation, mean ± SD, range 21.7~35.1) and 12 control fetuses (25.2 ± 5.0, range 18.6~33.3) using regional volumetric analysis of fetal brain MRI. All cases with DS had confirmed karyotypes. We performed non-linear regression models to compare fitted regional growth curves between DS and controls. We found decreased growth trajectories of the cortical plate (<span style="font-style: italic;">P</span> = 0.033), the subcortical parenchyma (<span style="font-style: italic;">P</span> = 0.010), and the cerebellar hemispheres (<span style="font-style: italic;">P</span> &lt; 0.0001) in DS compared to controls.

How does the brain process natural versus drug rewards? Alhadeff et al. demonstrate that food and drugs signal from the periphery to the hypothalamus via distinct pathways. Furthermore, bidirectional and coordinated interactions between hypothalamic and dopamine circuits potentiate responses to rewards.

<p>by Da Zhou, Yue Luo, David Dingli, Arne Traulsen</p>

Many fast renewing tissues are characterized by a hierarchical cellular architecture, with tissue specific stem cells at the root of the cellular hierarchy, differentiating into a whole range of specialized cells. There is increasing evidence that tumors are structured in a very similar way, mirroring the hierarchical structure of the host tissue. In some tissues, differentiated cells can also revert to the stem cell phenotype, which increases the risk that mutant cells lead to long lasting clones in the tissue. However, it is unclear under which circumstances de-differentiating cells will invade a tissue. To address this, we developed mathematical models to investigate how de-differentiation is selected as an adaptive mechanism in the context of cellular hierarchies. We derive thresholds for which de-differentiation is expected to emerge, and it is shown that the selection of de-differentiation is a result of the combination of the properties of cellular hierarchy and de-differentiation patterns. Our results suggest that de-differentiation is most likely to be favored provided stem cells having the largest effective self-renewal rate. Moreover, jumpwise de-differentiation provides a wider range of favorable conditions than stepwise de-differentiation. Finally, the effect of de-differentiation on the redistribution of self-renewal and differentiation probabilities also greatly influences the selection for de-differentiation.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/L8i-4SZ3AJQ" width="1" />

<p>by Albert Tian Chen, Alexander Franks, Nikolai Slavov</p>

Analysis by liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) can identify and quantify thousands of proteins in microgram-level samples, such as those comprised of thousands of cells. This process, however, remains challenging for smaller samples, such as the proteomes of single mammalian cells, because reduced protein levels reduce the number of confidently sequenced peptides. To alleviate this reduction, we developed Data-driven Alignment of Retention Times for IDentification (DART-ID). DART-ID implements principled Bayesian frameworks for global retention time (RT) alignment and for incorporating RT estimates towards improved confidence estimates of peptide-spectrum-matches. When applied to bulk or to single-cell samples, DART-ID increased the number of data points by 30–50% at 1% FDR, and thus decreased missing data. Benchmarks indicate excellent quantification of peptides upgraded by DART-ID and support their utility for quantitative analysis, such as identifying cell types and cell-type specific proteins. The additional datapoints provided by DART-ID boost the statistical power and double the number of proteins identified as differentially abundant in monocytes and T-cells. DART-ID can be applied to diverse experimental designs and is freely available at http://dart-id.slavovlab.net.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/pO3US3FVnoc" width="1" />

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Aging is the highest risk factor for Parkinson disease (PD). Under physiological conditions, spermidine and spermine experimentally enhance longevity via autophagy induction. Accordingly, we evaluated the ability of each polyamine metabolite to act as an age‐related, diagnostic, and severity‐associated PD biomarker.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Comprehensive metabolome analysis of plasma was performed in Cohort A (controls, n = 45; PD, n = 145), followed by analysis of 7 polyamine metabolites in Cohort B (controls, n = 49; PD, n = 186; progressive supranuclear palsy, n = 19; Alzheimer disease, n = 23). Furthermore, 20 patients with PD who were successively examined within Cohort B were studied using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Association of each polyamine metabolite with disease severity was assessed according to Hoehn and Yahr stage (H&amp;Y) and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor section (UPDRS‐III). Additionally, the autophagy induction ability of each polyamine metabolite was examined in vitro in various cell lines.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In Cohort A, <i>N</i>8‐acetylspermidine and <i>N</i>‐acetylputrescine levels were significantly and mildly elevated in PD, respectively. In Cohort B, spermine levels and spermine/spermidine ratio were significantly reduced in PD, concomitant with hyperacetylation. Furthermore, <i>N</i>1,<i>N</i>8‐diacetylspermidine levels had the highest diagnostic value, and correlated with H&amp;Y, UPDRS‐III, and axonal degeneration quantified by DTI. The spermine/spermidine ratio in controls declined with age, but was consistently suppressed in PD. Among polyamine metabolites, spermine was the strongest autophagy inducer, especially in SH‐SY5Y cells. No significant genetic variations in 5 genes encoding enzymes associated with spermine/spermidine metabolism were detected compared with controls.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Spermine synthesis and <i>N</i>1,<i>N</i>8‐diacetylspermidine may respectively be useful diagnostic and severity‐associated biomarkers for PD. ANN NEUROL 2019</p>

ABSTRACT<p>Sex differences in human cognitive performance are well characterized. However, the neural correlates of these differences remain elusive. This issue may be clarified using nonhuman primates, for which sociocultural influences are minimized. We used the marmoset (<i>Callithrix jacchus</i>) to investigate sex differences in two aspects of executive function: Reversal Learning and Intradimensional/Extradimensional (ID/ED) set shifting. Stress reactivity and motor function were also assessed. In agreement with human literature, females needed more trials than males to acquire the reversals. No sex differences in ED set shifting or motivational measures were observed. The findings suggest enhanced habit formation in females, perhaps due to striatal estrogenic effects. Both sexes showed increased urinary cortisol during social separation stressor, but females showed an earlier increase in cortisol and a greater increase in agitated locomotion, possibly indicating enhanced stress reactivity. Independent of sex, basal cortisol predicted cognitive performance. No sex differences were found in motor performance. Associations between brain networks and reversal learning performance were investigated using resting state fMRI. Resting state functional connectivity analyses revealed sex differences in cognitive networks, with differences in overall neural network metrics and specific regions, including the prefrontal cortex, caudate, putamen, and nucleus accumbens. Correlations between cognitive flexibility and neural connectivity indicate that sex differences in cognitive flexibility are related to sex-dependent patterns of resting brain networks. Overall, our findings reveal sex differences in reversal learning, brain networks, and their relationship in the marmoset, positioning this species as an excellent model to investigate the biological basis of cognitive sex differences.</p><p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We examined sex differences in multiple outcomes (cognition, motor function, stress reactivity and resting state functional connectivity) in middle-aged marmosets. We found that female marmosets had poorer reversal learning relative to males. Resting state functional connectivity analyses revealed substantial sex differences in cognitive networks, with differences in both overall neural network metrics and specific regions, including the prefrontal cortex, caudate, putamen, and nucleus accumbens. Sex-dependent correlations between reversal learning and neural connectivity measures indicate that the sex difference in cognitive performance is related to sex-dependent patterns of resting brain networks. Although these data are correlational and cannot determine causal effects, they are consistent with human resting state data, supporting the idea that cognitive sex differences have identifiable intrinsic neural correlates.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25530?af=R">Genetic risk for alzheimer disease is distinct from genetic risk for amyloid deposition</a></h4>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and is responsible for a huge and growing health care burden in the developed and developing world. The polygenic risk score (PRS) approach has shown 75 to 84% prediction accuracy of identifying individuals with AD risk.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In this study, we tested the prediction accuracy of AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and amyloid deposition risks with PRS, including and excluding <i>APOE</i> genotypes in a large publicly available dataset with extensive phenotypic data, the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohort. Among MCI individuals with amyloid‐positive status, we examined PRS prediction accuracy in those who converted to AD. In addition, we divided polygenic risk score by biological pathways and tested them independently for distinguishing between AD, MCI, and amyloid deposition.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We found that AD and MCI are predicted by both <i>APOE</i> genotype and PRS (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.82% and 68%, respectively). Amyloid deposition is predicted by <i>APOE</i> only (AUC = 79%). Further progression to AD of individuals with MCI and amyloid‐positive status is predicted by PRS over and above <i>APOE</i> (AUC = 67%). In pathway‐specific PRS analyses, the protein–lipid complex has the strongest association with AD and amyloid deposition even when genes in the <i>APOE</i> region were removed (<i>p</i> = 0.0055 and <i>p</i> = 0.0079, respectively).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The results showed different pattern of <i>APOE</i> contribution in PRS risk predictions of AD/MCI and amyloid deposition. Our study suggests that <i>APOE</i> mostly contributes to amyloid accumulation and the PRS affects risk of further conversion to AD. ANN NEUROL 2019</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To identify disease‐causing variants in autosomal recessive axonal polyneuropathy with optic atrophy and provide targeted replacement therapy.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed genome‐wide sequencing, homozygosity mapping, and segregation analysis for novel disease‐causing gene discovery. We used circular dichroism to show secondary structure changes and isothermal titration calorimetry to investigate the impact of variants on adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding. Pathogenicity was further supported by enzymatic assays and mass spectroscopy on recombinant protein, patient‐derived fibroblasts, plasma, and erythrocytes. Response to supplementation was measured with clinical validated rating scales, electrophysiology, and biochemical quantification.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified biallelic mutations in <i>PDXK</i> in 5 individuals from 2 unrelated families with primary axonal polyneuropathy and optic atrophy. The natural history of this disorder suggests that untreated, affected individuals become wheelchair‐bound and blind. We identified conformational rearrangement in the mutant enzyme around the ATP‐binding pocket. Low PDXK ATP binding resulted in decreased erythrocyte PDXK activity and low pyridoxal 5′‐phosphate (PLP) concentrations. We rescued the clinical and biochemical profile with PLP supplementation in 1 family, improvement in power, pain, and fatigue contributing to patients regaining their ability to walk independently during the first year of PLP normalization.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We show that mutations in <i>PDXK</i> cause autosomal recessive axonal peripheral polyneuropathy leading to disease via reduced PDXK enzymatic activity and low PLP. We show that the biochemical profile can be rescued with PLP supplementation associated with clinical improvement. As B<sub>6</sub> is a cofactor in diverse essential biological pathways, our findings may have direct implications for neuropathies of unknown etiology characterized by reduced PLP levels.

<p>Distinct clinical syndromes have been associated with pathogenic <i>MT‐ATP6</i> variants. In this cohort study, we identified 125 individuals (60 families) including 88 clinically affected individuals and 37 asymptomatic carriers. Thirty‐one individuals presented with Leigh syndrome and 7 with neuropathy ataxia retinitis pigmentosa. The remaining 50 patients presented with variable nonsyndromic features including ataxia, neuropathy, and learning disability. We confirmed maternal inheritance in 39 families and demonstrated that tissue segregation patterns and phenotypic threshold are variant dependent. Our findings suggest that <i>MT‐ATP6</i>–related mitochondrial DNA disease is best conceptualized as a mitochondrial disease spectrum disorder and should be routinely included in genetic ataxia and neuropathy gene panels.

The current review summarizes the pathobiology of nerve growth factor and its cognate receptors during the progression of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Both protein and transcript data indicate that cholinotrophic neuronal dysfunction is related to an imbalance between TrkA-mediated survival signaling and proNGF/p75NTR-mediated pro-apoptotic signaling, which may be related to alteration in the metabolism of NGF. Data indicate a spatiotemporal pattern of degeneration related to the evolution of tau pathology within cholinotrophic neuronal subgroups located within the nucleus basalis of Meynert (nbM). Despite these degenerative events the cholinotrophic system is capable of cellular resilience and/or plasticity during the prodromal (and later stages of the disease. In addition to neurotrophin dysfunction, studies indicate alterations nuclear epigenetic proteins occur within cholinotrophic nbM neurons during the progression of AD, suggesting a mechanism that may underlie changes in transcript expression. Findings suggest that postmortem intraventricular or premortem CSF levels of proNGF mark the onset of MCI and the transition to AD suggesting this proneurotrophin to be a potential biomarker for the progression of MCI. Novel therapeutics to treat NGF dysfunction included NGF gene therapy and the development of small molecule agonists for the high affinity TrkA survival receptor and antagonists against the low affinity p75NTR death receptor for the treatment of AD.

As a neurodevelopmental disorder with serious lifelong consequences, autism has received considerable attention from neuroscientists and geneticists. We present a hypothesis of mechanisms plausibly affected during brain development in autism, based on neural pathways that are associated with social behavior and connect the prefrontal cortex (PFC) to the basal ganglia (BG). We consider failure of social approach in autism as a special case of imbalance in the fundamental dichotomy between behavioral approach and avoidance.

The blood–brain barrier (BBB) is an evolutionarily conserved, structural, and functional separation between circulating blood and the central nervous system (CNS). By controlling permeability into and out of the nervous system, the BBB has a critical role in the precise regulation of neural processes. Here, we review recent studies demonstrating that permeability at the BBB is dynamically controlled by circadian rhythms and sleep. An endogenous circadian rhythm in the BBB controls transporter function, regulating permeability across the BBB.

Abstract<p>During early postnatal life, speed up of signal propagation through many central and peripheral neurons has been associated with an increase in axon diameter or/and myelination. Especially in unmyelinated axons postnatal adjustments of axonal membrane conductances is potentially a third mechanism but solid evidence is lacking. Here we show that axonal action potential conduction velocity in the <i>Drosophila</i> giant fiber interneuron (GF), that is required for fast long distance signal conduction through the escape circuit, is increased by 80% during the first day of adult life. Genetic manipulations indicate that this postnatal increase in action potential conduction velocity in the unmyelinated GF axon is likely owed to adjustments of ion channel expression or properties rather than axon diameter increases. Specifically, targeted RNAi knockdown of either Para fast voltage-gated sodium, Shaker potassium (<i>Kv1</i> homologue), or surprisingly, L-type like calcium channels counteracts postnatal increases in GF axonal conduction velocity. By contrast, the calcium-dependent potassium channel Slowpoke (BK) is not essential for postnatal speeding, though it also significantly increases conduction velocity. Therefore, we identified multiple ion channels that function to support fast axonal action potential conduction velocity, but only a subset of these are regulated during early postnatal life to maximize conduction velocity. Despite its large diameter (~ 7µm) and postnatal regulation of multiple ionic conductances, mature GF axonal conduction velocity is still 20-60 times slower than that of vertebrate Aβ sensory axons and α motoneurons, thus unraveling the limits of long range information transfer speed through invertebrate circuits.</p><p><b>Significance statement</b> An effective mechanism to increase information processing speed through neural circuits is enhancing plasma membrane insulation through optimizing myelination, a means that cannot be capitalized on un-myelinated invertebrate axons. We identify postnatal adjustments of the expression levels of fast sodium, Shaker potassium, and L-type calcium channels as a mechanism to almost double axonal conduction velocity in the <i>Drosophila</i> giant fiber axon, the core component for long range information transfer through a neural circuit optimized for fast escape responses. However, despite the regulation of multiple ion channels, mature giant fiber axonal conduction velocity still lacks magnitudes of order behind that of myelinated vertebrate fibers, thus hinting to long distance information transfer as a size-constrain in the evolution of invertebrate circuits.</p>

Nerve injuries are a common clinical problem and cause inconvenience in daily life. It is of great importance to get a full understanding of the biological processes and molecular mechanisms underlying nerve injury to find and target specific molecules in nerve regeneration. Numerous studies have shown that noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) participate in diverse biological processes and diseases. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and circular RNAs (circRNAs) are two major groups of ncRNAs, which attract growing attention. The expression of lncRNAs and circRNAs are altered following nerve injury and are associated with nerve regeneration. This review will give a brief introduction of the origins, characteristics and classifications of lncRNAs and circRNAs. We then summarize the current studies on lncRNAs and circRNAs following peripheral nerve injury and spinal cord injury. Typical lncRNAs and circRNAs are introduced to illustrate the diverse molecular mechanisms. In addition, we also discuss some issues to be addressed in future investigations on lncRNAs and circRNAs.

Lithium has been used for decades to treat Bipolar Disorder. Some of its therapeutic benefits may be through inhibition of Glycogen Synthase Kinase (GSK)-3. Enhanced GSK3 activity associates with development of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), therefore lithium is a currently used therapeutic with potential to be repurposed for prevention of Dementia. An important step towards a clinical trial for AD prevention using lithium is to establish the dose of lithium that blocks GSK3 in Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), a high-risk condition for progression to AD. We investigated volunteer recruitment, retention and tolerance in this population, and assessed biomarkers of GSK3 in MCI compared to control and after lithium treatment.
Recruitment was close to target, with higher than anticipated interest. Drop out was not related to lithium blood concentration. Indeed, 33% of the withdrawals were in the first week of very low dose lithium. Most made it through to the highest dose of lithium with no adverse events. We analysed 18 potential biomarkers of GSK3 biology in rat PBMCs, but only 4 of these gave a robust reproducible baseline signal. The only biomarker that was modified by acute lithium injection in the rat was the inhibitory phosphorylation of Ser9 of GSK3beta (enhanced in PBMCs) and this associated with reduced activity of GSK3beta. In contrast to the rat PBMC preparations the protein quality of the human PBMC preparations was extremely variable. There was no difference between GSK3 biomarkers in MCI and control PBMC preparations and no significant effect of chronic lithium on the robust GSK3 biomarkers, indicating that the dose reached may not be sufficient to modify these markers. 
In summary, the high interest from the MCI population, and the lack of any adverse events, suggest that it would be relatively straightforward and safe to recruit to a larger clinical trial within this dosing regimen. However, it is clear that we will need an improved PBMC isolation process along with more robust, sensitive and validated biomarkers of GSK3 function, in order to use GSK3 pathway regulation in human PBMC preparations as a biomarker of GSK3 inhibitor efficacy, within a clinical trial setting.

Recent research has shown that event-related brain potentials (ERPs) recorded while participants view lists of different consumer goods can be modulated by their preferences towards these products. However, it remains largely unknown whether ERP activity specific to a single consumer item can be informative about whether or not this item will be preferred in a shopping context. In this study, we examined whether single-item ERPs could reliably predict consumer preferences towards specific consumer goods. We recorded scalp EEG from 40 participants while they were viewing pictures of consumer goods and we subsequently asked them to indicate their preferences for each of these items. Replicating previous results, we found that ERP activity averaged over the six most preferred products was significantly differentiated from ERP activity averaged across the six least preferred products for three ERP components: The N200, the late positive potential (LPP) and positive slow waves (PSW). We also found that using single-item ERPs to infer behavioural preferences about specific consumer goods led to an overall accuracy of 71%, although this figure varied according to which ERPs were targeted. Later positivities such as the late posterior positivity (LPP) and positive slow waves (PSW) yielded relatively higher predictive accuracy rates than the frontal N200.  Our results suggest that ERPs related to single consumer items can be relatively accurate predictors of behavioural preferences depending on which type of ERP effects are chosen by the researcher, and ultimately on the level of prediction errors that users choose to tolerate.

Brand extension is a marketing strategy leveraging well-established brand to promote new offerings provided as goods or service. The previous neurophysiological studies on goods-to-goods brand extension have proposed that categorization and semantic memory processes are involved in brand extension evaluation. However, it is unknown whether these same processes also underlie service-to-service brand extension. The present study, therefore, aims to investigate neural processes in consumers underlying their judgement of service-to-service brand extension. Specifically, we investigated human electroencephalographic responses to extended services that were commonly considered to fit well or badly with parent brand among consumers. For this purpose, we proposed a new stimulus grouping method to find commonly acceptable or unacceptable service extensions. In the experiment, participants reported the acceptability of fifty-six brand extension pairs, consisting of parent brand name (S1) and extended service name (S2). From individual acceptability responses, we assigned each pair to one of the three fit levels: high- (i.e. highly acceptable), low-, and mid-fit. Next, we selected stimuli that received high/low-fit evaluations from a majority of participants (i.e. &gt; 85%) and assigned them to a high/low population-fit group. A comparison of event-related potentials (ERPs) between population-fit groups through a paired t-test showed significant differences in the fronto-central N2 and fronto-parietal P300 amplitudes. We further evaluated inter-subject variability of these ERP components by a decoding analysis that classified N2 and/or P300 amplitudes into a high, or low population-fit class using a support vector machine. Leave-one-subject-out validation revealed classification accuracy of 60.35% with N2 amplitudes, 78.95 % with P300 and 73.68% with both, indicating a relatively high inter-subject variability of N2 but low for P300. This validation showed that fronto-parietal P300 reflected neural processes more consistent across subjects in service-to-service brand extension. We further observed that the left frontal P300 amplitude was increased as fit-level increased across stimuli, indicating a semantic retrieval process to evaluate a semantic link between S1 and S2. Parietal P300 showed a higher amplitude in the high population-fit group, reflecting a similarity-based categorization process. In sum, our results suggest that service-to-service brand extension evaluation may share similar neural processes with goods-to-goods brand extension.

In Huntington’s disease (HD), while the ubiquitously expressed mutant Huntingtin (mtHTT) protein primarily compromises striatal and cortical neurons, glia also undergo disease-contributing alterations. Existing HD models using human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have not extensively characterized the role of mtHTT in patient-derived astrocytes. Here physiologically mature astrocytes are generated from HD patient iPSCs. These human astrocytes exhibit hallmark HD phenotypes that occur in mouse models, including impaired inwards rectifying K+ currents, lengthened spontaneous Ca2+ waves and reduced cell membrane capacitance. HD astrocytes in co-culture provided reduced support for the maturation of iPSC-derived neurons. In addition, neurons exposed to chronic glutamate stimulation are not protected by HD astrocytes. This iPSC-based HD model demonstrates the critical effects of mtHTT on human astrocytes, which not only broadens the understanding of disease susceptibility beyond cortical and striatal neurons but also increases potential drug targets.

Animal behavior is the final and integrated output of brain activity. Thus, recording and analyzing behavior is critical to understand the underlying brain function. While recording animal behavior has become easier than ever with the development of compact and inexpensive devices, detailed behavioral data analysis requires sufficient previous knowledge and/or high content data such as video images of animal postures, which makes it difficult for most of the animal behavioral data to be efficiently analyzed to understand brain function. Here, we report a versatile method using a hybrid supervised/unsupervised machine learning approach to efficiently estimate behavioral states and to extract important behavioral features only from low-content animal trajectory data. As proof of principle experiments, we analyzed trajectory data of worms, fruit flies, rats, and bats in the laboratories, and penguins and flying seabirds in the wild, which were recorded with various methods and span a wide range of spatiotemporal scales—from mm to 1000 km in space and from sub-seconds to days in time. We estimated several states during behavior and comprehensively extracted characteristic features from a behavioral state and/or a specific experimental condition. Physiological and genetic experiments in worms revealed that the extracted behavioral features reflected specific neural or gene activities. Thus, our method provides a versatile and unbiased way to extract behavioral features from simple trajectory data to understand brain function.

K-complexes identification is a challenging task in sleep research. The detection of k-complexes in electroencephalogram (EEG) signals based on visual inspection is time-consuming, prone to errors, and requires well-trained knowledge. Many existing methods for k-complexes detection rely mainly on analysing EEG signals in time and frequency domains. In this study, an efficient method is proposed to detect k-complexes from EEG signals based on the fractal dimension (FD) of time-frequency (T-F) images coupled with undirected graph features. Firstly, the EEG signal is partitioned into smaller segments using a sliding window technique. Each EEG segment is passed through a spectrogram of short time Fourier transform (STFT) to obtain T-F images. Secondly, the box-counting method is applied to each T-F image to estimate and discover the FDs in EEG signals. A vector of FD features are extracted from each T-F image and then mapped into an undirected graph.  The structural properties of the graphs are used as the representative features of the original EEG signals for the input of a least square support vector machine (LS-SVM) classifier. Key graphic features are extracted from the undirected graphs. The extracted graph features are forwarded to the LS-SVM for classification. To investigate the classification ability of the proposed feature extraction combined with the LS-SVM classifier, the extracted features are also forwarded to a k-means classifier for comparison. The proposed method is compared with several existing k-complexes detection methods in which the same datasets were used. The findings of this study shows that the proposed method yields better classification results than other existing methods in the literature. An average accuracy of 97% for the detection of the k-complexes is obtained using the proposed method. The proposed method could lead to an efficient tool for the scoring of automatic sleep stages which could be useful for doctors and neurologists in the diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders and for sleep research

Indentifying lateralization of bilateral temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is a challenging issue, scalp electroencephalography (EEG) and routine band electrocorticography (ECoG) fail to reveal the epileptogenic focus for further temporal lobectomy treatment. HFOs can be utilized as a biomarker for lateralizing the onset zone in suspected bitemporal epilepsy. Except subjective vision detect the HFOs, objective verification should be performed to raising the accuracy. In present research, we prospectively studied 10 patients with refractory temporal seizures and underwent electrocorticography (ECoG) with wide-band frequency amplifiers (2048Hz), all patients had a Class I outcome after temporal resection. Pre- and ictal HFOs will be analyzed by wavelet transform (WT) and Granger causality (GC) for objectively verifying lateralization of seizure onset zone (SOZ). WT analysis showed ictal HFOs in 10 patients mainly covered from 80Hz to 115 Hz (average, 92.59 ± 10.23Hz ), and there was distinct band-pass boundary between pre-ictal HFOs and ictal HFOs. GC analysis showed 5 patients (2, 4, 5, 6, 7), no matter pre-ictal or ictal state, had highest GC degree in SOZ itself. The remaining patients (1, 3, 8, 9, 10) had highest GC degree in SOZ with its adjacent regions in pre-ictal and ictal stage. GC analysis further confirmed the result of WT, and suggested HFOs is initiated and propagated in local brain region mainly, afterwards, transmitting to adjacent brain regions. These results indicated that combination of WT and GC analysis significantly contribute to accurate lateralizing patients with suspected bitemporal epilepsy.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2019.00041">A Temporal Signal-Processing Circuit Based on Spiking Neuron and Synaptic Learning</a></h4>

Time is a continuous, homogeneous, one-way and independent signal that cannot be modified by human will. Nearly 2,500 ago, Aristotle contended that, “time is the most unknown of all unknown things.” However, both humans and other animals have the ability to perceive time, and it is extremely easy to reproduce the time interval between two consecutive events. This ability to sense time is the basis of many normal cognitive activities, such as listening, speaking, and motion control. Although we constantly use our ability to perceive time, we do not know how our brain processes it. At present, time processing is generally divided into three categories: millisecond scale processing, second scale processing, and circadian rhythms. Different time processing scales correspond to different time processing mechanisms. The millisecond-scale processing range we have studied has a great effect on human perception and motion processing. This paper presents a model that uses spike neuron to construct a complete circuit for temporal processing. By combining the time-adaptive drift-diffusion model (TDDMs) with the transmission of impulse information between neurons, this new model is able to successfully reproduce the synchronization-continuation tapping task (SCT) experiments results. We also discovered that the neurons we used exhibited some of the firing properties of the time-related neurons detected by electrophysiological experiments. Therefore we believe that our model is closer to the neural circuit in the biological brain and can explain some of the phenomena in the temporal perception process.

The aim of this review is to summarize the effect of human intestinal microbiome on cognitive impairments and to focus primarily on the impact of diet and eating habits on learning processes. Better understanding of the microbiome could revolutionize the possibilities of therapy for many diseases. The authors performed a literature review of available studies on the research topic describing influence of human microbiome and diet on cognitive impairment or learning processes found in the world’s acknowledged databases Web of Science, PubMed, Springer, and Scopus. The digestive tube is populated by billions of living microorganisms including viruses, bacteria, protozoa, helminths, and microscopic fungi. In adulthood, under physiological conditions, the intestinal microbiome appears to be relatively steady. However, it is not true that it would not be influenced, both in the positive sense of the word and in the negative one. The basic pillars that maintain a steady microbiome are genetics, lifestyle, diet and eating habits, geography, and age. It is reported that the gastrointestinal tract and the brain communicate with each other through several pathways and one can speak about gut-brain axis. New evidence is published every year about the association of intestinal dysbiosis and neurological/psychiatric diseases. On the other hand, specific diets and eating habits can have positive effect on a balanced microbiota composition and thus contribute to the enhancement of cognitive functions, which are important for any learning process.

Exploratory behavior and responsiveness to novelty play an important role in maintaining cognitive function in older adults. Inferences about age- or disease-related differences in neural and behavioral responses to novelty are most often based on results from single experimental testing sessions. There has been very limited research on whether such findings represent stable characteristics of populations studied, which is essential if investigators are to determine the result of interventions aimed at promoting exploratory behaviors or draw appropriate conclusions about differences in the processing of novelty across diverse clinical groups. The goal of the current study was to investigate the short-term test-retest reliability of event-related potential (ERP) and behavioral responses to novel stimuli in cognitively normal older adults. ERPs and viewing durations were recorded in 70 healthy older adults participating in a subject-controlled visual novelty oddball task during two sessions occurring seven weeks apart. Mean midline P3 amplitude and latency, mean midline amplitude during successive 50ms intervals, temporospatial factors derived from principal component analysis, and viewing duration in response to novel stimuli were measured during each session.  ANOVAs revealed no reliable differences in the value of any measurements between time 1 and 2. Intraclass correlations (ICCs) between time 1 and 2 were excellent for mean P3 amplitude (ICC = .86), the temporospatial factors consistent with the P3 components (ICC of .88 and .76 respectively) and viewing duration of novel stimuli (ICC=.81). Reliability was only fair for P3 peak latency (ICC=.56). Successive 50ms mean amplitude measures from 100-1000ms yielded fair to excellent reliabilities, and all but one of the 12 temporospatial factors identified demonstrated ICCs in the good to excellent range. We conclude that older adults demonstrate substantial stability in ERP and behavioral responses to novel visual stimuli over a seven-week period. These results suggest that older adults may have a characteristic way of processing novelty that appears resistant to transient changes in their environment or internal states, which can be indexed during a single testing session. The establishment of reliable measures of novelty processing will allow investigators to determine whether proposed interventions have an impact on this important aspect of behavior.

Introduction: Tactile sensitivity is impaired in older adults, which contributes to the loss of manual dexterity and mobility function. The reliability of classical psychophysical tests, such as two-point gap discrimination, has been questioned. Here we tested a new method to determine tactile acuity during dynamic touch, which is more functional than static touch. The aim was to validate a method providing a high level of discrimination of tactile acuity in the elderly.
Methods: We tested the ability of subjects to evaluating the distance between bands printed on poly-methyl-methacrylate sheets. Pairs of sheets were compared in two groups of participants aged from 60 to 74 years; the test group was required to apply a cosmetic foam with an active ingredient on both their hands twice a day for one month, the control group had an identical task, but used the same cosmetic foam without any active ingredient. The tests were run in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. 
Results: The tactile discrimination threshold decreased by 83 µm after one month of cosmetic application in the group using the active ingredient while it was unchanged in the control group. 
Discussion: The test presented here provided highly accurate results and should be useful to determine tactile performance. It allows the monitoring of tactile rehabilitation and/or skin treatments used to restore tactile acuity in the elderly.

Cross-sectional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies reported significant associations between gray matter (GM) density changes in various limbic and neocortical areas and worst cognitive performances in elderly controls. Longitudinal studies in this field remain scarce and led to conflicting data. We report a clinico-radiological investigation of 380 cognitively preserved individuals who undergo neuropsychological assessment at baseline and after 18 months. All cases were assessed using a continuous cognitive score taking into account the global evolution of neuropsychological performances. The vast majority of Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) 29 and 30 cases showed equal or worst performance at follow-up due to a ceiling effect. GM densities, white matter hyperintensities and arterial spin labeling (ASL) values were assessed in the hippocampus, amygdala, mesial temporal and parietal cortex at inclusion using 3 Tesla MRI Scans. Florbetapir positron emission tomography (PET) amyloid was available in a representative subsample of 64 cases. Regional amyloid uptake ratios (SUVr), mean cortical SUVr values (mcSUVr) and corresponding z-scores were calculated. Linear regression models were built to explore the association between the continuous cognitive score and imaging variables. The presence of an APOE-ε4 allele was negatively related to the continuous cognitive score. Among the areas studied, significant associations were found between GM densities in the hippocampus and amygdala but not mesial temporal and parietal areas and continuous cognitive score. Neither ASL values, Fazekas score nor mean and regional PET amyloid load were related to the cognitive score. In multivariate models, the presence of APOE-ε4 allele and GM densities in the hippocampus and amygdala were independently associated with worst cognitive evolution at follow-up. Our data support the idea that early GM damage in the hippocampus and amygdala occur long before the emergence of the very first signs of cognitive failure in brain aging.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: The ability to adapt gait when negotiating unexpected hazards is crucial to maintain stability and avoid falling. This study investigated cognitive, physical and psychological factors associated with gait adaptability required for obstacle and stepping target negotiation in people with Parkinson’s disease (PD).
METHODS: Fifty-four people with PD were instructed to either (a) avoid an obstacle at usual step distance or (b) step onto a target at either a short or long step distance projected on a walkway two heel strikes ahead and then continue walking. Participants also completed clinical (Hoehn and Yahr rating scale; Movement Disorders Society version of the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale motor section [MDS-UPDRS-III]), cognitive (simple reaction time, Trail Making and Stroop stepping [difference between incongruent and standard choice stepping reaction time] tests), physical (hip abductor muscle power and reactive balance [pull test from the MDS-UPDRS-III]) and psychological (Fall Efficacy Scale–International) assessments.
RESULTS: Discriminant function analysis revealed Stroop stepping test (inhibitory control) performance was the best predictor of stepping errors across the gait adaptability test conditions. Poorer executive function (Trail Making test) and reactive balance predicted poorer stepping accuracy in the short target condition; poorer reactive balance predicted increased number of steps taken to approach the obstacle and the long target; and poorer executive function predicted obstacle avoidance. Weaker hip abductor muscle power, poorer reactive balance, slower reaction time, poorer executive function and higher concern about falling were significant predictors of shorter step length while negotiating the obstacle/targets.
CONCLUSIONS: Superior executive function, effective reactive balance and good muscle power were associated with successful gait adaptability. Executive function and reactive balance appear particularly important for precise foot placements; and cognitive capacity for step length adjustments for avoiding obstacles. These findings suggest that impaired inhibitory control contributes to stepping errors and may increase fall risk in people with PD. These findings help elucidate mechanisms for why people with PD fall and may facilitate fall risk assessments and fall prevention strategies for this group.

Previous studies investigating working memory performance in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) have mainly focused on the neural mechanisms of alterations in activation. To date, very few studies have investigated background network alterations in the working memory state. Therefore, the present study investigated the static and temporal dynamic changes in the background network in MCI patients during a working memory task.
A hybrid delayed-match-to-sample task was used to examine working memory performance in MCI patients. Functional magnetic resonance imaging data were collected and the marker of amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) was used to investigate alterations in the background network.
The present study demonstrated static and dynamic alterations of ALFF in MCI patients during working memory tasks, relative to the resting state. Traditional static analysis revealed that ALFF decreased in the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and left supplementary motor area for normal controls (NCs) in the working memory state. However, the same regions showed increased ALFF in MCI patients. Furthermore, relative to NCs, MCI patients demonstrated altered performance-related functional connectivity (FC) patterns, with the right VLPFC and right DLPFC as ROIs. In terms of temporal dynamic analysis, the present study found that in the working memory state dynamic ALFF of bilateral thalamus regions was increased in NCs but decreased in MCI patients. Additionally, MCI patients demonstrated altered performance-related coefficient of variation patterns; the regions in MCI patients were larger, and more widely distributed in the parietal and temporal lobes, relative to NCs.
This is the first study to examine static and temporal dynamic alterations of ALFF in the background network of MCI patients in working memory states. The results extend previous studies by providing a new perspective on the neural mechanisms of working memory deficits in MCI patients.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>A large amount of brain imaging research has focused on group studies delineating differences between males and females with respect to both cognitive performance as well as structural and functional brain organization. To supplement existing findings, the present study employed a machine learning approach to assess how accurately participants’ sex can be classified based on spatially specific resting state (RS) brain connectivity, using 2 samples from the Human Connectome Project (<span style="font-style: italic;">n</span>1 = 434, <span style="font-style: italic;">n</span>2 = 310) and 1 fully independent sample from the 1000BRAINS study (<span style="font-style: italic;">n</span> = 941). The classifier, which was trained on 1 sample and tested on the other 2, was able to reliably classify sex, both within sample and across independent samples, differing both with respect to imaging parameters and sample characteristics. Brain regions displaying highest sex classification accuracies were mainly located along the cingulate cortex, medial and lateral frontal cortex, temporoparietal regions, insula, and precuneus. These areas were stable across samples and match well with previously described sex differences in functional brain organization. While our data show a clear link between sex and regionally specific brain connectivity, they do not support a clear-cut dimorphism in functional brain organization that is driven by sex alone.</span>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p><i>C9orf72</i> hexanucleotide repeats expansions account for almost half of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) cases. Recent imaging studies in asymptomatic <i>C9orf72</i> carriers have demonstrated cerebral white (WM) and gray matter (GM) degeneration before the age of 40 years. The objective of this study was to characterize cervical spinal cord (SC) changes in asymptomatic <i>C9orf72</i> hexanucleotide carriers.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Seventy‐two asymptomatic individuals were enrolled in a prospective study of first‐degree relatives of ALS and FTD patients carrying the <i>c9orf72</i> hexanucleotide expansion. Forty of them carried the pathogenic mutation (C9<sup>+</sup>). Each subject underwent quantitative cervical cord imaging. Structural GM and WM metrics and diffusivity parameters were evaluated at baseline and 18 months later. Data were analyzed in C9<sup>+</sup> and C9<sup>−</sup> subgroups, and C9<sup>+</sup> subjects were further stratified by age.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>At baseline, significant WM atrophy was detected at each cervical vertebral level in C9<sup>+</sup> subjects older than 40 years without associated changes in GM and diffusion tensor imaging parameters. At 18‐month follow‐up, WM atrophy was accompanied by significant corticospinal tract (CST) fractional anisotropy (FA) reductions. Intriguingly, asymptomatic C9<sup>+</sup> subjects older than 40 years with family history of ALS (as opposed to FTD) also exhibited significant CST FA reduction at baseline.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Cervical SC imaging detects WM atrophy exclusively in C9<sup>+</sup> subjects older than 40 years, and progressive CST FA reductions can be identified on 18‐month follow‐up. Cervical SC magnetic resonance imaging readily captures presymptomatic pathological changes and disease propagation in <i>c9orf72</i>‐associated conditions. ANN NEUROL 2019</p>

In this review, we highlight the evidence that epigenetic modifications, specifically histone modifications, within key brain reward regions are correlated with addiction. We then discuss the emerging field of locus-specific neuroepigenetic editing, which is a promising method for determining the causal epigenetic molecular mechanisms that drive an addicted state. Such approaches will substantially increase the field’s ability to establish the precise epigenetic mechanisms underlying drug addiction, and could lead to novel treatments for addictive disorders.</p></div>

Spinocerebellar ataxia 3, also known as Machado-Joseph disease (SCA3/MJD), is a rare autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative disease caused by an abnormal expansion of CAG repeats in the ATXN3 gene. In the present study, we performed a global metabolomic analysis to identity pathogenic biochemical pathways and novel biomarkers implicated in SCA3 patients. Metabolic profiling of serum samples from 13 preclinical SCA3 patients, 13 symptomatic SCA3 patients, and 15 healthy controls were mapped using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry techniques. The symptomatic SCA3 patients showed a metabolic profile significantly distinct from those of the preclinical SCA3 patients and healthy controls. The principal differential metabolites were involved in the amino acid metabolism and fatty acid metabolism pathways. In addition, four candidate serum biomarkers, FFA 16:1 (palmitoleic acid), FFA 18:3 (linolenic acid), L-Proline and L-Tryptophan, were selected to discriminate between symptomatic SCA3 patients and healthy controls by receiver operator curve analysis with area under the curve of 0.979. Our study demonstrates that symptomatic SCA3 patients present distinct metabolic profiles with perturbed amino acid metabolism and fatty acid metabolism, and FFA 16:1, FFA 18:3, L-Proline and L-Tryptophan are identified as potential disease biomarkers.

PARK20, an early onset autosomal recessive parkinsonism is due to mutations in the phosphatidylinositol-phosphatase Synaptojanin 1 (Synj1).
We have recently shown that the early endosomal compartments are profoundly altered in PARK20 fibroblasts as well as the endosomal trafficking. Here, we report that PARK20 fibroblasts also display a drastic alteration of the architecture and function of the early secretory compartments. Our results show that the exit machinery from the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) and the ER-to-Golgi trafficking are markedly compromised in patient cells. As a consequence, PARK20 fibroblasts accumulate large amounts of cargo proteins within the ER, leading to the induction of ER stress. Interestingly, this stressful state is coupled to the activation of the PERK/eIF2α/ATF4/CHOP pathway of the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR). In addition, PARK20 fibroblasts reveal upregulation of oxidative stress markers and total ROS production with concomitant alteration of the morphology of the mitochondrial network. Interestingly, treatment of PARK20 cells with GSK2606414 (GSK), a specific inhibitor of PERK activity, restores the level of ROS, signalling a direct correlation between ER stress and the induction of oxidative stress in the PARK20 cells. 
All together, these findings suggest that dysfunction of early secretory pathway might contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease.

With the increasing use of functional brain network properties as markers of brain disorders, efficient visualisation and evaluation methods have become essential. Eigenvector centrality mapping (ECM) of functional MRI (fMRI) data enables the representation of per-node graph theoretical measures as brain maps. This paper studies the use of centrality dynamics for measuring group differences in imaging studies.

Imaging data were used from a publicly available imaging study, which included resting fMRI data.  After warping the images to a standard space and masking cortical regions, ECM were computed in a sliding window. The dual regression method was used to identify dynamic centrality differences inside well-known resting state networks between gender and age groups.

Gender-related differences were found in the medial and lateral visual, motor, default mode, and executive control RSN, where male subjects had more consistent centrality variations within the network. Age-related differences between the youngest and oldest subjects, based on a median split, were found in the medial visual, executive control and left frontoparietal networks, where younger subjects had more consistent centrality variations within the network.

Our findings show that centrality dynamics can be used to identify between-group functional brain network centrality differences, and that age and gender distributions studies need to be taken into account in functional imaging studies.

Brain functional connectivity has been shown to change over time during resting state fMRI experiments. Close examination of temporal changes have revealed a small set of whole-brain connectivity patterns called dynamic states. Dynamic functional network connectivity (dFNC) studies have demonstrated that it is possible to replicate the dynamic states across several resting state experiments. However, estimation of states and their temporal dynamicity still suffers from noisy and imperfect estimations. In regular dFNC implementations, states are estimated by comparing connectivity patterns through the data without considering time, in other words only zero order changes are examined. In this work we propose a method that includes first order variations of dFNC in the searching scheme of dynamic connectivity patterns. Our approach, referred to as temporal variation of functional network connectivity (tvFNC), estimates the derivative of dFNC, and then searches for reoccurring patterns of concurrent dFNC states and their derivatives. The tvFNC method is first validated using a simulated dataset and then applied to a resting-state fMRI sample including healthy controls (HC) and schizophrenia (SZ) patients and compared to the standard dFNC approach. Our dynamic approach reveals extra patterns in the connectivity derivatives complementing the already reported state patterns. State derivatives consist of additional information about increment and decrement of connectivity among brain networks not observed by the original dFNC method. The tvFNC shows more sensitivity than regular dFNC by uncovering additional FNC differences between the HC and SZ groups in each state. In summary, the tvFNC method provides a new and enhanced approach to examine time-varying functional connectivity.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the death of both upper and lower motor neurons (MNs) in the brain, brainstem and spinal cord. The neurodegenerative mechanisms leading to MN loss in ALS are not fully understood. Importantly, the reasons why MNs are specifically targeted in this disorder are unclear, when the proteins associated genetically or pathologically with ALS are expressed ubiquitously. Furthermore, MNs themselves are not affected equally; specific MNs subpopulations are more susceptible than others in both animal models and human patient tissues. Corticospinal MNs and lower somatic MNs, which innervate voluntary muscles, degenerate more readily than specific subgroups of lower MNs, which remain resistant to degeneration, reflecting the clinical manifestations of ALS. In this review, we discuss the possible factors intrinsic to MNs that render them uniquely susceptible to neurodegeneration in ALS. We also speculate why some MN subpopulations are more vulnerable than others, focussing on both their molecular and physiological properties. Finally, we review the anatomical network and neuronal microenvironment as determinants of MN subtype vulnerability and hence the progression of ALS.

White matter hyperintensities (WMH) appear as regions of abnormally high signal intensity on T2-weighted magnetic resonance image (MRI) sequences. In particular, WMH have been noteworthy in age-related neuroscience for being a crucial biomarker for all types of dementia and brain aging processes. The automatic WMH segmentation is challenging because of their variable intensity range, size and shape. U-Net tackles this problem through the dense prediction and has shown competitive performances not only on WMH segmentation/detection but also on varied image segmentation tasks. However, its network architecture is highly complex. In this study we propose the use of Saliency U-Net and irregularity age map (IAM) to decrease the U-Net architectural complexity without performance loss. We trained Saliency U-Net using both: a T2-FLAIR MRI sequence and its correspondent IAM. Since IAM guides locating image intensity irregularities, in which WMH are possibly included, in the MRI slice, Saliency U-Net performs better than the original U-Net trained only using T2-FLAIR. The best performance was achieved with fewer parameters and shorter training time. Moreover, the application of dilated convolution enhanced Saliency U-Net by recognising the shape of large WMH more accurately through multi-scale context learning. This network named Dilated Saliency U-Net improved Dice coefficient score to 0.5588 which was the best score among our experimental models, and recorded a relatively good sensitivity of 0.4747 with the shortest training time and the least number of parameters. In conclusion, based on our experimental results, incorporating IAM through Dilated Saliency U-Net resulted an appropriate approach for WMH segmentation.

Subclinical cerebrovascular disease is frequently identified in neuroimaging studies and is thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of cognitive disorders. However, the role of these neuroimaging findings in the context of normal cognitive aging is poorly understood. Identifying the etiologies of different types of lesions may help investigators differentiate between age-related and pathological cerebrovascular damage in cognitive aging. In this review, we aim to describe the epidemiology and etiology of various brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of vascular damage in cognitively normal, older adult populations. We focus here on population-based prospective cohort studies of cognitively unimpaired older adults, as well as discuss the heterogeneity of MRI findings and their relationships with cognition. This review emphasizes the need for a better understanding of subclinical cerebrovascular disease in cognitively normal populations, in order to more effectively identify and prevent cognitive decline in our rapidly aging population.

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Recent reports have described single individuals with neurodevelopmental disability (NDD) harboring heterozygous <i>KCNQ3</i> de novo variants (DNVs). We sought to assess whether pathogenic variants in <i>KCNQ3</i> cause NDD and to elucidate the associated phenotype and molecular mechanisms.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Patients with NDD and <i>KCNQ3</i> DNVs were identified through an international collaboration. Phenotypes were characterized by clinical assessment, review of charts, electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings, and parental interview. Functional consequences of variants were analyzed in vitro by patch‐clamp recording.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Eleven patients were assessed. They had recurrent heterozygous DNVs in <i>KCNQ3</i> affecting residues R230 (R230C, R230H, R230S) and R227 (R227Q). All patients exhibited global developmental delay within the first 2 years of life. Most (8/11, 73%) were nonverbal or had a few words only. All patients had autistic features, and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) was diagnosed in 5 of 11 (45%). EEGs performed before 10 years of age revealed frequent sleep‐activated multifocal epileptiform discharges in 8 of 11 (73%). For 6 of 9 (67%) recorded between 1.5 and 6 years of age, spikes became near‐continuous during sleep. Interestingly, most patients (9/11, 82%) did not have seizures, and no patient had seizures in the neonatal period. Voltage‐clamp recordings of the mutant KCNQ3 channels revealed gain‐of‐function (GoF) effects.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Specific GoF variants in <i>KCNQ3</i> cause NDD, ASD, and abundant sleep‐activated spikes. This new phenotype contrasts both with self‐limited neonatal epilepsy due to <i>KCNQ3</i> partial loss of function, and with the neonatal or infantile onset epileptic encephalopathies due to <i>KCNQ2</i> GoF.

γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptors (GABAARs) are the major mediators of synaptic inhibition in the brain. Aberrant GABAAR activity or regulation is observed in various neurodevelopmental disorders, neurodegenerative diseases and mental illnesses, including epilepsy, Alzheimer’s and schizophrenia. Benzodiazepines, anesthetics and other pharmaceutics targeting these receptors find broad clinical use, but their inherent lack of receptor subtype specificity causes unavoidable side effects, raising a need for new or adjuvant medications. In this review we introduce a new strategy to modulate GABAeric signaling: Targeting the intracellular protein interactors of GABAARs. Of special interest are scaffolding, anchoring and supporting proteins that display high GABAAR subtype specificity. Recent efforts to target gephyrin, the major intracellular integrator of GABAergic signaling, confirm that GABAAR-associated proteins can be successfully targeted through diverse molecules, including recombinant proteins, intrabodies, peptide-based probes and small molecules. Small-molecule artemisinins and peptides derived from endogenous interactors, that specifically target the universal receptor binding site of gephyrin, acutely affect synaptic GABAAR numbers and clustering, modifying neuronal transmission. Interference with GABAAR trafficking provides another way to modulate inhibitory signaling. Peptides blocking the binding site of GABAAR to AP2 increase the surface concentration of GABAAR clusters and enhance GABAergic signaling. Engineering of gephyrin binding peptides delivered superior means to interrogate neuronal structure and function. Fluorescent peptides, designed from gephyrin binders, enable live neuronal staining and visualization of gephyrin in the post synaptic sites with nanometer resolution. We anticipate that in the future, novel fluorescent probes, with improved size and binding efficiency, may find wide application in super resolution microscopy studies, enlightening the nanoscale architecture of the inhibitory synapse. Broader studies on GABAAR accessory proteins and the identification of the exact molecular binding interfaces and affinities will advance the development of novel GABAAR modulators and following in-vivo studies will reveal their clinical potential as adjuvant or stand-alone drugs.

The diversity of inhibitory interneurons allows for the coordination and modulation of excitatory principal cell firing. Interneurons that release GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid) onto the soma and axon exert powerful control by virtue of proximity to the site of action potential generation at the axon initial segment (AIS). Here we review and examine the cellular and molecular regulation of soma and axon targeting GABAergic synapses in the cortex and hippocampus. We also describe their role in controlling network activity in normal and pathological states. Recent studies have demonstrated a specific role for postsynaptic dystroglycan in the formation and maintenance of cholecystokinin positive basket cell terminals contacting the soma, and postsynaptic collybistin in parvalbumin positive chandelier cell contacts onto the AIS. Unique presynaptic molecular contributors, LGI2 and FGF13, expressed in parvalbumin positive basket cells and chandelier cells respectively, have also recently been identified. Mutations in the genes encoding proteins critical for somatic and AIS inhibitory synapses have been associated with human disorders of the nervous system. Dystroglycan dysfunction in some congenital muscular dystrophies is associated with developmental brain malformations, intellectual disability, and rare epilepsy. Collybistin dysfunction has been linked to hyperekplexia, epilepsy, intellectual disability, and developmental disorders. Both LGI2 and FGF13 mutations are implicated in syndromes with epilepsy as a component. Advancing our understanding of the powerful roles of somatic and axonic GABAergic contacts in controlling activity patterns in the cortex and hippocampus will provide insight into the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders and epilepsy.

Neurogenesis in developing and adult mammalian brain is a tightly regulated process that relies on neural stem cell activity. There is increasing evidence that mitochondrial metabolism affects neural stem cell homeostasis and differentiation but the precise role of mitochondrial function in the neurogenic process requires further investigation. Here, we have analyzed how mitochondrial complex I (MCI) dysfunction affects neural stem cell viability, proliferation and differentiation, as well as survival of the neural progeny. We have generated a conditional knockout model (hGFAP-NDUFS2 mice) in which expression of the NDUFS2 protein, essential for MCI function, is suppressed in cells expressing the Cre recombinase under the human glial fibrillary acidic protein promoter, active in mouse radial glial cells and in neural stem cells that reside in adult neurogenic niches. In this model we observed that survival of central neural stem cell population does not appear to be severely affected by MCI dysfunction. However, perinatal brain development was markedly inhibited and Ndufs2 knockout mice died before the tenth postnatal day. In addition, in vitro studies of subventricular zone neural stem cells showed that active neural progenitors require a functional MCI to produce ATP and to proliferate. In vitro differentiation of neural precursors into neurons and oligodendrocytes was also profoundly affected. These data indicate the need of a correct MCI function and oxidative phosphorylation for glia-like neural stem cell proliferation, differentiation and subsequent oligodendrocyte or neuronal maturation.

Abstract 
Objectives: This paper aims to determine if hypnotic suggestion analgesia and transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS) have a differential effect on pain perception. We hypothesized that tDCS would be more effective than hypnotic suggestion at changing the descending pain modulating system (DPMS), whereas the hypnotic suggestion would have a greater effect in quantitative sensory testing (QST). 
Design: This research was conducted as a randomized, blind and crossover trial. 
Settings: All the stages of this clinical trial were performed at the Laboratory of Pain and Neuromodulation of the Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre.
Subjects: Were included 24 healthy females aged from 18 to 45 years old, with a high susceptibility to hypnosis, according to the Waterloo-Stanford Group Scale of Hypnotic Susceptibility, Form C (15). 
Methods: The subjects received a random and crossover tDCS over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) (2mA for 20min) and hypnotic analgesia (20min). 
Results: Only hypnotic suggestion produced changes that are statistically significant from pre- to post-intervention in the following outcomes measures: heat pain threshold (HPT), heat pain tolerance (HPTo), cold pressure test (CPT) and serum brain-derivate-neurotrophic-factor (BDNF). The analysis showed a significant main effect for treatment (F=4.32; P=0.04) when we compared the delta-(Δ) of CPM task between the tDCS and hypnotic suggestion groups. Also, the change in the Δ-BDNF was positively correlated with the CPM task. 
Conclusions: The results confirm a differential effect between hypnotic suggestion and tDCS on the pain measures. They suggest that the impact of the interventions has differential neural mechanisms, since the hypnotic suggestion improved pain perception, whereas the tDCS increased inhibition in the DPMS.

Registration information clinicaltrials.gov: NCT03744897.

Perspective: These findings highlight the effect of hypnotic suggestion on contra-regulating mechanisms involved in pain perception, while the tDCS increased inhibition in the DPMS. They could help clinicians comprehend the mechanisms involved in hypnotic analgesia and tDCS and thus may contribute to pain and disability management.

Keywords: Hypnotic analgesia, tDCS, Pain threshold, CPM, BDNF, Pain.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00654">Manganese-Induced Neurotoxicity: New Insights Into the Triad of Protein Misfolding, Mitochondrial Impairment, and Neuroinflammation</a></h4>

Occupational or environmental exposure to manganese (Mn) can lead to the development of “Manganism”, a neurological condition showing certain motor symptoms similar to Parkinson’s disease (PD). Like PD, Mn toxicity is seen in the central nervous system mainly affecting nigrostriatal neuronal circuitry and subsequent behavioral and motor impairments. Since the first report of Mn-induced toxicity in 1837, various experimental and epidemiological studies have been conducted to understand this disorder. While early investigations focused on the impact of high concentrations of Mn on the mitochondria and subsequent oxidative stress, current studies have attempted to elucidate the cellular and molecular pathways involved in Mn toxicity. In fact, recent reports suggest the involvement of Mn in the misfolding of proteins such as α-synuclein and amyloid, thus providing credence to the theory that environmental exposure to toxicants can either initiate or propagate neurodegenerative processes by interfering with disease-specific proteins.  Besides manganism and PD, Mn has also been implicated in other neurological diseases such as Huntington’s and Prion diseases. While many reviews have focused on Mn homeostasis, the aim of this review is to concisely synthesize what we know about its effect primarily on the nervous system with respect to its role in protein misfolding, mitochondrial dysfunction, and consequently, neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Based on the current evidence, we propose a ‘Mn Mechanistic Neurotoxic Triad’ comprising 1) mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress, 2) protein trafficking and misfolding, and 3) neuroinflammation.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00649">Tau Secretion: Good and Bad for Neurons</a></h4>

In Alzheimer’s disease (AD), neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), lesions composed of hyperphosphorylated and aggregated tau, spread from the transentorhinal cortex to the hippocampal formation and neocortex. Growing evidence indicates that tau pathology propagates trans-synaptically, implying that pathological tau released by pre-synaptic neurons is taken up by post-synaptic neurons where it accumulates and aggregates. Observations such as the presence of tau in the cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) from control individuals and intyryh the CSF of transgenic mice overexpressing human tau before the detection of neuronal death indicate that tau can be secreted by neurons. The increase of tau in the CSF in pathological conditions such as AD suggests that tau secretion is enhanced and/or other secretory pathways take place when neuronal function is compromised. In physiological conditions, extracellular tau could exert beneficial effects as observed for other cytosolic proteins also released in the extracellular space. In such a case, blocking tau secretion could have negative effects on neurons unless the mechanism of tau secretion are different in physiological and pathological conditions allowing the prevention of pathological tau secretion without affecting the secretion of physiological tau. Furthermore, distinct extracellular tau species could be secreted in physiological and pathological conditions, species having the capacity to induce tau pathology being only secreted in the latter condition. In the present review, we will focus on the mechanisms and function of tau secretion in both physiological and pathological conditions and how this information can help elaborate an efficient therapeutic strategy to prevent tau pathology and its propagation.

Sparse coding models of natural images and sounds have been able to predict several response properties of neurons in the visual and auditory systems. While the success of these models suggests that the structure they capture is universal across domains to some degree, it is not yet clear which aspects of this structure are universal and which vary across sensory modalities. To address this, we fit complete and highly overcomplete sparse coding models to natural images and spectrograms of speech and report on differences in the statistics learned by these models. We find several types of sparse features in natural images, which all appear in similar, approximately Laplacian distributions, whereas the many types of sparse features in speech exhibit a broad range of sparse distributions, many of which are highly asymmetric. Moreover, individual sparse coding units tend to exhibit higher lifetime sparseness for overcomplete models trained on images compared to those trained on speech. Conversely, population sparseness tends to be greater for these networks trained on speech compared with sparse coding models of natural images. To illustrate the relevance of these findings to neural coding, we studied how they impact a biologically plausible sparse coding network's representations in each sensory modality. In particular, a sparse coding network with synaptically local plasticity rules learns different sparse features from speech data than are found by more conventional sparse coding algorithms, but the learned features are qualitatively the same for these models when trained on natural images.

A new label-free method is presented for measuring myeloarchitecture of the murine cerebral cortex in vivo and ex vivo. Growing evidence suggests that cortical myelination plays significant roles in neuronal plasticity and pathologies, such as multiple sclerosis (MS), but illuminating the mechanism requires longitudinal imaging of the same brains. Here we demonstrate imaging unlabeled myelinated fibers in a live mouse brain by third-harmonic generation (THG). Contrary to other label-free microscopies based on reflectance, fibers of all orientations could be visualized, i.e., radial and tangential to the pia, which is suitable for revealing the three-dimensional connectivity. The depth of THG imaging in an intact brain was approximately 200 µm, so the network of myelinated fibers could be captured into layers 2/3 in vivo. THG provides a novel base for reconstruction of morphology. Semi-automatic tracing of THG-positive axons unraveled the depth-dependent distribution of myelin lattice. Finally, a unique light property of THG was exploited for the estimation of the g-ratio. The demonstrated THG morphometry of the length density, orientation, and sheath thickness of cortical myelin could be useful for elucidating the function and how it is modulated during learning and diseases.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00156">Synaptopathy as a Mechanism for Age-Related Vestibular Dysfunction in Mice</a></h4>

Aged related decline of inner ear function contributes to both hearing loss and balance disorders, which lead to impaired quality of life and falls that can result in injury and even death. The cellular mechanisms responsible for the ear’s functional decline have been controversial, but hair cell loss has been considered the key cause for a long time. However, recent studies showed that in the cochlea, loss of inner hair cell synapses precedes hair cell or neuronal loss, and this synaptopathy is an early step in the functional decline. Whether a similar process occurs in the vestibular organ, its timing and its relationship to organ dysfunction remained unknown. We compared the time course of age-related deterioration in vestibular and cochlear functions in mice as well as characterized the age-associated changes in their utricles at the histological level. We found that in the mouse, as in humans, age-related decline in vestibular evoked potentials (VsEPs) occurs later than hearing loss. As in the cochlea, deterioration of VsEPs correlates with the loss of utricular ribbon synapses but not hair cells or neuronal cell bodies. Furthermore, the age-related synaptic loss is restricted to calyceal innervations in the utricular extrastriolar region. Hence, our findings suggest that loss of extrastriolar calyceal synapses has a key role in age-related vestibular dysfunction.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00155">Flavonoids as Prospective Neuroprotectants and Their Therapeutic Propensity in Aging Associated Neurological Disorders</a></h4>

Modern research revealed that dietary consumption of flavonoids and flavonoids-rich foods significantly improves cognitive capabilities, inhibits or delays the senescence process and related neurological disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD). The flavonoids rich foods such as green tea, cocoa, blue berry and other foods appear to improve states of cognitive hypofunction, AD and dementia-like pathological symptoms in different animal models. The mechanism of flavonoids are principally mediated via inhibition of cholinesterases (AChE, BChE), beta secretase (BACE1), free radicals and modulation of signaling pathways implicated in cognitive and neuroprotective performance. Flavonoids interact with several signaling protein pathways like ERK and PI3-kinase/Akt and modulate their actions, leading to their neuroprotective effects. Moreover, they enhance vascular blood flow and instigate neurogenesis particularly in the hippocampus area of the brain in animal models investigated so for. Flavonoids also hamper the progression of pathological symptoms of neuro-degenerative disorders via inhibition of neuronal apoptosis induced byneurotoxic substances including free radicals and beta amyloid proteins (Aβ). All these functions contribute to the maintenance of number, quality of neurons and their synaptic connectivity in the brain. Thus flavonoids can thwart the progression of age related disorders and can be a potential source for the development of new drugs effective in cognitive disabilities disorders.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00143">The Post-amyloid Era in Alzheimer's Disease: Trust Your Gut Feeling</a></h4>

Amyloid hypothesis, the assumption that beta-amyloid toxicity is the primary cause of neuronal and synaptic loss, has been the mainstream research concept in Alzheimer’s disease for the past two decades. Currently, this model is quietly being replaced by a more holistic, “systemic disease” paradigm which, like the aging process, affects multiple body tissues and organs, including the gut microbiota.
It is well-established that inflammation is a hallmark of cellular senescence, however the infection-senescence link has been less explored.  Microbiota-induced senescence is a gradually emerging concept promoted by the discovery of pathogens and their products in Alzheimer’s disease brains associated with senescent neurons, glia and endothelial cells.
Infectious agents have previously been associated with Alzheimer’s disease, but the cause vs. effect issue could not be established.  A recent study may have settled this debate as it shows that gingipain, a Porphyromonas gingivalis toxin, can be detected not only in Alzheimer’s disease but also in the brains of older individuals deceased prior to developing the illness.
In this review we take the position that gut microbes and their molecules reach the brain by triggering intestinal and blood brain barrier senescence and disruption.  We also surmise that novel Alzheimer’s disease findings, including neuronal somatic mosaicism, iron dyshomeostasis, aggressive glial phenotypes and loss of aerobic glycolysis can be explained by the infection-senescence model. In addition, we discuss potential cellular senescence targets and therapeutic strategies, including iron chelators, inflammasome inhibitors, senolytic antibiotics, mitophagy and epigenetic metabolic reprograming.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) affect 7–14% of all children in developed countries and are one of the leading causes of lifelong disability. Epigenetic modifications are poised at the interface between genes and environment and are predicted to reveal insight into NDD etiology. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing was used to examine DNA cytosine methylation in 49 human cortex samples from 3 different NDDs (autism spectrum disorder, Rett syndrome, and Dup15q syndrome) and matched controls. Integration of methylation changes across NDDs with relevant genomic and genetic datasets revealed differentially methylated regions (DMRs) unique to each type of NDD but with shared regulatory functions in neurons and microglia. NDD DMRs were enriched within promoter regions and for transcription factor binding sites with identified methylation sensitivity. DMRs from all 3 disorders were enriched for ontologies related to nervous system development and genes with disrupted expression in brain from neurodevelopmental or neuropsychiatric disorders. Genes associated with NDD DMRs showed expression patterns indicating an important role for altered microglial function during brain development. These findings demonstrate an NDD epigenomic signature in human cortex that will aid in defining therapeutic targets and early biomarkers at the interface of genetic and environmental NDD risk factors.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Speech perception involves mapping from a continuous and variable acoustic speech signal to discrete, linguistically meaningful units. However, it is unclear where in the auditory processing stream speech sound representations cease to be veridical (faithfully encoding precise acoustic properties) and become categorical (encoding sounds as linguistic categories). In this study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging and multivariate pattern analysis to determine whether tonotopic primary auditory cortex (PAC), defined as tonotopic voxels falling within Heschl’s gyrus, represents one class of speech sounds—vowels—veridically or categorically. For each of 15 participants, 4 individualized synthetic vowel stimuli were generated such that the vowels were equidistant in acoustic space, yet straddled a categorical boundary (with the first 2 vowels perceived as [i] and the last 2 perceived as [<span style="font-variant: small-caps;">i</span>]). Each participant’s 4 vowels were then presented in a block design with an irrelevant but attention-demanding level change detection task. We found that in PAC bilaterally, neural discrimination between pairs of vowels that crossed the categorical boundary was more accurate than neural discrimination between equivalently spaced vowel pairs that fell within a category. These findings suggest that PAC does not represent vowel sounds veridically, but that encoding of vowels is shaped by linguistically relevant phonemic categories.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Exposures to life stressors accumulate across the lifespan, with possible impact on brain health. Little is known, however, about the mechanisms mediating age-related changes in brain structure. We use a lifespan sample of participants (<span style="font-style: italic;">n</span> = 21 251; 4–97 years) to investigate the relationship between the thickness of cerebral cortex and the expression of the glucocorticoid- and the mineralocorticoid-receptor genes (<span style="font-style: italic;">NR3C1</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">NR3C2</span>, respectively), obtained from the Allen Human Brain Atlas. In all participants, cortical thickness correlated negatively with the expression of both <span style="font-style: italic;">NR3C1</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">NR3C2</span> across 34 cortical regions. The magnitude of this correlation varied across the lifespan. From childhood through early adulthood, the profile similarity (between <span style="font-style: italic;">NR3C1</span>/<span style="font-style: italic;">NR3C2</span> expression and thickness) increased with age. Conversely, both profile similarities decreased with age in late life. These variations do not reflect age-related changes in <span style="font-style: italic;">NR3C1</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">NR3C2</span> expression, as observed in 5 databases of gene expression in the human cerebral cortex (502 donors). Based on the co-expression of <span style="font-style: italic;">NR3C1</span> (and <span style="font-style: italic;">NR3C2</span>) with genes specific to neural cell types, we determine the potential involvement of microglia, astrocytes, and CA1 pyramidal cells in mediating the relationship between corticosteroid exposure and cortical thickness.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Phosphatase and tensin homolog on chromosome 10 (PTEN) is a tumor suppressor and autism-associated gene that exerts an important influence over neuronal structure and function during development. In addition, it participates in synaptic plasticity processes in adulthood. As an attempt to assess synaptic and developmental mechanisms by which PTEN can modulate cognitive function, we studied the consequences of 2 different genetic manipulations in mice: presence of additional genomic copies of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Pten</span> gene (Pten<sup>tg</sup>) and knock-in of a truncated <span style="font-style: italic;">Pten</span> gene lacking its PDZ motif (Pten-ΔPDZ), which is required for interaction with synaptic proteins. Pten<sup>tg</sup> mice exhibit substantial microcephaly, structural hypoconnectivity, enhanced synaptic depression at cortico-amygdala synapses, reduced anxiety, and intensified social interactions. In contrast, Pten-ΔPDZ mice have a much more restricted phenotype, with normal synaptic connectivity, but impaired synaptic depression at cortico-amygdala synapses and virtually abolished social interactions. These results suggest that synaptic actions of PTEN in the amygdala contribute to specific behavioral traits, such as sociability. Also, PTEN appears to function as a bidirectional rheostat in the amygdala: reduction in PTEN activity at synapses is associated with less sociability, whereas enhanced PTEN activity accompanies hypersocial behavior.</span>

The precise modulation of regional cerebral blood flow during neural activation is important for matching local energetic demand and supply and clearing brain metabolites. Here we discuss advances facilitated by high-resolution optical in vivo imaging techniques that for the first time have provided direct visualization of capillary blood flow and its modulation by neural activity. We focus primarily on studies of microvascular flow, mural cell control of vessel diameter, and oxygen level-dependent changes in red blood cell deformability.

Parental care is essential for the survival of offspring in altricial mammalian species. However, in most mammals, virgin females tend to avoid or attack infants. Moreover, most males demonstrate avoidance and aggression toward infants, and have little to no involvement in parental care. What mechanisms suppress avoidance, and support approach towards pups, to promote maternal care? In biparental and cooperatively breeding species, what mechanisms allow nonmothers (i.e., fathers and alloparents) to demonstrate parental care? In this review we consider the mechanisms that subserve parental care in mothers, fathers, and others (i.e., alloparents).

Gut injection of α-synuclein fibrils converts endogenous α-synuclein to a pathologic species that spreads to the brain. This leads to features of Parkinson’s disease, and vagotomy and α-synuclein deficiency prevent the neuropathology and neurobehavioral deficits induced by transmitted pathological α-synuclein.

During neuronal differentiation, spatially and temporally regulated transcription allows neuronal migration, the growth of dendrites and axons, and at later stages, synaptic formation and the establishment of neuronal circuitry. Genome topology and relocation of gene loci within the nucleus are now regarded as key factors that contribute to transcriptional regulation. Here, we review recent work supporting the hypothesis that the dynamic organization of chromatin within the nucleus impacts gene activation in response to extrinsic signalling and during neuronal differentiation.

Neuroligins are highly conserved across evolution with important roles in the formation, maturation and function of synaptic structures. Mutations in the genes that encode for neuroligins have been linked to a number of neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism and schizophrenia, which stem from synaptic pathologies. Owing to their essential functions in regulating synaptic connectivity and their link to synaptic dysfunction in disease, previous studies on neuroligins have focused on neurons. Yet a recent work reveals that neuroligins are also expressed in the central nervous system by glial cells, such as astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, and perform important roles in controlling synaptic connectivity in a non-cell autonomous manner. In this review, we will highlight these recent findings demonstrating the important roles of glial neuroligins in regulating the development and connectivity of healthy and diseased brains.</p></div>

Known exceptions include canonical imprinted genes, random X-chromosome inactivation, olfactory receptors and clustered protocadherins. Here, we highlight recent studies showing that allele-specific expression is frequent in the genome and involves subtypes of epigenetic allelic effects that differ in terms of heritability, clonality and stability over time. Different forms of epigenetic allele regulation could have different roles in brain development, function, and disease. An emerging area involves understanding allelic effects in a cell-type and developmental stage-specific manner and determining how these effects influence the impact of genetic variants and mutations on the brain. A deeper understanding of epigenetics at the allele and cellular level in the brain could help clarify the mechanisms underlying phenotypic variance.</p></div>

This region is densely packed with thousands of proteins that are involved in extensive interactions. During synaptic plasticity, the PSD undergoes changes in size and composition along with changes in synaptic strength that lead to long term potentiation (LTP) or depression (LTD). It is therefore essential to understand the organization principles underlying PSD assembly and rearrangement. Here, we review exciting new findings from recent <em>in vitro</em> reconstitution studies and propose a hypothesis that liquid–liquid phase separation mediates PSD formation and regulation. We also discuss how the properties of PSD formed via phase separation might contribute to the biological functions observed from decades of researches. Finally, we highlight unanswered questions regarding PSD organization and how <em>in vitro</em> reconstitution systems may help to answer these questions in the coming years.</p></div>

<p>Publication date: August 2019</p><p><b>Source:</b> Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 57</p><p>Author(s): Swathi Ayloo, Chenghua Gu</p><div><p>The blood–brain barrier (BBB) is a functional interface separating the brain from the circulatory system and is essential for homeostasis of the central nervous system (CNS). The BBB regulates molecular flux to maintain an optimal environment for neuronal function and protects the brain from toxins and pathogens. Endothelial cells forming the walls of CNS blood vessels constitute the BBB. CNS endothelial cells exhibit two features that underlie the restrictive properties of the BBB: specialized tight junctions that prevent paracellular passage between the blood and the brain, and unusually low levels of vesicle trafficking that limit transcellular transport or transcytosis. While the prevailing view in the field was that specialized tight junctions contributed to CNS barrier properties, recent findings have revealed the importance of maintaining low rates of transcytosis at the BBB. It is now clear that suppression of transcytosis at the BBB is an active process and CNS-specific genetic programs inhibit this pathway to maintain a functional barrier.</p></div>
