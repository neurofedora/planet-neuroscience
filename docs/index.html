	<p>Glial neoplasms are a group of diseases with poor prognoses. Not all risk factors are known, and no screening tests are available. Only histology provides certain diagnosis. As already reported, DNA transported by exosomes can be an excellent source of information shared by cells locally or systemically. These vesicles seem to be one of the main mechanisms of tumor remote intercellular signaling used to induce immune deregulation, apoptosis, and both phenotypic and genotypic modifications. In this study, we evaluated the exosomal DNA (exoDNA) concentration in blood samples of patients affected by cerebral glioma and correlated it with histological and radiological characteristics of tumors. From 14 patients with diagnosed primary or recurrent glioma, we obtained MRI imaging data, histological data, and preoperative blood samples that were used to extract circulating exosomal DNA, which we then quantified. Our results demonstrate a relationship between the amount of circulating exosomal DNA and tumor volume, and mitotic activity. In particular, a high concentration of exoDNA was noted in low-grade gliomas. Our results suggest a possible role of exoDNAs in the diagnosis of brain glioma. They could be particularly useful in detecting early recurrent high-grade gliomas and asymptomatic low-grade gliomas.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Mapping of the Sensory Innervation of the Mouse Lung by Specific Vagal and Dorsal Root Ganglion Neuronal Subsets</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The airways are densely innervated by sensory afferent nerves, whose activation regulates respiration and triggers defensive reflexes (e.g., cough, bronchospasm). Airway innervation is heterogeneous, and distinct afferent subsets have distinct functional responses. However, little is known of the innervation patterns of subsets within the lung. A neuroanatomical map is critical for understanding afferent activation under physiological and pathophysiological conditions. Here, we quantified the innervation of the mouse lung by vagal and dorsal root ganglion (DRG) sensory subsets defined by the expression of Pirt (all afferents), 5HT<SUB>3</SUB> (vagal nodose afferents), Tac1 (tachykinergic afferents), and transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 channel (TRPV1; defensive/nociceptive afferents) using Cre-mediated reporter expression. We found that vagal afferents innervate almost all conducting airways and project into the alveolar region, whereas DRG afferents only innervate large airways. Of the two vagal ganglia, only nodose afferents project into the alveolar region, but both nodose and jugular afferents innervate conducting airways throughout the lung. Many afferents that project into the alveolar region express TRPV1. Few DRG afferents expressed TRPV1. Approximately 25% of blood vessels were innervated by vagal afferents (many were Tac1+). Approximately 10% of blood vessels had DRG afferents (some were Tac1+), but this was restricted to large vessels. Lastly, innervation of neuroepithelial bodies (NEBs) correlated with the cell number within the bodies. In conclusion, functionally distinct sensory subsets have distinct innervation patterns within the conducting airways, alveoli and blood vessels. Physiologic (e.g., stretch) and pathophysiological (e.g., inflammation, edema) stimuli likely vary throughout these regions. Our data provide a neuroanatomical basis for understanding afferent responses <I>in vivo</I>.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Alpha EEG Activity and Pupil Diameter Coupling during Inactive Wakefulness in Humans</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Variations in human behavior correspond to the adaptation of the nervous system to different internal and environmental demands. Attention, a cognitive process for weighing environmental demands, changes over time. Pupillary activity, which is affected by fluctuating levels of cognitive processing, appears to identify neural dynamics that relate to different states of attention. In mice, for example, pupil dynamics directly correlate with brain state fluctuations. Although, in humans, alpha-band activity is associated with inhibitory processes in cortical networks during visual processing, and its amplitude is modulated by attention, conclusive evidence linking this narrowband activity to pupil changes in time remains sparse. We hypothesize that, as alpha activity and pupil diameter indicate attentional variations over time, these two measures should be comodulated. In this work, we recorded the electroencephalographic (EEG) and pupillary activity of 16 human subjects who had their eyes fixed on a gray screen for 1 min. Our study revealed that the alpha-band amplitude and the high-frequency component of the pupil diameter covariate spontaneously. Specifically, the maximum alpha-band amplitude was observed to occur ~300 ms before the peak of the pupil diameter. In contrast, the minimum alpha-band amplitude was noted to occur ~350 ms before the trough of the pupil diameter. The consistent temporal coincidence of these two measurements strongly suggests that the subject&rsquo;s state of attention, as indicated by the EEG alpha amplitude, is changing moment to moment and can be monitored by measuring EEG together with the diameter pupil.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Cooperative Behavior Evokes Interbrain Synchrony in the Prefrontal and Temporoparietal Cortex: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of fNIRS Hyperscanning Studies</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Single-brain neuroimaging studies have shown that human cooperation is associated with neural activity in frontal and temporoparietal regions. However, it remains unclear whether single-brain studies are informative about cooperation in real life, where people interact dynamically. Such dynamic interactions have become the focus of interbrain studies. An advantageous technique in this regard is functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) because it is less susceptible to movement artifacts than more conventional techniques like electroencephalography (EEG) or functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We conducted a systematic review and the first quantitative meta-analysis of fNIRS hyperscanning of cooperation, based on thirteen studies with 890 human participants. Overall, the meta-analysis revealed evidence of statistically significant interbrain synchrony while people were cooperating, with large overall effect sizes in both frontal and temporoparietal areas. All thirteen studies observed significant interbrain synchrony in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), suggesting that this region is particularly relevant for cooperative behavior. The consistency in these findings is unlikely to be because of task-related activations, given that the relevant studies used diverse cooperation tasks. Together, the present findings support the importance of interbrain synchronization of frontal and temporoparietal regions in interpersonal cooperation. Moreover, the present article highlights the usefulness of meta-analyses as a tool for discerning patterns in interbrain dynamics.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Cyclic, Condition-Independent Activity in Primary Motor Cortex Predicts Corrective Movement Behavior</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Reaching movements are known to have large condition-independent (CI) neural activity and cyclic neural dynamics. A new precision center-out task was performed by rhesus macaques to test the hypothesis that cyclic, CI neural activity in the primary motor cortex (M1) occurs not only during initial reaching movements but also during subsequent corrective movements. Corrective movements were observed to be discrete with time courses and bell-shaped speed profiles similar to the initial movements. CI cyclic neural trajectories were similar and repeated for initial and each additional corrective submovement. The phase of the cyclic CI neural activity predicted the time of peak movement speed more accurately than regression of instantaneous firing rate, even when the subject made multiple corrective movements. Rather than being controlled as continuations of the initial reach, a discrete cycle of motor cortex activity encodes each corrective submovement.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">White-Matter Integrity and Working Memory: Links to Aging and Dopamine-Related Genes</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Working memory, a core function underlying many higher-level cognitive processes, requires cooperation of multiple brain regions. White matter refers to myelinated axons, which are critical to interregional brain communication. Past studies on the association between white-matter integrity and working memory have yielded mixed findings. Using voxelwise tract-based spatial statistics analysis, we investigated this relationship in a sample of 328 healthy adults from 25 to 80 years of age. Given the important role of dopamine (DA) in working-memory functioning and white matter, we also analyzed the effects of dopamine-related genes on them. There were associations between white-matter integrity and working memory in multiple tracts, indicating that working-memory functioning relies on global connections between different brain areas across the adult life span. Moreover, a mediation analysis suggested that white-matter integrity contributes to age-related differences in working memory. Finally, there was an effect of the <I>COMT</I> Val158Met polymorphism on white-matter integrity, such that Val/Val carriers had lower fractional anisotropy values than any Met carriers in the internal capsule, corona radiata, and posterior thalamic radiation. As this polymorphism has been associated with dopaminergic tone in the prefrontal cortex, this result provides evidence for a link between DA neurotransmission and white matter. Together, the results support a link between white-matter integrity and working memory, and provide evidence for its interplay with age- and DA-related genes.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Disruption of Hyaluronic Acid in Skeletal Muscle Induces Decreased Voluntary Activity via Chemosensitive Muscle Afferent Sensitization in Male Mice</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>PEGPH20, a human recombinant hyaluronidase, has been proposed as a coadjutant to pancreatic cancer chemotherapy. In early trials, patients reported increased widespread muscle pain as the main adverse reaction to PEGPH20. To understand how PEGPH20 caused musculoskeletal pain, we systemically administered PEGPH20 to male mice and measured voluntary wheel activity and pain-related behaviors. These were paired with <I>ex vivo</I> electrophysiology of primary sensory neurons, whole DRG real-time PCR, and immunohistochemistry of hindpaw muscle. PEGPH20 induced significantly lower wheel running, compared with vehicle-treated animals, and decreased mechanical withdrawal thresholds 5 d after PEGPH20 injections. Chemo-sensory muscle afferents showed increased responses to noxious chemical stimulation of their receptive fields (RFs) in the PEGPH20-treated group. This was correlated with upregulation of the NGF receptor TrkA, the transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1) channel and ATP-sensitive channel P2X3 in the DRG. Immunohistochemistry of hindpaw muscles revealed damage to the muscle architecture and extensive infiltration of the tissue by cells of the myelomonocytic lineage 3 d after PEGPH20 injection. Peripheral macrophage ablation in macrophage Fas-induced apoptosis (MaFIA) mice, however, did not prevent the decreased voluntary activity and instead caused even lower levels of running. These results suggest that disruption of hyaluronic acid (HA) within the muscle extracellular matrix (ECM) sensitizes chemo-nociceptive muscle afferents possibly leading to altered pain-like behaviors. Ablation experiments suggest macrophages are necessary for adequate recovery of voluntary activity after HA disruption. These data support a role for HA and macrophages in tissue integrity and muscle pain development in patients taking PEGPH20.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Extrasynaptic NMDA Receptors Bidirectionally Modulate Intrinsic Excitability of Inhibitory Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>The NMDA subtype glutamate receptors (NMDARs) play important roles in both physiological and pathologic processes in the brain. Compared with their critical roles in synaptic modifications and excitotoxicity in excitatory neurons, much less is understood about the functional contributions of NMDARs to the inhibitory GABAergic neurons. By using selective NMDAR inhibitors and potentiators, we here show that NMDARs bidirectionally modulate the intrinsic excitability (defined as spontaneous/evoked spiking activity and EPSP-spike coupling) in inhibitory GABAergic neurons in adult male and female mice. This modulation depends on GluN2C/2D- but not GluN2A/2B-containing NMDARs. We further show that NMDAR modulator EU1794-4 mostly enhances extrasynaptic NMDAR activity, and by using it we demonstrate a significant contribution of extrasynaptic NMDARs to the modulation of intrinsic excitability in inhibitory neurons. Together, this bidirectional modulation of intrinsic excitability reveals a previously less appreciated importance of NMDARs in the second-to-second functioning of inhibitory GABAergic neurons.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> NMDA subtype of glutamate receptors (NMDARs) have important roles in brain functions, including both physiological and pathologic ones. The role of NMDARs in inhibitory neurons has been less elucidated compared with that in excitatory neurons. Our results demonstrate the importance of GluN2C/GluN2D-containing but not GluN2A/GluN2B-containing extrasynaptic NMDARs in modulating the intrinsic excitability of inhibitory neurons. These results further suggest distinct contributions of subsynaptic locations and subunit compositions of NMDARs to their functions in excitatory and inhibitory neurons. The above findings have implications for better understanding of brain diseases, such as schizophrenia.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">CLC Anion/Proton Exchangers Regulate Secretory Vesicle Filling and Granule Exocytosis in Chromaffin Cells</a></h4>

              
                <p>ClC-3, ClC-4, and ClC-5 are electrogenic chloride/proton exchangers that can be found in endosomal compartments of mammalian cells. Although the association with genetic diseases and the severe phenotype of knock-out animals illustrate their physiological importance, the cellular functions of these proteins have remained insufficiently understood. We here study the role of two <I>Clcn3</I> splice variants, ClC-3b and ClC-3c, in granular exocytosis and catecholamine accumulation of adrenal chromaffin cells using a combination of high-resolution capacitance measurements, amperometry, protein expression/gene knock out/down, rescue experiments, and confocal microscopy. We demonstrate that ClC-3c resides in immature as well as in mature secretory granules, where it regulates catecholamine accumulation and contributes to the establishment of the readily releasable pool of secretory vesicles. The lysosomal splice variant ClC-3b contributes to vesicle priming only with low efficiency and leaves the vesicular catecholamine content unaltered. The related Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporter ClC-5 undergoes age-dependent downregulation in wild-type conditions. Its upregulation in <I>Clcn3</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> cells partially rescues the exocytotic mutant defect. Our study demonstrates how different CLC transporters with similar transport functions, but distinct localizations can contribute to vesicle functions in the regulated secretory pathway of granule secretion in chromaffin cells.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchangers are expressed along the endosomal/lysosomal system of mammalian cells; however, their exact subcellular functions have remained insufficiently understood. We used chromaffin cells, a system extensively used to understand presynaptic mechanisms of synaptic transmission, to define the role of CLC exchangers in neurosecretion. Disruption of ClC-3 impairs catecholamine accumulation and secretory vesicle priming. There are multiple ClC-3 splice variants, and only expression of one, ClC-3c, in double Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger-deficient cells fully rescues the WT phenotype. Another splice variant, ClC-3b, is present in lysosomes and is not necessary for catecholamine secretion. The distinct functions of ClC-3c and ClC-3b illustrate the impact of expressing multiple CLC transporters with similar transport functions and separate localizations in different endosomal compartments.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Suppressing CSPG/LAR/PTP{sigma} Axis Facilitates Neuronal Replacement and Synaptogenesis by Human Neural Precursor Grafts and Improves Recovery after Spinal Cord Injury</a></h4>

              
                <p>Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) is a leading cause of permanent neurologic disabilities in young adults. Functional impairments after SCI are substantially attributed to the progressive neurodegeneration. However, regeneration of spinal-specific neurons and circuit re-assembly remain challenging in the dysregulated milieu of SCI because of impaired neurogenesis and neuronal maturation by neural precursor cells (NPCs) spontaneously or in cell-based strategies. The extrinsic mechanisms that regulate neuronal differentiation and synaptogenesis in SCI are poorly understood. Here, we perform extensive <I>in vitro</I> and <I>in vivo</I> studies to unravel that SCI-induced upregulation of matrix chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) impedes neurogenesis of NPCs through co-activation of two receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases, LAR and PTP. In adult female rats with SCI, systemic co-inhibition of LAR and PTP promotes regeneration of motoneurons and spinal interneurons by engrafted human directly reprogramed caudalized NPCs (drNPC-O2) and fosters their morphologic maturity and synaptic connectivity within the host neural network that culminate in improved recovery of locomotion and sensorimotor integration. Our transcriptomic analysis of engrafted human NPCs in the injured spinal cord confirmed that inhibition of CSPG receptors activates a comprehensive program of gene expression in NPCs that can support neuronal differentiation, maturation, morphologic complexity, signal transmission, synaptic plasticity, and behavioral improvement after SCI. We uncovered that CSPG/LAR/PTP axis suppresses neuronal differentiation in part by blocking Wnt/&beta;-Catenin pathway. Taken together, we provide the first evidence that CSPGs/LAR/PTP axis restricts neurogenesis and synaptic integration of new neurons in NPC cellular therapies for SCI. We propose targeting LAR and PTP receptors offers a promising clinically-feasible adjunct treatment to optimize the efficacy and neurologic benefits of ongoing NPC-based clinical trials for SCI.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Transplantation of neural precursor cells (NPCs) is a promising approach for replacing damaged neurons after spinal cord injury (SCI). However, survival, neuronal differentiation, and synaptic connectivity of transplanted NPCs within remain challenging in SCI. Here, we unravel that activation of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG)/LAR/PTP axis after SCI impedes the capacity of transplanted human NPCs for replacing functionally integrated neurons. Co-blockade of LAR and PTP is sufficient to promote re-generation of motoneurons and spinal V1 and V3 interneurons by engrafted human caudalized directly reprogramed NPCs (drNPC-O2) and facilitate their synaptic integration within the injured spinal cord. CSPG/LAR/PTP axis appears to suppress neuronal differentiation of NPCs by inhibiting Wnt/&beta;-Catenin pathway. These findings identify targeting CSPG/LAR/PTP axis as a promising strategy for optimizing neuronal replacement, synaptic re-connectivity, and neurologic recovery in NPC-based strategies.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Perceptual Weighting of V1 Spikes Revealed by Optogenetic White Noise Stimulation</a></h4>

              
                <p>During visually guided behaviors, mere hundreds of milliseconds can elapse between a sensory input and its associated behavioral response. How spikes occurring at different times are integrated to drive perception and action remains poorly understood. We delivered random trains of optogenetic stimulation (white noise) to excite inhibitory interneurons in V1 of mice of both sexes while they performed a visual detection task. We then performed a reverse correlation analysis on the optogenetic stimuli to generate a neuronal-behavioral kernel, an unbiased, temporally precise estimate of how suppression of V1 spiking at different moments around the onset of a visual stimulus affects detection of that stimulus. Electrophysiological recordings enabled us to capture the effects of optogenetic stimuli on V1 responsivity and revealed that the earliest stimulus-evoked spikes are preferentially weighted for guiding behavior. These data demonstrate that white noise optogenetic stimulation is a powerful tool for understanding how patterns of spiking in neuronal populations are decoded in generating perception and action.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> During visually guided actions, continuous chains of neurons connect our retinas to our motoneurons. To unravel circuit contributions to behavior, it is crucial to establish the relative functional position(s) that different neural structures occupy in processing and relaying the signals that support rapid, precise responses. To address this question, we randomly inhibited activity in mouse V1 throughout the stimulus-response cycle while the animals did many repetitions of a visual task. The period that led to impaired performance corresponded to the earliest stimulus-driven response in V1, with no effect of inhibition immediately before or during late stages of the stimulus-driven response. This approach offers experimenters a powerful method for uncovering the temporal weighting of spikes from stimulus to response.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Multiscale Computer Model of the Spinal Dorsal Horn Reveals Changes in Network Processing Associated with Chronic Pain</a></h4>

              
                <p>Pain-related sensory input is processed in the spinal dorsal horn (SDH) before being relayed to the brain. That processing profoundly influences whether stimuli are correctly or incorrectly perceived as painful. Significant advances have been made in identifying the types of excitatory and inhibitory neurons that comprise the SDH, and there is some information about how neuron types are connected, but it remains unclear how the overall circuit processes sensory input or how that processing is disrupted under chronic pain conditions. To explore SDH function, we developed a computational model of the circuit that is tightly constrained by experimental data. Our model comprises conductance-based neuron models that reproduce the characteristic firing patterns of spinal neurons. Excitatory and inhibitory neuron populations, defined by their expression of genetic markers, spiking pattern, or morphology, were synaptically connected according to available qualitative data. Using a genetic algorithm, synaptic weights were tuned to reproduce projection neuron firing rates (model output) based on primary afferent firing rates (model input) across a range of mechanical stimulus intensities. Disparate synaptic weight combinations could produce equivalent circuit function, revealing degeneracy that may underlie heterogeneous responses of different circuits to perturbations or pathologic insults. To validate our model, we verified that it responded to the reduction of inhibition (i.e., disinhibition) and ablation of specific neuron types in a manner consistent with experiments. Thus validated, our model offers a valuable resource for interpreting experimental results and testing hypotheses <I>in silico</I> to plan experiments for examining normal and pathologic SDH circuit function.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We developed a multiscale computer model of the posterior part of spinal cord gray matter (spinal dorsal horn), which is involved in perceiving touch and pain. The model reproduces several experimental observations and makes predictions about how specific types of spinal neurons and synapses influence projection neurons that send information to the brain. Misfiring of these projection neurons can produce anomalous sensations associated with chronic pain. Our computer model will not only assist in planning future experiments, but will also be useful for developing new pharmacotherapy for chronic pain disorders, connecting the effect of drugs acting at the molecular scale with emergent properties of neurons and circuits that shape the pain experience.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Both Corticospinal and Reticulospinal Tracts Control Force of Contraction</a></h4>

              
                <p>The control of contraction strength is a key part of movement control. In primates, both corticospinal and reticulospinal cells provide input to motoneurons. Corticospinal discharge is known to correlate with force, but there are no previous reports of how reticular formation (RF) activity modulates with different contractions. Here we trained two female macaque monkeys (body weight, 5.9&ndash;6.9 kg) to pull a handle that could be loaded with 0.5&ndash;6 kg weights and recorded from identified pyramidal tract neurons (PTNs) in primary motor cortex and RF cells during task performance. Population-averaged firing rate increased monotonically with higher force for the RF, but showed a complex profile with little net modulation for PTNs. This reflected a more heterogeneous profile of rate modulation across the PTN population, leading to cancellation in the average. Linear discriminant analysis classified the force based on the time course of rate modulation equally well for PTNs and RF cells. Peak firing rate had significant linear correlation with force for 43 of 92 PTNs (46.7%) and 21 of 46 RF cells (43.5%). For almost all RF cells (20 of 21), the correlation coefficient was positive; similar numbers of PTNs (22 vs 21) had positive versus negative coefficients. Considering the timing of force representation, similar fractions (PTNs: 61.2%; RF cells: 55.5%) commenced coding before the onset of muscle activity. We conclude that both corticospinal and reticulospinal tracts contribute to the control of contraction force; the reticulospinal tract seems to specify an overall signal simply related to force, whereas corticospinal cell activity would be better suited for fine-scale adjustments.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> For the first time, we compare the coding of force for corticospinal and reticular formation cells in awake behaving monkeys, over a wide range of contraction strengths likely to come close to maximum voluntary contraction. Both cortical and brainstem systems coded similarly well for force, but whereas reticular formation cells carried a simple uniform signal, corticospinal neurons were more heterogeneous. This may reflect a role in the gross specification of a coordinated movement, versus more fine-grained adjustments around individual joints.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Separate Functional Subnetworks of Excitatory Neurons Show Preference to Periodic and Random Sound Structures</a></h4>

              
                <p>Auditory cortex (ACX) neurons are sensitive to spectro-temporal sound patterns and violations in patterns induced by rare stimuli embedded within streams of sounds. We investigate the auditory cortical representation of repeated presentations of sequences of sounds with standard stimuli (common) with an embedded deviant (rare) stimulus in two conditions, Periodic (Fixed deviant position) or Random (Random deviant position). We used extracellular single-unit and two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging recordings in layer 2/3 neurons of the mouse (<I>Mus musculus</I>) ACX of either sex. Population single-unit average responses increased over repetitions in the Random condition and were suppressed or did not change in the Periodic condition, showing general irregularity preference. A subset of neurons showed the opposite behavior, indicating regularity preference. Furthermore, pairwise noise correlations were higher in the Random condition than in the Periodic condition, suggesting a role of recurrent connections in the observed differential adaptation. Functional two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging showed that excitatory (EX), and inhibitory (IN) neurons [parvalbumin-positive (PV) and somatostatin-positive (SOM)] also had different categories of long-term adaptation as observed with single-units. However, examination of functional connectivity between pairs of neurons of different categories showed that EX-PV connected pairs behaved opposite to the EX-EX and EX-SOM pairs, with more connections outside category in Random condition than Periodic condition. Finally, considering Regularity, Irregularity, and no preference of connected pairs of neurons showed that EX-EX and EX-SOM pairs were in largely separate functional subnetworks with different preferences, not EX-PV pairs. Thus, separate subnetworks underlie coding of periodic and random sound sequences.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Studying how the auditory cortex (ACX) neurons respond to streams of sound sequences help us understand the importance of changes in dynamic acoustic noisy scenes around us. Humans and animals are sensitive to regularity and its violations in sound sequences. Psychophysical tasks in humans show that the auditory brain differentially responds to Periodic and Random structures, independent of the listener's attentional states. Here, we show that mouse ACX L2/3 neurons detect changes and respond differently to patterns over long-time scales. The differential functional connectivity profile obtained in response to two different sound contexts suggests the vital role of recurrent connections in the auditory cortical network. Furthermore, the excitatory-inhibitory neuronal interactions can contribute to detecting the changing sound patterns.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">High Fidelity Theta Phase Rolling of CA1 Neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>Single hippocampal cells encode the spatial position of an animal by increasing their firing rates within "place fields," and by shifting the phase of their spikes to earlier phases of the ongoing theta oscillations (theta phase precession). Whether other forms of spatial phase changes exist in the hippocampus is unknown. Here, we used high-density electrophysiological recordings in mice of either sex running back and forth on a 150-cm linear track. We found that the instantaneous phase of spikes shifts to progressively later theta phases as the animal traverses the place field. We term this shift theta "phase rolling." Phase rolling is opposite in direction to precession, faster than precession, and occurs between distinct theta cycles. Place fields that exhibit phase rolling are larger than nonrolling fields, and in-field spikes occur in distinct theta phases in rolling compared with nonrolling fields. As a phase change associated with position, theta phase rolling may be used to encode space.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Theta phase precession is a well-known coding scheme in which neurons represent the position of the animal by the timing of their spikes with respect to the phase of ongoing theta oscillations. Here, we show that hippocampal neurons also undergo "theta phase rolling," a phase change faster and opposite in direction to precession. As the animal advances in space, spikes occur at progressively later phases of consecutive theta cycles. Future studies may reveal whether phase rolling constitutes a novel coding mechanism of space.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Causal Evidence for the Multiple Demand Network in Change Detection: Auditory Mismatch Magnetoencephalography across Focal Neurodegenerative Diseases</a></h4>

              
                <p>The multiple demand (MD) system is a network of fronto-parietal brain regions active during the organization and control of diverse cognitive operations. It has been argued that this activation may be a nonspecific signal of task difficulty. However, here we provide convergent evidence for a causal role for the MD network in the "simple task" of automatic auditory change detection, through the impairment of top-down control mechanisms. We employ independent structure-function mapping, dynamic causal modeling (DCM), and frequency-resolved functional connectivity analyses of MRI and magnetoencephalography (MEG) from 75 mixed-sex human patients across four neurodegenerative syndromes [behavioral variant fronto-temporal dementia (bvFTD), nonfluent variant primary progressive aphasia (nfvPPA), posterior cortical atrophy (PCA), and Alzheimer's disease mild cognitive impairment with positive amyloid imaging (ADMCI)] and 48 age-matched controls. We show that atrophy of any MD node is sufficient to impair auditory neurophysiological response to change in frequency, location, intensity, continuity, or duration. There was no similar association with atrophy of the cingulo-opercular, salience or language networks, or with global atrophy. MD regions displayed increased functional but decreased effective connectivity as a function of neurodegeneration, suggesting partially effective compensation. Overall, we show that damage to any of the nodes of the MD network is sufficient to impair top-down control of sensation, providing a common mechanism for impaired change detection across dementia syndromes.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Previous evidence for fronto-parietal networks controlling perception is largely associative and may be confounded by task difficulty. Here, we use a preattentive measure of automatic auditory change detection [mismatch negativity (MMN) magnetoencephalography (MEG)] to show that neurodegeneration in any frontal or parietal multiple demand (MD) node impairs primary auditory cortex (A1) neurophysiological response to change through top-down mechanisms. This explains why the impaired ability to respond to change is a core feature across dementias, and other conditions driven by brain network dysfunction, such as schizophrenia. It validates theoretical frameworks in which neurodegenerating networks upregulate connectivity as partially effective compensation. The significance extends beyond network science and dementia, in its construct validation of dynamic causal modeling (DCM), and human confirmation of frequency-resolved analyses of animal neurodegeneration models.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Minimal Phrase Composition Revealed by Intracranial Recordings</a></h4>

              
                <p>The ability to comprehend phrases is an essential integrative property of the brain. Here, we evaluate the neural processes that enable the transition from single-word processing to a minimal compositional scheme. Previous research has reported conflicting timing effects of composition, and disagreement persists with respect to inferior frontal and posterior temporal contributions. To address these issues, 19 patients (10 male, 9 female) implanted with penetrating depth or surface subdural intracranial electrodes, heard auditory recordings of adjective-noun, pseudoword-noun, and adjective-pseudoword phrases and judged whether the phrase matched a picture. Stimulus-dependent alterations in broadband gamma activity, low-frequency power, and phase-locking values across the language-dominant left hemisphere were derived. This revealed a mosaic located on the lower bank of the posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS), in which closely neighboring cortical sites displayed exclusive sensitivity to either lexicality or phrase structure, but not both. Distinct timings were found for effects of phrase composition (210&ndash;300 ms) and pseudoword processing (~300&ndash;700 ms), and these were localized to neighboring electrodes in pSTS. The pars triangularis and temporal pole encoded anticipation of composition in broadband low frequencies, and both regions exhibited greater functional connectivity with pSTS during phrase composition. Our results suggest that the pSTS is a highly specialized region composed of sparsely interwoven heterogeneous constituents that encodes both lower and higher level linguistic features. This hub in pSTS for minimal phrase processing may form the neural basis for the human-specific computational capacity for forming hierarchically organized linguistic structures.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Linguists have claimed that the integration of multiple words into a phrase demands a computational procedure distinct from single-word processing. Here, we provide intracranial recordings from a large patient cohort, with high spatiotemporal resolution, to track the cortical dynamics of phrase composition. Epileptic patients volunteered to participate in a task in which they listened to phrases (red boat), word-pseudoword or pseudoword-word pairs (e.g., red fulg). At the onset of the second word in phrases, greater broadband high gamma activity was found in posterior superior temporal sulcus in electrodes that exclusively indexed phrasal meaning and not lexical meaning. These results provide direct, high-resolution signatures of minimal phrase composition in humans, a potentially species-specific computational capacity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Lateralized and Region-Specific Thalamic Processing of Lexical Status during Reading Aloud</a></h4>

              
                <p>To explore whether the thalamus participates in lexical status (word vs nonword) processing during spoken word production, we recorded local field potentials from the ventral lateral thalamus in 11 essential tremor patients (three females) undergoing thalamic deep-brain stimulation lead implantation during a visually cued word and nonword reading-aloud task. We observed task-related beta (12&ndash;30 Hz) activity decreases that were preferentially time locked to stimulus presentation, and broadband gamma (70&ndash;150 Hz) activity increases, which are thought to index increased multiunit spiking activity, occurring shortly before and predominantly time locked to speech onset. We further found that thalamic beta activity decreases bilaterally were greater when nonwords were read, demonstrating bilateral sensitivity to lexical status that likely reflects the tracking of task effort; in contrast, greater nonword-related increases in broadband gamma activity were observed only on the left, demonstrating lateralization of thalamic broadband gamma selectivity for lexical status. In addition, this lateralized lexicality effect on broadband gamma activity was strongest in more anterior thalamic locations, regions which are more likely to receive basal ganglia than cerebellar afferents and have extensive connections with prefrontal cortex including Brodmann's areas 44 and 45, regions consistently associated with grapheme-to-phoneme conversions. These results demonstrate active thalamic participation in reading aloud and provide direct evidence from intracranial thalamic recordings for the lateralization and topography of subcortical lexical status processing.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Despite the corticocentric focus of most experimental work and accompanying models, there is increasing recognition of the role of subcortical structures in speech and language. Using local field potential recordings in neurosurgical patients, we demonstrated that the thalamus participates in lexical status (word vs nonword) processing during spoken word production, in a lateralized and region-specific manner. These results provide direct evidence from intracranial thalamic recordings for the lateralization and topography of subcortical lexical status processing.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Subregions of DLPFC Display Graded yet Distinct Structural and Functional Connectivity</a></h4>

              
                <p>The human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC; approximately corresponding to Brodmann areas 9 and 46) has demonstrable roles in diverse executive functions such as working memory, cognitive flexibility, planning, inhibition, and abstract reasoning. However, it remains unclear whether this is the result of one functionally homogeneous region or whether there are functional subdivisions within the DLPFC. Here, we divided the DLPFC into seven areas along rostral-caudal and dorsal-ventral axes anatomically and explored their respective patterns of structural and functional connectivity. In vivo probabilistic tractography (11 females and 13 males) and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI; 57 females and 21 males) were employed to map out the patterns of connectivity from each DLPFC subregion. Structural connectivity demonstrated graded intraregional connectivity within the DLPFC. The patterns of structural connectivity between the DLPFC subregions and other cortical areas revealed that the dorsal-rostral subregions connections were restricted to other frontal and limbic areas, whereas the ventral-caudal region was widely connected to frontal, parietal, and limbic cortex. Functional connectivity analyses demonstrated that subregions of DLPFC were strongly interconnected to each other. The dorsal subregions were associated with the default mode network (DMN), while middle dorsal-rostral subregions were linked with the multiple demand network (MDN). The ventral-caudal subregion showed increased functional coupling with both DMN and MDN. Our results suggest that the connectivity of the DLPFC may be subdivided along a dorsorostral-ventrocaudal axis with differing (albeit graded) patterns of connectivity reflecting the integrative executive function of the DLPFC.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Research has shown that the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) plays a role in various executive functions. By dividing the DLPFC into seven areas along rostral-caudal and dorsal-ventral axes anatomically, we explored their patterns of structural and functional connectivity. The patterns of connectivity within DLPFC subregions demonstrated graded intraregional connectivity. There were distinctive patterns of connectivity with other cortical areas in dorsal-rostral and ventral-caudal DLPFC subregions. Divisions across DLPFC subregions seem to align with their structural and functional connectivity. Our results suggest that DLPFC may be subdivided by the diagonal axis of the dorsal-ventral axis and rostral-caudal axis, supporting the framework of a functional organization along the anterior-posterior axis in the lateral PFC.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Patient-Derived Anti-NMDAR Antibody Disinhibits Cortical Neuronal Networks through Dysfunction of Inhibitory Neuron Output</a></h4>

              
                <p>Anti-NMDA receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis is a severe neuropsychiatric disorder associated with autoantibodies against NMDARs, which cause a variety of symptoms from prominent psychiatric and cognitive manifestations to seizures and autonomic instability. Previous studies mainly focused on hippocampal effects of these autoantibodies, helping to explain mechanistic causes for cognitive impairment. However, antibodies' effects on higher cortical network function, where they could contribute to psychosis and/or seizures, have not been explored in detail until now. Here, we employed a patient-derived monoclonal antibody targeting the NR1 subunit of NMDAR and tested its effects on <I>in vitro</I> cultures of rodent cortical neurons, using imaging and electrophysiological techniques. We report that this hNR1 antibody drives cortical networks to a hyperexcitable state and disrupts mechanisms stabilizing network activity such as Npas4 signaling. Network hyperactivity is in part a result of a reduced synaptic output of inhibitory neurons, as indicated by a decreased inhibitory drive and levels of presynaptic inhibitory proteins, specifically in inhibitory-to-excitatory neuron synapses. Importantly, on a single-cell level hNR1 antibody selectively impairs NMDAR-mediated currents and synaptic transmission of cortical inhibitory neurons, yet has no effect on excitatory neurons, which contrasts with its effects on hippocampal neurons. Together, these findings provide a novel, cortex-specific mechanism of antibody-induced neuronal hyperexcitability, highlighting regional specificity underlying the pathology of autoimmune encephalitis.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> It is increasingly appreciated that the inadvertent activation of the immune system within CNS can underlie pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric disorders. Although the exact mechanisms remain elusive, autoantibodies derived from patients with autoimmune encephalitis pose a unique tool to study pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric states. Our analysis reveals that autoantibody against the NMDA receptor (NMDAR) has a distinct mechanism of action in the cortex, where it impairs function of inhibitory neurons leading to increased cortical network excitability, in contrast to previously described hippocampal synaptic mechanisms of information encoding, highlighting brain regional specificity. Notably, similar mechanism of NMDAR-mediated inhibitory hypofunction leading to cortical disinhibition has been suggested to underlie pathology of schizophrenia, hence our data provide new evidence for common mechanisms underlying neuropsychiatric disorders.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Differential Activation of Pain Circuitry Neuron Populations in a Mouse Model of Spinal Cord Injury-Induced Neuropathic Pain</a></h4>

              
                <p>Neuropathic pain (NP) is one of the most common and debilitating comorbidities of spinal cord injury (SCI). Current therapies are often ineffective due in part to an incomplete understanding of underlying pathogenic mechanisms. In particular, it remains unclear how SCI leads to dysfunction in the excitability of nociceptive circuitry. The immediate early gene c-Fos has long been used in pain processing locations as a marker of neuronal activation. We employed a mouse reporter line with fos-promoter driven Cre-recombinase to define neuronal activity changes in relevant pain circuitry locations following cervical spinal cord level (C)5/6 contusion (using both females and males), a SCI model that results in multiple forms of persistent NP-related behavior. SCI significantly increased activation of cervical dorsal horn (DH) projection neurons, as well as induced a selective reduction in the activation of a specific DH projection neuron subpopulation that innervates the periaqueductal gray (PAG), an important brain region involved in descending inhibitory modulation of DH pain transmission. SCI also increased the activation of both protein kinase C (PKC) and calretinin excitatory DH interneuron populations. Interestingly, SCI promoted a significant decrease in the activation selectively of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS)-expressing inhibitory interneurons of cervical DH. In addition, SCI altered activation of various supraspinal neuron populations associated with pain processing, including a large increase in thalamus and a significant decrease in PAG. These findings reveal a complex and diverse set of SCI-induced neuron activity changes across the pain circuitry neuraxis. Moving forward, these results can be used to inform therapeutic targeting of defined neuronal populations in NP.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Neuropathic pain (NP) is one of the most common and highly debilitating comorbidities of spinal cord injury (SCI). Unfortunately, current therapies are often ineffective due in part to an incomplete understanding of underlying pathogenic mechanisms. In particular, it remains unclear how SCI leads to dysfunction in excitability of nociceptive circuitry. Using a FosTRAP2 reporter mouse line in a model of SCI-induced NP, we show SCI alters activation of a number of important interneuron and projection neuron populations across relevant spinal cord and brain locations of the pain circuitry neuraxis. These data suggest a role for maladaptive plasticity involving specific subpopulations of neurons and circuits in driving SCI-induced chronic pain. Moving forward, these results can be used to inform therapeutic targeting of defined neuronal populations in NP.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The diversity of the diprotodontids provides an excellent opportunity to study how a basic marsupial cortical plan has been modified for the needs of the mammals living in different habitats. Very little is known about the connections of the cerebral cortex with the deep brain structures (basal ganglia and thalamus) in this evolutionarily significant group of mammals. In this study, we performed mapping of brain regions and connections in a diprotodontid marsupial from data obtained from an excised brain scanned in high-field (9.4 T) microstructural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) instrument. The analysis was based on two MRI methodologies. First, high-resolution structural scans were used to map MRI visible brain regions from T1w and T2w images. Second, extensive diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data were obtained to elucidate connectivity between brain areas using deterministic diffusion tracking of neuronal brain fibers. From the data, we were able to identify corticostriate connections between the frontal association and dorsomedial isocortex and the head of the caudate, and between the lateral somatosensory cortex and the putamen. We were also able to follow the olfactory and limbic connections by tracing fibers in the fornix, cingulum, intrabulbar part of the anterior commissure, and lateral olfactory tract. There was segregation of fibers in the anterior commissure such that olfactory connections passed through the rostroventral part and successively more dorsal cortical areas connected through more dorsal parts of the commissure. Our findings confirm a common pattern of cortical connectivity in therian mammals, even where brain expansion has occurred independently in diverse groups.</p>

<p>Pigment-dispersing factor (PDF) neuronal network (magenta) grows in complexity with the developing honey bee brain. Numbers of PDF neurons in the honey bee brain are displayed along with the developmental stage of the honey bee.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The neuropeptide pigment-dispersing factor (PDF) plays a prominent role in the circadian clock of many insects including honey bees. In the honey bee brain, PDF is expressed in about 15 clock neurons per hemisphere that lie between the central brain and the optic lobes. As in other insects, the bee PDF neurons form wide arborizations in the brain, but certain differences are evident. For example, they arborize only sparsely in the accessory medulla (AME), which serves as important communication center of the circadian clock in cockroaches and flies. Furthermore, all bee PDF neurons cluster together, which makes it impossible to distinguish individual projections. Here, we investigated the developing bee PDF network and found that the first three PDF neurons arise in the third larval instar and form a dense network of varicose fibers at the base of the developing medulla that strongly resembles the AME of hemimetabolous insects. In addition, they send faint fibers toward the lateral superior protocerebrum. In last larval instar, PDF cells with larger somata appear and send fibers toward the distal medulla and the medial protocerebrum. In the dorsal part of the medulla serpentine layer, a small PDF knot evolves from which PDF fibers extend ventrally. This knot disappears during metamorphosis and the varicose arborizations in the putative AME become fainter. Instead, a new strongly stained PDF fiber hub appears in front of the lobula. Simultaneously, the number of PDF neurons increases and the PDF neuronal network in the brain gets continuously more complex.</p>

<p>The picture illustrates a boar fetus 2 weeks before birth and its highly gyrated brain. A representative coronal section through one hemisphere indicates regions of interest for assessing, in the laminar compartments, the changes in morphology and cell density. Microglia cells reach adult-like cell density and morphology well before birth. Cells interact with neuronal somata and axon initial segments by late midgestation. Depending on the laminar compartment, microglia cells represent 7–12% of all cortical cells.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Knowledge on cortical development is based mainly on rodents besides primates and carnivores, all being altricial. Here, we analyzed a precocial animal, the pig, looking at dorsoparietal cortex from E45 to P90. At E45, most ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1-positive (Iba1+) cells had a macrophage-like morphology and resided in meninges and choroid plexus. Only a few cells were scattered in the ventricular and subventricular zone (VZ and SVZ). At E60/E70, all laminar compartments displayed microglia cells at a low-to-moderate density, being highest in VZ and SVZ followed by intermediate zone/white matter (IZ/WM). The cortical plate and marginal zone displayed only a few Iba1+ cells. Cells were intensely labeled, but still had poorly arborized somata and many resembled ameboid, macrophage-like microglia. Concurrent with a massive increase in cortical volume, microglia cell density increased until E85, and further until E100/E110 (birth at E114) to densities that resemble those seen postnatally. A fraction of microglia colabeled with Ki67 suggesting proliferation in all laminar compartments. Cell-to-cell distance decreased substantially during this time, and the fraction of microglia to all nuclei and to neurons increases in the laminar compartments. Eventually, of all cortical DAPI+ nuclei 7–12% were Iba1+ microglia. From E70 onwards, more and more cells with ramified processes were present in MZ down to IZ/WM, showing, for instance, a close association with NeuN+, NPY+, and GAD65/67+ somata and axon initial segments. These results suggested that the development of microglia cell density and morphology proceeds rapidly from mid-gestation onwards reaching near-adult status already before birth.</p>

<p>
<p>The interscapular brown adipose tissue (iBAT) innervations reaches their targets via dorsal rami, not via intercostal nerves (aka ventral rami).</p>
<p>Dorsal rami 1–5 represent sympathetic chain ganglia inputs (stellate ganglion to T5).</p>
<p>Fine nerves branch off each dorsal ramus to enter the iBAT for innervation, while dorsal rami continue to innervate additional dorsal structures like the skin.</p>
<p>Brown adipocytes (BA) are densely innervated by axonal varicosities that form neuro-adipocyte junctions, while white adipocytes show sparse innervation in mouse and human adipose tissues.</p>
<p>Core iBAT innervation density remains unchanged by cold exposure, but increases in white adipose tissue mainly within beige islands.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The interscapular brown adipose tissue (iBAT) is under sympathetic control, and recent studies emphasized the importance of efferent sympathetic and afferent sensory or humoral feedback systems to regulate adipose tissue function and overall metabolic health. However, functional studies of the sympathetic nervous system in the mouse are limited, because details of anatomy and fine structure are lacking. Here, we used reporter mice for tyrosine hydroxylase expressing neurons (TH:tomato mice), iDISCO tissue clearance, confocal, lightsheet, and electron microscopy to clarify that (<b>a)</b> iBAT receives sympathetic input via dorsal rami (instead of often cited intercostal nerves); (<b>b)</b> dorsal rami T1–T5 correspond to the postganglionic input from sympathetic chain ganglia (stellate/T1–T5); (<b>c)</b> dorsal rami serve as conduits for sympathetic axons that branch off in finer nerve bundles to enter iBAT; (<b>d)</b> axonal varicosities show strong differential innervation of brown (dense innervation) versus white (sparse innervation) adipocytes, that surround the core iBAT in the mouse and are intermingled in human adipose tissues, (<b>e)</b> axonal varicosities can form neuro-adipocyte junctions with brown adipocytes. Taken together, we demonstrate that sympathetic iBAT innervation is organized by specific nerves and terminal structures that can be surgically and genetically accessed for neuromodulatory purposes.</p>

<p>Central olfactory pathway in the brain of the hermit crabs <i>Pagurus bernhardus</i> and <i>Coenobita clypeatus</i>: summary of glomerular structure and neurochemistry.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The primary olfactory centers of metazoans as diverse as arthropods and mammals consist of an array of fields of dense synaptic neuropil, the olfactory glomeruli. However, the neurochemical structure of crustacean olfactory glomeruli is largely understudied when compared to the insects. We analyzed the glomerular architecture in selected species of hermit crabs using immunohistochemistry against presynaptic proteins, the neuropeptides orcokinin, RFamide and allatostatin, and the biogenic amine serotonin. Our study reveals an unexpected level of structural complexity, unmatched by what is found in the insect olfactory glomeruli. Peptidergic and aminergic interneurons provide the structural basis for a regionalization of the crustacean glomeruli into longitudinal and concentric compartments. Our data suggest that local olfactory interneurons take a central computational role in modulating the information transfer from olfactory sensory neurons to projection neurons within the glomeruli. Furthermore, we found yet unknown neuronal elements mediating lateral inhibitory interactions across the glomerular array that may play a central role in modulating the transfer of sensory input to the output neurons through presynaptic inhibition. Our study is another step in understanding the function of crustacean olfactory glomeruli as highly complex units of local olfactory processing.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Disturbances of the early stages of neurogenesis lead to irreversible changes in the structure of the mature brain and its functional impairment, including increased excitability, which may be the basis for drug-resistant epilepsy. The range of possible clinical symptoms is as wide as the different stages of disturbed neurogenesis may be. In this study, we used a quadruple model of brain dysplasia by comparing structural and functional disorders in animals whose neurogenesis was disturbed with a single dose of 1 Gy of gamma rays at one of the four stages of neurogenesis, that is, on days 13, 15, 17, or 19 of prenatal development.</p>
<p>When reached adulthood, the prenatally irradiated rats received EEG teletransmitter implantation. Thereafter, pilocarpine was administered and significant differences in susceptibility to seizure behavioral symptoms were detected depending on the degree of brain dysplasia. Before, during, and after the seizures significant correlations were found between the density of parvalbumin-immunopositive neurons located in the cerebral cortex and the intensity of behavioral seizure symptoms or increases in the power of particular EEG bands. Neurons expressing calretinin or NPY showed also dysplasia-related increases without, however, correlations with parameters of seizure intensity. The results point to significant roles of parvalbumin-expressing interneurons, and also to expression of NPY—an endogenous anticonvulsant and neuroprotectant reducing susceptibility to seizures and supporting neuronal survival.</p>

     alt="Structural analysis of the microglia–interneuron interactions in the CA1 hippocampal area of the APP/PS1 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease"/>
<p>This study provides new insights into the structural interactions between microglia and two types of hippocampal inhibitory interneurons defined by expression of parvalbumin or somatostatin. We report a high level of structural interactions between microglia and both types of interneurons, with cell-type-specific differences in contact location and interaction area. Furthermore, these interactions were preserved in the APP/PS1 mouse model of the Alzheimer's Disease (AD), suggesting that physical interactions between microglia and interneurons remain stable. However, the fraction of microglia contacts onto interneuron dendrites was significantly decreased, indicating that, under AD-like conditions, the somatic control of interneurons by microglia becomes more functionally relevant and may control the firing behavior of interneurons to maintain the network inhibition/excitation balance.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Microglia can interact with glutamatergic neurons and, through control of synaptic elements, regulate their physiological function. Much less is known about the partnership between microglia and GABAergic inhibitory interneurons. Here, we compared the interactions between microglia and parvalbumin (PV+) and somatostatin (SOM+) expressing interneurons in the CA1 hippocampal area of APP/PS1 transgenic mice that mimic certain aspects of the Alzheimer's disease (AD). We first uncovered a high level of interactions between microglia and two types of interneurons, with 98% of SOM+ and 90% of PV+ cells receiving different types of putative microglial contacts. The latter included the microglia soma to the interneuron soma (Soma<sub>MG</sub>-to-Soma<sub>IN</sub>), the microglia process to the interneuron soma (Process<sub>MG</sub>-to-Soma<sub>IN</sub>) and the microglia process to the interneuron dendrite (Process<sub>MG</sub>-to-Dend<sub>IN</sub>) interactions. Moreover, we found significantly larger areas of interaction for the Soma<sub>MG</sub>-to-Soma<sub>IN</sub> and the Process<sub>MG</sub>-to-Dend<sub>IN</sub> type of contacts between microglia and SOM+ cells. In contrast, PV+ cells exhibited larger areas for the Process<sub>MG</sub>-to-Soma<sub>IN</sub> interactions. Second, in APP/PS1 mice, although the overall microglia interactions with interneurons remained preserved, the fraction of interneurons receiving putative microglia contacts on their dendrites was reduced, and larger areas of interactions were observed for somatic contacts, suggesting a stronger modulation of the interneuron output by microglia in AD. In summary, these results reveal microglia as important partners of hippocampal PV+ and SOM+ GABAergic cells, with interneuron type-specific pattern of interactions. Thus, microglia may play an essential role in the operation of interneurons under normal conditions and their dysfunction in disease.</p>

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Neuroscience lacks a diverse repertoire of model organisms, resulting in an incomplete understanding of the general principles of neural function. Ctenophores display many neurobiological and experimental features which make them a promising candidate to fill this gap. They possess a nerve net distributed across their body surface in the epithelial layer. There is a long-held assumption that nerve nets are “simple” and lack distinct organizational principles. We want to challenge this assumption and determine how stereotyped the structure of this network is. We estimated body surface area in <i>Pleurobrachia pileus</i> using custom optical projection tomography and light sheet morphometry imaging systems. Using an antibody against tyrosinated α-tubulin, we visualized the nerve net in situ and quantified the geometric properties using an automated segmentation approach. We characterized organizational rules of the epithelial nerve net in animals of different sizes and at different regions of the body. We found that specific morphological features within the nerve net are largely unchanged during growth. These properties must be essential to the functionality of the nervous system and therefore are maintained during a change in body size. We have also established the principles of organization of the network and showed that some of the geometric properties are variable across different parts of the body. This suggests that there may be different functions occurring in regions with different structural characteristics. This is the most comprehensive structural description of a ctenophore nerve net to date and demonstrates the amenability of <i>P. pileus</i> for whole organism network analysis.</p>

     alt="The lateral posterior clock neurons of Drosophila melanogaster express three neuropeptides and have multiple connections within the circadian clock network and beyond"/>
<p>The authors characterized <i>Drosophila</i>’s lateral posterior neurons (LPNs) that belong to the circadian clock neurons. They demonstrate that the LPNs are well connected to the other clock neurons (s-LN<sub>v</sub>, LN<sub>d</sub>, DN<sub>2</sub>, DN<sub>1p</sub>) and to putative wake and sleep centers as well as centers that control temperature preference, metabolism, feeding, and oviposition (e.g., the <i>pars intercerebralis</i> (PI), the mushroom body (MB), and the dorsal fan-shaped body(dFB)). The LPNs get input from the small ventrolateral clock neurons (s-LN<sub>v</sub>) and may signal to the downstream neurons and centers via direct synapses and/or via three neuropeptides (AstA, AstC, and DH31), which they express rhythmically. Furthermore, the authors show that the LPNs are heterogeneous (LPN-Type 1 and LPN-Type 2) and appear to have opposing roles on activity and sleep.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p><i>Drosophila</i>’s lateral posterior neurons (LPNs) belong to a small group of circadian clock neurons that is so far not characterized in detail. Thanks to a new highly specific split-Gal4 line, here we describe LPNs’ morphology in fine detail, their synaptic connections, daily bimodal expression of neuropeptides, and propose a putative role of this cluster in controlling daily activity and sleep patterns. We found that the three LPNs are heterogeneous. Two of the neurons with similar morphology arborize in the superior medial and lateral protocerebrum and most likely promote sleep. One unique, possibly wakefulness-promoting, neuron with wider arborizations extends from the superior lateral protocerebrum toward the anterior optic tubercle. Both LPN types exhibit manifold connections with the other circadian clock neurons, especially with those that control the flies’ morning and evening activity (M- and E-neurons, respectively). In addition, they form synaptic connections with neurons of the mushroom bodies, the fan-shaped body, and with many additional still unidentified neurons. We found that both LPN types rhythmically express three neuropeptides, Allostatin A, Allostatin C, and Diuretic Hormone 31 with maxima in the morning and the evening. The three LPN neuropeptides may, furthermore, signal to the insect hormonal center in the <i>pars intercerebralis</i> and contribute to rhythmic modulation of metabolism, feeding, and reproduction. We discuss our findings in the light of anatomical details gained by the recently published hemibrain of a single female fly on the electron microscopic level and of previous functional studies concerning the LPN.</p>

<p>We induced chronic ocular hypertension (OHT) by laser photocoagulation and then characterized the survival of general retinal ganglion cell (RGC) and intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cell (ipRGC) subtypes. We found that ipRGCs suffer significant loss, similar to the general RGC population, but ipRGC subtypes are differentially affected following chronic OHT. M4 ipRGCs are susceptible to chronic OHT, while M1 ipRGCs exhibit almost no cell loss following chronic OHT. Accordingly, we induced OHT bilaterally and observed that circadian re-entrainment and circadian rhythmicity are largely not disrupted in these mice.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases characterized by retinal ganglion cell (RGC) loss and optic nerve damage. Studies, including this study, support that RGCs degenerate and die in a type-specific manner following the disease insult. Here we specifically examined one RGC type, the intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cell (ipRGC), and its associated functional deficits in a mouse model of experimental glaucoma. We induced chronic ocular hypertension (OHT) by laser photocoagulation and then characterized the survival of ipRGC subtypes. We found that ipRGCs suffer significant loss, similar to the general RGC population, but ipRGC subtypes are differentially affected following chronic OHT. M4 ipRGCs, which are involved in pattern vision, are susceptible to chronic OHT. Correspondingly, mice with chronic OHT experience reduced contrast sensitivity and visual acuity. By comparison, M1 ipRGCs, which project to the suprachiasmatic nuclei to regulate circadian rhythmicity, exhibit almost no cell loss following chronic OHT. Accordingly, we observed that circadian re-entrainment and circadian rhythmicity are largely not disrupted in OHT mice. Our study demonstrates the link between subtype-specific ipRGC survival and behavioral deficits in glaucomatous mice. These findings provide insight into glaucoma-induced visual behavioral deficits and their underlying mechanisms.</p>

<p>We provide the first neuroanatomical description of RFRP (precursor peptide of gonadotropin-inhibitory hormone) expression and localization in the brain of any bat using a widespread temperate species (<i>Eptesicus fuscus</i>, big brown bat) as a model. We found that RFRP mRNA expression occurs in the hypothalamus, testes, and ovaries of big brown bats with cellular RFRP peptide immunoreactivity across the hypothalamus, arcuate nucleus, and median eminence. Putative contact between RFRP fibers and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) cell bodies were observed in the brain, suggesting potential for direct inhibition of downstream reproductive behavior and physiology via RFRP signaling to GnRH cells. Our work highlights utility of the unique annual reproductive life history of temperate bats—including extended reproductive suppression in overwintering females and asynchronous upregulation between sexes—and provides the foundation for exploring the neuroendocrine and molecular mechanisms regulating the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis of bats in response to seasonal/environmental cues.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Gonadotropin-inhibitory hormone (GnIH, also known RFRP-3 in mammals) is an important regulator of the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis and downstream reproductive physiology. Substantial species differences exist in the localization of cell bodies producing RFRP-3 and patterns of fiber immunoreactivity in the brain, raising the question of functional differences. Many temperate bat species exhibit unusual annual reproductive patterns. Male bats upregulate spermatogenesis in late spring which is asynchronous with periods of mating in the fall, while females have the physiological capacity to delay their reproductive investment over winter via sperm storage or delayed ovulation/fertilization. Neuroendocrine mechanisms regulating reproductive timing in male and female bats are not well-studied. We provide the first description of RFRP—precursor peptide of GnIH —expression and localization in the brain of any bat using a widespread temperate species (<i>Eptesicus fuscus</i>, big brown bat) as a model. RFRP mRNA expression was detected in the hypothalamus, testes, and ovaries of big brown bats. Cellular RFRP-immunoreactivity was observed within the periventricular nuclei, dorsomedial nucleus of the hypothalamus, arcuate nucleus (Arc), and median eminence (ME). As in other vertebrates, RFRP fiber immunoreactivity was widespread, with the greatest density observed in the hypothalamus, preoptic area, Arc, ME, midbrain, and thalamic nuclei. Putative interactions between RFRP-ir fibers and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) cell bodies were observed in 16% of GnRH-immunoreactive cells, suggesting direct regulation of GnRH via RFRP signaling. This characterization of RFRP distribution contributes to a deeper understanding of bat neuroendocrinology, which serves as foundation for manipulative approaches examining changes in reproductive neuropeptide signaling in response to environmental and physiological challenges within, and among, bat species.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Immunoreactivity for calcium-/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) in the primate dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) has been attributed to geniculocortical relay neurons and has also been suggested to arise from terminals of retinal ganglion cells. Here, we combined immunostaining with single-cell injections to investigate the expression of CaMKII in retinal ganglion cells of three primate species: macaque (<i>Macaca fascicularis</i>, <i>M. nemestrina</i>), human, and marmoset (<i>Callithrix jacchus</i>). We found that in all species, about 2%–10% of the total ganglion cell population expressed CaMKII. In all species, CaMKII was expressed by multiple types of wide-field ganglion cell including large sparse, giant sparse (melanopsin-expressing), broad thorny, and narrow thorny cells. Three other ganglion cells types, namely, inner and outer stratifying maze cells in macaque and tufted cells in marmoset were also found. Double labeling experiments showed that CaMKII-expressing cells included inner and outer stratifying melanopsin cells. Nearly all CaMKII-expressing ganglion cell types identified here are known to project to the koniocellular layers of the dLGN as well as to the superior colliculus. The best characterized koniocellular projecting cell type—the small bistratified (blue ON/yellow OFF) cell—was, however, not CaMKII-positive in any species. Our results indicate that the pattern of CaMKII expression in retinal ganglion cells is largely conserved across different species of primate suggesting a common functional role. But the results also show that CaMKII is not a marker for all koniocellular projecting retinal ganglion cells.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Chaotic and stochastic dynamics of epileptiform-like activities in sclerotic hippocampus resected from patients with pharmacoresistant epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Noemi S. Araújo, Selvin Z. Reyes-Garcia, João A. F. Brogin, Douglas D. Bueno, Esper A. Cavalheiro, Carla A. Scorza, Jean Faber</p>

The types of epileptiform activity occurring in the sclerotic hippocampus with highest incidence are interictal-like events (II) and periodic ictal spiking (PIS). These activities are classified according to their event rates, but it is still unclear if these rate differences are consequences of underlying physiological mechanisms. Identifying new and more specific information related to these two activities may bring insights to a better understanding about the epileptogenic process and new diagnosis. We applied Poincaré map analysis and Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA) onto 35 <i>in vitro</i> electrophysiological signals recorded from slices of 12 hippocampal tissues surgically resected from patients with pharmacoresistant temporal lobe epilepsy. These analyzes showed that the II activity is related to chaotic dynamics, whereas the PIS activity is related to deterministic periodic dynamics. Additionally, it indicates that their different rates are consequence of different endogenous dynamics. Finally, by using two computational models we were able to simulate the transition between II and PIS activities. The RQA was applied to different periods of these simulations to compare the recurrences between artificial and real signals, showing that different ranges of regularity-chaoticity can be directly associated with the generation of PIS and II activities.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">SNX27–Retromer directly binds ESCPE-1 to transfer cargo proteins during endosomal recycling</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Boris Simonetti, Qian Guo, Manuel Giménez-Andrés, Kai-En Chen, Edmund R. R. Moody, Ashley J. Evans, Mintu Chandra, Chris M. Danson, Tom A. Williams, Brett M. Collins, Peter J. Cullen</p>

Coat complexes coordinate cargo recognition through cargo adaptors with biogenesis of transport carriers during integral membrane protein trafficking. Here, we combine biochemical, structural, and cellular analyses to establish the mechanistic basis through which SNX27–Retromer, a major endosomal cargo adaptor, couples to the membrane remodeling endosomal SNX-BAR sorting complex for promoting exit 1 (ESCPE-1). In showing that the SNX27 FERM (4.1/ezrin/radixin/moesin) domain directly binds acidic-Asp-Leu-Phe (aDLF) motifs in the SNX1/SNX2 subunits of ESCPE-1, we propose a handover model where SNX27–Retromer captured cargo proteins are transferred into ESCPE-1 transport carriers to promote endosome-to-plasma membrane recycling. By revealing that assembly of the SNX27:Retromer:ESCPE-1 coat evolved in a stepwise manner during early metazoan evolution, likely reflecting the increasing complexity of endosome-to-plasma membrane recycling from the ancestral opisthokont to modern animals, we provide further evidence of the functional diversification of yeast pentameric Retromer in the recycling of hundreds of integral membrane proteins in metazoans.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Why did only one genus of insects, Halobates, take to the high seas?</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Lanna Cheng, Himanshu Mishra</p>

Oceans cover more than 70% of the Earth’s surface and house a dizzying array of organisms. Mammals, birds, and all manner of fish can be commonly sighted at sea, but insects, the world’s most common animals, seem to be completely absent. Appearances can deceive, however, as 5 species of the ocean skater <i>Halobates</i> live exclusively at the ocean surface. Discovered 200 years ago, these peppercorn-sized insects remain rather mysterious. How do they cope with life at the ocean surface, and why are they the only genus of insects to have taken to the high seas?

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">Intercellular signaling by ectodomain shedding at the synapse</a></h4>

              
                Ectodomain shedding (ES) is a post-translational protein modification process that plays key roles in health and disease. Many neuronal and synaptic membrane proteins are known to undergo ES, but the complexity of functions regulated by the shed peptides is only beginning to be unraveled. Here, we provide an overview of emerging evidence demonstrating that synaptic ES can mediate autocrine and paracrine signaling. We also discuss how advances in large-scale proteomic analyses are leading to the identification of novel synaptic proteins undergoing ES, as well as the targets and functions of their soluble ectodomains.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/inpress.rss">Deficits in decision-making induced by parietal cortex inactivation are compensated at two timescales</a></h4>

              
                Jeurissen et al. inactivate a parietal cortical area thought to play a role in perceptual decision-making. Silencing causes monkeys to bias decisions, consistent with partial hemineglect. The bias dissipates over 30 min and over subsequent experiments. The results expose a capacity of the brain to compensate for focal insult.

                Zong et al. discover an unexpected association between the oxidative stress-sensitive ion channel TRPM2 and the extrasynaptic NMDA receptor (NMDAR) in the neurons, which enhances excitotoxicity during ischemic brain injury. Neuron-specific knockout of TRPM2 or uncoupling of the TRPM2-NMDAR association using an interfering peptide protects mice against ischemic stroke.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A point mutation in the nucleotide exchange factor eIF2B constitutively activates the integrated stress response by allosteric modulation</a></h4>

              
                In eukaryotic cells, stressors reprogram the cellular proteome by activating the integrated stress response (ISR). In its canonical form, stress-sensing kinases phosphorylate the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF2 (eIF2-P), which ultimately leads to reduced levels of ternary complex required for initiation of mRNA translation. Previously we showed that translational control is primarily exerted through a conformational switch in eIF2's nucleotide exchange factor, eIF2B, which shifts from its active A-State conformation to its inhibited I-State conformation upon eIF2-P binding, resulting in reduced nucleotide exchange on eIF2 (Schoof et al. 2021). Here, we show functionally and structurally how a single histidine to aspartate point mutation in eIF2B's β subunit (H160D) mimics the effects of eIF2-P binding by promoting an I-State like conformation, resulting in eIF2-P independent activation of the ISR. These findings corroborate our previously proposed A/I-State model of allosteric ISR regulation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Drosophila TRPg is required in neuroendocrine cells for post-ingestive food selection</a></h4>

              
                The mechanism through which the brain senses the metabolic state, enabling an animal to regulate food consumption, and discriminate between nutritional and non-nutritional foods is a fundamental question. Flies choose the sweeter non-nutritive sugar, L-glucose, over the nutritive D-glucose if they are not starved. However, under starvation conditions, they switch their preference to D-glucose, and this occurs independent of peripheral taste neurons. Here, we found that eliminating the TRPγ channel impairs the ability of starved flies to choose D-glucose. This food selection depends on <i>trpγ</i> expression in neurosecretory cells in the brain that express Diuretic hormone 44 (DH44). Loss of <i>trpγ</i> increases feeding, alters the physiology of the crop, which is the fly stomach equivalent, and decreases intracellular sugars and glycogen levels. Moreover, survival of starved <i>trpγ</i> flies is reduced. Expression of <i>trpγ</i> in DH44 neurons reverses these deficits. These results highlight roles for TRPγ in coordinating feeding with the metabolic state through expression in DH44 neuroendocrine cells.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A mechano-osmotic feedback couples cell volume to the rate of cell deformation</a></h4>

              
                Mechanics has been a central focus of physical biology in the past decade. In comparison, how cells manage their size is less understood. Here we show that a parameter central to both the physics and the physiology of the cell, its volume, depends on a mechano-osmotic coupling. We found that cells change their volume depending on the rate at which they change shape, when they spontaneously spread are externally deformed. Cells undergo slow deformation at constant volume, while fast deformation leads to volume loss. We propose a mechano-sensitive pump and leak model to explain this phenomenon. Our model and experiments suggest that volume modulation depends on the state of the actin cortex and the coupling of ion fluxes to membrane tension. This mechano-osmotic coupling defines a membrane tension homeostasis module constantly at work in cells, causing volume fluctuations associated with fast cell shape changes, with potential consequences on cellular physiology.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Aspirin’s effect on kinetic parameters of cells contributes to its role in reducing incidence of advanced colorectal adenomas, shown by a multiscale computational study</a></h4>

              
                Aspirin intake has been shown to lead to significant protection against colorectal cancer, for example with an up to twofold reduction in colorectal adenoma incidence rates at higher doses. The mechanisms contributing to protection are not yet fully understood. While aspirin is an anti-inflammatory drug and can thus influence the tumor microenvironment, in vitro and in vivo experiments have recently shown that aspirin can also have a direct effect on cellular kinetics and fitness. It reduces the rate of tumor cell division and increases the rate of cell death. The question arises whether such changes in cellular fitness are sufficient to significantly contribute to the epidemiologically observed protection. To investigate this, we constructed a class of mathematical models of in vivo evolution of advanced adenomas, parameterized it with available estimates, and calculated population level incidence. Fitting the predictions to age incidence data revealed that only a model that included colonic crypt competition can account for the observed age-incidence curve. This model was then used to predict modified incidence patterns if cellular kinetics were altered as a result of aspirin treatment. We found that changes in cellular fitness that were within the experimentally observed ranges could reduce advanced adenoma incidence by a sufficient amount to account for age incidence data in aspirin-treated patient cohorts. While the mechanisms that contribute to the protective effect of aspirin are likely complex and multi-factorial, our study demonstrates that direct aspirin-induced changes of tumor cell fitness can significantly contribute to epidemiologically observed reduced incidence patterns.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Windborne migration amplifies insect-mediated pollination services</a></h4>

              
                Worldwide, hoverflies (Syrphidae: Diptera) provide crucial ecosystem services such as pollination and biological pest control. Although many hoverfly species exhibit migratory behavior, the spatiotemporal facets of these movement dynamics and their ecosystem services implications are poorly understood. In this study, we use long-term (16 yr) trapping records, trajectory analysis and intrinsic (i.e., isotope, genetic, pollen) markers to describe migration patterns of the hoverfly <i>Episyrphus balteatus</i> in northern China. Our work reveals how <i>E. balteatus </i>migrate northward during spring-summer and exhibits return (long-range) migration during autumn. The extensive genetic mixing and high genetic diversity of <i>E. balteatus</i> populations underscore its adaptive capacity to environmental disturbances e.g., climate change. Pollen markers and molecular gut-analysis further illuminate how <i>E. balteatus</i> visits min. 1,012 flowering plant species (39 orders) over space and time. By thus delineating <i>E. balteatus</i> trans-regional movements and pollination networks, we advance our understanding of its migration ecology and facilitate the design of targeted strategies to conserve and enhance its ecosystem services.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Protection of nascent DNA at stalled replication forks is mediated by phosphorylation of RIF1 intrinsically disordered region</a></h4>

              
                RIF1 is a multifunctional protein that plays key roles in the regulation of DNA processing. During repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), RIF1 functions in the 53BP1-Shieldin pathway that inhibits resection of DNA ends to modulate the cellular decision on which repair pathway to engage. Under conditions of replication stress, RIF1 protects nascent DNA at stalled replication forks from degradation by the DNA2 nuclease. How these RIF1 activities are regulated at the post-translational level has not yet been elucidated. Here, we identified a cluster of conserved ATM/ATR consensus SQ motifs within the intrinsically disordered region (IDR) of mouse RIF1 that are phosphorylated in proliferating B lymphocytes. We found that phosphorylation of the conserved IDR SQ cluster is dispensable for the inhibition of DSB resection by RIF1, but is essential to counteract DNA2-dependent degradation of nascent DNA at stalled replication forks. Therefore, our study identifies a key molecular feature that enables the genome-protective function of RIF1 during DNA replication stress.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Free spermidine evokes superoxide radicals that manifest toxicity</a></h4>

              
                Spermidine and other polyamines alleviate oxidative stress, yet excess spermidine seems toxic to <i>Escherichia coli</i> unless it is neutralized by SpeG, an enzyme for the spermidine N-acetyl transferase function. Thus, wild-type <i>E. coli</i> can tolerate applied exogenous spermidine stress, but D<i>speG</i> strain of <i>E. coli</i> fails to do that. Here, using different ROS probes and performing electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, we provide evidence that although spermidine mitigates oxidative stress by lowering overall ROS levels, excess of it simultaneously triggers the production of superoxide radicals, thereby causing toxicity in the D<i>speG</i> strain. Furthermore, performing microarray experiment and other biochemical assays, we show that the spermidine-induced superoxide anions affected redox balance and iron homeostasis. Finally, we demonstrate that while RNA-bound spermidine inhibits iron oxidation, free spermidine interacts and oxidizes the iron to evoke superoxide radicals directly. Therefore, we propose that the spermidine-induced superoxide generation is one of the major causes of spermidine toxicity in <i>E. coli</i>.

                Theories of Prefrontal Cortex (PFC) as optimizing <i>reward</i> value have been widely deployed to explain its activity in a diverse range of contexts, with substantial empirical support in neuroeconomics and decision neuroscience. Similar neural circuits, however, have also been associated with information processing. By using computational modeling, model-based fMRI analysis, and a novel experimental paradigm, we aim at establishing whether a dedicated and independent value system for information exists in the human PFC. We identify two regions in the human PFC which independently encode reward and information. Our results provide empirical evidence for PFC as an optimizer of independent information and reward signals during decision-making under realistic scenarios, with potential implications for the interpretation of PFC activity in both healthy and clinical populations.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Genetic variation of putative myokine signaling is dominated by biologic sex and sex hormones</a></h4>

              
                Skeletal muscle plays an integral role in coordinating physiologic homeostasis, where signaling to other tissues via myokines allows for coordination of complex processes. Here, we aimed to leverage natural genetic correlation structure of gene expression both within and across tissues to understand how muscle interacts with metabolic tissues. Specifically, we performed a survey of genetic correlations focused on myokine gene regulation, muscle cell composition, cross-tissue signaling and interactions with genetic sex in humans. While expression levels of a majority of myokines and cell proportions within skeletal muscle showed little relative differences between males and females, nearly all significant cross-tissue enrichments operated in a sex-specific or hormone-dependent fashion; in particular, with estradiol. These sex- and hormone-specific effects were consistent across key metabolic tissues: liver, pancreas, hypothalamus, intestine, heart, visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue. To characterize the role of estradiol receptor signaling on myokine expression, we generated male and female mice which lack estrogen receptor α specifically in skeletal muscle (MERKO) and integrated with human data. These analyses highlighted potential mechanisms of sex-dependent myokine signaling conserved between species, such as myostatin enriched for divergent substrate utilization pathways between sexes. Several other putative sex-dependent mechanisms of myokine signaling were uncovered, such as muscle-derived <i>TNFA</i> enriched for stronger inflammatory signaling in females compared to males and <i>GPX3</i> as a male-specific link between glycolytic fiber abundance and hepatic inflammation. Collectively, we provide a population genetics framework for inferring muscle signaling to metabolic tissues in humans. We further highlight sex and estradiol receptor signaling as critical variables when assaying myokine functions and how changes in cell composition are predicted to impact other metabolic organs.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Neuronal origins of reduced accuracy and biases in economic choices under sequential offers</a></h4>

              
                Economic choices are characterized by a variety of biases. Understanding their origins is a long-term goal for neuroeconomics, but progress on this front has been limited. Here we examined choice biases observed when two goods are offered sequentially. In the experiments, rhesus monkeys chose between different juices offered simultaneously or in sequence. Choices under sequential offers were less accurate (higher variability). They were also biased in favor of the second offer (order bias) and in favor of the preferred juice (preference bias). Analysis of neuronal activity recorded in the orbitofrontal cortex revealed that these phenomena emerged at different computational stages. Lower choice accuracy reflected weaker offer value signals (valuation stage), the order bias emerged during value comparison (decision stage), and the preference bias emerged late in the trial (post-comparison). By neuronal measures, each phenomenon reduced the value obtained on average in each trial and was thus costly to the monkey.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Autoinhibition and regulation by phosphoinositides of ATP8B1, a human lipid flippase associated with intrahepatic cholestatic disorders</a></h4>

              
                P4-ATPases flip lipids from the exoplasmic to the cytosolic leaflet, thus maintaining lipid asymmetry in eukaryotic cell membranes. Mutations in several human P4-ATPase genes are associated with severe diseases, e.g. in <i>ATP8B1</i> causing progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis, a rare inherited disorder progressing toward liver failure. ATP8B1 forms a binary complex with CDC50A and displays a broad specificity to glycerophospholipids, but regulatory mechanisms are unknown. Here, we report functional studies and the cryo-EM structure of the human lipid flippase ATP8B1-CDC50A at 3.1 Å resolution. We find that ATP8B1 is autoinhibited by its N- and C-terminal tails, which form extensive interactions with the catalytic sites and flexible domain interfaces. Consistently, ATP hydrolysis is unleashed by truncation of the C-terminus, but also requires phosphoinositides, most markedly phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-phosphate (PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>), and removal of both N- and C-termini results in full activation. Restored inhibition of ATP8B1 truncation constructs with a synthetic peptide mimicking the C-terminal segment further suggests molecular communication between N- and C-termini in the autoinhibition and demonstrates that the regulatory mechanism can be interfered with by exogenous compounds. A recurring (G/A)(Y/F)AFS motif of the C-terminal segment suggests that this mechanism is employed widely across P4-ATPase lipid flippases in plasma membrane and endomembranes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Catecholaminergic cell type-specific expression of Cre recombinase in knock-in transgenic rats generated by the Combi-CRISPR technology</a></h4>

              
                Background: Cell groups containing catecholamines provide a useful model to study the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the morphogenesis, physiology, and pathology of the central nervous system. For this purpose, it is necessary to establish a system to induce catecholaminergic group-specific expression of Cre recombinase. Recently, we introduced a gene cassette encoding 2A peptide fused to Cre recombinase into the site between the C-terminus and translational termination codons of the rat tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) open reading frame by the Combi-CRISPR technology, which is a genomic editing method to enable an efficient knock-in (KI) of long DNA sequence into a target site. However, the expression patterns of the transgene and its function as well as the effect of the mutation on the biochemical and behavioral phenotypes in the KI strains have not been characterized yet. New Method: We aimed to evaluate the usefulness of TH-Cre KI rats as an experimental model for investigating the structure and function of catecholaminergic neurons in the brain. Results: We detected cell type-specific expression of Cre recombinase and site-specific recombination activity in the representative catecholaminergic groups in the TH-Cre KI rat strains. In addition, we measured TH expression level and catecholamine accumulation in the brain regions, and spontaneous locomotion, indicating that catecholamine metabolism and general behavior are apparently normal in these KI rats. Conclusions: TH-Cre KI rat strains produced by the Combi-CRISPR system offer a beneficial model to study the molecular and cellular mechanics for the morphogenesis, physiology, and pathology of catecholamine-containing neurons in the brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Low-efficiency conversion of proliferative glia into induced neurons by Ascl1 in the postnatal mouse cerebral cortex in vivo</a></h4>

              
                The proneural transcription factor Achaete-scute complex-like 1 (Ascl1) is a major regulator of neural progenitor fate, implicated both in neurogenesis and oligodendrogliogenesis. Ascl1 has been widely used to reprogram non-neuronal cells into induced neurons. In vitro, Ascl1 induces efficient reprogramming of proliferative astroglia from the early postnatal cerebral cortex into interneuron-like cells. Here, we examined whether Ascl1 can similarly induce neuronal reprogramming of glia undergoing proliferation in the postnatal mouse cerebral cortex in vivo. Toward this, we targeted cortical glia at the peak of proliferative expansion (i.e., postnatal day 5) by injecting a retrovirus encoding for Ascl1 into the mouse cerebral cortex. In sharp contrast to the very efficient reprogramming in vitro, Ascl1-transduced glial cells were converted into doublecortin-immunoreactive neurons only with low efficiency in vivo. Interfering with the phosphorylation of Ascl1 by mutation of six conserved proline-directed serine/threonine phosphorylation sites (Ascl1SA6) has been previously shown to increase its neurogenic activity in the early embryonic cerebral cortex. We therefore tested whether transduction of proliferative glia with a retrovirus encoding Ascl1SA6 improved their conversion into neurons. While in vitro glia-to-neuron conversion was markedly enhanced, in vivo reprogramming efficiency remained low. However, both wild-type and mutant Ascl1 reduced the relative number of cells expressing the astrocytic marker glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and increased the relative number of cells expressing the oligodendroglial marker Sox10 in vivo. Together, our results indicate that the enhanced neurogenic response of proliferative postnatal glia to Ascl1SA6 versus Ascl1 observed in vitro is not recapitulated in vivo.

                As we learn, dynamic memory processes build structured knowledge across our experiences. Such knowledge enables the formation of internal models of the world that we use to plan, make decisions, and act. Recent theorizing posits that mnemonic mechanisms of differentiation and integration - which at one level may seem to be at odds - both contribute to the emergence of structured knowledge. We tested this possibility using fMRI as human participants learned to navigate within local and global virtual environments over the course of three days. Pattern similarity analyses on entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, and ventromedial prefrontal cortex patterns revealed evidence that differentiation and integration work concurrently to build local and global environmental representations, and that variability in integration relates to differences in navigation efficiency. These results offer new insights into the neural machinery and the underlying mechanisms that translate experiences into structured knowledge that allows us to navigate to achieve goals.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Reelin deficiency exacerbates cocaine-induced hyperlocomotion by enhancing neuronal activity in the dorsomedial striatum.</a></h4>

              
                The Reln gene encodes for the extracellular glycoprotein Reelin, which regulates several brain functions from development to adulthood, including neuronal migration, dendritic growth and branching, and synapse formation and plasticity. Human studies have implicated Reelin signaling in several neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. Mouse studies using the heterozygous Reeler (HR) mice have shown that reduced levels of Reln expression are associated with deficits in learning and memory and increased disinhibition. Although these traits are relevant to substance use disorders, the role of Reelin in cellular and behavioral responses to addictive drugs remains largely unknown. Here, we compared HR mice to wild-type (WT) littermate controls to investigate the contribution of Reelin signaling to the hyper-locomotor and rewarding effects of cocaine. After a single cocaine injection, HR mice showed enhanced cocaine-induced locomotor activity compared to WT controls. After repeated injections of cocaine, Reelin deficiency also led to increased cocaine-induced locomotor sensitization, which persisted after withdrawal. In contrast, Reelin deficiency did not affect the rewarding effects of cocaine measured in the conditioned place preference assay. The elevated cocaine-induced hyper-locomotion in HR mice resulted in increased Fos expression in the dorsal medial striatum (DMS) compared to WT. Lastly, we found that Reln was highly co-expressed with the Drd1 gene, which encodes for the dopamine receptor D1, in the DMS. These findings demonstrated that Reelin signaling contributes to the locomotory effects of cocaine and improved our understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the cellular and behavioral effects of cocaine.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Nav1.2 and BK channels interaction shapes the action potential in the axon initial segment</a></h4>

              
                In neocortical layer-5 pyramidal neurons, the action potential (AP) is generated in the axon initial segment (AIS) when the membrane potential (Vm) reaches the threshold for activation of two diverse voltage-gated Na+ channels, that differ in spatial distribution and biophysical properties. Yet, the understanding of specific functional differences between these two channels remains elusive. Here, using ultrafast Na+, Vm and Ca2+ imaging in combination with partial block of Nav1.2 by a recent peptide, we demonstrate an exclusive role of Nav1.2 in shaping the generating AP. Precisely, Ca2+ influx via Nav1.2 activates BK Ca2+-activated K+ channels determining the amplitude and the early phase of repolarisation of the AP in the AIS. We mimicked this result with a NEURON model where the role of the different ion channels tested reproduced the experimental evidence. The exclusive role of Nav1.2 reported here is important for understanding the physiology and pathology of neuronal excitability.

                Across the transition from childhood to adolescence the human brain experiences profound functional changes, shifting from an organizational framework anchored within somatosensory/motor and visual regions into one that is balanced through interactions with later-maturing aspects of association cortex. Here, we provide evidence linking this profile of large-scale functional reorganization to developmental shifts in attention network connectivity. We demonstrate that changes in functional connectivity between childhood and adolescence are preferential to the salience/ventral attention network. Excluding these network-linked vertices from analysis effectively removes developmental changes in cortical organization, while connectivity within the ventral attention network predicts intellectual ability. Children with low ventral attention network connectivity exhibit adolescent-like topographical profiles, suggesting attentional systems may be critically important for understanding how brain functions are refined across development. These data highlight a core role for the ventral attention network in supporting age-dependent shifts in the macroscale organization of cortex across development.

                Alzheimer's disease (AD), the leading cause of dementia, affects millions of people worldwide. With no disease-modifying medication currently available, the human toll and economic costs are rising rapidly. Under current standards, a patient is diagnosed with AD when both cognitive decline and pathology (amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles) are present. Remarkably, some individuals who have AD pathology remain cognitively normal. Uncovering factors that lead to "cognitive resilience" to AD is a promising path to create new targets for therapies. However, technical challenges discovering novel human resilience factors limit testing, validation, and nomination of novel drugs for AD. In this study, we use single-nuclear transcriptional profiles of postmortem cortex from human individuals with high AD pathology who were either cognitively normal (resilient) or cognitively impaired (susceptible) at time of death, as well as mouse strains that parallel these differences in cognition with high amyloid. Our cross-species discovery approach highlights a novel role for excitatory layer 4/5 cortical neurons in promoting cognitive resilience to AD, and nominates several resilience genes that include ATP1A1, GABRB1, PTK2, and ROCK2. Nominated resilience genes were tested for replication in orthogonal data sets and confirmed to be correlated with cognitive resilience. Additionally, we identified several potential mechanisms of resilience, including regulation of membrane potential, axonal and dendritic growth, and general increase of protein cycle, potentially of membrane proteins. Because our discovery of resilience-associated genes in layer 4/5 cortical neurons originates from an integrated human and mouse transcriptomic space from susceptible and resilient individuals, we are positioned to test causality and perform mechanistic, validation, and pre-clinical studies in our human-relevant AD-BXD mouse panel.

                Excitatory cortical neurons show clear tuning to stimulus features, but the tuning properties of inhibitory neurons are ambiguous and have been the subject of a long debate. While inhibitory neurons have been considered to be largely untuned, recent studies show that some parvalbumin-expressing (PV) neurons do show feature selectivity and participate in co-tuned subnetworks with pyramidal cells in which PV cells show high response similarity to the excitatory (E) neurons. Given shared input from layer 4 that drives feature tuning in excitatory subnetworks, we demonstrate that homeostatic regulation of postsynaptic firing rate governing the synaptic dynamics of the connections from PV to E cells, in combination with heterogeneity in the excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSP) that impinge on PV cells, results in the self-organization of PV subnetworks. We reconcile different experimental findings by showing that feature tuning of PV cells is an emerging network property that may be driven by synaptic heterogeneity, and can be inferred using population-level measures, while pairwise individual-level measures may fail to reveal inhibitory tuning. We show that such co-tuning can enhance network stability at the cost of response salience.

                Similarities and differences in brain structure and function across species is of major interest in systems neuroscience, comparative biology, and brain mapping. Recently, increased emphasis has been placed on tertiary sulci, which are shallow indentations of the cerebral cortex that appear last in gestation, continue to develop after birth, and are largely either human- or hominoid-specific. While tertiary sulcal morphology in lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) has been linked to functional representations and cognition in humans, it is presently unknown if LPFC tertiary sulci also exist in non-human hominoids. To fill this gap in knowledge, we leveraged two freely available multimodal datasets to address the following main question: Can LPFC tertiary sulci be defined in chimpanzee cortical surfaces from human predictions? We found that 1-3 components of the posterior middle frontal sulcus (pmfs) in the posterior middle frontal gyrus are identifiable in nearly all chimpanzee hemispheres. In stark contrast to the consistency of the pmfs components, we could only identify components of the paraintermediate frontal sulcus (pimfs) in two chimpanzee hemispheres. LPFC tertiary sulci were relatively smaller and shallower in chimpanzees compared to humans. In both species, two of the pmfs components were deeper in the right compared to the left hemisphere. As these results have direct implications for future studies interested in the functional and cognitive role of LPFC tertiary sulci across species, we share probabilistic predictions of the three pmfs components to guide the definitions of these sulci in future studies.

                Mechanical force is crucial in guiding axon outgrowth, before and after synapse formation. This process is referred to as stretch-growth. However, how neurons transduce mechanical inputs into signaling pathways remains poorly understood. Another open question is how stretch-growth is coupled in time with the intercalated addition of new mass along the entire axon. Here, we demonstrate that active mechanical force generated by magnetic nano-pulling induces a remodeling of the axonal cytoskeleton. Specifically, the increase in the axonal density of microtubules leads to an accumulation of organelles and signaling vesicles which, in turn, promotes local translation by increasing the probability of assembly of the translation factories. The modulation of axonal transport and local translation sustains enhanced axon outgrowth and synapse maturation.

                From visual perception to language, sensory stimuli change their meaning depending on prior experience. Recurrent neural dynamics can interpret stimuli based on externally cued context, but it is unknown whether similar dynamics can compute and employ internal hypotheses to resolve ambiguities. Here, we show that mouse retrosplenial cortex (RSC) can form hypotheses over time and perform spatial reasoning through recurrent dynamics. In our task, mice navigated using ambiguous landmarks that are identified through their mutual spatial relationship, requiring sequential refinement of hypotheses. Neurons in RSC and in artificial neural networks encoded mixtures of hypotheses, location, and sensory information, and were constrained by robust low dimensional dynamics. RSC encoded hypotheses as locations in activity space with divergent trajectories for identical sensory inputs, enabling their correct interpretation. Our results indicate that interactions between internal hypotheses and external sensory data in recurrent circuits can provide a substrate for complex sequential cognitive reasoning.

                Understanding the connection between the brain's structural connectivity and its functional connectivity is of immense interest in computational neuroscience. Although some studies have suggested that whole brain functional connectivity is shaped by the underlying structure, the rule by which anatomy constrains brain dynamics remains an open question. In this work, we introduce a computational framework that identifies a joint subspace of eigenmodes for both functional and structural connectomes. We found that a small number of those eigenmodes are sufficient to reconstruct functional connectivity from the structural connectome, thus serving as low-dimensional basis function set. We then develop an algorithm that can estimate the functional eigenspectrum in this joint space from the structural eigenspectrum. By concurrently estimating the joint eigenmodes and the functional eigenspectrum, we can reconstruct a given subject's functional connectivity from their structural connectome. We perform elaborate experiments and demonstrate that the proposed algorithm for estimating function connectivity from the structural connectome using joint space eigenmodes is superior to all other existing benchmark methods.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Light targeting the melanopic system suppresses melatonin, but does not alter sleepiness, vigilance, sensory processing, or sleep</a></h4>

              
                Objectives: Pre-sleep exposure to short-wavelength light acutely suppresses melatonin, increases vigilance, and decrease sleepiness with the activating effects extending to sleep. The effects have mainly been attributed to melanopic effects of light. Thus, we investigated whether two metameric light conditions designed to only differ in their melanopic effects (123 vs. 59 lux melanopic EDI) also differentially affect sleep besides melatonin effects. Beyond this, we also studied whether the light conditions modulate sensory processing during wakefulness and sleep. Methods: In a preregistered study, twenty-nine healthy participants aged 18-30 y (15 women) were exposed to two metameric light conditions (high- vs. low-melanopic, differing by a factor of 2x, 7-day washout period) for 1 hour prior to their habitual bed time. This was followed by an 8-h sleep opportunity with polysomnography. Objective sleep measurements were complemented by self-reported sleep evaluation after wake-up. Salivary melatonin levels, subjective sleepiness, and behavioural vigilance were sampled in regular intervals. Sensory processing was evaluated using an oddball paradigm participants completed during the light exposure in the evening and the following sleep episode. Specifically, we were interested in event-related potentials (ERPs) and time-frequency responses related to violations of expectations, that is, the mismatch response. Results: Despite {approx}14% melatonin suppression in the high- compared to the low-melanopic condition, light conditions did not differentially affect objectively assessed sleep, self-perceived sleep quality, sleepiness, or vigilance. A neural mismatch response was evident during all sleep stages but not differentially modulated by pre-sleep light. Conclusions: Suppression of melatonin by light targeting the melanopic system does not necessarily translate to acutely altered levels of vigilance or sleepiness and neither to changes in sleep, sleep quality, or basic sensory processing. This may suggest that an interaction between melanopsin and cone-rod signals could be at work for such effects to occur.

                Listening in everyday life requires attention to be deployed dynamically - when listening is expected to be difficult and when relevant information is expected to occur - to conserve mental resources. Conserving mental resources may be particularly important for older adults who often experience difficulties understanding speech. We use electro- and magnetoencephalography to investigate the neural and behavioral mechanics of dynamic attention regulation during listening and the effects that aging may have on these. We show that neural alpha oscillatory activity indicates when in time attention is deployed (Experiment 1) and that deployment depends on listening difficulty (Experiment 2). Older adults also show successful attention regulation, although younger adults appear to utilize timing information a bit differently compared to older adults. We further show that the recruited brain regions differ between age groups. Superior parietal cortex is involved in attention regulation in younger adults, whereas posterior temporal cortex is more involved in older adults (Experiment 3). This difference in the sources of alpha activity across age groups was only observed when a task was performed, and not for alpha activity during resting-state recordings (Experiment S1). In sum, our study suggests that older adults employ different neural control strategies compared to younger adults to regulate attention in time under listening challenges.

                Reversible silencing of neuronal activity in freely behaving animals provides a powerful tool to determine the roles of specific neuronal populations in circuit dynamics and behavior. Here, we show how magnetothermal silencing using endogenous TREK-1 channels can suppress the dopaminergic reward in the ventral tegmental area and the place preference in mice. Magnetothermal silencing uses alternating magnetic fields penetrating tissue undiminished without harmful effects to heat superparamagnetic nanoparticles at the target cells. The induced sudden, small increase in temperature inhibits neuronal firing rapidly and reversibly, and without the need of genetic modification of the neurons. We demonstrate that two-pore potassium channel TREK-1 channels are responsible for this thermal neuronal silencing. Using fiber-based optogenetics we measure the heating and neuronal silencing in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) brain of the animals. We show that in a place preference assay magnetothermal neuronal silencing of the dopaminergic neurons in the VTA is sufficient to abolished the place preference. TREK1 knock-out mice are immune to the magnetothermal silencing and behave as if the magnetic field were not applied.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Speech prosody supports speaker selection and auditory stream segregation in a multi-talker situation</a></h4>

              
                To process speech in a multi-talker environment, listeners need to segregate the mixture of incoming speech streams and focus their attention on one of them. Potentially, speech prosody could aid the segregation of different speakers, the selection of the desired speech stream, and detecting targets within the attended stream. For testing these issues, we recorded behavioral responses and extracted event-related potentials and functional brain networks from electroencephalographic signals recorded while participants listened to two concurrent speech streams, performing a lexical detection and a recognition memory task in parallel. Prosody manipulation was applied to the attended speech stream in one group of participants and to the ignored speech stream in another group. Naturally recorded speech stimuli were either intact, synthetically F0-flattened, or suppressed by the speaker. Results show that prosody - especially the parsing cues mediated by speech rate - facilitates stream selection, while playing a smaller role in auditory stream segmentation and target detection.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Astrocyte-mediated transduction of muscle fiber contractions synchronizes hippocampal neuronal network development</a></h4>

              
                Exercise supports brain health in part through enhancing hippocampal function. The leading hypothesis is that muscles release factors when they contract (e.g., lactate, myokines, growth factors) that enter circulation and reach the brain where they enhance plasticity (e.g., increase neurogenesis and synaptogenesis). However, it remains unknown how the muscle signals are transduced by the hippocampal cells to modulate network activity and synaptic development. Thus, we established an in vitro model in which the media from contracting primary muscle cells (CM) is applied to developing primary hippocampal cell cultures on a microelectrode array. We found that the hippocampal neuronal network matures more rapidly (as indicated by synapse development and synchronous neuronal activity) when exposed to CM than regular media (RM). This was accompanied by a fourfold increase in the proliferation of astrocytes. Further, experiments established that the astrocytes release factors that inhibit neuronal excitability and facilitate network development. Results provide new insight into how exercise may support hippocampal function through regulating astrocyte proliferation and subsequent taming of neuronal activity into an integrated network.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Gestational Ethanol Exposure Induces Sex-specific Striatal Acetylcholine and Dopamine Deficits</a></h4>

              
                Fetal alcohol exposure has deleterious consequences on the cognitive abilities and motor skills of patients affected by Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) and in pre-clinical models of gestational ethanol exposure (GEE). Deficits in striatal cholinergic interneuron and dopamine function impair action learning and execution, yet the effects of GEE on acetylcholine and dopamine striatal release remain unexplored. Here, we report that alcohol exposure during the first ten postnatal days (GEE P0-P10), which mimics EtOH consumption during the last gestational trimester in humans, induces sex-specific anatomical and motor learning deficits in female mice during adulthood. Consistent with these behavioral impairments, we observed increased evoked-dopamine levels in the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) of GEE P0-P10 female, but not male, mice. Further experiments revealed an impaired {beta}2-containing nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChRs)-modulation of electrically evoked dopamine release, pointing to striatal acetylcholine deficits. Using a genetically encoded acetylcholine sensor (GACh3.0), we found a reduced decay of acetylcholine transients in DLS of GEE P0-P10 females in the presence of an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. Finally, we showed that this effect is associated with decreased excitability of striatal cholinergic interneurons (CINs), pointing to activity-dependent defects in acetylcholine release. Altogether, these data shed a new light on striatal deficits that might underlie cognitive and motor learning symptoms of patients affected by FASD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Two stages of bandwidth scaling drives efficient neural coding of natural sounds</a></h4>

              
                Theories of efficient coding propose that the auditory system is optimized for the statistical structure of natural sounds, yet the transformations underlying optimal acoustic representations are not well understood. Using a database of natural sounds including human speech and a physiologically-inspired auditory model, we explore the consequences of peripheral (cochlear) and mid-level (auditory midbrain) filter tuning transformations on the representation of natural sound spectra and modulation statistics. Whereas Fourier-based spectrographic decompositions with equal resolution filters can preserve spectral details, cochlear filters with bandwidth scaling, sacrifice spectral information while producing a more robust temporal representation. Cochlear bandwidth scaling produces a frequency-dependent gain that counteracts the tendency of natural sound power to decrease with frequency, resulting in a whitened output representation. Mid-level auditory filter scaling further enhance the representation of natural sounds by producing a whitened modulation power spectrum (MPS) with higher modulation entropy than both the cochlear outputs and the conventional Fourier MPS. These findings suggest that the tuning characteristics of the peripheral and mid-level auditory system together produce a whitened output representation in three dimensions (frequency, temporal and spectral modulation) that reduces redundancies and allows for a more efficient use of neural resources. This hierarchical multi-stage tuning strategy is thus likely optimized to extract available information and may underlies perceptual sensitivity to natural sounds.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Representation of illusory shapes within the topographic areas of the posterior parietal cortex</a></h4>

              
                The human visual system consists of multiple topographic maps that extend from the early visual cortex along the dorsal and ventral processing streams. Responses to illusory shapes within these maps have been demonstrated in the ventral stream areas, in particular the lateral occipital complex. Recently, the intraparietal sulcus of the dorsal stream has been linked to the processing of illusory shapes defined by motion. It therefore remains unclear whether the topographically organized parietal areas also respond to static illusory shapes, which would suggest their generic role in representing illusory content. Here we measured brain responses using fMRI while human participants observed flickering inducers around the fixation task. The inducers either formed an illusory diamond in the center, a triangle in the left or in the right hemifield, or were inverted such that no illusory figure was formed. We compared responses of parietal regions IPS0-IPS5 and SPL1 to each illusory figure with the non-illusory condition. To determine the role of attention in illusory shape responses we manipulated the difficulty of the fixation task. Our results show that all IPS areas responded to illusory shapes. The more posterior areas IPS0-IPS3 additionally displayed a preference towards the contralateral shapes, while the more anterior areas IPS4 and IPS5 showed response attenuation with increased task difficulty. We suggest that the IPS can represent illusory content irrespective of the perceptual mechanism that generated it. These responses may serve as a potential feedback signal that drives illusory shape responses in early and ventral visual areas.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Binding of different substrate molecules at the docking site and the active site of γ-secretase can trigger toxic events in sporadic and familial Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                Significance: pathogenic changes in {gamma}-secretase activity, and its response to different drugs, can be greatly affected by changes in saturation of {gamma}-secretase with its substrate. The molecular mechanism is unclear. Results: multiscale molecular dynamics studies show that saturation of {gamma}-secretase with its substrate can result in parallel binding of different substrate molecules at the docking site and the active site. C-terminal domain of the second substrate can bind at cytosolic end of presenilin subunit while {gamma}-secretase is still processing its first substrate. Such interactions can disrupt dynamic presenilin structures that regulate proteolytic steps. Similar disruptions in dynamic presenilin structures can be produced by different drugs and by different disease-causing mutations. Thus, the presented two-substrate mechanism, can explain toxic inhibition of {gamma}-secretase activity and toxic increase in production of the longer, more hydrophobic, A{beta}-proteins. Toxic aggregation between N-terminal domains of the two substrates is controlled by nicastrin ectodomain. Such aggregation is more likely to happen with C99-{beta}CTF-APP than with C83-CTF-APP substrate, which can explain, why {beta}-secretase path is more pathogenic than -secretase path. The binding of C99-{beta}CTF-APP substrate to {gamma}-secretase can be controlled by substrate-channeling between nicastrin ectodomain and {beta}-secretase. Conclusions: The presented two-substrate mechanism can explain why different studies consistently show that increase in saturation of {gamma}-secretase with its substrate can support pathogenic changes in different sporadic and familiar cases of the disease. Future drug-development strategies can target different physiological mechanisms that control the balance between cellular levels of {gamma}-secretase activity and the total amyloid metabolism.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Calibration allows accurate estimation of the axonal volume fraction with diffusion MRI</a></h4>

              
                Biophysical models enable the non-invasive estimation of microstructural tissue features of the central nervous system such as the axonal volume fraction using diffusion weighted imaging (DWI)-data. However, these models trade accuracy with complexity and demands for time-efficient data acquisition. In this study, we hypothesise that their accuracy can be improved substantially through biophysically motivated, linear calibration. We test this hypothesis in the context of axonal volume fraction estimation in four different DWI-models of different complexity using multi-modal data including ex-vivo diffusion MRI- and electron microscopy (EM)-data in mice with broad dynamic range, whereby the latter served as gold standard. We found that two calibration parameters, an offset accounting for the fraction of unmyelinated axons in severely hypomyelinated mice and a scaling accounting for the compartment-specific relaxation, substantially improved the accuracy of axonal volume fraction. Furthermore, we theoretically predict the scaling parameter, and demonstrate that similar accuracy improvement can be achieved for a subset of DWI-models, if the scaling parameter is fixed to the predicted value instead of estimating it on basis of data. This is of practical relevance because it allows to estimate the remaining offset calibration parameter from a limited amount of multi-modal data and thus makes the proposed method usable in human brain data.

                Brain orexin (hypocretin) neurons are implicated in sleep-wake switching and reward-seeking, but their roles in rapid arousal dynamics and reward perception remain unclear. Here, cell-specific stimulation, deletion, and in vivo recordings revealed strong correlative and causal links between pupil dilation - a quantitative arousal marker - and orexin cell activity. Coding of arousal and reward was distributed across orexin cells, indicating that they specialize in rapid, multiplexed communication of momentary arousal and reward states.

	<p>Exposure to chronic stress leads to disturbances in glucose metabolism in the brain, and changes in the functioning of neurons coexisting with the development of depression. The detailed molecular mechanism and cerebral gluconeogenesis during depression are not conclusively established. The aim of the research was to assess the expression of selected genes involved in cerebral glucose metabolism of mice in the validated animal paradigm of chronic stress. To confirm the induction of depression-like disorders, we performed three behavioral tests: sucrose preference test (SPT), forced swim test (FST), and tail suspension test (TST). In order to study the cerebral glucose metabolism of the brain, mRNA levels of the following genes were determined in the prefrontal cortex of mice: Slc2a3, Gapdh, Ldha, Ldhb, and Pkfb3. It has been shown that exogenous, chronic administration of corticosterone developed a model of depression in behavioral tests. There were statistically significant changes in the mRNA level of the Slc2a3, Ldha, Gapdh, and Ldhb genes. The obtained results suggest changes in cerebral glucose metabolism as a process of adaptation to stressful conditions, and may provide the basis for introducing new therapeutic strategies for chronic stress-related depression.</p>

	<p>Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields) therapy is FDA approved and has the CE mark for treatment of newly diagnosed and recurrent glioblastoma. To our knowledge, to date TTFields therapy remains unstudied in glioblastoma patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) as a comorbidity. Here, we present a patient who was diagnosed with MS at the age of 34. Treatment included several corticoid pulse treatments and therapies with interferon beta-1a and sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulator fingolimod. At the age of 52 the patient was diagnosed with glioblastoma, after experiencing worsening headaches which could not be attributed to the MS condition. After subtotal resection and concomitant radiochemotherapy, the patient received temozolomide in combination with TTFields therapy. For two years, the tumor condition remained stable while the patient showed high adherence to TTFields therapy with low-grade skin reactions being the only therapy-related adverse events. After two years, the tumor recurred. The patient underwent re-resection and radiotherapy and restarted TTFields therapy together with chemotherapy and is currently still on this therapy regime. Although having not been studied systematically, the case presented here demonstrates that TTFields therapy may be considered for newly diagnosed and recurrent glioblastoma patients with previously diagnosed multiple sclerosis.</p>

	<p>Music interventions support functional outcomes, improve mood, and reduce symptoms of depression in neurorehabilitation. Neurologic music therapy (NMT) has been reported as feasible and helpful in stroke rehabilitation but is not commonly part of multidisciplinary services in acute or subacute settings. This study assessed the feasibility and acceptability of delivering NMT one-day-per-week in a subacute neurorehabilitation centre over 15 months. Data were collected on the number of referrals, who referred, sessions offered, attended, and declined, and reasons why. Staff, patients, and their relatives completed questionnaires rating the interventions. Patients completed the Visual Analog Mood Scales (VAMS) pre and post a single session. Forty-nine patients received 318 NMT sessions (83% of sessions offered). NMT was rated as helpful or very helpful as part of the multidisciplinary team (n = 36). The highest ratings were for concentration, arm and hand rehabilitation, and motivation and mood. VAMS scores (n = 24) showed a reduction in &amp;amp;lsquo;confused&amp;amp;rsquo; (&amp;amp;minus;8.6, p = 0.035, effect size 0.49) and an increase in &amp;amp;lsquo;happy&amp;amp;rsquo; (6.5, p = 0.021, effect size = 0.12) post NMT. The data suggest that a one-day-per-week NMT post in subacute neurorehabilitation was feasible, acceptable, and helpful, supporting patient engagement in rehabilitation exercises, mood, and motivation.</p>

	<p>Memantine is an FDA approved drug for the treatment of Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease. It reduces neurodegeneration in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex through the inhibition of extrasynaptic NMDA receptors in patients and mouse models. Potentially, it could prevent neurodegeneration in other brain areas and caused by other diseases. We previously used memantine to prevent functional damage and to retain morphology of cerebellar neurons and Bergmann glia in an optogenetic mouse model of spinocerebellar ataxia type-1 (SCA1). However, before suggesting wider use of memantine in clinics, its side effects must be carefully evaluated. Blockers of NMDA receptors are controversial in terms of their effects on anxiety. Here, we investigated the effects of chronic application of memantine over 9 weeks to CD1 mice and examined rotarod performance and anxiety-related behaviors. Memantine-treated mice exhibited an inability to adapt to anxiety-causing conditions which strongly affected their rotarod performance. A tail suspension test revealed increased signs of behavioral despair. These data provide further insights into the potential deleterious effects of memantine which may result from the lack of adaptation to novel, stressful conditions. This effect of memantine may affect the results of tests used to assess motor performance and should be considered during clinical trials of memantine in patients.</p>

	<p>Having a parent with Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (AD) and related dementias confers a risk for developing these types of neurocognitive disorders in old age, but the mechanisms underlying this risk are understudied. Although the hippocampus is often one of the earliest brain regions to undergo change in the AD process, we do not know how early in the lifespan such changes might occur or whether they differ early in the lifespan as a function of family history of AD. Using a rare sample, young adults with a parent with late-onset dementia, we investigated whether brain abnormalities could already be detected compared with a matched sample. Moreover, we employed simple yet novel techniques to characterize resting brain activity (mean and standard deviation) and brain volume in the hippocampus. Young adults with a parent with dementia showed greater resting mean activity and smaller volumes in the left hippocampus compared to young adults without a parent with dementia. Having a parent with AD or a related dementia was associated with early aberrations in brain function and structure. This early hippocampal dysfunction may be due to aberrant neural firing, which may increase the risk for a diagnosis of dementia in old age.</p>

	<p>Respiratory failure, malnutrition, aspiration pneumonia, and dehydration are the precursors to mortality in ALS. Loss of natural communication is considered one of the worst aspects of ALS. This first study to test the feasibility of a music therapy protocol for bulbar and respiratory rehabilitation in ALS employs a mixed-methods case study series design with repeated measures. Newly diagnosed patients meeting the inclusion criteria were invited to participate, until the desired sample size (n = 8) was achieved. The protocol was delivered to participants in their homes twice weekly for six weeks. Individualised exercise sets for independent practice were provided. Feasibility data (recruitment, retention, adherence, tolerability, self-motivation and personal impressions) were collected. Bulbar and respiratory changes were objectively measured. Results. A high recruitment rate (100%), a high retention rate (87.5%) and high mean adherence to treatment (95.4%) provide evidence for the feasibility of the study protocol. The treatment was well tolerated. Mean adherence to the suggested independent exercise routine was 53%. The outcome measurements to evaluate the therapy-induced change in bulbar and respiratory functions were defined. Findings suggest that the protocol is safe to use in early- and mid-stage ALS and that music therapy was beneficial for the participants&amp;amp;rsquo; bulbar and respiratory functions. Mean trends suggesting that these functions were sustained or improved during the treatment period were observed for most outcome parameters: Maximal Inspiratory Pressure, Maximal Expiratory Pressure, Peak Expiratory Flow, the Center for Neurologic Study&amp;amp;mdash;Bulbar Function Scale speech and swallowing subscales, Maximum Phonation Time, Maximum Repetition Rate&amp;amp;mdash;Alternating, Maximum Repetition Rate&amp;amp;mdash;Sequential, Jitter, Shimmer, NHR, Speaking rate, Speech&amp;amp;ndash;pause ratio, Pause frequency, hypernasality level, Time-to-Laryngeal Vestibule Closure, Maximum Pharyngeal Constriction Area, Peak Position of the Hyoid Bone, Total Pharyngeal Residue C24area. Conclusion. The suggested design and protocol are feasible for a larger study, with some modifications, including aerodynamic measure of nasalance, abbreviated voice sampling and psychological screening.</p>

	<p>Human infants are highly sensitive to social information in their visual world. In laboratory settings, researchers have mainly studied the development of social information processing using faces presented on standard computer displays, in paradigms exploring face-to-face, direct eye contact social interactions. This is a simplification of a richer visual environment in which social information derives from the wider visual field and detection involves navigating the world with eyes, head and body movements. The present study measured 9-month-old infants&amp;amp;rsquo; sensitivities to face-like configurations across mid-peripheral visual areas using a detection task. Upright and inverted face-like stimuli appeared at one of three eccentricities (50&amp;amp;deg;, 55&amp;amp;deg; or 60&amp;amp;deg;) in the left and right hemifields. Detection rates at different eccentricities were measured from video recordings. Results indicated that infant performance was heterogeneous and dropped beyond 55&amp;amp;deg;, with a marginal advantage for targets appearing in the left hemifield. Infants&amp;amp;rsquo; orienting behaviour was not influenced by the orientation of the target stimulus. These findings are key to understanding how face stimuli are perceived outside foveal regions and are informative for the design of infant paradigms involving stimulus presentation across a wider field of view, in more naturalistic visual environments.</p>

	<p>Although researchers have recognized the need to better account for the heterogeneous perceptual speech characteristics among talkers with the same disease, guidance on how to best establish such dysarthria subgroups is currently lacking. Therefore, we compared subgroup decisions of two data-driven approaches based on a cohort of talkers with Huntington&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (HD): (1) a statistical clustering approach (STATCLUSTER) based on perceptual speech characteristic profiles and (2) an auditory free classification approach (FREECLASS) based on listeners&amp;amp;rsquo; similarity judgments. We determined the amount of overlap across the two subgrouping decisions and the perceptual speech characteristics driving the subgrouping decisions of each approach. The same speech samples produced by 48 talkers with HD were used for both grouping approaches. The STATCLUSTER approach had been conducted previously. The FREECLASS approach was conducted in the present study. Both approaches yielded four dysarthria subgroups, which overlapped between 50% to 78%. In both grouping approaches, overall bizarreness and speech rate characteristics accounted for the grouping decisions. In addition, voice abnormalities contributed to the grouping decisions in the FREECLASS approach. These findings suggest that apart from overall bizarreness ratings, indexing dysarthria severity, speech rate and voice characteristics may be important features to establish dysarthria subgroups in HD.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Motor Plans under Uncertainty Reflect a Trade-Off between Maximizing Reward and Success</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>When faced with multiple potential movement options, individuals either reach directly to one of the options, or initiate a reach intermediate between the options. It remains unclear why people generate these two types of behaviors. Using the go-before-you-know task (commonly used to study behavior under choice uncertainty) in humans, we examined two key questions. First, do these two types of responses actually reflect distinct movement strategies? If so, the relative desirability (i.e., weighing the success likelihood vs the attainable reward) of the two target options would not need to be computed identically for direct and intermediate reaches. We showed that indeed, when reward and success likelihood differed between the two options, reach direction was preferentially biased toward different directions for direct versus intermediate reaches. Importantly, this suggests that the computation of subjective values depends on the choice of movement strategy. Second, what drives individual differences in how people respond under uncertainty? We found that risk/reward-seeking individuals tended to generate more intermediate reaches and were more responsive to changes in reward, suggesting these movements may reflect a strategy to maximize reward versus success. Together, these findings suggest that when faced with choice uncertainty, individuals adopt movement strategies consistent with their risk/reward attitude, preferentially biasing behavior toward exogenous rewards or endogenous success and consequently modulating the relative desirability of the available options.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Incubation of craving refers to the intensification of drug-seeking behavior in response to reward-paired cues over the course of abstinence. In rodents, craving and drug-seeking behaviors have been measured by an increase in lever pressing in the absence of reinforcer availability in response to cue presentations. However, craving in rodents is difficult to define and little is known about the behavioral signatures that accompany increased drug-seeking behavior measured by lever pressing. The affective components of relapse are also important, but understudied in rodents. Hormonal fluctuations influence craving for psychostimulants, but little is known about the impact of the estrous cycle on opioid-seeking behavior. This study sought to delineate the behavioral and affective signatures associated with craving, and to examine the influence of the female estrous cycle on craving. Male and female rats underwent 10 d of intravenous opioid self-administration. Separate cohorts of control rats self-administered oral sucrose, a natural nondrug reward. Cue-induced seeking tests were conducted after 1 or 30d of forced abstinence. These sessions were recorded and scored for overall locomotion, instances of sniffing, grooming, or hyperactivity. Ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) were also recorded to determine affective profiles that accompany opioid seeking. Although active lever presses and overall locomotion increased unanimously over extended abstinence from heroin and sucrose, a sex- and reinforcer-specific behavioral and affective signature of craving emerged. Furthermore, although the female estrous cycle did not affect taking or seeking, it appears to influence more granular behaviors.</p>

                <p>This exploratory case–control study investigates the synaptic marker beta-synuclein in serum and plasma pTau181 in adults with Down syndrome (DS) with (sDS, <i>n</i> = 14) and without (aDS, <i>n</i> = 47) clinical symptoms of Alzheimer disease (AD) as well as euploid controls (<i>n</i> = 23). Beta-synuclein was higher in aDS and more pronounced in sDS (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001), whereas pTau181 was only higher in sDS (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001). Both markers showed good discriminatory power (area under the curve &gt; 0.90) to distinguish symptomatic from asymptomatic AD. The data indicate that synaptic alterations belong to the earliest AD-associated events in DS and highlight the value of serum beta-synuclein as a potential early marker of AD.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA) are characterized by genetic heterogeneity. Some mapped and named <i>loci</i> remain without a causal gene identified. Here we applied next generation sequencing (NGS) to uncover the genetic etiology of the <i>SCA25 locus</i>.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing were performed in families linked to <i>SCA25</i>, including the French family in which the <i>SCA25 locus</i> was originally mapped. Whole exome sequence data was interrogated in a cohort of 796 ataxia patients of unknown aetiology.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The SCA25 phenotype spans a slowly evolving sensory and cerebellar ataxia, in most cases attributed to ganglionopathy. A pathogenic variant causing exon skipping was identified in the gene encoding Polyribonucleotide Nucleotidyltransferase PNPase 1 (<i>PNPT1)</i> located in the <i>SCA25</i> linkage interval. A second splice variant in <i>PNPT1</i> was detected in a large Australian family with a dominant ataxia also mapping to <i>SCA25</i>. An additional nonsense variant was detected in an unrelated individual with ataxia. Both nonsense and splice heterozygous variants result in premature stop codons, all located in the S1-domain of PNPase. In addition, an elevated type I interferon response was observed in blood from all affected heterozygous carriers tested. PNPase notably prevents the abnormal accumulation of double-stranded mtRNAs in the mitochondria and leakage into the cytoplasm, associated with triggering a type I interferon response.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This study identifies <i>PNPT1</i> as a new SCA gene, responsible for SCA25, and highlights biological links between alterations of mtRNA trafficking, interferonopathies and ataxia.</p>

This suggests that the prefrontal oscillations distinguish between perceptual experiences driven by internal memory and external perception.

                Köllisch et al. identify 5ʹ-methylthioinosine (MTI), a Plasmodium-derived metabolite of the purine salvage pathway, as Toll-like receptor 8 (TLR8) ligand. In vitro infection experiments with human PBMC and P. falciparum-infected red blood cells suggest that MTI serves as TLR8-dependent pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) for innate immune sensing.

                Martin-Martin et al. describe the function of an Aedes aegypti salivary peptide, sialokinin. It modulates macrophages, alters endothelial permeability, promotes leukocyte recruitment, induces nitric oxide release, and interferes with hemostasis via NK1R signaling. Sialokinin promotes blood perfusion and ensures short probing time. These findings demonstrate its antihemostatic and immunomodulator role.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Vinculin controls endothelial cell junction dynamics during vascular lumen formation</a></h4>

              
                Kotini et al. investigate junctional dynamics during angiogenic lumen formation. Finger-shaped junctions containing the mechanotransduction protein vinculin are formed in response to blood pressure. Vinculin is required for finger formation and maintenance. Junctional fingers present an in vivo paradigm to study junctional dynamics in relation to extrinsic forces.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">The C. elegans regulatory factor X (RFX) DAF-19M module: A shift from general ciliogenesis to cell-specific ciliary and behavioral specialization</a></h4>

              
                In Caenorhabditis elegans, IL2 ciliated neurons are required for nictation behavior. What makes IL2 neurons different from other ciliated neurons? Ahn et al. demonstrate that DAF-19M, an isoform of the sole C. elegans RFX transcription factor DAF-19, regulates IL2-specific, cilia-associated genes through an X-box motif variant.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">An oxygen-adaptive interaction between SNHG12 and occludin maintains blood-brain barrier integrity</a></h4>

              
                Li et al. identify an oxygen-adaptive interaction between lncRNA SNHG12 and the tight junction protein occludin in brain microvascular endothelial cells. This interaction stabilizes occludin by blocking its degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system and is critical for the blood-brain barrier integrity maintenance and oxygen adaption.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Transformation of an early-established motor circuit during maturation in zebrafish</a></h4>

              
                Pallucchi et al. reveal that an early-established motor circuit in zebrafish undergoes a profound reorganization during maturation toward adulthood. There is a loss of existing connections and establishment of new connections combined with a change in function to suit new behavioral demands.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Dynamic interplay between thalamic activity and Cajal-Retzius cells regulates the wiring of cortical layer 1</a></h4>

              
                Genescu et al. show that the wiring of cortical layer 1 relies on crosstalk between spontaneous thalamic activity and Cajal-Retzius cells, with long-lasting consequences on cortical circuits. These findings reveal that transient activity and cells play key roles in the wiring of apical dendrites and upper layer neocortical networks.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Prefrontal pyramidal neurons are critical for all phases of working memory</a></h4>

              
                Vogel et al. show that pyramidal neurons in the prefrontal cortex are required not only for the maintenance of information in spatial working memory but also its encoding and retrieval. Imaging of these neurons reveals preferential encoding of spatial information, including to-be-remembered goal locations.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/current.rss">Synaptic vesicle binding of α-synuclein is modulated by β- and γ-synucleins</a></h4>

              
                α-synuclein functions in synaptic neurotransmitter release by binding to synaptic vesicles. The roles of β- and γ-synuclein in this process are unknown. Carnazza et al. demonstrate that on the synaptic vesicle surface, synucleins form heteromultimers whose composition dictates the amount of physiologically active α-synuclein on synaptic vesicles.
