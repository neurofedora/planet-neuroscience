                <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Previous studies have reported an association between anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNFα) treatment and central nervous system (CNS) events. We described eight patients presenting with demyelinating CNS events while on treatment with anti-TNFα for autoimmune diseases and followed up for a medium period of 4 years. Four patients presented with isolated demyelinating events, three patients fulfilled the criteria for multiple sclerosis (MS), and one patient showed worsening of pre-existing MS after anti-TNF therapy initiation. All patients except one, showed a good medium-term prognosis. Our observation supports an association between anti-TNFα treatment and demyelinating events and suggests that a prompt discontinuation of the drug may lead to a favorable demyelinating disease outcome.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://link.springer.com/search.rss?search-within=Journal&facet-journal-id=415&query=">Mononeuritis multiplex: an unexpectedly frequent feature of severe COVID-19</a></h4>

              
                <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">The prolonged mechanical ventilation that is often required by patients with severe COVID-19 is expected to result in significant intensive care unit-acquired weakness (ICUAW) in many of the survivors. However, in our post-COVID-19 follow-up clinic we have found that, as well as the anticipated global weakness related to loss of muscle mass, a significant proportion of these patients also have disabling focal neurological deficits relating to multiple axonal mononeuropathies. Amongst the 69 patients with severe COVID-19 that have been discharged from the intensive care units in our hospital, we have seen 11 individuals (16%) with such a mononeuritis multiplex. In many instances, the multi-focal nature of the weakness in these patients was initially unrecognised as symptoms were wrongly assumed to relate simply to “critical illness neuromyopathy”. While mononeuropathy is well recognised as an occasional complication of intensive care, our experience suggests that such deficits are surprisingly frequent and often disabling in patients recovering from severe COVID-19.</p>

                <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">We report a 57-year-old man with recurrent meningoencephalitis resulting in bouts of altered consciousness, encephalopathy, tremors, focal seizures, and paraparesis. The neurological manifestations were accompanied by fever and leukocytosis in the absence of other systemic manifestations. MRI abnormalities of the brain, brainstem, spinal cord and meninges and CSF pleocytosis and elevated protein were observed. Exhaustive studies failed to reveal an etiology. Brain biopsy revealed nodules of neutrophils and macrophages, but no vasculitis. The lesions were not vasocentric as would be expected with neuro-Behcet’s disease and neuro-Sweet’s disease. The disorder was responsive to high-dose corticosteroid therapy and, ultimately, to anakinra, an IL-1α and IL-1β receptor antagonist.</p>

                      <p class="a-plus-plus">During the COVID-19 outbreak, the presence of extensive white matter microhemorrhages was detected by brain MRIs. The goal of this study was to investigate the origin of this atypical hemorrhagic complication.</p>
                    </span>
                    <span class="a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2">
                      <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Methods</h3>
                      <p class="a-plus-plus">Between March 17 and May 18, 2020, 80 patients with severe COVID-19 infections were admitted for acute respiratory distress syndrome to intensive care units at the University Hospitals of Strasbourg for whom a brain MRI for neurologic manifestations was performed. 19 patients (24%) with diffuse microhemorrhages were compared to 18 control patients with COVID-19 and normal brain MRI.</p>

                      <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Results</h3>
                      <p class="a-plus-plus">The first hypothesis was hypoxemia. The latter seemed very likely since respiratory failure was longer and more pronounced in patients with microhemorrhages (prolonged endotracheal intubation (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.0002), higher FiO<sub class="a-plus-plus">2</sub> (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.03), increased use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.04)). A relevant hypothesis, the role of microangiopathy, was also considered, since patients with microhemorrhages presented a higher increase of the D-Dimers (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.01) and a tendency to more frequent thrombotic events (<em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.12). Another hypothesis tested was the role of kidney failure, which was more severe in the group with diffuse microhemorrhages (higher creatinine level [median of 293 µmol/L versus 112 µmol/L, <em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.04] and more dialysis were introduced in this group during ICU stay [12 versus 5 patients, <em class="a-plus-plus">p</em> = 0.04]).</p>

                      <p class="a-plus-plus">Blood–brain barrier dysfunction secondary to hypoxemia and high concentration of uremic toxins seems to be the main mechanism leading to critical illness-associated cerebral microbleeds, and this complication remains to be frequently described in severe COVID-19 patients.</p>

                <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Many neuropsychological disorders, especially attentional abnormality, are present in patients with myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study aimed to evaluate attention function by auditory event-related potential (ERP) P3a (novelty paradigm) in DM1 patients. A total of 10 young DM1 patients (mean age 30.4 years) and 14 age-matched normal controls participated in this study. ERPs were recorded using an auditory novel paradigm, consisting of three types of stimuli, i.e., standard sound (70%), target sound (20%), and various novel sounds (10%), and participants pressed buttons to the target sounds. ERP components P3b after the target stimuli and P3a following the novel stimuli were analyzed. Correlations of neuropsychological evaluations with the amplitudes and latencies of P3b and P3a were analyzed in DM1 patients. We found that P3a latency was significantly delayed in patients with DM1 compared with normal controls, although the latency and amplitude of P3b in DM1 patients were comparable with those in normal controls. The achievement rates of both the Symbol Digit Modality Test and the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test were significantly correlated with P3a amplitude, as well as P3b amplitude. These results suggest that ERPs, including P3a and P3b, provide important insights into the physiological basis of neuropsychological abnormalities in patients with DM1, especially from the viewpoint of the frontal lobe and attention function.</p>

                <h3 class="a-plus-plus">Abstract</h3>
                    <p class="a-plus-plus">Valproate is a broad-spectrum antiepileptic drug (AED) of particular interest in pediatric epilepsy syndromes and idiopathic generalized epilepsy, as it is relatively more effective in these syndromes than other AEDs. In 2018, the European Medicines Agency introduced new restrictions on the use of valproate in girls and women of childbearing potential to avoid exposure during pregnancy. The strengthening of existing restrictions sparked controversy and debate among patients and the medical community. The high prevalence of epilepsy syndromes amenable to valproate treatment in women of childbearing age and the little information available on the teratogenic potential of alternative treatments have created uncertainty on how to manage these patients. In this consensus statement, based on a review of the literature and the clinical experience of a panel of European epilepsy experts, we present general recommendations for the optimal clinical management of AED treatment in girls, women of childbearing potential, and pregnant women across the different epilepsy syndromes.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Are adverse effects of cannabidiol (CBD) products caused by tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) contamination? [version 4; peer review: 2 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Cannabidiol (CBD)-containing products are widely marketed as over the counter products, mostly as food supplements. Adverse effects reported in anecdotal consumer reports or during clinical studies were first assumed to be due to hydrolytic conversion of CBD to psychotropic Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC) in the stomach after oral consumption. However, research of pure CBD solutions stored in simulated gastric juice or subjected to various storage conditions such as heat and light with specific liquid chromatographic/tandem mass spectrometric (LC/MS/MS) and ultra-high pressure liquid chromatographic/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometric (UPLC-QTOF) analyses was unable to confirm THC formation. Another hypothesis for the  adverse effects of CBD products may be residual Δ9-THC concentrations in the products as contamination, because most of them are based on hemp extracts containing the full spectrum of cannabinoids besides CBD. Analyses of 181 food products of the German market (mostly CBD oils) confirmed this hypothesis: 21 products (12%) contained Δ9-THC above the lowest observed adverse effect level (2.5 mg/day). Inversely, CBD was present in the products below the no observed adverse effect level. Hence, it may be assumed that the adverse effects of some commercial CBD products are based on a low-dose effect of Δ9-THC and not due to effects of CBD itself. The safety, efficacy and purity of commercial CBD products is highly questionable, and all of the products in our sample collection showed various non-conformities to European food law such as unsafe Δ9-THC levels, hemp extracts or CBD isolates as non-approved novel food ingredients, non-approved health claims, and deficits in mandatory food labelling requirements. In view of the growing market for such lifestyle products, the effectiveness of the instrument of food business operators' own responsibility for product safety and regulatory compliance must obviously be challenged, and a strong regulatory framework for hemp products needs to be devised.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Predicting coronary artery disease risk in firefighters – a cross-sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Firefighters are placed under severe cardiovascular load in performing active duty and, when carrying various coronary artery disease (CAD) risk factors, firefighters are predisposed to significant morbidity and mortality. Reducing the incidence of these risk factors is paramount. The purpose of this study is to determine the predictors of CAD risk.   Methods: This study used a quantitative, cross-sectional and correlational design. The researchers conveniently sampled 124 full-time firefighters from the City of Cape Town Fire and Rescue Service. A researcher-generated questionnaire was used to collect sociodemographic and CAD risk factors information, such as age, gender, ethnicity, family history of CAD, cigarette smoking and physical activity levels, and all research procedures were conducted according to the American College of Sports Medicine guidelines. Data collection took place between September and November 2019. Linear and logistic regression were used to determine the relationship between the various CAD risk factors and the predictors of CAD risk.   Results: Age was a significant predictor of hypertension (p <0.01), dyslipidemia (p <0.01), diabetes (p <0.01), obesity (p <0.01) and central obesity (p <0.01). Gender was a significant predictor of obesity, central obesity and cigarette smoking (p <0.05). Waist circumference was a significant predictor of hypertension (p <0.01), dyslipidemia (p <0.01) and diabetes (p <0.05).   Conclusion: Age was a significant predictor of various modifiable CAD risk factors, including obesity, in both genders and all ethnicities. Attentive monitoring should be in place as firefighters age, along with behavioural modifications designed to reduce age-related increases in CAD risk factors.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The Norwegian public’s ability to assess treatment claims: results of a cross-sectional study of critical health literacy [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Few studies have evaluated the ability of the general public to assess the trustworthiness of claims about the effects of healthcare. For the most part, those studies have used self-reported measures of critical health literacy. Methods: We mailed 4500 invitations to Norwegian adults. Respondents were randomly assigned to one of four online questionnaires that included multiple-choice questions that test understanding of Key Concepts people need to understand to assess healthcare claims. They also included questions about intended behaviours and self-efficacy. One of the four questionnaires was identical to one previously used in two randomised trials of educational interventions in Uganda, facilitating comparisons to Ugandan children, parents, and teachers. We adjusted the results using demographic data to reflect the population. Results: A total of 771 people responded. The adjusted proportion of Norwegian adults who answered correctly was > 50% for 17 of the 30 Key Concepts. On the other hand, less than half answered correctly for 13 concepts. The results for Norwegian adults were better than the results for Ugandan children in the intervention arm of the trial and parents, and similar to those of Ugandan teachers in the intervention arm of the trial. Based on self-report, most Norwegians are likely to find out the basis of treatment claims, but few consider it easy to assess whether claims are based on research and to assess the trustworthiness of research. Conclusions: Norwegian adults do not understand many concepts that are essential for assessing healthcare claims and making informed choices.Future interventions should be tailored to address Key Concepts for which there appears to be a lack of understanding.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Economic burden of out-of-pocket expenditure, productivity cost during pregnancy and COVID-19 impact on household economy in a cohort of pregnant women in Anuradhapura District, Sri Lanka; A study protocol [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Investigating the out-of-pocket expenditure (OOPE) associated with maternal health is important since OOPE directly affects the affordability of health services. Global evidence suggests the importance of capturing the productivity cost during pregnancy in terms of absenteeism and presenteeism. Furthermore, the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on the household economy needs to be further evaluated as pregnant women are one of the most vulnerable groups. This study aims at determining the economic burden of OOPE, productivity cost, and COVID-19 impact on pregnant women's household economy in a cohort of pregnant women in Anuradhapura District, Sri Lanka. Methods: The study setting is all 22 Medical Officer of Health (MOH) areas in Anuradhapura district, Sri Lanka. The study has three components; a follow-up study of a cohort of pregnant women to assess the magnitude and associated factors of OOPE and to assess the productivity cost (Component 1), a qualitative case study to explore the impact and causes of the OOPE under free health services (Component 2) and a cross-sectional study to describe the effects of COVID-19 outbreak on household economy (Component 3). The study samples consist of 1,393 and 1,460 participants for components one and three, respectively, and 25 pregnant women will be recruited for component two. The data will be analyzed using descriptive, parametric, and non-parametric statistics for the first and third components and thematic analysis for the second component. Discussion: With the lack of evidence on OOPE, productivity loss/cost in terms of maternal health, and COVID-19 impact on household economy in Sri Lanka, the evidence generated from this study would be valuable for policymakers, health care administrators, and health care practitioners globally, regionally, and locally to plan for future measures for reducing the OOPE, productivity loss/cost, and minimizing the economic hardship of the COVID-19 outbreak during pregnancy.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Accumulation of essential (copper, iron, zinc) and non-essential (lead, cadmium) heavy metals in Caulerpa racemosa, sea water, and marine sediments of Bintan Island, Indonesia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Heavy metals are materials naturally occurring in nature and increase with a rise in human activity. Ex-mining areas and domestic waste from human settlements are sources of heavy metal contamination that enter and pollute water, which then accumulates in various organisms including the Caulerpa racemosa community. The accumulation of heavy metals in C. racemosa has a wide impact on the food chain in aquatic ecosystems and humans because this alga is a consumptive commodity.   Methods: Sampling of C. racemosa was carried out at seven sites on Bintan Island, Indonesia covering the eastern (Teluk Bakau, Beralas Pasir, Malang Rapat), northern (Berakit and Pengudang), western (Sakera), and southern parts (Tg. Siambang). Sampling was carried out during different monsoons, and heavy metals in water and sediment samples were measured to determine the heavy metal concentration. Heavy metals were analyzed by a spectrophotometric method using Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry.   Results: The results showed that heavy metal concentrations fluctuate according to changes in the wind season, which carry currents and spread pollutants into the water. The concentration of metal in the water is also from anthropogenic activities. The heavy metal content of cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), and zinc (Zn) in C. racemosa is high in locations close to settlements. Meanwhile, in seawater samples, Fe and Zn metals have the highest concentrations compared to others.  Conclusions: Ex-bauxite mines are a source of Fe and Zn metal contamination in the environment, especially at Tg. Siambang. The levels of these heavy metals in the sediment are also high, as surface particle deposits accumulate at the bottom of the sediment. In general, the levels of heavy metals Cd, Pb, Cu, Fe, and Zn increase in the northern monsoon because the dynamics of the water transport greater heavy metal pollution.

                Small, isolated teaching centers have difficulty mentoring interprofessional junior faculty in research methods and grant writing. Peer mentoring programs for grant writing at larger institutions have been successful. In this short report, we describe our program that leveraged mentor experience using four framing seminars followed by project refinement in three-person peer groups and monthly mentored works in progress meetings. In its first year, ten faculty from medicine, psychology, and pharmacy completed the program and successfully obtained six funded grants. Five of the projects transitioned from single profession applications to interprofessional applications as participants connected and profession-specific expertise was identified. Refinements for future cohorts are discussed.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Low back pain and associated risk factors among medical students in Bangladesh: a cross-sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Low back pain (LBP) is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide. Different studies showed the high prevalence of LBP among medical students. However, no study has been conducted on Bangladeshi medical students to estimate the prevalence of LBP. This study evaluated the prevalence, characteristics, and associated risk factors of LBP among medical students in Bangladesh. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted from October to December 2020 among randomly selected 270 medical students and medical interns in Faridpur Medical College, Bangladesh, using an online questionnaire. In data analysis, chi-square test and binary logistic regression were performed, and a p-value of < 0.05 was regarded as statistically significant. Results: A total of 207 participants responded fully to the survey, and were included in the analysis. The mean age of the participants was 22.36 ± 1.915 years. The point, 6-month, and 12-month prevalence of LBP was 25.6%, 46.9%, and 63.3%, respectively. In most participants, LBP was localized (53.2%), recurrent (64.9%), undiagnosed (70.8%), affected for a short period (55%), and relieved without receiving any treatment (60.4%). Participants who had a significantly higher 12-month prevalence of LBP included females (72.2% vs 52.2%), with BMI >25 kg/m2 (73.2% vs 56.7%), those who performed physical activity at low to moderate frequency (72.4% vs 29.5%), those who spent > 6 hours/day by sitting (71.3% vs 45.3%), and those who did not have enough rest time (92.7% vs 56%). Ergonomic features of chairs, such as having back support, adjustable back support, and adjustable sitting surface, significantly (p < 0.05) influenced the outcomes. Conclusion: The prevalence of LBP among medical students in Bangladesh was high, and most of the risk factors associated with the high prevalence of LBP were modifiable. Hence, LBP can be prevented by implementing preventive strategies and providing ergonomic training and physical activity facilities.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">rmcorrShiny: A web and standalone application for repeated measures correlation [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                We describe a web and standalone Shiny app for calculating the common, linear within-individual association for repeated assessments of paired measures with multiple individuals: repeated measures correlation (rmcorr). This tool makes rmcorr more widely accessible, providing a graphical interface for performing and visualizing the output of analysis with rmcorr. In contrast to rmcorr, most widely used correlation techniques assume paired data are independent. Incorrectly analyzing repeated measures data as independent will likely produce misleading results. Using aggregation or separate models to address the issue of independence may obscure meaningful patterns and will also tend to reduce statistical power. rmcorrShiny (repeated measures correlation Shiny) provides a simple and accessible solution for computing the repeated measures correlation. It is available at: https://lmarusich.shinyapps.io/shiny_rmcorr/.

                In Gram-positive bacteria, the McsB protein arginine kinase is central to protein quality control, labelling aberrant molecules for degradation by the ClpCP protease. Despite its importance for stress response and pathogenicity, it is still elusive how the bacterial degradation labelling is regulated. Here, we delineate the mechanism how McsB targets aberrant proteins during stress conditions. Structural data reveal a self-compartmentalized kinase, in which the active sites are sequestered in a molecular cage. The 'closed' octamer interconverts with other oligomers in a phosphorylation-dependent manner and, contrary to these 'open' forms, preferentially labels unfolded proteins. In vivo data show that heat-shock triggers accumulation of higher-order oligomers, of which the octameric McsB is essential for surviving stress situations. The interconversion of open and closed oligomers represents a distinct regulatory mechanism of a degradation labeler, allowing the McsB kinase to adapt its potentially dangerous enzyme function to the needs of the bacterial cell.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Resonating neurons stabilize heterogeneous grid-cell networks</a></h4>

              
                A central theme that governs the functional design of biological networks is their ability to sustain stable function despite widespread parametric variability. Here, we investigated the impact of distinct forms of biological heterogeneities on the stability of a two-dimensional continuous attractor network (CAN) implicated in grid-patterned activity generation. We show that increasing degrees of biological heterogeneities progressively disrupted the emergence of grid-patterned activity and resulted in progressively large perturbations in low-frequency neural activity. We postulated that targeted suppression of low-frequency perturbations could ameliorate heterogeneity-induced disruptions of grid-patterned activity. To test this, we introduced intrinsic resonance, a physiological mechanism to suppress low-frequency activity, either by adding an additional high-pass filter (phenomenological) or by incorporating a slow negative feedback loop (mechanistic) into our model neurons. Strikingly, CAN models with resonating neurons were resilient to the incorporation of heterogeneities and exhibited stable grid-patterned firing. We found CAN networks with mechanistic resonators to be more effective in targeted suppression of low-frequency activity, with the slow kinetics of the negative feedback loop essential in stabilizing these networks. As low-frequency perturbations (1/<i>f</i> noise) are pervasive across biological systems, our analyses suggest a universal role for mechanisms that suppress low-frequency activity in stabilizing heterogeneous biological networks.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Social fluidity mobilizes contagion in human and animal populations</a></h4>

              
                Humans and other group-living animals tend to distribute their social effort disproportionately. Individuals predominantly interact with a small number of close companions while maintaining weaker social bonds with less familiar group members. By incorporating this behavior into a mathematical model, we find that a single parameter, which we refer to as <i>social fluidity</i>, controls the rate of social mixing within the group. Large values of social fluidity correspond to gregarious behavior, whereas small values signify the existence of persistent bonds between individuals. We compare the social fluidity of 13 species by applying the model to empirical human and animal social interaction data. To investigate how social behavior influences the likelihood of an epidemic outbreak, we derive an analytical expression of the relationship between social fluidity and the basic reproductive number of an infectious disease. For species that form more stable social bonds, the model describes frequency-dependent transmission that is sensitive to changes in social fluidity. As social fluidity increases, animal-disease systems become increasingly density-dependent. Finally, we demonstrate that social fluidity is a stronger predictor of disease outcomes than both group size and connectivity, and it provides an integrated framework for both density-dependent and frequency-dependent transmission.

                The development of pancreatic cancer requires recruitment and activation of different macrophage populations. However, little is known about how macrophages are attracted to the pancreas after injury or an oncogenic event, and how they crosstalk with lesion cells or other cells of the lesion microenvironment. Here, we delineate the importance of CXCL10/CXCR3 signaling during the early phase of murine pancreatic cancer. We show that CXCL10 is produced by pancreatic precancerous lesion cells in response to IFNγ signaling, and that inflammatory macrophages are recipients for this chemokine. CXCL10/CXCR3 signaling in macrophages mediates their chemoattraction to the pancreas, enhances their proliferation and maintains their inflammatory identity. Blocking of CXCL10/CXCR3 signaling <i>in vivo</i> shifts macrophage populations to a tumor promoting (Ym1<sup>+</sup>, Fizz<sup>+</sup>, Arg1<sup>+</sup>) phenotype, increases fibrosis and mediates progression of lesions, highlighting the importance of this pathway in PDA development. This is reversed when CXCL10 is overexpressed in PanIN cells.

                Correlates of sensory stimuli and motor actions are found in multiple cortical areas, but such correlates do not indicate whether these areas are causally relevant to task performance. We trained mice to discriminate visual contrast and report their decision by steering a wheel. Widefield calcium imaging and Neuropixels recordings in cortex revealed stimulus-related activity in visual (VIS) and frontal (MOs) areas, and widespread movement-related activity across the whole dorsal cortex. Optogenetic inactivation biased choices only when targeted at VIS and MOs,proportionally to each site's encoding of the visual stimulus, and at times corresponding to peak stimulus decoding. A neurometric model based on summing and subtracting activity in VIS and MOs successfully described behavioral performance and predicted the effect of optogenetic inactivation. Thus, sensory signals localized in visual and frontal cortex play a causal role in task performance, while widespread dorsal cortical signals correlating with movement reflect processes that do not play a causal role.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Long-term stability of cortical ensembles</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal ensembles, coactive groups of neurons found in spontaneous and evoked cortical activity, are causally related to memories and perception, but it still unknown how stable or flexible they are over time. We used two-photon multiplane calcium imaging to track over weeks the activity of the same pyramidal neurons in layer 2/3 of the visual cortex from awake mice and recorded their spontaneous and visually evoked responses. Less than half of the neurons were commonly active across any two imaging sessions. These 'common neurons' formed stable ensembles lasting weeks, but some ensembles were also transient and appeared only in one single session. Stable ensembles preserved ~68 % of their neurons up to 46 days, our longest imaged period, and these 'core' cells had stronger functional connectivity. Our results demonstrate that neuronal ensembles can last for weeks and could, in principle, serve as a substrate for long-lasting representation of perceptual states or memories.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Fast and flexible estimation of effective migration surfaces</a></h4>

              
                Spatial population genetic data often exhibits ‘isolation-by-distance,’ where genetic similarity tends to decrease as individuals become more geographically distant. The rate at which genetic similarity decays with distance is often spatially heterogeneous due to variable population processes like genetic drift, gene flow, and natural selection. Petkova et al., 2016 developed a statistical method called Estimating Effective Migration Surfaces (EEMS) for visualizing spatially heterogeneous isolation-by-distance on a geographic map. While EEMS is a powerful tool for depicting spatial population structure, it can suffer from slow runtimes. Here, we develop a related method called Fast Estimation of Effective Migration Surfaces (FEEMS). FEEMS uses a Gaussian Markov Random Field model in a penalized likelihood framework that allows for efficient optimization and output of effective migration surfaces. Further, the efficient optimization facilitates the inference of migration parameters per edge in the graph, rather than per node (as in EEMS). With simulations, we show conditions under which FEEMS can accurately recover effective migration surfaces with complex gene-flow histories, including those with anisotropy. We apply FEEMS to population genetic data from North American gray wolves and show it performs favorably in comparison to EEMS, with solutions obtained orders of magnitude faster. Overall, FEEMS expands the ability of users to quickly visualize and interpret spatial structure in their data.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Multiple neuronal networks coordinate Hydra mechanosensory behavior</a></h4>

              
                <i>Hydra vulgaris</i> is an emerging model organism for neuroscience due to its small size, transparency, genetic tractability, and regenerative nervous system; however, fundamental properties of its sensorimotor behaviors remain unknown. Here, we use microfluidic devices combined with fluorescent calcium imaging and surgical resectioning to study how the diffuse nervous system coordinates <i>Hydra</i>'s mechanosensory response. Mechanical stimuli cause animals to contract, and we find this response relies on at least two distinct networks of neurons in the oral and aboral regions of the animal. Different activity patterns arise in these networks depending on whether the animal is contracting spontaneously or contracting in response to mechanical stimulation. Together, these findings improve our understanding of how <i>Hydra</i>’s diffuse nervous system coordinates sensorimotor behaviors. These insights help reveal how sensory information is processed in an animal with a diffuse, radially symmetric neural architecture unlike the dense, bilaterally symmetric nervous systems found in most model organisms.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The sensory code within sense of time</a></h4>

              
                Sensory experiences are accompanied by the perception of the passage of time; a cell phone vibration, for instance, is sensed as brief or long. The neuronal mechanisms underlying the perception of elapsed time remain unknown1. Recent work agrees on a role for cortical processing networks2,3, however the causal function of sensory cortex in time perception has not yet been specified. We hypothesize that the mechanisms for time perception are embedded within primary sensory cortex and are thus governed by the basic rules of sensory coding. By recording and optogenetically modulating neuronal activity in rat vibrissal somatosensory cortex, we find that the percept of stimulus duration is dilated and compressed by optogenetic excitation and inhibition, respectively, during stimulus delivery. A second set of rats judged the intensity of tactile stimuli; here, optogenetic excitation amplified the intensity percept, demonstrating sensory cortex to be the common gateway to both time and stimulus feature processing. The coding algorithms for sensory features are well established4-10. Guided by these algorithms, we formulated a 3-stage model beginning with the membrane currents evoked by vibrissal and optogenetic drive and culminating in the representation of perceived time; this model successfully replicated rats' choices. Our finding that stimulus coding is intrinsic to sense of time disagrees with dedicated pacemaker-accumulator operation models11-13, where sensory input acts only to trigger the onset and offset of the timekeeping process. Time perception is thus as deeply intermeshed within the sensory processing pathway as is the sense of touch itself14,15 and can now be treated through the computational language of sensory coding. The model presented here readily generalizes to humans14,16 and opens up new approaches to understanding the time misperception at the core of numerous neurological conditions17,18.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Widespread nociceptive maps in the human neonatal somatosensory cortex</a></h4>

              
                Topographic cortical maps are essential for spatial localisation of sensory stimulation and generation of appropriate task-related motor responses. Somatosensation and nociception are finely mapped and aligned in the adult somatosensory (S1) cortex, but in infancy, when pain behaviour is disorganised and poorly directed, nociceptive maps may be less refined. We compared the topographic pattern of S1 activation following noxious (clinically required heel lance) and innocuous (touch) mechanical stimulation of the same skin region in newborn infants (n=32) using multi-optode functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Signal to noise ratio and overall activation area did not differ with stimulus modality. Within S1 cortex, touch and lance of the heel elicit localised, partially overlapping increases in oxygenated haemoglobin (HbO), but while touch activation was restricted to the heel area, lance activation extended into cortical hand regions. The data reveals a widespread cortical nociceptive map in infant S1, consistent with their poorly directed pain behaviour.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A new protocol for multiple muscle mapping using nTMS</a></h4>

              
                Background: Single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation is a safe and non-invasive tool for investigating cortical representation of muscles in the primary motor cortex. While non-navigated TMS has been successfully applied to simultaneously induce motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) in multiple muscles, a more rigorous assessment of the corresponding cortical representation can greatly benefit from navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS). Objective: We designed a protocol to map the entire precentral gyrus using neural navigation while recording responses of eight muscles simultaneously. Here, we evaluated the feasibility, validity, and reliability of this protocol. Method: Twenty participants underwent conventional (i.e., muscle-based, grid-constrained) and gyrus-based nTMS mapping. For both protocols, we investigated three different stimulation intensities during two consecutive sessions. Results: The gyrus-based nTMS mapping was received well by all participants and was less time consuming than the grid-constrained standard. On average, MEP amplitudes, latencies, and centre-of-gravity and size of the active areas largely agreed across protocols supporting validity. Intraclass coefficients between sessions unscored the reliability of our protocol. Conclusion: We designed an nTMS protocol for the simultaneous mapping multiple muscles on the cortex. The protocol takes only about ten minutes per participant when including as many as eight muscles. Our assessments revealed that the cortical representation of multiple muscles can be determined with high validity and reliability.

                Most mental disorders are characterised by impaired cognitive function and behaviour control. Their often chronic reoccurring nature and the lack of efficient therapies necessitate the development of new treatment strategies. Brain-computer interfaces, equipped with multiple sensing and stimulation abilities, offer a new toolbox, whose suitability for diagnosis and therapy of mental disorders has not yet been explored. Here, we developed a soft and multimodal neuroprosthesis to measure and modulate prefrontal neurophysiological features of neuropsychiatric symptoms. We implanted the device epidurally above the medial prefrontal cortex of rats and obtained auditory event-related brain potentials reflecting intact neural stimulus processing and alcohol-induced neural impairments. Moreover, implant-driven electrical and pharmacological stimulation enabled successful modulation of neural activity. Finally, we developed machine learning algorithms which can deal with sparsity in the data and distinguish effects with high accuracy. Our work underlines the potential of multimodal bioelectronic systems to enable a personalised and optimised therapy.

                Auditory attention describes a listeners focus on an acoustic source while they ignore other competing sources that might be present. In an environment with multiple talkers and background noise (i.e. the cocktail party effect), auditory attention can be difficult, requiring the listener to expend measurable cognitive effort. A listener will naturally interrupt sustained attention on a source when switching towards another source during conversation. This change in attention is potentially even more taxing than maintaining sustained attention due to the limits of human working memory, and this additional effort required has not been well studied. In this work, we evaluated an attention decoder algorithm for detecting the change in attention and investigated cognitive effort expended during attentional switching and sustained attention. Two variants of endogenous attention switching were explored: the switches either had in-the-moment decision making or a pre-defined attentional switch time. A least-squares, EEG-based, attention decoding algorithm achieved 64.1% accuracy with a 5-second correlation window and illustrated smooth transitions in the attended talker prediction through switches in sustained attention at approximately half of the analysis window size (2.2 seconds). The expended listening effort, as measured by simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) and pupillometry, was also a strong indicator of switching. Specifically, centrotemporal alpha power [F(2, 18) = 7.473, P = 0.00434] and mean pupil diameter [F(2, 18) = 9.159, P = 0.0018] were significantly different for trials that contained a switch in comparison to sustained trials. We also found that relative attended and ignored talker locations modulate the EEG alpha topographic response. This alpha lateralization was found to be impacted by the interaction between experimental condition and whether the measure was computed before or after the switch [F(2,18) = 3.227, P = 0.0634]. These results suggest that expended listening effort is a promising feature that should be pursued in a decoding context, in addition to speech and location-based features.

                Antibiotics are widely applied for the treatment of bacterial infections, but their long-term use may lead to gut flora dysbiosis and detrimental effects on brain physiology, behavior as well as cognitive performance. Still, a striking lack of knowledge exists concerning electrophysiological correlates of antibiotic-induced changes in gut microbiota and behavior. Here, we investigated changes in the synaptic transmission and plasticity together with behaviorally-relevant network activities from the hippocampus of antibiotic-treated mice. The prolonged antibiotic treatment led to a strong reduction of myeloid cell pools in bone marrow, circulation and those surveilling the brain. Upon antibiotic treatment, circulating Ly6Chi inflammatory monocytes adopted a proinflammatory phenotype with increased expression of CD40 and MHC II. In the central nervous system, microglia displayed typical signs of activation with elevated CD40 and MHC II expression, as well as increased IL-6 and TNF production. Concomitantly, we detected a substantial reduction in the synaptic transmission in the hippocampal CA1 after antibiotic treatment. In line, carbachol-induced cholinergic gamma oscillation were reduced upon antibiotic treatment while the incidence of hippocampal sharp waves was elevated. These changes were associated with the global changes in the expression of neurotrophin nerve growth factor and inducible nitric oxide synthase, both of which have been shown to influence cholinergic functions. Overall, our study demonstrates that antibiotic-induced changes in the gut microbiome and immune cell function are associated with a drastic reduction in the synaptic transmission and gamma oscillations in the hippocampus, a brain region that is critically involved in mediation of innate and cognitive behavior.

                Social relationships change across the lifespan as social networks narrow and motivational priorities shift to the present. Interestingly, aging is also associated with changes in executive function, including decision-making abilities, but it remains unclear how age-related changes in both domains interact to impact financial decisions involving other people. To study this problem, we recruited 50 human participants (N_younger = 26, ages 18-34; N_older = 24, ages 63-80) to play an economic trust game as the investor with three partners (friend, stranger, and computer) who played the role of investee. Investors underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during the trust game while investees were seated outside of the scanner. Building on our previous work with younger adults showing both enhanced striatal responses and altered default-mode network (DMN) connectivity as a function of social closeness during reciprocated trust, we predicted that these relations would exhibit age-related differences. We found that striatal responses to reciprocated trust from friends relative to strangers and computers were blunted in older adults relative to younger adults, thus supporting our primary pre-registered hypothesis regarding social closeness. We also found that older adults exhibited enhanced DMN connectivity with the temporoparietal junction (TPJ) during reciprocated trust from friends compared to computers while younger adults exhibited the opposite pattern. Taken together, these results advance our understanding of age-related differences in sensitivity to social closeness in the context of trusting others.

                Excitotoxicity caused by NMDA receptors (NMDARs) is a major cause of neuronal death in ischemic stroke. However, past efforts of directly targeting NMDARs have unfortunately failed in clinical ischemic stroke trials. Here we reveal an unexpected mechanism underlying NMDARs-mediated neurotoxicity, which leads to identification of a novel target and development of an effective therapeutic peptide for ischemic stroke. We show that NMDAR's excitotoxicity upon ischemic insults is mediated by physical and functional coupling to TRPM2. The physical interaction of TRPM2 with NMDARs results in markedly increase in the surface expression of NMDARs, leading to enhanced NMDAR function and increased neuronal death. We identified a specific NMDAR-interacting domain on TRPM2, and developed a cell-permeable peptide to uncouple TRPM2-NMDARs. The disrupting-peptide protects neurons against ischemic injury in vitro and protects mice against ischemic stroke in vivo. These findings provide an unconventional strategy to eliminate excitotoxic neuronal death without directly targeting NMDARs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A comparative study between state-of-the-art MRI deidentification and AnonyMI, a new method combining re-identification risk reduction and geometrical preservation</a></h4>

              
                Deidentifying MRIs constitutes an imperative challenge, as it aims at precluding the possibility of re-identification of a research subject or patient, but at the same time it should preserve as much geometrical information as possible, in order to maximize data reusability and to facilitate interoperability. Although several deidentification methods exist, no comprehensive and comparative evaluation of deidentification performance has been carried out across them. Moreover, the possible ways these methods can compromise subsequent analysis has not been exhaustively tested. To tackle these issues, we developed AnonyMI, a novel MRI deidentification method, implemented as a user-friendly 3D Slicer plugin-in, which aims at providing a balance between identity protection and geometrical preservation. To test these features, we performed two series of analyses on which we compared AnonyMI to other two state-of-the-art methods, to evaluate, at the same time, how efficient they are at deidentifying MRIs and how much they affect subsequent analyses, with particular emphasis on source localization procedures. Our results show that all three methods significantly reduce the re-identification risk but AnonyMI provides the best geometrical conservation. Notably, it also offers several technical advantages such as a user-friendly interface, multiple input-output capabilities, the possibility of being tailored to specific needs, batch processing and efficient visualization for quality assurance.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Coherent mapping of position and head direction across auditory and visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                Neurons in primary visual cortex (V1) may not only signal current visual input but also relevant contextual information such as reward expectancy and the subject's spatial position. Such location-specific representations need not be restricted to V1 but could participate in a coherent mapping throughout sensory cortices. Here we show that spiking activity in primary auditory cortex (A1) and lateral, secondary visual cortex (V2L) of freely moving rats coherently represents a location-specific mapping in a sensory detection task performed on a figure-8 maze. Single-unit activity of both areas showed extensive similarities in terms of spatial distribution, reliability and position coding. Importantly, reconstructions of subject position on the basis of spiking activity displayed decoding errors that were correlated between areas in magnitude and direction. In addition to position, we found that head direction, but not locomotor speed or head angular velocity, was an important determinant of activity in A1 and V2L. Finally, pairs of units within and across areas showed significant correlations in instantaneous variability of firing rates (noise correlations). These were dependent on the spatial tuning of cells as well as the spatial position of the animal. We conclude that sensory cortices participate in coherent, multimodal representations of the subject's sensory-specific location. These may provide a common reference frame for distributed cortical sensory and motor processes and may support crossmodal predictive processing.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Distributed representations for human inference</a></h4>

              
                Neural representations can be characterized as falling along a continuum, from distributed representations, in which neurons are responsive to many related features of the environment, to localist representations, where neurons orthogonalize activity patterns despite any input similarity. Distributed representations support powerful learning in neural network models and have been posited to exist throughout the brain, but it is unclear under what conditions humans acquire these representations and what computational advantages they may confer. In a series of behavioral experiments, we present evidence that interleaved exposure to new information facilitates the rapid formation of distributed representations in humans. As in neural network models with distributed representations, interleaved learning supports fast and automatic recognition of item relatedness, affords efficient generalization, and is especially critical for inference when learning requires statistical integration of noisy information over time. We use the data to adjudicate between several existing computational models of human memory and inference. The results demonstrate the power of interleaved learning and implicate the use of distributed representations in human inference.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">An Oscillatory Mechanism for Multi-level Storage in Short-term Memory</a></h4>

              
                Oscillatory activity is commonly observed during the maintenance of information in short-term memory, but its role remains unclear. Non-oscillatory models of short-term memory storage are able to encode stimulus identity through their spatial patterns of activity, but are typically limited to either an all-or-none representation of stimulus amplitude or exhibit a biologically implausible exact-tuning condition. Here, we demonstrate a simple phase-locking mechanism by which oscillatory input enables a circuit to generate persistent or sequential activity patterns that encode information not only in their location but also in a discrete set of amplitudes.

	<p>Microglia influence pathological progression in neurological diseases, reacting to insults by expressing multiple morphofunctional phenotypes. However, the complete morphological spectrum of reactive microglia, as revealed by three-dimensional microscopic reconstruction, has not been detailed in virus limbic encephalitis. Here, using an anatomical series of brain sections, we expanded on an earlier Piry arbovirus encephalitis study to include CA1/CA2 and assessed the morphological response of homeostatic and reactive microglia at eight days post-infection. Hierarchical cluster and linear discriminant function analyses of multimodal morphometric features distinguished microglial morphology between infected animals and controls. For a broad representation of the spectrum of microglial morphology in each defined cluster, we chose representative cells of homeostatic and reactive microglia, using the sum of the distances of each cell in relation to all the others. Based on multivariate analysis, reactive microglia of infected animals showed more complex trees and thicker branches, covering a larger volume of tissue than in control animals. This approach offers a reliable representation of microglia dispersion in the Euclidean space, revealing the morphological kaleidoscope of surveillant and reactive microglia morphotypes. Because form precedes function in nature, our findings offer a starting point for research using integrative methods to understand microglia form and function.</p>

	<p>Aggression and violent offenses are common amongst forensic psychiatric patients. Notably, research distinguishes two motivationally distinct dimension of aggression–instrumental and reactive aggression. Instrumental aggression comprises of appetitive, goal-directed aggressive acts, whereas reactive aggression consists of affective, defensive violence with both their biological basis remaining largely unknown. Childhood trauma and functional genetic polymorphisms in catecholamines converting enzymes, such as mono-amino-oxidase A (MAO-A) and catechol-o-methyltransferase (COMT) have been suggested to augment an aggressive behavioral response in adulthood. However, it warrants clarification if these factors influence one or both types of aggression. Furthermore, it remains elusive, if having a combination of unfavorable enzyme genotypes and childhood maltreatment further increases violent behavior. Hence, we set out to address these questions in the current study. First, analysis revealed an overall marginally increased frequency of the unfavorable MAO-A genotype in the test population. Second, each gene polymorphisms together with a traumatic childhood significantly increased the AFAS (Appetitive and Facilitative Aggression Scale) scores for both reactive and appetitive aggression. Third, having a combination of both disadvantageous genotypes and a negative childhood served as a minor positive predictor for increased reactive aggression, but had a strong influence on the joy of being aggressive.</p>

	<p>Olfactory decline is an early symptom of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and is a predictor of conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD. Olfactory decline could reflect AD-related atrophy of structures related to the sense of smell. The aim of this study was to verify whether the presence of a clinical diagnosis of AD or MCI is associated with a volumetric decrease in the olfactory bulbs (OB) and the primary olfactory cortex (POC). We conducted two systematic reviews, one for each region and a meta-analysis. We collected articles from PsychNet, PubMed, Ebsco, and ProQuest databases. Results showed large and heterogeneous effects indicating smaller OB volumes in patients with AD (k = 6, g = −1.21, 95% CI [−2.19, −0.44]) and in patients with MCI compared to controls. There is also a trend for smaller POC in patients with AD or MCI compared to controls. Neuroanatomical structures involved in olfactory processing are smaller in AD and these volumetric reductions could be measured as early as the MCI stage.</p>

	<p>Background. Interpersonal distance (IPD) plays a critical role in a human being’s social life, especially during interpersonal interaction, and IPD is non-verbal social information and not only provides silent cues but also provides a secure space for personal relationships. IPD has been a research field of neural studies from the recent decade, researches had provided behavior and neural correlates of IPD. Objectives. This review aims to summarize the experimental paradigms of IPD-neural research, to reveal the neural activity processes associated with it, and to explore the correlation between IPD-neural activity and IPD-behavior. Methods. We conducted a standardized systematic review procedure, including the formal search method be adopted to seek out any type of studies related to IPD and brain, then devised them into categories to make a systematic review. Results. 17 articles met the inclusion criteria of the review, 5 event-related potential (ERP) studies measured the amplitude and latencies of ERPs, and 12 functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies provided the neural activation during IPD tasks. In addition, the passive IPD experimental paradigm is the main experimental paradigm for exploring neural activity in IPD cognition, with the parietal lobe, motor areas, prefrontal lobe, and amygdala being the main brain areas involved. Functional connections between the identified brain regions were found and have a moderate correlation with IPD behavior. Conclusions. This review provides the neural activity of the IPD interaction process. However, the insufficient ecological validity of IPD tasks and ignore the initiative of people in IPD interaction. Therefore, there is a large research space on this topic. The work of the current systematic review contributed to linking the external performance and inner neural activities of IPD.</p>

	<p>Seizures in about 40% of patients with epilepsy fail to respond to anti-seizure medication (ASM) and may lead to uncontrolled and prolonged seizures often inducing status epilepticus (SE). The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of a long-term treatment with two different generation ASMs: ethosuximide (ETS, a classic ASM) and lacosamide (LCM, a 3rd generation ASM) on neural stem cells’ (NSCs’) proliferation and learning and memory functions after pilocarpine (PILO)-induced SE in mice. The following drugs were used: LCM (10 mg/kg), ETS (20 mg/kg), and PILO (300 mg/kg). Cell counting was done using confocal microscope and ImageJ software. Cognitive functions were evaluated with the Morris water maze (MWM) test. The level of several selected neurometabolites was measured with magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Obtained results indicated no significant impact of ETS treatment on the neurogenesis process in PILO mice. Interestingly, LCM significantly decreased the total amount of newborn neurons. The MWM test indicated no significant changes in the time and distance traveled by the ETS and LCM groups compared to PILO control mice, although all measured parameters were more favorable for the PILO mice treated with ASM. Conclusions: The presented results show that long term treatment with LCM and ETS seems to be safe for the cognitive functions and the proper course of neurogenesis in the mouse PILO-induced SE model, although one should remember that LCM administered chronically may act to reduce new neurons’ formation.</p>

	<p>(1) Background: This study compared anterior attentional–intentional system performance between three groups: Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients with normal cognition (PD-NC), with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI), and a comparison group (CG). It also evaluated the feasibility of the recruitment and study procedures; (2) Methods: From 45 participants recruited, 39 were allocated (mean age 65.31; 43.59% men) to PD-NC, PD-MCI and CG (13 per group). To assess attention, we used three tasks from the ROtman–Baycrest Battery for Investigating Attention: Simple Reaction time (RT), Choice RT, and Prepare RT. We conducted a mixed-model analysis of variance with a 3 (groups) × 4 (tasks) design to compare reaction times; (3) Results: PD-MCI had slower reaction times than PD-NC (p = 0.028) and the CG (p = 0.052); there was no difference between PD-NC and CG. PD-MCI might perform worse on monitoring tasks than PD-NC, Z = −1.68, p = 0.092. Nearly half the volunteers from the CG and 87% of all eligible patients were enrolled in the study and completed all neuropsychological procedures; (4) Conclusions: General cognitive decline appears related to partial deficits in energization and tends to impair attentional monitoring. Furthermore, PD-NC exhibited similar reaction times to the CG. Results from the feasibility study contributed to the definitive study.</p>

	<p>Levels of independence vary in individuals with Down syndrome (DS). We began this study to describe the current life skills in our clinic population of children and adults with DS. We collected and reviewed demographics, living situation, and life skills from an electronic intake form used in clinic procedures. Descriptive statistics for this cohort study included mean, standard deviation, and frequencies. From 2014–2020, 350 pediatric and 196 adult patients (range 0–62 years) with a first visit to the Massachusetts General Hospital Down Syndrome Program are described. Pediatric patients were most often enrolled in school, and in an inclusion setting. Adult patients were most often participating in a day program, living with family, and wanted to continue living with family in the future. Most (87%) of adults with DS communicated verbally, though fewer could use written communication (17%). Life skills of greatest importance to adolescents and adults with DS included: learning about healthy foods (35%), preparing meals (34%), providing personal information when needed (35%), and describing symptoms to a doctor (35%). Life skills for patients with DS are varied; those associated with a medical appointment, such as sharing symptoms with the doctor, could improve for greater independence.</p>

	<p>Counting ability is one of the many aspects of animal cognition and has enjoyed great interest over the last couple of decades. The impetus for studying counting ability in nonhuman animals has likely come from more than a general interest in animal cognition, as the analysis of animal abilities amplifies our understanding of human cognition. In addition, a model animal with the ability to count could be used to replace human subjects in related studies. Here we designed a behavioral paradigm to train rhesus monkeys to count 1-to-6 visual patterns presented sequentially with long and irregular interpattern intervals on a touch screen. The monkeys were required to make a response to the sixth pattern exclusively, inhibiting response to any patterns appearing at other ordinal positions. All stimulus patterns were of the same size, color, location, and shape to prevent monkeys making the right choice due to non-number physical cues. In the long delay period, the monkey had to enumerate how many patterns had been presented sequentially and had to remember in which ordinal position the current pattern was located. Otherwise, it was impossible for them to know which pattern was the target one. The results show that all three monkeys learned to correctly choose the sixth pattern within 3 months. This study provides convincing behavioral evidence that rhesus monkeys may have the capacity to count.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Preventing type 1 diabetes in childhood</a></h4>

              
                <p>Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease in which the insulin-producing &beta; cells of the pancreas are destroyed by T lymphocytes. Recent studies have demonstrated that monitoring for pancreatic islet autoantibodies, combined with genetic risk assessment, can identify most children who will develop T1D when they still have sufficient &beta; cell function to control glucose concentrations without the need for insulin. In addition, there has been recent success in secondary prevention using immunotherapy to delay the progression of preclinical disease, and primary prevention approaches to inhibiting the initiating autoimmune process have entered large-scale clinical trials. By changing the focus of T1D management from late diagnosis and insulin replacement to early diagnosis and &beta; cell preservation, we can anticipate a future without the need for daily insulin injections for children with T1D.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Immunotherapy: Building a bridge to a cure for type 1 diabetes</a></h4>

              
                <p>Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease in which T cells attack and destroy the insulin-producing &beta; cells in the pancreatic islets. Genetic and environmental factors increase T1D risk by compromising immune homeostasis. Although the discovery and use of insulin have transformed T1D treatment, insulin therapy does not change the underlying disease or fully prevent complications. Over the past two decades, research has identified multiple immune cell types and soluble factors that destroy insulin-producing &beta; cells. These insights into disease pathogenesis have enabled the development of therapies to prevent and modify T1D. In this review, we highlight the key events that initiate and sustain pancreatic islet inflammation in T1D, the current state of the immunological therapies, and their advantages for the treatment of T1D.</p>

                <p>Technological advancements in blood glucose monitoring and therapeutic insulin administration have improved the quality of life for people with type 1 diabetes. However, these efforts fall short of replicating the exquisite metabolic control provided by native islets. We examine the integrated advancements in islet cell replacement and immunomodulatory therapies that are coalescing to enable the restoration of endogenous glucose regulation. We highlight advances in stem cell biology and graft site design, which offer innovative sources of cellular material and improved engraftment. We also cover cutting-edge approaches for preventing allograft rejection and recurrent autoimmunity. These insights reflect a growing understanding of type 1 diabetes etiology, &beta; cell biology, and biomaterial design, together highlighting therapeutic opportunities to durably replace the &beta; cells destroyed in type 1 diabetes.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Type 1 diabetes glycemic management: Insulin therapy, glucose monitoring, and automation</a></h4>

              
                <p>Despite innovations in insulin therapy since its discovery, most patients living with type 1 diabetes do not achieve sufficient glycemic control to prevent complications, and they experience hypoglycemia, weight gain, and major self-care burden. Promising pharmacological advances in insulin therapy include the refinement of extremely rapid insulin analogs, alternate insulin-delivery routes, liver-selective insulins, add-on drugs that enhance insulin effect, and glucose-responsive insulin molecules. The greatest future impact will come from combining these pharmacological solutions with existing automated insulin delivery methods that integrate insulin pumps and glucose sensors. These systems will use algorithms enhanced by machine learning, supplemented by technologies that include activity monitors and sensors for other key metabolites such as ketones. The future challenges facing clinicians and researchers will be those of access and broad clinical implementation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Horizontally transmitted parasitoid killing factor shapes insect defense to parasitoids</a></h4>

              
                <p>Interkingdom competition occurs between hymenopteran parasitoids and insect viruses sharing the same insect hosts. It has been assumed that parasitoid larvae die with the death of the infected host or as result of competition for host resources. Here we describe a gene family, <I>parasitoid killing factor</I> (<I>pkf</I>), that encodes proteins toxic to parasitoids of the Microgastrinae group and determines parasitism success. <I>Pkfs</I> are found in several entomopathogenic DNA virus families and in some lepidopteran genomes. We provide evidence of equivalent and specific toxicity against endoparasites for PKFs found in entomopoxvirus, ascovirus, baculovirus, and Lepidoptera through a mechanism that elicits apoptosis in the cells of susceptible parasitoids. This highlights the evolutionary arms race between parasitoids, viruses, and their insect hosts.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Drug-induced phospholipidosis confounds drug repurposing for SARS-CoV-2</a></h4>

              
                <p>Repurposing drugs as treatments for COVID-19, the disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has drawn much attention. Beginning with sigma receptor ligands and expanding to other drugs from screening in the field, we became concerned that phospholipidosis was a shared mechanism underlying the antiviral activity of many repurposed drugs. For all of the 23 cationic amphiphilic drugs we tested, including hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, amiodarone, and four others already in clinical trials, phospholipidosis was monotonically correlated with antiviral efficacy. Conversely, drugs active against the same targets that did not induce phospholipidosis were not antiviral. Phospholipidosis depends on the physicochemical properties of drugs and does not reflect specific target-based activities&mdash;rather, it may be considered a toxic confound in early drug discovery. Early detection of phospholipidosis could eliminate these artifacts, enabling a focus on molecules with therapeutic potential.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">lncRNA SLERT controls phase separation of FC/DFCs to facilitate Pol I transcription</a></h4>

              
                <p>RNA polymerase I (Pol I) transcription takes place at the border of the fibrillar center (FC) and the dense fibrillar component (DFC) in the nucleolus. Here, we report that individual spherical FC/DFC units are coated by the DEAD-box RNA helicase DDX21 in human cells. The long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) <I>SLERT</I> binds to DDX21 RecA domains to promote DDX21 to adopt a closed conformation at a substoichiometric ratio through a molecular chaperone&ndash;like mechanism resulting in the formation of hypomultimerized and loose DDX21 clusters that coat DFCs, which is required for proper FC/DFC liquidity and Pol I processivity. Our results suggest that <I>SLERT</I> is an RNA regulator that controls the biophysical properties of FC/DFCs and thus ribosomal RNA production.</p>

                <p>Thermoelectric materials transfer heat and electrical energy, hence they are useful for power generation or cooling applications. Many of these materials have narrow bandgaps, especially for cooling applications. We developed SnSe crystals with a wide bandgap (<I>E</I><SUB>g</SUB>  33 <I>k</I><SUB>B</SUB><I>T</I>) with attractive thermoelectric properties through Pb alloying. The momentum and energy multiband alignments promoted by Pb alloying resulted in an ultrahigh power factor of ~75 &mu;W cm<sup>&ndash;1</sup> K<sup>&ndash;2</sup> at 300 K, and an average figure of merit <I>ZT</I> of ~1.90. We found that a 31-pair thermoelectric device can produce a power generation efficiency of ~4.4% and a cooling <I>T</I><SUB>max</SUB> of ~45.7 K. These results demonstrate that wide-bandgap compounds can be used for thermoelectric cooling applications.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Liquid medium annealing for fabricating durable perovskite solar cells with improved reproducibility</a></h4>

              
                <p>Solution processing of semiconductors is highly promising for the high-throughput production of cost-effective electronics and optoelectronics. Although hybrid perovskites have potential in various device applications, challenges remain in the development of high-quality materials with simultaneously improved processing reproducibility and scalability. Here, we report a liquid medium annealing (LMA) technology that creates a robust chemical environment and constant heating field to modulate crystal growth over the entire film. Our method produces films with high crystallinity, fewer defects, desired stoichiometry, and overall film homogeneity. The resulting perovskite solar cells (PSCs) yield a stabilized power output of 24.04% (certified 23.7%, 0.08 cm<sup>2</sup>) and maintain 95% of their initial power conversion efficiency (PCE) after 2000 hours of operation. In addition, the 1-cm<sup>2</sup> PSCs exhibit a stabilized power output of 23.15% (certified PCE 22.3%) and keep 90% of their initial PCE after 1120 hours of operation, which illustrates their feasibility for scalable fabrication. LMA is less climate dependent and produces devices in-house with negligible performance variance year round. This method thus opens a new and effective avenue to improving the quality of perovskite films and photovoltaic devices in a scalable and reproducible manner.</p>

                <p>Half-integer thermal quantum Hall conductance has recently been reported for the two-dimensional honeycomb material &alpha;-RuCl<SUB>3</SUB>. We found that the half-integer thermal Hall plateau appears even for a magnetic field with no out-of-plane components. The measured field-angular variation of the quantized thermal Hall conductance has the same sign structure as the topological Chern number of the pure Kitaev spin liquid. This observation suggests that the non-Abelian topological order associated with fractionalization of the local magnetic moments persists even in the presence of non-Kitaev interactions in &alpha;-RuCl<SUB>3</SUB>.</p>

                <p>Generalization of the concept of band topology from lower-dimensional to higher-dimensional (<I>n</I> &gt; 3) physical systems is expected to introduce new bulk and boundary topological effects. However, theoretically predicted topological singularities in five-dimensional systems&mdash;Weyl surfaces and Yang monopoles&mdash;have either not been demonstrated in realistic physical systems or are limited to purely synthetic dimensions. We constructed a system possessing Yang monopoles and Weyl surfaces based on metamaterials with engineered electromagnetic properties, leading to the observation of several intriguing bulk and surface phenomena, such as linking of Weyl surfaces and surface Weyl arcs, via selected three-dimensional subspaces. The demonstrated photonic Weyl surfaces and Weyl arcs leverage the concept of higher-dimension topology to control the propagation of electromagnetic waves in artificially engineered photonic media.</p>

                <p>Artificial spin ices are frustrated spin systems that can be engineered, in which fine tuning of geometry and topology has allowed the design and characterization of exotic emergent phenomena at the constituent level. Here, we report a realization of spin ice in a lattice of superconducting qubits. Unlike conventional artificial spin ice, our system is disordered by both quantum and thermal fluctuations. The ground state is classically described by the ice rule, and we achieved control over a fragile degeneracy point, leading to a Coulomb phase. The ability to pin individual spins allows us to demonstrate Gauss&rsquo;s law for emergent effective monopoles in two dimensions. The demonstrated qubit control lays the groundwork for potential future study of topologically protected artificial quantum spin liquids.</p>

                <p>The question of how the brain recognizes the faces of familiar individuals has been important throughout the history of neuroscience. Cells linking visual processing to person memory have been proposed but not found. Here, we report the discovery of such cells through recordings from an area in the macaque temporal pole identified with functional magnetic resonance imaging. These cells responded to faces that were personally familiar. They responded nonlinearly to stepwise changes in face visibility and detail and holistically to face parts, reflecting key signatures of familiar face recognition. They discriminated between familiar identities, as fast as a general face identity area. The discovery of these cells establishes a new pathway for the fast recognition of familiar individuals.</p>

                <p>In animals, PIEZOs are plasma membrane&ndash;localized cation channels involved in diverse mechanosensory processes. We investigated PIEZO function in tip-growing cells in the moss <I>Physcomitrium patens</I> and the flowering plant <I>Arabidopsis thaliana</I>. <I>Pp</I>PIEZO1 and <I>Pp</I>PIEZO2 redundantly contribute to the normal growth, size, and cytoplasmic calcium oscillations of caulonemal cells. Both <I>Pp</I>PIEZO1 and <I>Pp</I>PIEZO2 localized to vacuolar membranes. Loss-of-function, gain-of-function, and overexpression mutants revealed that moss PIEZO homologs promote increased complexity of vacuolar membranes through tubulation, internalization, and/or fission. <I>Arabidopsis</I> PIEZO1 also localized to the tonoplast and is required for vacuole tubulation in the tips of pollen tubes. We propose that in plant cells the tonoplast has more freedom of movement than the plasma membrane, making it a more effective location for mechanosensory proteins.</p>

                <p>Bacteriophage predation selects for diverse antiphage systems that frequently cluster on mobilizable defense islands in bacterial genomes. However, molecular insight into the reciprocal dynamics of phage-bacterial adaptations in nature is lacking, particularly in clinical contexts where there is need to inform phage therapy efforts and to understand how phages drive pathogen evolution. Using time-shift experiments, we uncovered fluctuations in <I>Vibrio cholerae</I>&rsquo;s resistance to phages in clinical samples. We mapped phage resistance determinants to SXT integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs), which notoriously also confer antibiotic resistance. We found that SXT ICEs, which are widespread in -proteobacteria, invariably encode phage defense systems localized to a single hotspot of genetic exchange. We identified mechanisms that allow phage to counter SXT-mediated defense in clinical samples, and document the selection of a novel phage-encoded defense inhibitor. Phage infection stimulates high-frequency SXT ICE conjugation, leading to the concurrent dissemination of phage and antibiotic resistances.</p>

                <p>Emerging studies indicate that the immune system can regulate systemic metabolism. Here, we show that thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) stimulates T cells to induce selective white adipose loss, which protects against obesity, improves glucose metabolism, and mitigates nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Unexpectedly, adipose loss was not caused by alterations in food intake, absorption, or energy expenditure. Rather, it was induced by the excessive loss of lipids through the skin as sebum. TSLP and T cells regulated sebum release and sebum-associated antimicrobial peptide expression in the steady state. In human skin, <I>TSLP</I> expression correlated directly with sebum-associated gene expression. Thus, we establish a paradigm in which adipose loss can be achieved by means of sebum hypersecretion and uncover a role for adaptive immunity in skin barrier function through sebum secretion.</p>

                <p>Aging is an established risk factor for vascular diseases, but vascular aging itself may contribute to the progressive deterioration of organ function. Here, we show in aged mice that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling insufficiency, which is caused by increased production of decoy receptors, may drive physiological aging across multiple organ systems. Increasing VEGF signaling prevented age-associated capillary loss, improved organ perfusion and function, and extended life span. Healthier aging was evidenced by favorable metabolism and body composition and amelioration of aging-associated pathologies including hepatic steatosis, sarcopenia, osteoporosis, "inflammaging" (age-related multiorgan chronic inflammation), and increased tumor burden. These results indicate that VEGF signaling insufficiency affects organ aging in mice and suggest that modulating this pathway may result in increased mammalian life span and improved overall health.</p>

<p>Mechanical thrombectomy (MT) is not recommended for acute stroke with large vessel occlusion (LVO) and a large volume of irreversibly injured tissue (“core”). Perfusion imaging may identify a subset of patients with large core who benefit from MT.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We compared two cohorts of LVO-related patients with large core (&gt;50 ml on diffusion-weighted-imaging or CT-perfusion using RAPID), available perfusion imaging, and treated within 6 hours from onset by either MT + Best Medical Management (BMM) in one prospective study, or BMM alone in the pre-MT era from a prospective registry. Primary outcome was 90-day modified Rankin Scale ≤2. We searched for an interaction between treatment group and amount of penumbra as estimated by the mismatch ratio (MMRatio = critical hypoperfusion/core volume).</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Overall, 107 patients were included (56 MT + BMM and 51 BMM): Mean age was 68 ± 15 years, median core volume 99 ml (IQR: 72–131) and MMRatio 1.4 (IQR: 1.0–1.9). Baseline clinical and radiological variables were similar between the two groups, except for a higher intravenous thrombolysis rate in the BMM group. The MMRatio strongly modified the clinical outcome following MT (<i>p</i>
<sub>interaction</sub> &lt; 0.001 for continuous MMRatio); MT was associated with a higher rate of good outcome in patients with, but not in those without, MMRatio&gt;1.2 (adjusted OR [95% CI] = 6.8 [1.7–27.0] vs 0.7 [0.1–6.2], respectively). Similar findings were present for MMRatio ≥1.8 in the subgroup with core ≥70 ml. Parenchymal hemorrhage on follow-up imaging was more frequent in the MT + BMM group regardless of the MMRatio.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Perfusion imaging may help select which patients with large core should be considered for MT. Randomized studies are warranted. ANN NEUROL 2021</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The regulation of synaptic connectivity in the brain is vital to proper functioning and development of the CNS. Formation of neural networks in the CNS has been shown to be heavily influenced by astrocytes, which secrete factors, including thrombospondin (TSP) family proteins, that promote synaptogenesis. However, whether this process is different between males and females has not been thoroughly investigated. In this study, we found that cortical neurons purified from newborn male rats showed a significantly more robust synaptogenic response compared with female-derived cells when exposed to factors secreted from astrocytes. This difference was driven largely by the neuronal response to TSP2, which increased synapses in male neurons while showing no effect on female neurons. Blockade of endogenous 17&beta;-estradiol (E2) production with letrozole normalized the TSP response between male and female cells, indicating a level of regulation by estrogen signaling. Our results suggest that male and female neurons show a divergent response to TSP synaptogenic signaling, contributing to sex differences in astrocyte-mediated synaptic connectivity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">COUNTEN, an AI-Driven Tool for Rapid and Objective Structural Analyses of the Enteric Nervous System</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The enteric nervous system (ENS) consists of an interconnected meshwork of neurons and glia residing within the wall of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. While healthy GI function is associated with healthy ENS structure, defined by the normal distribution of neurons within ganglia of the ENS, a comprehensive understanding of normal neuronal distribution and ganglionic organization in the ENS is lacking. Current methodologies for manual enumeration of neurons parse only limited tissue regions and are prone to error, subjective bias, and peer-to-peer discordance. There is accordingly a need for robust, and objective tools that can capture and quantify enteric neurons within multiple ganglia over large areas of tissue. Here, we report on the development of an AI-driven tool, COUNTEN (COUNTing Enteric Neurons), which is capable of accurately identifying and enumerating immunolabeled enteric neurons, and objectively clustering them into ganglia. We tested and found that COUNTEN matches trained humans in its accuracy while taking a fraction of the time to complete the analyses. Finally, we use COUNTEN&rsquo;s accuracy and speed to identify and cluster thousands of ileal myenteric neurons into hundreds of ganglia to compute metrics that help define the normal structure of the ileal myenteric plexus. To facilitate reproducible, robust, and objective measures of ENS structure across mouse models, experiments, and institutions, COUNTEN is freely and openly available to all researchers.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Deciphering Spinal Endogenous Dopaminergic Mechanisms That Modulate Micturition Reflexes in Rats with Spinal Cord Injury</a></h4>

              
                <p>Spinal neuronal mechanisms regulate recovered involuntary micturition after spinal cord injury (SCI). It was recently discovered that dopamine (DA) is synthesized in the rat injured spinal cord and is involved in lower urinary tract (LUT) activity. To fully understand the role of spinal DAergic machinery in micturition, we examined urodynamic responses in female rats during pharmacological modulation of the DA pathway. Three to four weeks after complete thoracic SCI, the DA precursor L-DOPA administered intravenously during bladder cystometrogram (CMG) and external urethral sphincter (EUS) electromyography (EMG) reduced bladder overactivity and increased the duration of EUS bursting, leading to remarkably improved voiding efficiency. Apomorphine (APO), a non-selective DA receptor (DR) agonist, or quinpirole, a selective DR<SUB>2</SUB> agonist, induced similar responses, whereas a specific DR<SUB>2</SUB> antagonist remoxipride alone had only minimal effects. Meanwhile, administration of SCH 23390, a DR<SUB>1</SUB> antagonist, reduced voiding efficiency by increasing tonic EUS activity and shortening the EUS bursting period. Unexpectedly, SKF 38393, a selective DR<SUB>1</SUB> agonist, increased EUS tonic activity, implying a complicated role of DR<SUB>1</SUB> in LUT function. In metabolic cage assays, subcutaneous administration of quinpirole decreased spontaneous voiding frequency and increased voiding volume; L-DOPA and APO were inactive possibly because of slow entry into the CNS. Collectively, tonically active DR<SUB>1</SUB> in SCI rats inhibit urine storage and enhance voiding by differentially modulating EUS tonic and bursting patterns, respectively, while pharmacologic activation of DR<SUB>2</SUB>, which are normally silent, improves voiding by enhancing EUS bursting. Thus, enhancing DA signaling achieves better detrusor-sphincter coordination to facilitate micturition function in SCI rats.</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>In vivo measures of myeloid activity are promising biomarkers in multiple sclerosis. We previously demonstrated that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) myeloid microvesicles are markers of microglial/macrophage activity and neuroinflammation in multiple sclerosis. Here, we aimed at investigating the diagnostic and prognostic value of myeloid microvesicles in a clinical setting.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Six hundred one patients discharged with a diagnosis of neuroinflammatory, neurodegenerative, or no neurological disease were enrolled. Myeloid microvesicles were measured with flow cytometry as isolectin B4–positive events in fresh CSF. Clinical, demographical, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data were collected at diagnosis (all patients) and during follow-up (n = 176).</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>CSF myeloid microvesicles were elevated in neuroinflammatory patients compared to the neurodegenerative and control groups. In multiple sclerosis, microvesicles were higher in patients with MRI disease activity and their concentration increased along with the number of enhancing lesions (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001, Jonckheere–Terpstra test). CSF myeloid microvesicles were also higher in patients with higher disease activity in the month and year preceding diagnosis. Microvesicles excellently discriminated between the relapsing–remitting and control groups (receiver operator characteristic curve, area under the curve = 0.939, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001) and between radiologically isolated syndrome and unspecific brain lesions (0.942, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001). Furthermore, microvesicles were independent predictors of prognosis for both the relapsing–remitting and progressive groups. Microvesicles independently predicted future disease activity in relapsing–remitting patients (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.967, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.147–3.372), correcting for prognostic factors of standard clinical use. In the progressive group, microvesicles were independent predictors of disability accrual (HR = 10.767, 95% CI = 1.335–86.812).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results confirm that CSF myeloid microvesicles are a clinically meaningful biomarker of neuroinflammation and microglial/macrophage activity in vivo. These findings may support a possible use in clinical practice during diagnostic workup and prognostic assessment. ANN NEUROL 2021;90:253–265</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study was undertaken to determine the dose–response relation between epileptiform activity burden and outcomes in acutely ill patients.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A single center retrospective analysis was made of 1,967 neurologic, medical, and surgical patients who underwent &gt;16 hours of continuous electroencephalography (EEG) between 2011 and 2017. We developed an artificial intelligence algorithm to annotate 11.02 terabytes of EEG and quantify epileptiform activity burden within 72 hours of recording. We evaluated burden (1) in the first 24 hours of recording, (2) in the 12-hours epoch with highest burden (peak burden), and (3) cumulatively through the first 72 hours of monitoring. Machine learning was applied to estimate the effect of epileptiform burden on outcome. Outcome measure was discharge modified Rankin Scale, dichotomized as good (0–4) versus poor (5–6).</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Peak epileptiform burden was independently associated with poor outcomes (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001). Other independent associations included age, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, seizure on presentation, and diagnosis of hypoxic–ischemic encephalopathy. Model calibration error was calculated across 3 strata based on the time interval between last EEG measurement (up to 72 hours of monitoring) and discharge: (1) &lt;5 days between last measurement and discharge, 0.0941 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.0706–0.1191); 5 to 10 days between last measurement and discharge, 0.0946 (95% CI = 0.0631–0.1290); &gt;10 days between last measurement and discharge, 0.0998 (95% CI = 0.0698–0.1335). After adjusting for covariates, increase in peak epileptiform activity burden from 0 to 100% increased the probability of poor outcome by 35%.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Automated measurement of peak epileptiform activity burden affords a convenient, consistent, and quantifiable target for future multicenter randomized trials investigating whether suppressing epileptiform activity improves outcomes. ANN NEUROL 2021;90:300–311</p>

                <p>Inflammasomes are multimeric protein complexes that can sense a plethora of microbe- and damage-associated molecular signals. They play important roles in innate immunity and are key regulators of inflammation in health and disease. Inflammasome-mediated processing and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL) 1β and IL-18 and induction of pyroptosis, a proinflammatory form of cell death, have been associated with the development and progression of common immune-mediated and degenerative central nervous system (CNS) diseases such as Alzheimer disease, multiple sclerosis, brain injury, stroke, epilepsy, Parkinson disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. A growing number of pharmacological compounds inhibiting inflammasome activation and signaling show therapeutic efficacy in preclinical models of the aforementioned disease conditions. Here, we illustrate regulatory mechanisms of inflammasome activation during CNS homeostasis and tissue injury. We highlight the evidence for inflammasome activation as a mechanistic underpinning in a wide range of CNS diseases and critically discuss the promise and potential limitations of therapeutic strategies that aim to inhibit the inflammasome components in neurological disorders.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Low-level somatic mosaicism in the brain has been shown to be a major genetic cause of intractable focal epilepsy. However, how a relatively few mutation-carrying neurons are able to induce epileptogenesis at the local network level remains poorly understood.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>To probe the origin of epileptogenesis, we measured the excitability of neurons with <i>MTOR</i> mutation and nearby nonmutated neurons recorded by whole-cell patch-clamp and array-based electrodes comparing the topographic distribution of mutation. Computational simulation is used to understand neural network-level changes based on electrophysiological properties. To examine the underlying mechanism, we measured inhibitory and excitatory synaptic inputs in mutated neurons and nearby neurons by electrophysiological and histological methods using the mouse model and postoperative human brain tissue for cortical dysplasia. To explain non–cell-autonomous hyperexcitability, an inhibitor of adenosine kinase was injected into mice to enhance adenosine signaling and to mitigate hyperactivity of nearby nonmutated neurons.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We generated mice with a low-level somatic mutation in <i>MTOR</i> presenting spontaneous seizures. The seizure-triggering hyperexcitability originated from nonmutated neurons near mutation-carrying neurons, which proved to be less excitable than nonmutated neurons. Interestingly, the net balance between excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs onto mutated neurons remained unchanged. Additionally, we found that inhibition of adenosine kinase, which affects adenosine metabolism and neuronal excitability, reduced the hyperexcitability of nonmutated neurons.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This study shows that neurons carrying somatic mutations in <i>MTOR</i> lead to focal epileptogenesis via non–cell-autonomous hyperexcitability of nearby nonmutated neurons. ANN NEUROL 2021;90:285–299</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Genome‐Wide Association Study Identifies Risk Loci for Cluster Headache</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study was undertaken to identify susceptibility loci for cluster headache and obtain insights into relevant disease pathways.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We carried out a genome-wide association study, where 852 UK and 591 Swedish cluster headache cases were compared with 5,614 and 1,134 controls, respectively. Following quality control and imputation, single variant association testing was conducted using a logistic mixed model for each cohort. The 2 cohorts were subsequently combined in a merged analysis. Downstream analyses, such as gene-set enrichment, functional variant annotation, prediction and pathway analyses, were performed.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Initial independent analysis identified 2 replicable cluster headache susceptibility loci on chromosome 2. A merged analysis identified an additional locus on chromosome 1 and confirmed a locus significant in the UK analysis on chromosome 6, which overlaps with a previously known migraine locus. The lead single nucleotide polymorphisms were rs113658130 (<i>p</i> = 1.92 × 10<sup>−17</sup>, odds ratio [OR] = 1.51, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.37–1.66) and rs4519530 (<i>p</i> = 6.98 × 10<sup>−17</sup>, OR = 1.47, 95% CI = 1.34–1.61) on chromosome 2, rs12121134 on chromosome 1 (<i>p</i> = 1.66 × 10<sup>−8</sup>, OR = 1.36, 95% CI = 1.22–1.52), and rs11153082 (<i>p</i> = 1.85 × 10<sup>−8</sup>, OR = 1.30, 95% CI = 1.19–1.42) on chromosome 6. Downstream analyses implicated immunological processes in the pathogenesis of cluster headache.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We identified and replicated several genome-wide significant associations supporting a genetic predisposition in cluster headache in a genome-wide association study involving 1,443 cases. Replication in larger independent cohorts combined with comprehensive phenotyping, in relation to, for example, treatment response and cluster headache subtypes, could provide unprecedented insights into genotype–phenotype correlations and the pathophysiological pathways underlying cluster headache.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Identifying common genetic variants that confer genetic risk for cluster headache.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We conducted a case–control study in the Dutch Leiden University Cluster headache neuro-Analysis program (LUCA) study population (n = 840) and unselected controls from the Netherlands Epidemiology of Obesity Study (NEO; n = 1,457). Replication was performed in a Norwegian sample of 144 cases from the Trondheim Cluster headache sample and 1,800 controls from the Nord-Trøndelag Health Survey (HUNT). Gene set and tissue enrichment analyses, blood cell-derived RNA-sequencing of genes around the risk loci and linkage disequilibrium score regression were part of the downstream analyses.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>An association was found with cluster headache for 4 independent loci (<i>r</i>
<sup>
   <i>2</i>
</sup> &lt; 0.1) with genomewide significance (<i>p</i> &lt; 5 × 10<sup>−8</sup>), rs11579212 (odds ratio [OR] = 1.51, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.33–1.72 near <i>RP11-815 M8.1</i>), rs6541998 (OR = 1.53, 95% CI = 1.37–1.74 near <i>MERTK</i>), rs10184573 (OR = 1.43, 95% CI = 1.26–1.61 near <i>AC093590.1</i>), and rs2499799 (OR = 0.62, 95% CI = 0.54–0.73 near <i>UFL1/FHL5</i>), collectively explaining 7.2% of the variance of cluster headache. SNPs rs11579212, rs10184573, and rs976357, as proxy SNP for rs2499799 (<i>r</i>
<sup>
   <i>2</i>
</sup> = 1.0), replicated in the Norwegian sample (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Gene-based mapping yielded <i>ASZ1</i> as possible fifth locus. RNA-sequencing indicated differential expression of <i>POLR1B</i> and <i>TMEM87B</i> in cluster headache patients.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This genomewide association study (GWAS) identified and replicated genetic risk loci for cluster headache with effect sizes larger than those typically seen in complex genetic disorders. ANN NEUROL 2021;90:203–216</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Pathogenic MAST3 Variants in the STK Domain Are Associated with Epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The MAST family of microtubule-associated serine–threonine kinases (STKs) have distinct expression patterns in the developing and mature human and mouse brain. To date, only <i>MAST1</i> has been conclusively associated with neurological disease, with de novo variants in individuals with a neurodevelopmental disorder, including a mega corpus callosum.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Using exome sequencing, we identify <i>MAST3</i> missense variants in individuals with epilepsy. We also assess the effect of these variants on the ability of MAST3 to phosphorylate the target gene product ARPP-16 in HEK293T cells.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identify de novo missense variants in the STK domain in 11 individuals, including 2 recurrent variants p.G510S (n = 5) and p.G515S (n = 3). All 11 individuals had developmental and epileptic encephalopathy, with 8 having normal development prior to seizure onset at &lt;2 years of age. All patients developed multiple seizure types, 9 of 11 patients had seizures triggered by fever and 9 of 11 patients had drug-resistant seizures. In vitro analysis of HEK293T cells transfected with <i>MAST3</i> cDNA carrying a subset of these patient-specific missense variants demonstrated variable but generally lower expression, with concomitant increased phosphorylation of the MAST3 target, ARPP-16, compared to wild-type. These findings suggest the patient-specific variants may confer MAST3 gain-of-function. Moreover, single-nuclei RNA sequencing and immunohistochemistry shows that <i>MAST3</i> expression is restricted to excitatory neurons in the cortex late in prenatal development and postnatally.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In summary, we describe <i>MAST3</i> as a novel epilepsy-associated gene with a potential gain-of-function pathogenic mechanism that may be primarily restricted to excitatory neurons in the cortex. ANN NEUROL 2021;90:274–284</p>

                <p>We here describe the identification of a novel variant in the anti-inflammatory Annexin A1 protein likely to be the cause of disease in two siblings with autosomal recessive parkinsonism. The disease-segregating variant was ascertained through a combination of homozygosity mapping and whole genome sequencing and was shown to impair phagocytosis in zebrafish mutant embryos. The highly conserved variant, absent in healthy individuals and public SNP databases, affected a functional domain of the protein with neuroprotective properties. This study supports the hypothesis that damaged microglia might lead to impairments in the clearance of accumulated and aggregated proteins resulting in parkinsonism.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Cognitive Functions in Adult‐Onset Phenotypes of X‐Linked Adrenoleukodystrophy</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by progressive demyelination ranging from mild myelopathic forms (adrenomyeloneuropathy [AMN]) to severe cerebral variants (adult cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy [ACALD]). The aim of this study was to compare cognitive function in adult-onset X-ALD phenotypes.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Cognitive function in various domains (intelligence, attention, memory, executive function, and processing speed) was assessed in 172 adults (117 with AMN, 30 with arrested ACALD, and 25 with acute ACALD) using comprehensive neuropsychological batteries. Phenotype differences were examined by analyses of variance.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>X-ALD phenotypes significantly differed in nonverbal intelligence, sustained attention, verbal encoding, nonverbal recognition, and processing speed (<i>ps</i> &lt; 0.050). No group differences emerged regarding verbal intelligence, verbal retrieval and recognition, and executive function (<i>ps</i> &gt; 0.050). Specifically, patients with acute ACALD showed severe cognitive deficits compared to AMN and normal data, with largest effects on processing speed. Contrary, cognition was overall intact in patients with AMN, independent of sex and corticospinal tract involvement, and those with arrested ACALD showed mild cognitive dysfunction, particularly in verbal encoding and processing speed.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Cerebral demyelination in patients with X-ALD causes white matter dementia, mainly characterized by an extreme slowdown in processing speed associated with deficits in attention and learning. Most patients with AMN show intact cognitive function. Future prospective, longitudinal studies with more sensitive imaging techniques are required to clarify whether early mild cognitive dysfunction found in some patients with AMN may be associated with subtle myelin abnormalities that do not yet appear as white matter lesions on cerebral MRI (cMRI) but have the potential to serve as early predictors of later cerebral progression.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Iron has been implicated in the pathogenesis of brain injury and hydrocephalus after preterm germinal matrix hemorrhage-intraventricular hemorrhage, however, it is unknown how external or endogenous intraventricular clearance of iron pathway proteins affect the outcome in this group.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This prospective multicenter cohort included patients with posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus (PHH) who underwent (1) temporary and permanent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diversion and (2) Bayley Scales of Infant Development-III testing around 2 years of age. CSF proteins in the iron handling pathway were analyzed longitudinally and compared to ventricle size and neurodevelopmental outcomes.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Thirty-seven patients met inclusion criteria with a median estimated gestational age at birth of 25 weeks; 65% were boys. Ventricular CSF levels of hemoglobin, iron, total bilirubin, and ferritin decreased between temporary and permanent CSF diversion with no change in CSF levels of ceruloplasmin, transferrin, haptoglobin, and hepcidin. There was an increase in CSF hemopexin during this interval. Larger ventricle size at permanent CSF diversion was associated with elevated CSF ferritin (<i>p</i> = 0.015) and decreased CSF hemopexin (<i>p</i> = 0.007). CSF levels of proteins at temporary CSF diversion were not associated with outcome, however, higher CSF transferrin at permanent CSF diversion was associated with improved cognitive outcome (<i>p</i> = 0.015). Importantly, longitudinal change in CSF iron pathway proteins, ferritin (decrease), and transferrin (increase) were associated with improved cognitive (<i>p</i> = 0.04) and motor (<i>p</i> = 0.03) scores and improved cognitive (<i>p</i> = 0.04), language (<i>p</i> = 0.035), and motor (<i>p</i> = 0.008) scores, respectively.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Longitudinal changes in CSF transferrin (increase) and ferritin (decrease) are associated with improved neurodevelopmental outcomes in neonatal PHH, with implications for understanding the pathogenesis of poor outcomes in PHH. ANN NEUROL 2021;90:217–226</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Guillain‐Barré Syndrome following ChAdOx1‐S/nCoV‐19 Vaccine</a></h4>

              
                <p>As of April 22, 2021, around 1.5 million individuals in three districts of Kerala, India had been vaccinated with COVID-19 vaccines. Over 80% of these individuals (1.2 million) received the ChAdOx1-S/nCoV-19 vaccine. In this population, during this period of 4 weeks (mid-March to mid-April 2021), we observed seven cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) that occurred within 2 weeks of the first dose of vaccination. All seven patients developed severe GBS. The frequency of GBS was 1.4- to 10-fold higher than that expected in this period for a population of this magnitude. In addition, the frequency of bilateral facial weakness, which typically occurs in &lt;20% of GBS cases, suggests a pattern associated with the vaccination. While the benefits of vaccination substantially outweigh the risk of this relatively rare outcome (5.8 per million), clinicians should be alert to this possible adverse event, as six out of seven patients progressed to areflexic quadriplegia and required mechanical ventilatory support.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Protein misfolding plays a central role not only in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), but also in other conditions, such as frontotemporal dementia (FTD), inclusion body myopathy (hIBM) or Paget's disease of bone. The concept of multisystem proteinopathies (MSP) was created to account for those rare families that segregate at least 2 out of these 4 conditions in the same pedigree. The calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding protein annexin A11 was recently associated to ALS in European pedigrees. Herein, we describe in detail 3 Brazilian families presenting hIBM (isolated or in combination with ALS/FTD) caused by the novel p.D40Y change in the gene encoding annexin A11 (<i>ANXA11</i>).</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We collected clinical, genetic, pathological and skeletal muscle imaging from 11 affected subjects. Neuroimaging was also obtained from 8 patients and 8 matched controls.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Clinico-radiological phenotype of this novel hIBM reveals a slowly progressive predominant limb-girdle syndrome, but with frequent axial (ptosis/dropped head) and distal (medial gastrocnemius) involvement as well. Muscle pathology identified numerous rimmed vacuoles with positive annexin A11, TDP-43 and p62 inclusions, but no inflammation. Central nervous system was also involved: two patients had FTD, but diffusion tensor imaging uncovered multiple areas of cerebral white matter damage in the whole group (including the corticospinal tracts and frontal subcortical regions).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These findings expand the phenotypic spectrum related to <i>ANXA11</i>. This gene should be considered the cause of a novel multisystem proteinopathy (MSP type 6), rather than just ALS. ANN NEUROL 2021;90:239–252</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Blood–Brain Barrier Breakdown in Relationship to Alzheimer and Vascular Disease</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Blood–brain barrier (BBB) breakdown has been suggested to be an early biomarker in human cognitive impairment. However, the relationship between BBB breakdown and brain pathology, most commonly Alzheimer disease (AD) and vascular disease, is still poorly understood. The present study measured human BBB function in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients on 2 molecular scales, specifically BBB's permeability to water and albumin molecules.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Fifty-five elderly participants were enrolled, including 33 MCI patients and 22 controls. BBB permeability to water was measured with a new magnetic resonance imaging technique, water extraction with phase contrast arterial spin tagging. BBB permeability to albumin was determined using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)/serum albumin ratio. Cognitive performance was assessed by domain-specific composite scores. AD pathology (including CSF Aβ and ptau) and vascular risk factors were examined.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Compared to cognitively normal subjects, BBB in MCI patients manifested an increased permeability to small molecules such as water but was no more permeable to large molecules such as albumin. BBB permeability to water was found to be related to AD markers of CSF Aβ and ptau. On the other hand, BBB permeability to albumin was found to be related to vascular risk factors, especially hypercholesterolemia, but was not related to AD pathology. BBB permeability to small molecules, but not to large molecules, was found to be predictive of cognitive function.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These findings provide early evidence that BBB breakdown is related to both AD and vascular risks, but their effects can be differentiated by spatial scales. BBB permeability to small molecules has a greater impact on cognitive performance. ANN NEUROL 2021;90:227–238</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A Keller-Segel model for C elegans L1 aggregation</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Leon Avery, Brian Ingalls, Catherine Dumur, Alexander Artyukhin</p>

We describe a mathematical model for the aggregation of starved first-stage <i>C elegans</i> larvae (L1s). We propose that starved L1s produce and respond chemotactically to two labile diffusible chemical signals, a short-range attractant and a longer range repellent. This model takes the mathematical form of three coupled partial differential equations, one that describes the movement of the worms and one for each of the chemical signals. Numerical solution of these equations produced a pattern of aggregates that resembled that of worm aggregates observed in experiments. We also describe the identification of a sensory receptor gene, <i>srh–2</i>, whose expression is induced under conditions that promote L1 aggregation. Worms whose <i>srh–2</i> gene has been knocked out form irregularly shaped aggregates. Our model suggests this phenotype may be explained by the mutant worms slowing their movement more quickly than the wild type.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Accurate influenza forecasts using type-specific incidence data for small geographic units</a></h4>

              
                <p>by James Turtle, Pete Riley, Michal Ben-Nun, Steven Riley</p>

Influenza incidence forecasting is used to facilitate better health system planning and could potentially be used to allow at-risk individuals to modify their behavior during a severe seasonal influenza epidemic or a novel respiratory pandemic. For example, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) runs an annual competition to forecast influenza-like illness (ILI) at the regional and national levels in the US, based on a standard discretized incidence scale. Here, we use a suite of forecasting models to analyze type-specific incidence at the smaller spatial scale of clusters of nearby counties. We used data from point-of-care (POC) diagnostic machines over three seasons, in 10 clusters, capturing: 57 counties; 1,061,891 total specimens; and 173,909 specimens positive for Influenza A. Total specimens were closely correlated with comparable CDC ILI data. Mechanistic models were substantially more accurate when forecasting influenza A positive POC data than total specimen POC data, especially at longer lead times. Also, models that fit subpopulations of the cluster (individual counties) separately were better able to forecast clusters than were models that directly fit to aggregated cluster data. Public health authorities may wish to consider developing forecasting pipelines for type-specific POC data in addition to ILI data. Simple mechanistic models will likely improve forecast accuracy when applied at small spatial scales to pathogen-specific data before being scaled to larger geographical units and broader syndromic data. Highly local forecasts may enable new public health messaging to encourage at-risk individuals to temporarily reduce their social mixing during seasonal peaks and guide public health intervention policy during potentially severe novel influenza pandemics.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Rational design of complex phenotype via network models</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Marcio Gameiro, Tomáš Gedeon, Shane Kepley, Konstantin Mischaikow</p>

We demonstrate a modeling and computational framework that allows for rapid screening of thousands of potential network designs for particular dynamic behavior. To illustrate this capability we consider the problem of hysteresis, a prerequisite for construction of robust bistable switches and hence a cornerstone for construction of more complex synthetic circuits. We evaluate and rank most three node networks according to their ability to robustly exhibit hysteresis where robustness is measured with respect to parameters over multiple dynamic phenotypes. Focusing on the highest ranked networks, we demonstrate how additional robustness and design constraints can be applied. We compare our results to more traditional methods based on specific parameterization of ordinary differential equation models and demonstrate a strong qualitative match at a small fraction of the computational cost.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Massive colonization of protein-coding exons by selfish genetic elements in Paramecium germline genomes</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Diamantis Sellis, Frédéric Guérin, Olivier Arnaiz, Walker Pett, Emmanuelle Lerat, Nicole Boggetto, Sascha Krenek, Thomas Berendonk, Arnaud Couloux, Jean-Marc Aury, Karine Labadie, Sophie Malinsky, Simran Bhullar, Eric Meyer, Linda Sperling, Laurent Duret, Sandra Duharcourt</p>

Ciliates are unicellular eukaryotes with both a germline genome and a somatic genome in the same cytoplasm. The somatic macronucleus (MAC), responsible for gene expression, is not sexually transmitted but develops from a copy of the germline micronucleus (MIC) at each sexual generation. In the MIC genome of <i>Paramecium tetraurelia</i>, genes are interrupted by tens of thousands of unique intervening sequences called internal eliminated sequences (IESs), which have to be precisely excised during the development of the new MAC to restore functional genes. To understand the evolutionary origin of this peculiar genomic architecture, we sequenced the MIC genomes of 9 <i>Paramecium</i> species (from approximately 100 Mb in <i>Paramecium aurelia</i> species to >1.5 Gb in <i>Paramecium caudatum</i>). We detected several waves of IES gains, both in ancestral and in more recent lineages. While the vast majority of IESs are single copy in present-day genomes, we identified several families of mobile IESs, including nonautonomous elements acquired via horizontal transfer, which generated tens to thousands of new copies. These observations provide the first direct evidence that transposable elements can account for the massive proliferation of IESs in <i>Paramecium</i>. The comparison of IESs of different evolutionary ages indicates that, over time, IESs shorten and diverge rapidly in sequence while they acquire features that allow them to be more efficiently excised. We nevertheless identified rare cases of IESs that are under strong purifying selection across the <i>aurelia</i> clade. The cases examined contain or overlap cellular genes that are inactivated by excision during development, suggesting conserved regulatory mechanisms. Similar to the evolution of introns in eukaryotes, the evolution of <i>Paramecium</i> IESs highlights the major role played by selfish genetic elements in shaping the complexity of genome architecture and gene expression.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">N6-methyladenosine promotes induction of ADAR1-mediated A-to-I RNA editing to suppress aberrant antiviral innate immune responses</a></h4>

Among over 150 distinct RNA modifications, <i>N</i><sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) and adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing represent 2 of the most studied modifications on mammalian mRNAs. Although both modifications occur on adenosine residues, knowledge on potential functional crosstalk between these 2 modifications is still limited. Here, we show that the m<sup>6</sup>A modification promotes expression levels of the ADAR1, which encodes an A-to-I RNA editing enzyme, in response to interferon (IFN) stimulation. We reveal that YTH <i>N</i><sup>6</sup>-methyladenosine RNA binding protein 1 (YTHDF1) mediates up-regulation of ADAR1; YTHDF1 is a reader protein that can preferentially bind m<sup>6</sup>A-modified transcripts and promote translation. Knockdown of YTHDF1 reduces the overall levels of IFN-induced A-to-I RNA editing, which consequently activates dsRNA-sensing pathway and increases expression of various IFN-stimulated genes. Physiologically, YTHDF1 deficiency inhibits virus replication in cells through regulating IFN responses. The A-to-I RNA editing activity of ADAR1 plays important roles in the YTHDF1-dependent IFN responses. Therefore, we uncover that m<sup>6</sup>A and YTHDF1 affect innate immune responses through modulating the ADAR1-mediated A-to-I RNA editing.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Educating the future generation of researchers: A cross-disciplinary survey of trends in analysis methods</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Taylor Bolt, Jason S. Nomi, Danilo Bzdok, Lucina Q. Uddin</p>

Methods for data analysis in the biomedical, life, and social (BLS) sciences are developing at a rapid pace. At the same time, there is increasing concern that education in quantitative methods is failing to adequately prepare students for contemporary research. These trends have led to calls for educational reform to undergraduate and graduate quantitative research method curricula. We argue that such reform should be based on data-driven insights into within- and cross-disciplinary use of analytic methods. Our survey of peer-reviewed literature analyzed approximately 1.3 million openly available research articles to monitor the cross-disciplinary mentions of analytic methods in the past decade. We applied data-driven text mining analyses to the “Methods” and “Results” sections of a large subset of this corpus to identify trends in analytic method mentions shared across disciplines, as well as those unique to each discipline. We found that the <i>t</i> test, analysis of variance (ANOVA), linear regression, chi-squared test, and other classical statistical methods have been and remain the most mentioned analytic methods in biomedical, life science, and social science research articles. However, mentions of these methods have declined as a percentage of the published literature between 2009 and 2020. On the other hand, multivariate statistical and machine learning approaches, such as artificial neural networks (ANNs), have seen a significant increase in the total share of scientific publications. We also found unique groupings of analytic methods associated with each BLS science discipline, such as the use of structural equation modeling (SEM) in psychology, survival models in oncology, and manifold learning in ecology. We discuss the implications of these findings for education in statistics and research methods, as well as within- and cross-disciplinary collaboration.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Insulin‐like growth factor 1 gene transfer for sporadic Alzheimer's disease: New evidence for trophic factor mediated hippocampal neuronal and synaptic recovery‐based behavior improvement</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Sporadic Alzheimer's disease (sAD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder with no cure. Patients typically suffer from cognitive impairment imprinted by irreversible neocortex and hippocampal degeneration with overt synaptic and neuron dysfunction. Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) has proven to be a potent neuroprotective molecule in animal models of age-related neurodegeneration. In this regard, adenoviral gene transfer aiming at IGF1 brain overexpression has been hitherto an underexplored approach for the sAD treatment. We postulated enhanced IGF1 signaling in the brain as a restorative means in the diseased brain to revert cognitive deficit and restore hippocampal function. We implemented recombinant adenovirus mediated intracerebroventricular IGF1 gene transfer on the streptozotocin (STZ) induced sAD rat model, using 3-month-old male Sprague Dawley rats. This approach enhanced IGF1 signaling in the hippocampus and dampened sAD phosphorylated Tau. We found a remarkable short-term improvement in species-typical behavior, recognition memory, spatial memory, and depressive-like behavior. Histological analysis revealed a significant recovery of immature hippocampal neurons. We additionally recorded an increase in hippocampal microglial cells, which we suggest to exert anti-inflammatory effects. Finally, we found decreased levels of pre- and postsynaptic proteins in the hippocampus of STZ animals. Interestingly, IGF1 gene transfer increased the levels of PSD95 and GAD65/67 synaptic markers, indicating that the treatment enhanced the synaptic plasticity. We conclude that exogenous activation of IGF1 signaling pathway, 1 week after intracerebroventricular STZ administration, protects hippocampal immature neurons, dampens phosphorylated Tau levels, improves synaptic function and therefore performs therapeutically on the sAD STZ model. Hence, this study provides strong evidence for the use of this trophic factor to treat AD and age-related neurodegeneration.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Postvaccinal encephalitis after ChAdOx1 nCov‐19</a></h4>

              
                <p>The global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has contributed to more than 163 million confirmed infections and 3.3 million deaths worldwide. The severity of the pandemic has led to an unprecedented effort to develop multiple effective vaccines. Due to excellent safety and efficacy data from clinical trials, several vaccines were approved.</p>
<p>We report a case series of postvaccinal encephalitis in temporal correlation to vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCov-19. The diagnostic criteria for possible autoimmune encephalitis were fulfilled. Our patients responded well to immunosuppressive therapy with corticosteroids. The incidence has been estimated to be approximately 8 per 10 million vaccine doses. Complication of postvaccinal encephalitis after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination still appear to be very rare, but need to be diagnosed and treated adequately. Large pooled data from observational epidemiologic studies are necessary to verify causality.</p>

<p>Murugappan et al., report that trigeminal neuropathy causes desynchronization and reduces neuronal communications in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)-basolateral amygdala neural circuitry, associated with hypomyelination and reduced myelinating cells. The hypomyelination and desynchronization in the ACC lead to poor decision-making in male rats.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Infraorbital nerve-chronic constriction injury (ION-CCI) has become the most popular chronic trigeminal neuropathic pain (TNP) injury animal model which causes prolonged mechanical allodynia. Accumulative evidence suggests that TNP interferes with cognitive functions, however the underlying mechanisms are not known. The aim of this study was to investigate decision-making performance as well as synaptic and large-scale neural synchronized alterations in the spinal trigeminal nucleus (SpV) circuitry and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) neural circuitry in male rats with TNP. Rat gambling task showed that ION-CCI led to decrease the proportion of good decision makers and increase the proportion of poor decision makers. Electrophysiological recordings showed long-lasting synaptic potentiation of local field potential in the trigeminal ganglia-SpV caudalis (SpVc) synapses in TNP rats. In this study, TNP led to disruption of ACC spike timing and basolateral amygdala (BLA) theta oscillation associated with suppressed synchronization of theta oscillation between the BLA and ACC, indicating reduced neuronal communications. Myelination is critical for information flow between brain regions, and myelin plasticity is an important feature for learning. Neural activity in the cortical regions impacts myelination by regulating oligodendrocyte (OL) proliferation, differentiation, and myelin formation. We characterized newly formed oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, and mature OLs are reduced in TNP and are associated with reduced myelin strength in the ACC region. The functional disturbances in the BLA-ACC neural circuitry is pathologically associated with the myelin defects in the ACC region which may be relevant causes for the deficits in decision-making in chronic TNP state.</p>
