">Causal Lesion Evidence for Two Motor Speech Coordination Networks in the Brain</a></h4>

              
                Speech production is supported by sensory-to-motor transformations to coordinate activity of the larynx and orofacial muscles. Here, we show that lesions to left temporal lobe areas involved in pitch processing cause reduced neural responses when repeating sentences and when humming piano melodies in a dorsal portion of the left precentral gyrus linked to laryngeal motor control. In contrast, lesions to left inferior parietal areas involved in somatosensory processing of speech cause reduced neural responses when repeating sentences but not when humming piano melodies in a ventral portion of the left precentral gyrus linked to orofacial motor control. Analyses in neurotypical participants converge in showing that the dorsal and ventral portions of the left precentral gyrus exhibit strong functional connectivity to left temporal and inferior parietal regions, respectively. These results provide causal lesion evidence that dissociable networks underlie distinct sensory-to-motor transformations supporting laryngeal and orofacial motor control for speech production.

">Convergent and divergent brain-cognition relationships during development revealed by cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses in the ABCD Study</a></h4>

              
                How brain networks and cognition co-evolve during development remains poorly understood. Using longitudinal data collected at baseline and Year 2 from 2,949 individuals (ages 8.9-13.5) in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study, we show that baseline resting-state functional connectivity (FC) more strongly predicts future cognitive ability than concurrent cognitive ability. Models trained on baseline FC to predict baseline cognition generalize better to Year 2 data, suggesting that brain-cognition relationships strengthen over time. Intriguingly, baseline FC outperforms longitudinal FC change in predicting future cognitive ability. Differences in measurement reliability do not fully explain this discrepancy: although FC change is less reliable (intraclass correlation, ICC = 0.24) than baseline FC (ICC = 0.56), matching baseline FC reliability by shortening scan time only partially narrows the predictive gap. Furthermore, neither baseline FC nor FC change meaningfully predicts longitudinal change in cognitive ability. We also identify converging and diverging predictive network features across cross-sectional and longitudinal models of brain-cognition relationships, revealing a multivariate twist on Simpsons paradox. Together, these findings suggest that during early adolescence, stable individual differences in brain functional network organization exert a stronger influence on future cognitive outcomes than short-term changes.

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/12/6/ENEURO.0124-25.2025?rss=1">An Automatic Domain-General Error Signal Is Shared across Tasks and Predicts Confidence in Different Sensory Modalities</a></h4>

              
                <p>Understanding the ability to self-evaluate decisions is an active area of research. This research has primarily focused on the neural correlates of self-evaluation during visual tasks and whether neural correlates before or after the primary decision contribute to self-reported confidence. This focus has been useful, yet the reliance on subjective confidence reports may confound our understanding of key everyday features of metacognitive self-evaluation: that decisions must be rapidly evaluated without explicit feedback and unfold in a multisensory world. These considerations led us to hypothesize that an automatic domain-general metacognitive signal may be shared between sensory modalities, which we tested in the present study with multivariate decoding of electroencephalographic (EEG) data. Participants (<I>N</I> = 21, 12 female) first performed a visual task with no request for self-evaluations of performance, prior to an auditory task that included rating decision confidence on each trial. A multivariate classifier trained to predict errors in the speeded visual task generalized to distinguish correct and error trials in the subsequent nonspeeded auditory discrimination. This generalization did not occur for classifiers trained on the visual stimulus-locked data and further predicted subjective confidence on the subsequent auditory task. This evidence of overlapping post-response neural activity provides evidence for automatic encoding of confidence independent of any explicit request for metacognitive reports and a shared basis for metacognitive evaluations across sensory modalities.</p>

                <p>Rod and cone photoreceptor cells selectively contact different compartments of axon-bearing retinal horizontal cells in the mammalian retina. Cones synapse exclusively on the soma whereas rods synapse exclusively on a large axon terminal compartment. The possibility that rod signals can travel down the axon from terminal to soma has been proposed as a means of producing spectrally opponent interactions between rods and cones, but there is conflicting data about whether this actually occurs. The spectral overlap between rods and cones in mouse makes it difficult to stimulate rod and cone pigments separately. We therefore used optogenetic techniques to analyze photoreceptor inputs into horizontal somas by selectively expressing channelrhodopsin in rods and/or cones. Optogenetic stimulation of rods and cones both evoked large fast inward currents in horizontal cell somas. Cone-driven responses were abolished by eliminating synaptic release in a cone-specific knock-out of the exocytotic calcium sensor, synaptotagmin 1 (Syt1). However, rod-driven responses in horizontal somas were unchanged after eliminating synaptic release from rods but abolished by eliminating release from both rods and cones. This suggests that release from cones is required for transmission of rod signals to horizontal cell somas. Rods and cones are coupled by Cx36 gap junctions, and we found that selective elimination of Cx36 from rods also abolished rod-driven optogenetic responses in horizontal cell somas. Together, these results show that rod signals reach the somas of B-type horizontal cells exclusively via gap junctions with cones and not by transmission down the axon from the axon terminal.</p>

                <p>Perceptual localization of brief, high-contrast perisaccadic visual probes is grossly erroneous. While this phenomenon has been extensively studied in humans, more needs to be learned about its underlying neural mechanisms. This ideally requires running similar behavioral paradigms in animals. However, during neurophysiology, neurons encountered in the relevant sensory and sensory&ndash;motor brain areas for visual mislocalization can have arbitrary, noncardinal response field locations. This necessitates using mislocalization paradigms that can work with any saccade direction. Here, we first established such a paradigm in three male rhesus macaque monkeys. In every trial, the monkeys generated a saccade toward an eccentric target. Once a saccade onset was detected, we presented a brief flash at one of three possible locations ahead of the saccade target location. After an experimentally imposed delay, we removed the saccade target, and the monkeys were then required to generate a memory-guided saccade toward the remembered flash location. All three monkeys readily learned the task, and, like humans, they all showed strong backward mislocalization toward the saccade target, which recovered for later flashes from the saccade time. Importantly, we then replicated a known property of human perisaccadic mislocalization, as revealed by two-dimensional mislocalization paradigms: that mislocalization is the strongest for upward saccades. For horizontal saccades, we additionally found stronger mislocalization for upper visual field flashes, again consistent with humans. Our results establish a robust two-dimensional mislocalization paradigm in monkeys, and they pave the way for exploring the neural mechanisms underlying the dependence of perisaccadic mislocalization strength on saccade direction.</p>

                <p>by Wiep Stikvoort, Eider Pérez-Ordoyo, Iván Mindlin, Anira Escrichs, Jacobo D. Sitt, Morten L. Kringelbach, Gustavo Deco, Yonatan Sanz Perl</p>

Assessing someone’s level of consciousness is a complex matter, and attempts have been made to aid clinicians in these assessments through metrics based on neuroimaging data. Many studies have empirically investigated measures related to the complexity elicited after the brain is stimulated to quantify the level of consciousness across different states. Here we hypothesized that the level of non-equilibrium dynamics of the unperturbed brain already contains the information needed to know how the system will react to an external stimulus. We created personalized whole-brain models fitted to resting state fMRI data recorded in participants in altered states of consciousness (e.g., deep sleep, disorders of consciousness) to infer the effective connections underlying their brain dynamics. We then measured the out-of-equilibrium nature of the unperturbed brain by evaluating the level of asymmetry of the inferred connectivity, the time irreversibility in each model and compared this with the elicited complexity generated after <i>in silico</i> perturbations, using a simulated fMRI-based version of the Perturbational Complexity Index, a measure that has been shown to distinguish different levels of consciousness in <i>in vivo</i> settings. Crucially, we found that states of consciousness involving lower arousal and/or lower awareness had a lower level of asymmetry in their effective connectivities, a lower level of irreversibility in their simulated dynamics, and a lower complexity compared to control subjects. We show that the asymmetry in the underlying connections drives the nonequilibrium state of the system and in turn the differences in complexity as a response to the external stimuli.

                <p>by Kevin J. Flynn, Andrew Yu. Morozov</p>

Many organisms, notably phototrophs, routinely acquire resources over only a fraction of the day. They have to balance their main period of initial biosynthesis against cell cycle events. Because of their short generation times, this challenge is especially acute for the planktonic microalgae that perform 50% of global C-fixation. Empirical evidence indicates that microalgal day-average growth is a function of the ability to acquire resources rapidly when available, retaining initial products of assimilation to support growth. A fundamental question arises over the optimal physiological configuration to support such activity. Here, we applied computer simulations implementing a development of the quota concept, in which the internal limiting resource is itself C, ratioed against total organism C-biomass. The model comprises metabolite and core pools of carbon C (<sup>M</sup><i>C</i> and <sup>C</sup><i>C</i>, respectively), with growth modulated by <sup>M</sup><i>C</i>/(<sup>M</sup><i>C</i><sup> </sup>+ <sup>C</sup><i>C</i>); <sup>M</sup><i>C</i> supports growth of <sup>C</sup><i>C</i> in the absence of concurrent resource acquisition. Dynamic feedback interactions from the relative size of <sup>M</sup>C controls resource acquisition. The model reproduces the general pattern of growth at different light:day fraction (<i>LD</i>), and of afternoon-depression of C-fixation. We explored the efficiency of the physiological cell configuration to locate optimal configurations at different combinations of maximum growth rates (<i>U</i><sub>max</sub>) and <i>LD</i> values across plausible parameter values for microalgae. While the optimum maximum resource acquisition rate deployed during the L phase scales with <i>U</i><sub>max</sub>/<i>LD</i>, the maximum size of the metabolite pool scales to <i>LD</i>/<i>DV</i>, where <i>DV</i> is division time (i.e. <i>U</i><sub>max</sub>/Ln(2)). Accordingly, we conclude that faster growing organisms carry a penalty limiting their geographic spread to latitudes and seasons where <i>LD</i> is high. Larger, vacuolated organisms (such as diatoms), having a bigger metabolite compartment, may be at an advantage in such situations.

                <p>by Swathi Anil, Dan F. M. Goodman, Marcus Ghosh</p>

Animals continuously combine information across sensory modalities and time, and use these combined signals to guide their behaviour. Picture a predator watching their prey sprint and screech through a field. To date, a range of multisensory algorithms have been proposed to model this process including linear and nonlinear fusion, which combine the inputs from multiple sensory channels via either a sum or nonlinear function. However, many multisensory algorithms treat successive observations independently, and so cannot leverage the temporal structure inherent to naturalistic stimuli. To investigate this, we introduce a novel multisensory task in which we provide the same number of task-relevant signals per trial but vary how this information is presented: from many short bursts to a few long sequences. We demonstrate that multisensory algorithms that treat different time steps as independent, perform sub-optimally on this task. However, simply augmenting these algorithms to integrate across sensory channels and short temporal windows allows them to perform surprisingly well, and comparably to fully recurrent neural networks. Overall, our work: highlights the benefits of fusing multisensory information across channels and time, shows that small increases in circuit/model complexity can lead to significant gains in performance, and provides a novel multisensory task for testing the relevance of this in biological systems.

                This paper introduces the concept of fuzzy filters and 2-fuzzy filters of a quasi-ordered residuated system K . This research explores comparative, normal, implicative and associative fuzzy filters within a quasi-ordered residuated system. It establishes the sufficient conditions under which a comparative fuzzy filter in K qualifies as a normal fuzzy filter and vice-versa. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that the collection of all comparative fuzzy filters in K constitutes a complete lattice. The notion of fuzzy filters of a pseudo quasi-ordered residuated system is introduced and the analysis extends to fantastic, comparative, associative and implicative fuzzy filters within a pseudo quasi-ordered residuated framework. Finally, it is proven that an associative fuzzy filter in K inherently satisfies the criteria for both implicative and comparative fuzzy filters.

                Background Ovarian cancer management has not yet given a satisfactory result, and the recurrence rate is still high. One of the reasons for this is resistance to chemotherapy. Melatonin and cisplatin may be involved in the chemotherapy resistance of ovarian cancer. Methods A laboratory experiment was performed using melatonin and cisplatin in the SKOV3 cell, from September 2020 to November 2021 at the SCTE and Integrated Laboratory & Research Center Universitas Indonesia. Several variables were used, such as doxorubicin, melatonin, cisplatin, and combination of cisplatin and melatonin at several concentrations (1×, 3/4×, 1/2×, and 1/4×). A total of 24 samples were included and divided into 8 groups. The IC50 values of melatonin, doxorubicin, and cisplatin as well as cell viability was calculated via MTS assay. Subsequently, flow cytometry was performed to assess the effect of cisplatin and melatonin on the mechanisms of CTR1, p-glycoprotein, GSH, ERCC1, e-cadherin, and apoptosis. Analysis of variance and Bonferroni test were employed for the study. Results The IC50 values of melatonin, cisplatin, and doxorubicin were 1.841 mM, 117.5 mM, and 14.72 mM, respectively. The combination groups of cisplatin and melatonin reduced cell viability; decreased the CTR1 mean (19.73), Pgp (6.7), GSH (11.73), and ERCC1 (4.27) in the combination 1 (C1) group; and increased e-cadherin (32.2) and annexin V (53.57) also in the combination 1 (C1) group. Conclusions The combination of melatonin and cisplatin might have an impact on drug resistance via several mechanisms in ovarian cancer.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-165/v2?src=rss">Engaging Sustainable Reforestation and Forest Protection in the Wallacea Line, Indonesia [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                The Wallacea region of Indonesia has high biodiversity and highly unique and endangered species. Its terrestrial ecosystems have unique flora and fauna found nowhere else. Nevertheless, the strategy for protecting and conserving the Wallacea ecosystem is like that in other parts of Indonesia, since it refers to the national forest and environmental regulations. The uniqueness of the Wallacea ecosystem does not reflect the extraordinary efforts of protecting and conserving the region’s pristine ecosystem. The continuing decline of the forestland and expansions of agricultural lands have indicated the need for a more fundamental and integrative approach to conserving and protecting the Wallacea ecosystem, particularly forestlands. We use the actor-centered power (ACP) approach or ideas and use the Wallacea Line to highlight how this idea is contested and confronted with the dynamics of complex societies and ecosystems. The ACP approach is the most widely used one in the implementation of the community forest (CF) program in Indonesia. The CF program is one of Indonesia’s community-based forest management schemes that empowers local communities to manage state forests sustainably. We chose two national parks established in the Wallacea region, Mutis on Timor Island and Matalawa on Sumba Island, to elaborate further on the development, conservation, and changes that occurred within that landscape. The ACP approach, in line with the spirit of the decentralization era, has mixed consequences for forest management and the biodiversity of the Wallacea region. Regarding the specific characteristics of the Wallacea region and lessons learned from the ACP approach implementation in the CF program, we then propose a sustainable model of reforestation and forest protection that applies the principle of “unity in diversity,” where all actors involved have space for the growth of creativity and positive contributions to sustainable forest protection.

                Background Vitamin D may play an important role in later-life physical and cognitive health. Vitamin D status is standardly assessed in serum and plasma; however, collection, transport, and storage costs make large epidemiologic studies challenging. We assessed the agreement of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25(OH)D3) quantification from dried blood spots (DBS) as compared to standard plasma assessment among older Indian adults. Methods A total of 58 adults over 45 years of age who resided in Pune, India were enrolled in the study from July 2020 to June 2021. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was used to assess 25(OH)D3 concentrations in paired plasma and DBS samples. Results Plasma and DBS 25(OH)D3 concentrations were highly correlated (Pearson’s correlation = 0.976). The median 25(OH)D3 concentration of the study population assessed by plasma was 14.6 ng/mL (Q1=12.0, Q3= 18.1) while the median concentration assessed in DBS was 12.8 ng/mL (Q1=11.0, Q3= 16.6). 25(OH)D3 concentrations measured from DBS were on average 6% (95% CI: 2-13%) lower than concentrations assessed by plasma across the observed 25(OH)D3 distribution. Conclusions We found good agreement between 25(OH)D3 quantification between DBS and plasma and our findings indicate that DBS can be used in epidemiologic studies of vitamin D among Indian adults.

                Introduction Surgical site infections (SSIs) occur in 1.3% to 4% of paediatric appendectomies. It is the most common complication after an appendectomy. Surgical complications in paediatric patients increase patient susceptibility to opportunistic infections, falls and drug-related side effects The aim of this study was to identify the modifiable risk factors for SSIs after paediatric appendectomies. Methodology Paediatric patients who underwent appendectomies from April 2018 to April 2023 in a tertiary care teaching hospital in coastal Karnataka were included. Clinical characteristics of patients were collected from the medical records of the patients. Results A total of 459 paediatric patients underwent appendectomies between 2018 and 2023. 45 (9.8%) developed surgical site infections (SSIs). Chi-squared tests (or Fisher’s exact tests, where appropriate) revealed significant associations (p < 0.05) between SSIs and the following categorical variables: faecal incontinence, surgical technique, wound type, type of appendicitis, postoperative stay and use of invasive devices. Multivariate logistic regression analysis further identified laparotomy (OR = 4.39, 95% CI: 1.31–14.74), presence of invasive devices (OR = 104.4, 95% CI: 5.45–2002.93), longer consultation-to-surgery time (OR = 1.48, 95% CI: 1.17–1.88), and increased surgery duration (OR = 1.02 per minute, 95% CI: 1.01–1.04) as independent risk factors significantly associated with the development of SSIs. Discussion The study identified laparotomy, use of drains, delayed surgery, and longer operation time as key risk factors for SSIs after paediatric appendectomies. Despite standard precautions, high SSI rates were observed, likely due to modifiable surgical factors and antimicrobial resistance. The findings highlight the need for optimized surgical practices, timely intervention, and multidisciplinary strategies to reduce SSI rates and improve patient outcomes.

[version</a></h4>

              
                Background Treatment-resistant chronic migraine patients constitute a heavily burdened patient population with need for novel treatment options. The sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG), located deep within the facial structures, is a synaptic junction in the trigemino-autonomic reflex that is hypothesised to play a part in migraine pathophysiology. A 2017 open-label pilot study explored the SPG as a target for onabotulinumtoxinA injections in chronic migraine using a navigation-guided injection device, demonstrating a favourable safety profile and promising response on migraine related efficacy outcomes. Methods MiBlock is a multi-centre, investigator-initiated, publicly funded, randomised, quadruple-blinded and placebo-controlled trial. Participation is voluntary and all participants must sign a written consent prior to inclusion. The study is approved by the Norwegian ethics committee and the Norwegian Medical Product Agency. Patients with treatment-resistant chronic migraine will be recruited from four Norwegian university hospitals until 170 have received study treatment. The study will investigate the efficacy of a single-session, bilateral, navigation-guided, percutaneous injection of either onabotulinumtoxinA (verum) or 0.9% NaCl (placebo) towards the SPG under local anaesthesia. The primary efficacy endpoint is the change from baseline in the frequency of moderate and severe headache days at weeks 5-8 post-injection. The primary efficacy outcome variable is collected prospectively through daily headache eDiary entries during the entire study participation. The treatment effect will be assessed by comparing the placebo and the treatment arm according to a prespecified statistical analysis plan. Discussion This trial addresses a novel treatment strategy in headache prevention. The study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of onabotulinumtoxinA injection towards the SPG in chronic migraine, but results may shed light on the feasibility of navigation-guided SPG injections in several headache disorders. Results will be published in international open-access peer-reviewed journals. Trial registration number EudraCT number: 2018-004053-24. ClinicalTrial ref: NCT04069897.

                Introduction phlebitis is one of the complications associated with the placement of peripheral intravascular lines in neonates and serves as an indicator of the quality of care provided by health professionals. Determining its incidence and predictors provides valuable evidence for stakeholders to address this issue and the potential factors contributing to phlebitis. Objective This study aims to determine the incidence and predictors of phlebitis among neonates with perinatal asphyxia admitted at the neonatal intensive care unit of West Amhara Comprehensive Specialized Hospital, Northwest Ethiopia, 2023. Method A multicentered, institution-based prospective follow-up study was conducted from May 1 to August 30, 2024, at the Northwest Amhara Region Comprehensive Specialized Hospital in Northwest Ethiopia. A systematic random sampling technique was employed, and data were collected using a data extraction checklist from the medical registry of neonates. The collected data were entered into EPI-DATA V.4.6.0.0 and analyzed using STATA V.14. The Kaplan-Meier failure curve and log-rank test were utilized, and both bivariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses were performed to identify predictors of phlebitis. Statistical significance was defined as p ≤ 0.05. Result The overall incidence of phlebitis was 20.9 per 1,000 neonate-day observations (95% CI: 17.12-25.54) during the entire follow-up period. Of the 423 neonates admitted to the NICU, 96 (22.69%) (95% CI: 18.93-26.94) developed phlebitis. Significant predictors included birth asphyxia (AHR= 2.1; 95% CI: 1.38-3.19), trials of cannulation (AHR=2.5; 95% CI: 1.01-6.36), macrosomic neonates (AHR=3.05; 95% CI: 1.17-7.96), flushed cannulas (AHR=0.54; 95% CI: 0.31-0.97), and short dwelling time (AHR=0.47; 95% CI: 0.29-0.765). Conculsion The incidence rate of phlebitis was higher than that reported in other studies. Predictors of phlebitis included birth asphyxia, the number of cannulation trials, macrosomic neonates, flushed cannulas, and shorter dwelling times.

                Introduction Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) is a serious concern for preterm infants and can predispose such infants to brain injury and poor neurodevelopmental outcomes. Aim The present study aimed to determine the frequency of IVH and its risk factors in the premature newborns admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) at King Fahd University Hospital. Methodology This cross-sectional study involved 201 preterm neonates admitted at King Fahd University Hospital, Khobar, Saudi Arabia over a period of 7 years (from 2016 to 2023). These neonates were diagnosed by cranial ultrasound. IVH was classified into four grades based on Papile classification. The frequency of IVH was compared across various attributing factors i.e., gestational age at delivery, gender, birth weight, mode of delivery, and maternal antenatal steroids. Results Two hundred and one patients were analyzed (male 50.7% vs. female 49.3%). 51.2% had a gestational age of 29 weeks or less. More than half (54.2%) had a birth weight of ≤1200g. The incidence of IVH in a 7-year duration was 41.8%, with stage 1 (41.7%) and stage 2 (34.5%) being the most common IVH stages. Multivariate regression analysis revealed that CHD, seizure, and ROP were identified as the significant independent predictors of IVH among preterm infants. Conclusion IVH in premature infants remains a complex and delicate issue in neonatology. An integrated approach covering both prevention and treatment is essential to minimize the negative impact of this complication on the neurological development of premature infants.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-561/v1?src=rss">Income Inequality, Governance Quality, and Political Engagement: A Cross-country Analysis of Disparities and Democratic Participation [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Income gaps threaten democratic vitality, yet the evidence is mixed on whether economic inequality inevitably suppresses citizens’ political voices. We argue that institutional integrity—particularly the capacity to curb corruption—conditions how inequality translates into civic disengagement. By embedding governance quality in the inequality-participation debate, this study addresses a significant omission in comparative political-economy scholarship and offers policy-relevant insights. Methods We compile a balanced panel of ten democracies—Australia, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States, Brazil, India, Indonesia, Mexico, and South Africa—for 2002-2022. Voice and Accountability (Worldwide Governance Indicators) are the outcome variable; predictors include the lagged Gini Index, extreme poverty headcount, GDP-per-capita growth, and five governance metrics. Country- and year-fixed-effects regressions with cluster-robust errors are estimated. Diagnostic tests (Pesaran LM, IPS, Westerlund, VIF) guide specification and interaction terms to assess whether strong corruption control moderates inequality’s impact in developed versus developing subsamples. Results Corruption control is the strongest positive predictor of democratic voice, while inequality and poverty are insignificant in isolation. Interaction models reveal pronounced asymmetries. In developed economies, the deleterious effect of inequality is neutralised—and sometimes reversed—when corruption is tightly controlled (β = +0.028, p < 0.01). In developing economies, inequality remains benign until corruption escalates, at which point higher Gini scores significantly erode Voice and Accountability (β = -0.020, p ≈ 0.07). Corrected models confirm a modest universal adverse effect of inequality once institutional dynamics are constant. Conclusions Inequality is not destiny; its democratic toll depends on whether institutions can control corruption. Policy agendas that redistribute income will underperform if they neglect governance reforms. Combating graft, professionalising public administration, and expanding digital feedback channels can shield civic participation even in unequal societies. Conversely, failing to fortify institutions leaves democracies—especially developing ones—vulnerable to a corrosive feedback loop of widening gaps and falling political voices.

                Demenego et al. show that inborn errors of immunity (IEI) directly impact neurodevelopment independently of immune dysfunction. In WHIM syndrome, CXCR4 hyperactivation disrupts cerebellar assembly and behavior via cell-intrinsic mechanisms. Early brain-targeted CXCR4 antagonist rescues both structural and psychomotor defects. The study redefines the neurodevelopmental origins of IEI-associated symptoms.

                Memories do not reflect the continuous nature of experience—they represent distinct events. How does the brain know when one memory should end and the next should begin? Clewett et al. show that during meaningful changes, increased arousal and locus coeruleus activation trigger the formation of separate episodic memories.

                Sustained androgen receptor (AR) inhibition is a clinical challenge due to multiple AR reactivation mechanisms. Hence, delineating the signaling pathways downstream of AR that promote cancer progression may nominate novel, alternative therapeutic targets. Lin et al. identify CAMKI-CREB-mediated cholesterol metabolism as an alternative, AMPK-independent, and druggable pathway mediating AR-CAMKK2-driven CRPC.

                Chou et al. demonstrate that CEP164 recruits TTBK2 to centriole distal appendages through phase separation driven by electrostatic interactions between their intrinsically disordered regions. This multivalent interaction forms dynamic condensates, facilitating efficient TTBK2 recruitment and initiating ciliogenesis, highlighting the critical role of phase separation in cilia formation.

                Burgmer et al. show that the pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) PGRP-LC and PGRP-LE repress key metabolic functions in the Drosophila midgut. These regulations occur independently of canonical immune pathways and restrict parasitic Wolbachia endosymbionts in the intestine and peripheral tissues. Thus, PRRs act beyond canonical immune pathways to control bacteria.

              <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(25)00573-X?rss=yes">RNA m6A dynamics promote transcription and RNA stability of bivalent genes during iPSC-induced generation of human lung progenitors</a></h4>

              
                Dong et al. show that stage-specific m6A dynamics direct human iPSC differentiation into lung progenitors. The upregulation of RBM15B induces m6A hypermethylation in differentiated stages, while the switch between m6A readers YTHDC1 and IGF2BP2 coordinates chromatin remodeling and mRNA stability control of bivalent genes critical for lung endoderm specification.

                In this study, Kraska et al. identify MYB68 as a novel regulator of endodermal suberization, linked to the formation of distinct identities in the xylem-pole-associated endodermis. The research uncovers new insights into the patterning of the endodermis with suberin and highlights genes encoding K-transport proteins associated with endodermal passage cells.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100376">A general mechanism for initiating the bacterial general stress response</a></h4>

              
                The General Stress Response promotes survival of bacteria in adverse conditions, but how sensor proteins transduce species-specific signals to initiate the response is not known. The serine/threonine phosphatase RsbU initiates the General Stress Response in <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> upon binding a partner protein (RsbT) that is released from sequestration by environmental stresses. We report that RsbT activates RsbU by inducing otherwise flexible linkers of RsbU to form a short coiled-coil that dimerizes and activates the phosphatase domains. Importantly, we present evidence that related coiled-coil linkers and phosphatase dimers transduce signals from diverse sensor domains to control the General Stress Response and other signaling across bacterial phyla. This coiled-coil linker transduction mechanism additionally suggests a resolution to the mystery of how shared sensory domains control serine/threonine phosphatases, diguanylate cyclases and histidine kinases. We propose that this provides bacteria with a modularly exchangeable toolkit for the evolution of diverse signaling pathways.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96675">Clearance of protein aggregates during cell division</a></h4>

              
                Protein aggregates are spatially organized and regulated in cells to prevent the deleterious effects of proteostatic stress. Misfolding of proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) results in aggregate formation, but how the aggregates are processed, especially during cell division is not well understood. Here, we induced proteostatic stress and protein aggregation using a proteostasis reporter, which is prone to misfolding and aggregation in the ER. Unexpectedly, we detected solid-like protein aggregates deposited mainly in the nucleus and surrounded by the ER membrane. The membrane-bound aggregates were then cleared as cells progressed through mitosis and cytokinesis. Aggregate clearance depended on Hsp70 family chaperones in the ER, particularly BiP, and proteasomal activity. The clearance culminated at mitotic exit and required cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) inactivation but was independent of the anaphase-promoting complex (APC/C). The ER reorganization that is active during mitosis and cytokinesis was required for the aggregate clearance. Thus, dividing cells reorganize the ER networks to allow BiP to clear the protein aggregates to maintain proteostasis in the newly divided cells.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100292">Different roles of D1/D2 medium spiny neurons in the nucleus accumbens in pair bond formation of male mandarin voles</a></h4>

              
                The mesolimbic dopamine (DA) system has been implicated in pair bond formation. However, the involvements of DA release, real-time activities, and electrophysiological activities of D1/D2 medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell in pair bonding remain unclear. This work verified that male mandarin voles after pair bonding released higher levels of DA in the NAc shell and displayed higher levels of D1 MSNs activity and lower levels of D2 MSNs activity upon sniffing their partners compared to upon sniffing an unknown female. Moreover, pair bonding induced differential alterations in both synaptic plasticity and neuronal intrinsic excitability in both D1 MSNs and D2 MSNs. In addition, chemogenetic inhibition of ventral pallidum (VP) -projecting D2 MSNs in the NAc shell enhanced pair bond formation, while chemogenetic activation of VP-projecting D2 MSNs in the NAc shell inhibited pair bond formation. These findings suggest that different neuronal activity of NAc shell D1 MSNs / D2 MSNs regulated by increasing DA release after pair bonding may be a neurobiological mechanism underlying pair bond formation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104074">Upstream open reading frames buffer translational variability during Drosophila evolution and development</a></h4>

              
                Protein abundance tends to be more evolutionarily conserved than mRNA levels both within and between species, yet the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain largely unknown. Upstream open reading frames (uORFs) are widespread <i>cis</i>-regulatory elements in eukaryotic genomes that regulate translation, but it remains unclear whether and how uORFs contribute to stabilizing protein levels. In this study, we performed ribosome translation simulations on mRNA to quantitatively assess the extent to which uORF translation influences the translational variability of downstream coding sequences (CDSs) across varying contexts. Our simulations revealed that uORF translation dampens CDS translational variability, with buffering capacity increasing in proportion to uORF translation efficiency, length, and number. We then compared the translatomes at different developmental stages of two <i>Drosophila</i> species, demonstrating that uORFs buffer mRNA translation fluctuations during both evolution and development. Experimentally, deleting a uORF in the <i>bicoid</i> (<i>bcd</i>) gene—a prominent example of translational buffering—resulted in extensive changes in gene expression and phenotypes in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. Additionally, we observed uORF-mediated buffering between primates and within human populations. Together, our results reveal a novel regulatory mechanism by which uORFs stabilize gene translation during development and across evolutionary time.

">NEUROLINGUA: A Neuroimaging Database Tailored to Unravel the Complexity of Multilingual Comprehension</a></h4>

              
                The neural mechanisms underlying language processing involve a well-defined brain network, including mainly left perisylvian areas. Yet, the extent of its individual variability remains largely unexplored, particularly in bilingual and multilingual contexts. Differences in linguistic profiles (e.g., age of acquisition, exposure, proficiency) provide an opportunity to assess how network topology adapts to sociolinguistic factors. To address this, we developed NEUROLINGUA, a comprehensive database of functional and structural MRI data, enriched with sociodemographic, sociolinguistic, and behavioral information. It includes 725 healthy individuals aged 18-82 immersed in a Basque-Spanish multilingual environment, ranging from near-monolinguals to highly proficient multilinguals. Participants completed a functional MRI language localizer with both auditory and visual comprehension tasks, enabling cross-modal comparisons. Additionally, this localizer included sentences involving arithmetic problem-solving. Exploratory analyses confirmed associations between structural MRI, sociodemographic, and cognitive measures. Functional MRI validated NEUROLINGUA's capacity to localize the language comprehension network and capture linguistic profile effects. This integrative dataset offers an unparalleled resource to investigate the factors influencing language network adaptability and variability in diverse sociolinguistic contexts.

">Multidimensional components of impulsivity during early adolescence: Relationships with brain networks and future substance-use in the Adolescent Brian and Cognitive Development (ABCD) study</a></h4>

              
                Impulsivity is a multifaceted construct that typically increases during adolescence and is implicated in risk for substance use disorders that develop later in life. Here, we take a multivariate approach to identify latent dimensions of impulsivity, broadly defined, among youth enrolled in the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) study and explore associations with individual differences in demographics, substance-use initiation and canonical resting state networks (N=11,872, ages ~9-10). Using principal component analysis, we identified eight latent impulsivity dimensions, the top three of which together accounted for the majority of the variance across all impulsivity assessments. The first principal component (PC1) was a general impulsivity factor that mapped onto all impulsivity-related assessments. PC2 mapped onto a 'mixed' impulsivity style related to both poorer, less attentive performance on the SST and decreased delay discounting. PC3 linked externalizing behaviors across multiple measures with indices of delay discounting, making delay discounting the only impulsivity-related assessment to load on all three of the top PCs. Multiple impulsivity PCs were significantly associated with subsequent initiation of alcohol and cannabis use. Finally, we found both cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between the PCs and functional connectivity between and within frontoparietal, cingulo-opercular, and default mode networks. These data provide a critical empirical baseline for how facets of impulsivity covary in early adolescence which may be tracked through future waves of ABCD data, enabling longitudinal elucidation of how dimensions of impulsivity interact with other individual and environmental factors to influence risk for substance use later in life.

">Central nervous system atlas of larval zebrafish constructed using the morphology of single excitatory and inhibitory neurons</a></h4>

              
                Comprehensive single-neuron mapping is essential for understanding the brain connectome. However, focusing only on mapping the projections of neurons from a single brain region gives limited insight into the global organizational principles of brain connectivity. Here, we present a whole body-wide Common Physical Space (CPSv1.0) for larval zebrafish, integrating neuroanatomical parcellations, cytoarchitecture atlases of excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) neurons, and a dendrite-axon-annotated projectome comprising 12,219 E and 7,792 I neuronal morphologies (~25% of total E and I neurons). These neurons span all regions of the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral ganglia, forming 531 hierarchical morphotypes and generating weighted and directed inter-cell-type and inter-region connectomes. Projection and network analyses reveal structural divergence between E and I neurons, combinatory and modular projection rules, behavior-linked pathways, structured E and I connectivities, and multimodal sensorimotor hubs. Hosted on an open interactive platform, these digital atlases establish a scalable framework for multimodal neural data integration, offering insights into the global neural architecture across the whole central nervous system.

">Gene therapies alleviate absence epilepsy associated with Scn2a deficiency in DBA/2J mice</a></h4>

              
                Mutations in the voltage-gated sodium channel gene SCN2A, which encodes the NaV1.2 channel, cause severe epileptic seizures. Patients with SCN2A loss-of-function (LoF) mutations, such as protein-truncating mutations, often experience later-onset and drug-resistant epilepsy, highlighting an urgent unmet clinical need for new therapies. We previously developed a gene-trap Scn2a (Scn2agt/gt) mouse model with a global NaV1.2 reduction in the widely used C57BL/6N (B6) strain. Although these mice display multiple behavioral abnormalities, EEG recordings indicated only mild epileptiform discharges, possibly attributable to the seizure-resistant characteristics associated with the B6 strain. To enhance the epileptic phenotype, we derived congenic Scn2agt/gt mice in the seizure-susceptible DBA/2J (D2J) strain. Notably, we found that these mice exhibit prominent spontaneous absence seizures, marked by both short and long spike-wave discharges (SWDs). Restoring NaV1.2 expression in adult mice substantially reduced their SWDs, suggesting the possibility of SCN2A gene replacement therapy during adulthood. RNA sequencing revealed significant alterations in gene expression in the Scn2agt/gt mice, in particular a broad downregulation of voltage-gated potassium channel (KV) genes, including KV1.1. The reduction of KV1.1 expression was further validated in human cerebral organoids with SCN2A deficiency, highlighting KV1.1 as a promising therapeutic target for refractory seizures associated with SCN2A dysfunction. Importantly, delivery of exogenous human KV1.1 expression via adeno-associated virus (AAV) in D2J Scn2agt/gt mice substantially reduced absence seizures. Together, these findings underscore the influence of mouse strain on seizure severity and highlight the potential of targeted gene therapies for treating SCN2A deficiency-related epilepsies.

">Intermingled representation of oral cavity in mouse trigeminal ganglion</a></h4>

              
                Somatotopy serves as a fundamental principle underlying sensory information processing, traditionally emphasized in the study of the cerebral cortex. However, little effort has been directed towards unraveling the spatial organization characterizing the earlier stages of somatosensory pathways. In this study, we developed a novel methodology to visualize individual neurons within the trigeminal ganglion, a crucial cluster of cell bodies of sensory neurons innervating the face. Our investigations revealed a reliable sensory response to stimulation of the lower incisor or lip within this ganglion. The responsive neurons were confined to a specific portion of the trigeminal ganglion, consistent with innervation of the lower oral cavity by the mandibular nerve (V3). Contrary to our expectations, we did not observe a discernible map differentiating the lower tooth and the lip. Instead, the spatial representation of the tooth and lip within this portion of trigeminal ganglion exhibited intermingling with no clear border between tooth-responding and lip-responding neurons. These findings contrast with earlier studies that identified tooth and lip responding regions in the somatosensory cortex. Our study sheds light on the complex spatial organization of sensory processing in the trigeminal system, highlighting the need for further research to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and implications for sensory perception and clinical interventions.

">Implantable CMOS Deep-Brain Fluorescence Imager with Single-Neuron Resolution</a></h4>

              
                Despite the advantages of optical imaging over electrophysiology, such as cell-type specificity, its application has been limited to the investigation of shallow brain regions (< 2 mm) because of the light scattering property of brain tissue. Passive optical conduits such as graded-index lenses and waveguides have permitted access to deeper locales but with restricted resolution and field of view, while creating massive lesions along the inserted path, with little pathway to improvement in the technology. As an alternative, we present the Acus device, an active implantable complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) neural imager with a 512-pixel silicon image sensor post-processed into a 4.1-mm-long, 120-m-wide shank with a collinear fiber for illumination, which is able to record transient fluorescent signals in deep brain regions at 400 frames/sec. Acus can achieve single-neuron resolution in functional imaging of GCaMP6s-expressing neurons at a frame rate of 400 frames/sec.

">High-dimensional neuronal activity from low-dimensional latent dynamics: a solvable model</a></h4>

              
                Computation in recurrent networks of neurons has been hypothesized to occur at the level of low-dimensional latent dynamics, both in artificial systems and in the brain. This hypothesis seems at odds with evidence from large-scale neuronal recordings in mice showing that neuronal population activity is high-dimensional. To demonstrate that low-dimensional latent dynamics and high-dimensional activity can be two sides of the same coin, we present an analytically solvable recurrent neural network (RNN) model whose dynamics can be exactly reduced to a low-dimensional dynamical system, but generates an activity manifold that has a high linear embedding dimension. This raises the question: Do low-dimensional latents explain the high-dimensional activity observed in mouse visual cortex? Spectral theory tells us that the covariance eigenspectrum alone does not allow us to recover the dimensionality of the latents, which can be low or high, when neurons are nonlinear. To address this indeterminacy, we develop Neural Cross-Encoder (NCE), an interpretable, nonlinear latent variable modeling method for neuronal recordings, and find that high-dimensional neuronal responses to drifting gratings and spontaneous activity in visual cortex can be reduced to low-dimensional latents, while the responses to natural images cannot. We conclude that the high-dimensional activity measured in certain conditions, such as in the absence of a stimulus, is explained by low-dimensional latents that are nonlinearly processed by individual neurons.

">PP2A METHYLESTERASE, PME-1, AND PP2A METHYLTRANSFERASE, LCMT-1, CONTROL SENSITIVITY TO IMPAIRMENTS CAUSED BY INJURY-RELATED OLIGOMERIC TAU</a></h4>

              
                Oligomeric species of tau are a hallmark of multiple neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). Given the evidence implicating protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) in the molecular pathogenesis of tau-related neurodegenerative disorders, we sought to determine whether manipulating the expression of enzymes that regulate PP2A activity, such as leucine carboxyl methyltransferase 1 (LCMT-1) and protein methyl esterase 1 (PME-1), might impact pathological responses to oligomeric tau. Here, we tested the effect of transgenic overexpression of LCMT-1 or PME-1 on cognitive and electrophysiological impairments caused by exposure to either recombinant oligomeric human tau or oligomeric tau prepared from mice subjected to blast-induced traumatic brain injury. We found that overexpression of LCMT-1 reduced sensitivity to tau-induced impairments, while overexpression of PME-1 increased sensitivity to these impairments. Moreover, we found that shockwave exposure increased the propensity of endogenous tau to form toxic oligomers. These results suggest that manipulating LCMT-1 or PME-1 activity may represent novel therapeutic approaches for disorders involving exposure to pathogenic forms of oligomeric tau.

">RNA-seq reveals transcriptomic differences in circadian-related genes of the choroid plexus in a preclinical chronic migraine model.</a></h4>

              
                Background: Migraine patients show choroid plexus (CP) changes, impairing the blood-CSF barrier. The CP regulates circadian rhythms, but links between CP circadian genes and migraine are unexplored. Objective: This study examined CP circadian gene transcriptome changes in a chronic migraine rat model versus controls to identify migraine-related pathways. Design: Chronic migraine model: Sprague Dawley rats (3 females, 3 males) received nitroglycerine (NTG) every other day for 9 days; controls (3 females, 3 males) got saline. CP from the 4th ventricle was collected 2 hours post-final injection for RNAseq. Methods: Migraine Behavior: Von Frey hair tests on days 1, 5, and 9, pre- and 2 hours post-NTG/saline injection, assessed basal and NTG-induced pain thresholds. RNAseq & Analysis: Differentially expressed genes (p < 0.05, fold change > 1) were identified. GO, KEGG, and Reactome enrichment analyses evaluated circadian gene expression changes. Results: NTG group showed reduced basal and NTG-induced pain thresholds on days 1, 5, and 9. Females had more upregulated genes (MT2A, SLC7A11), males upregulated ZBTB16, S100A8. SLC7A11, SCG2, GRIA1 showed inverse regulation (up in females, down in males). Circadian gene expression altered: 10 genes upregulated (e.g., SERPINE1, MAPK9, ATF4), 13 downregulated (e.g., PER2, DBP, EZH2). Sex-specific differences: females (FBXL12, GPR157), males (NKX2-1, ATF4, CLOCK). GO/KEGG analyses revealed significant enrichment of circadian rhythm-related pathways, insulin resistance, and inflammatory response processes, with sex-specific differences: females showed HIF-1 signaling and hemoglobin-related pathways, while males exhibited arachidonic acid and leukotriene production. Conclusion: CP transcriptomics in the rat migraine model revealed sex-specific gene regulation, with females upregulating antioxidant genes (MT2A, SLC7A11) and males upregulating inflammatory factors (ZBTB16, S100A8), alongside circadian disruption (e.g., SERPINE1 upregulated, PER2 downregulated). Pathway analyses indicate enriched circadian rhythms, HIF-1 signaling (females), inflammatory processes (males), lipid metabolism (PPAR), and heme signaling, highlighting sex-specific and circadian targets for migraine therapy.

">The representation of emotion knowledge in hippocampal-prefrontal systems</a></h4>

              
                Emotional experiences involve more than bodily reactions and momentary feelings - they depend on knowledge about the world that spans contexts and time. Although it is well established that individuals conceptualize emotions using a low-dimensional space organized by valence and arousal, the neural mechanisms giving rise to this configuration remain unclear. Here, we examine whether hippocampal-prefrontal circuits - regions implicated in forming cognitive maps - also support the abstraction of emotional experiences. Using functional MRI data collected as participants viewed emotionally evocative film clips, we found that activity in hippocampal and prefrontal cortex predicted self-reported emotion across schematically distinct videos, consistent with a role in structural learning. Computational modeling of emotion transitions revealed that hippocampal responses to films and emotion self-reports could be predicted based on the statistical regularities of emotion transitions across different temporal scales. These findings demonstrate that hippocampal-prefrontal systems represent emotion concepts at multiple levels of abstraction, offering new insight into how the brain organizes emotion knowledge.

">Effects of binge-like ethanol drinking on nest building behavior in mice</a></h4>

              
                Nest building is a natural behavior that can readily be analyzed in mice in the home cage environment. Nest building is involved in thermoregulation, positive motivational states, and motor function, and has been proposed as an index for ethanol withdrawal severity in mice. However, nest building outcomes after voluntary ethanol consumption have not been examined. Here, we tested male and female C57BL/6J mice on a 4-day drinking in the dark (DID) paradigm of binge-like drinking with either ethanol or a water control and analyzed nest scores at two time points (48 hours and 7 days) after the last DID session. At 48 hours after the last DID session, there were no differences between the two groups in nest quality. At 7 days after DID, ethanol-drinking animals showed significantly lower nest scores than the water group. No differences were found between the ethanol- and water-drinking groups in locomotor activity or anxiety-like behavior at this timepoint, indicating that nest building deficits in the ethanol group were likely not due to underlying differences in these behaviors. Together, these results validate the use of nest building as a naturalistic assessment of withdrawal-associated behavioral changes following voluntary binge-like ethanol consumption.

">Neuronal or vascular receptive fields? On the relation between BOLD-fMRI population receptive field (pRF) estimates and cortical vascularization.</a></h4>

              
                This study investigates the contribution of different vascular compartments on population receptive field (pRF) size estimates within the early visual cortex (V1, V2, and V3) using BOLD-fMRI. We employed T2*-weighted gradient-echo (GE) and T2-weighted spin-echo (SE) sequences at 7 Tesla (7T) and a multi-band GE sequence at 3T to explore how different vessel sensitivities across these sequences influence pRF modeling. Our results confirm the expected pRF size increase across eccentricity and visual areas but found no significant differences in pRF size estimates across MR sequences, voxel sizes, or field strengths. BOLD signal amplitudes were influenced by MR sequence, with the largest signal changes observed for 7TGE, and amplitude increases were noted across cortical depth for GE sequences but not for SE sequences. Contrary to our hypotheses, pRF size estimates were not noticeably affected by the local vascularization, suggesting that pRFs primarily reflect neuronal activity rather than vascular compartment characteristics. Our study highlights the robust nature of pRF size estimates across various fMRI conditions and points toward the decoupling of pRF properties from vascular factors.

">Early neuronal reprogramming and cell cycle reentry shape Alzheimer's disease progression</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by hallmark pathologies, synaptic dysfunction, neuronal loss, gliosis and cognitive decline-dementia. Recent large-scale cell atlases of human AD brains exposed vulnerability of specific neuronal subtypes and highlighted early, coordinated glial responses, suggesting glial involvement in disease progression. However, the timing and nature of neuronal changes, differences between neuronal subtypes, and their coordination with glia remain unclear. Here, we used non-negative matrix factorization to identify co-expression gene programs in single-nucleus RNA profiles from the prefrontal cortex of 437 samples from donors whose clinical symptoms ranged between no cognitive impairment and AD dementia. This approach identified early coordinated transcriptional changes across all neuronal subtypes, preceding clinical symptoms of cognitive decline, and validated in independent snRNA-seq, proteomics, and ELISA datasets. We found neurons in AD undergo rapid modulation of synaptic genes, accompanied by convergence of neurons into two distinct programs: An oxidative stress and apoptosis program abundant in vulnerable neuronal subtypes, and a DNA damage and cell-cycle reentry program associated with resilient subtypes. Moreover, neuronal reprogramming was closely tied to glial responses, and diverged between AD to non-AD brain aging, suggesting neuro-glial coordinated reprogramming shapes the AD cascade and influences disease outcomes.

">A discontinuity in motion perception during fixational drift</a></h4>

              
                The human visual system is tasked with perceiving stable and moving objects despite ever-present eye movements. Normally, our visual system performs this task exceptionally well; indeed, under conditions with frames of reference, our ability to detect relative motion exceeds the sampling limits of foveal cones. However, during fixational drift, if an image is programmed to move in a direction consistent with retinal slip, little to no motion is perceived, even if this motion is amplified. We asked: Would a stimulus moving in a direction consistent with retinal slip, but with a smaller magnitude across the retina, also appear relatively stable? We used an adaptive optics scanning light ophthalmoscope to deliver stimuli that moved contingent to retinal motion and measured subjects' perceived motion, under conditions with world-fixed background content. We also tested under conditions with background content closer and farther from the stimuli. We found a sharp discontinuity in motion perception. Stimuli moving in a direction consistent with retinal slip, no matter how small, appear to have relatively little to no motion; while, stimuli moving in the same direction as eye motion appear to be moving. Displacing background content to greater than 4 degrees from the stimuli diminishes the effects of this phenomenon.

">Pupil size correlates with near-threshold detection performance irrespective of stimulus colour, eccentricity, or retinal adaptation-state</a></h4>

              
                In near-threshold detection tasks, larger pre-stimulus pupil size is associated with improved accuracy. However, previous studies have used black and white peripherally presented stimuli, leaving open the question of whether the relationship persists when targets differ in their colour or eccentricity. Across three experiments (in years 2022-2024), we tested a total of 124 participants while systematically varying the lighting conditions and target properties in a near-threshold detection task. Light conditions ranged from dark to dim to bright, with the dark condition including a period of dark-adaptation. Possible target colours were blue and red on a black background (dark condition), blue and red on a grey background (dim condition), or yellow and cyan on a white background (bright condition). Possible target eccentricities ranged from parafoveal to peripheral, in a continuous manner (experiment 3) or as two predefined near and far eccentricities (experiments 1 & 2). Across all experiments we show that larger pre-stimulus pupil size is associated with improved performance. This large-pupil advantage is not modulated by the colour or eccentricity of the targets, the illumination of the testing room, or retinal adaptation-state. We conclude that the phenomenon is robust, indicating that pupil size affects vision in a behaviourally relevant manner, regardless of the exact conditions.

                Preventing retinal ganglion cells (RGCs)'s soma and axon degeneration and promoting optic nerve (ON) regeneration holds great promise for effective glaucoma treatment. To explore potential neural repair strategies, we focused on glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), a key regulator of lipid peroxidation. GPX4 is upregulated in surviving RGCs after acute ON crush or chronic ocular hypertension insult, and also in regenerating RGCs. AAV-mediated RGC-specific overexpression of GPX4 promotes significant ON regeneration and RGC survival, along with visual functional preservation, demonstrating the detrimental role of lipid peroxidation in glaucoma and the therapeutic potential of modulating lipid peroxidation through GPX4 in optic neuropathies.

">The spatial coding of touch is defined in intrinsic, limb-specific coordinates: an EEG study</a></h4>

              
                The brain localizes touch in space by integrating tactile and proprioceptive signals, a process known as tactile remapping. While it is often assumed that the remapped touch is encoded in an extrinsic, limb-independent reference frame, an alternative view proposes that touch may instead be represented within an intrinsic, limb-specific coordinate system. To test these hypotheses, we used electroencephalography (EEG) and a novel tactile stimulation paradigm in which participants received touch on their hands positioned at various locations relative to the body. Previous findings suggest that neural activity in primate sensorimotor and parietal regions monotonically encodes limb position. We therefore analyzed amplitude gradients in somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) to test predictions from each coding scheme. If touch is coded extrinsically, neural gradients should reflect changes of the external stimulus location, regardless of the limb. If coded intrinsically, gradients should be tied to the position of each limb and mirror each other between hands. Both univariate and multivariate EEG analyses found no evidence for extrinsic coding. Instead, we observed neural signatures of limb-specific, intrinsic spatial codes, the earliest emerging about 160 ms after touch in centro-parietal regions, later shifting to fronto-temporal and parieto-occipital areas. Furthermore, a population-based neural network model of tactile remapping successfully reproduced the observed gradient patterns. These results show that the human brain localizes touch using an intrinsic, limb-specific spatial code, challenging the dominant assumption of extrinsic encoding in tactile remapping.

">Telomere-driven senescence accelerates tau pathology, neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in a tauopathy mouse model</a></h4>

              
                Background: Although the connection between aging and neurodegenerative pathologies like Alzheimer's disease (AD) has long been recognized, the underlying pathological mechanisms remain largely unknown. Senescent brain cells build up in the brains of AD patients and a causal link has been established between senescence and AD-related tauopathy. Methods: To investigate the role of cellular senescence in tau-mediated neuropathology, we crossed the Terc knockout (Terc-/-) senescent mouse model with the P301S tauopathy model (PS19 line). Using brain sections and protein extracts, we employed Western blot and immunostaining analyses to investigate the expression of tau-related neuropathological features within a senescent context. Results: We found that the brains of 6- and 9-month-old Terc-/- mice exhibit significant telomere attrition and signs of cellular senescence. Introducing a senescent phenotype in a tauopathy mouse model resulted in increased tau phosphorylation at key residues, particularly in the hippocampus. Over time, this was associated with enhanced tau truncation and aggregation. These pathological changes were accompanied by exacerbated astrocyte and microglial activation, as well as selective neuronal loss in vulnerable brain regions. Conclusions: Overall, our findings place senescence as a key upstream regulator of tau pathology, suggesting that targeting senescent cells and their detrimental effects may offer promising therapeutic strategies for AD and other related tauopathies.

">Heterogeneity in human brain clearance adds resilience against tauopathy -- a computational model informed by glymphatic MRI</a></h4>

              
                Neurotoxic protein fragments such as amyloid-beta and tau accumulate in characteristic staging patterns in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The brain clears such metabolic substances via multiple different systems, including via the glymphatic (extracellular/extravascular) pathway. Here, we ask how the distinct features that characterize human glymphatic function would affect the prion-like cascade of protein invasion associated with AD. To address this question, we extract and analyze individual clearance rates from human glymphatic MRI (gMRI) data sets. These clearance rates define subject-specific maps of glymphatic clearance that vary both across cortical lobes and Braak staging regions. We apply these clearance maps as initial states in a computational network model linking misfolded proteins, tissue damage, and local clearance to simulate a series of individual proteinopathy trajectories. Our results show that the spatial heterogeneity in initial clearance induces characteristic propagation patterns, delaying and redirecting the disease progression. Moreover, reducing this spatial heterogeneity accelerates disease progression and induces staging patterns typically associated with AD. A comparison between well-rested subjects and subjects who underwent a single night of sleep deprivation did not reveal differences in initial clearance maps nor in simulated disease progression. These findings suggest that spatial heterogeneity in brain clearance may be a key factor for neurodegenerative resilience.

">Extracting Reproducible Components from Electroencephalographic Responses to Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation with Group Task-Related Component Analysis</a></h4>

              
                Transcranial magnetic stimulation combined with electroencephalography (TMS-EEG) is a powerful technique for investigating human cortical circuits. However, characterizing TMS-evoked potentials (TEPs) at the group level typically relies on grand averaging across stimulus repetitions (trials) and subjects - an approach that assumes a level of spatial and temporal consistency that is often lacking in TEPs. Here, we introduce an adaptation of Group Task-Related Component Analysis (gTRCA), a novel multivariate signal decomposition method, to automatically extract TEP components that are maximally reproducible across both trials and subjects. Following the validation of a new permutation-based statistical test for gTRCA using simulated data, the method was applied to two independent TMS-EEG datasets, in which stimulation was targeted to the primary motor cortex (M1) in cohorts of 16 and 22 healthy participants. We found that gTRCA reliably identified TEP components that were reproducible at the group level. Notably, the main gTRCA component captured the key spatial, temporal, and spectral features of motor TEPs, remained robust despite reduced number of stimuli and participants, and was consistent across different recordings. These findings demonstrate that gTRCA affords a more reliable characterization of TEPs at the group level, thereby facilitating the translation of TMS-EEG research into clinical practice.

">The Neurofibrillary Tangle Maturity Scale: A Novel Framework for Tangle Pathology Evaluation in Alzheimer's Disease</a></h4>

              
                Neurofibrillary tangles are dynamic neuropathologic hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease with a hypothesized lifespan morphologically-defined by three maturity levels: pretangles, mature tangles, and ghost tangles. To better understand the progression of tangle pathophysiology, we characterized tangle maturity level predilection of 15 tau antibodies recognizing a broad range of linear, phosphorylation, conformational, and truncation epitopes in the hippocampus of 24 postmortem brains. We developed the tangle maturity scoring system to semi-quantitatively evaluate each tangle maturity level. Based on proportions of tangle maturity levels, we classified antibodies as "early" (mostly pretangles and mature tangles), "middling" (mature tangles with pretangles and ghost tangles), and "advanced" (mostly ghost tangles and mature tangles) tangle maturity markers. To summarize tangle maturity predilection, we developed the tangle maturity scale to integrate individual tangle maturity scores. Correlations showed stronger relationships between tangle maturity scale and subsector thickness for more advanced tangle maturity markers in CA1 and subiculum, whereas Braak tangle stage remained consistently correlated throughout markers of the tangle lifespan. To aid in scoring hippocampi, we used machine learning to recognize tangle maturity levels, which performed comparably to a domain expert and showed similar relationships by Spearman correlation. Pattern recognition software was used to assess tangle and neuritic tau burden separately, which generally correlated with Braak stage and neuronal counts. However, tangle-derived tau burden more consistently correlated with hippocampal subsector thickness. In conclusion, we developed manual and automated scoring systems to evaluate tangle maturity levels, demonstrating early 4R, phosphorylated, and oligomeric tau accumulation preceding more advanced 3R and truncated tau. Our study provides supportive evidence of disease-relevant ordering of tau posttranslational modifications in the brain, which may have implications for theragnostic development. These findings underscore the promise of computerized quantitative analyses (i.e., pathomics) for high-throughput feature extraction from whole-slide images to enhance our understanding of microscopically observed morphologic changes.

This study examined how material elasticity and stochastic surface roughness jointly shape perceived roughness using a Bayesian optimization discrimination procedure. We employed two stimulus sets (high/low elasticity), each varying in both elasticity and stochastic surface roughness, under two interaction conditions (direct/indirect touch). Our results indicate that variations in surface roughness and material elasticity can produce perceptual roughness confounds, or metamers, wherein distinct cue configurations elicit indistinguishable roughness percepts. These metamers emerged across both direct and indirect touch, underscoring the role of contact-induced vibrations that depend on the relative stiffness of the stimulus and probe. Confidence ratings similarly reflected the influence of both stimulus parameters. The findings highlight the multidimensional nature of roughness perception, shaped by an integration of material and surface properties.

">bstinence and Extinction Drive Opposing Changes in Striatal Activity and Dopamine Signaling During Alcohol Relapse</a></h4>

              
                Relapse remains a major obstacle in the treatment of alcohol use disorder, often driven in part by enduring neuroadaptations. However, how different treatment strategies, such as abstinence versus extinction training, modulate the underlying neural circuits and synaptic mechanisms that shape relapse vulnerability remains poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrate that abstinence and extinction distinctly influence dorsomedial striatal (DMS) direct-pathway medium spiny neuron (dMSN) activity and dopamine signaling during cue-induced reinstatement of alcohol seeking. Using in vivo fiber photometry in D1-Cre rats expressing calcium or dopamine sensors, we found that abstinence enhanced dMSN calcium responses and dopamine release during reinstatement, whereas extinction normalized these neural signals and suppressed relapse-like behavior. Furthermore, bidirectional optogenetic modulation of medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)-to-dMSN synapses revealed a causal role for corticostriatal plasticity in determining relapse propensity. Inducing long-term depression (LTD) in the abstinent state attenuated reinstatement, while inducing long-term potentiation (LTP) after extinction training reinstated alcohol seeking. Together, these findings identify distinct neural adaptations shaped by abstinence versus extinction and highlight corticostriatal plasticity as a potential target for relapse prevention.

">Temporally-segregated dual functions for Gfi1 in the development of retinal direction-selectivity</a></h4>

              
                There is great diversity in retinal ganglion cells subtypes in the mouse retina, but little is known about the molecular factors required to generate this subtype diversity. Here, we identify the transcription factor Gfi1 as a conserved driver of differentiation specifically in two downward-tuned direction selective ganglion cells (DSGCs). Further, we describe a post-differentiation role for Gfi1 in regulating dendritic development of Down ON-type DSGCs crucial for their ability to detect downward motion. These results define novel temporally-segregated dual functions for Gfi1 in the development of retinal direction-selective circuits, and they provide a framework for understanding fundamental mechanisms underlying direction-selectivity in the retina.

">PQBP1-dependent alternative RNA splicing underlies high calorie diet-induced cognitive impairment</a></h4>

              
                High calorie-high fat diet (HFD) has been implicated as a pathological modifier of brain diseases including neurodegenerative dementias, but the detailed molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here we report that HFD suppresses PPAR{gamma}-mediated transcriptional expression of PQBP1, a RNA splicing factor implicated in human intellectual disability and Alzheimer's disease. RNAseq-based comprehensive analyses of alternative RNA splicing (AS) in HFD-fed mice for 1 or 6 weeks and in PQBP1-cKO mice reveal their common changes, which weigh on synapse-related genes. Betweenness-based extraction of core molecules from the common changes reveals CASK, Cacnb1 and Cyfip2 as key molecules of the network. Both CASK and Cacnb1 regulate STXBP1, a causative gene for infantile epilepsy syndrome and an essential factor for synapse vesicle release, via their direct interaction. In addition, our analysis suggests that Syt1 plays a role specifically in HFD for 1 week. HFD-induced AS isoforms of CASK, Cacnb1, Cyfip2 and Syt1 impair pre-synapse vesicle release in primary neurons. AAV-PQBP1, AAV-CASK, AAV-Cacnb1, AAV-Cyfip2 or AAV-Syt1 rescues synapse and/or cognitive dysfunctions in HFD mice, genetically supporting the pathological PQBP1-presynase axis in HFD. Moreover, immunohistochemistry experiments suggest that the pathological axis plays roles not only in excitatory neurons, but also in inhibitory neurons of the brain. Collectively, our results unravel a novel molecular mechanism for brain dysfunction when mice are exposed to a HFD.

">Interindividual variations in peak alpha frequency do not predict the magnitude or extent of secondary hyperalgesia induced by high-frequency stimulation</a></h4>

              
                Background Previous studies have shown an association between interindividual variations in the frequency of alpha-band EEG oscillations such as estimates of peak alpha frequency (PAF) and pain sensitivity. Whether differences in PAF also influence the susceptibility to develop central sensitization (CS) is unknown. Objective This study aimed to determine if the PAF of vision- and sensorimotor-related alpha-band activity is associated with the magnitude and extent of secondary mechanical hyperalgesia induced by high-frequency stimulation (HFS) of the skin, a surrogate marker of CS. Methods The EEG was recorded in 32 healthy participants at rest during eyes open and eyes closed conditions, and during bilateral finger movements. Two methods were used to isolate vision- and sensorimotor-related alpha-band activity based on sensitivity to eye closure and movement: one based on an independent component analysis, the other on spectral subtraction. PAF was assessed using a center-of-gravity approach or the Fitting Oscillations and One-Over-F (FOOOF) method, accounting for the aperiodic EEG component. HFS was applied to the right forearm, and pinprick sensitivity was assessed at both forearms, before and 40 minutes after HFS. Results Neither sensorimotor- nor vision-related PAF were significantly correlated with the magnitude or extent of HFS-induced secondary hyperalgesia. Interestingly, at the non-sensitized forearm, participants with a higher vision-related PAF exhibited greater habituation to pinprick stimuli, suggesting that variations in PAF may relate to variations in sensory habituation. Conclusion Interindividual variations of PAF were not significantly associated with the susceptibility to develop HFS-induced secondary hyperalgesia.

">ezscore-f: A Set of Freely Available, Validated Sleep Stage Classifiers for Forehead EEG</a></h4>

              
                The increasing availability of wearable forehead EEG devices, such as the Hypnodyne ZMax, open-source DCM, CGX PatchEEG, and many others, has significantly expanded opportunities for convenient, at-home sleep monitoring. However, most publicly available sleep classifiers are trained on scalp EEG from traditional polysomnography (PSG) data, and thus generalize poorly to forehead EEG due to differences in electrode placement, referencing montages, and higher susceptibility to artifacts from user movements and electrode displacement. Conventional classifiers typically do not explicitly account for these artifacts, resulting in inaccurate and misleading sleep stage scoring. To address this gap, we developed a suite of artifact-aware sleep stage classifiers trained specifically using forehead EEG data, leveraging two comprehensive datasets --Wearanize+ and Donders2022-- that contain concurrent forehead EEG and clinical PSG recordings. We further introduce two classifier variants: one optimized for real-time applications that operates directly on raw EEG amplitudes, and another optimized for offline analysis utilizing normalized EEG signals. Validation results indicate robust and reliable classification performance across standard sleep stages (Wake, N1, N2, N3, REM), along with effective identification of artifact epochs. Importantly, the developed classifiers generalize well to forehead EEG devices beyond the original training platform. These validated classifiers are freely available to the sleep research community through the open-source ezscore-f package, providing versatile and practical tools for forehead EEG-based sleep stage analysis.

We tested whether treatment with the GluN2C/D positive allosteric modulator CIQ and non-competitive antagonist DQP-1105 from days in vitro (DIV) 5–10 and DIV 15–20 modulates neurite growth in organotypic cultures. Calcium imaging confirmed a functional expression of GluN2D in nonpyramidal neurons. DQP treatment enhanced apical dendritic branching and increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation and spine density, suggesting a disinhibitory effect mirrored by a reduced expression of GAD-65, VGAT, and Syt-2. Control basket cells had larger axon-carrying dendrites (AcDs), and under CIQ, the AcDs grew even larger. The axons of CIQ-treated basket cells formed more branches within the dendritic field, and the effect was strongest for axons emerging from AcDs. DQP-treated basket cells also displayed more complex AcDs, presumably driven by enhanced network activity. However, local branching of basket cell axons was reduced under DQP in somatic axon cells but at control level in AcD cells. This suggested a growth-promoting effect of the enhanced network activity and that the AcD configuration neutralized the inhibitory action of DQP on basket cell axons. The results suggest a specific role of GluN2D signaling for development and remodeling of interneuronal axons.</span>

To test this, we conducted representational similarity analysis across continuously presented mindset-induction trials using the same loose chunk decomposition problem-solving strategy. This induction was expected to impair the solving of subsequent probe trials requiring a more insightful tight chunk decomposition strategy. Results showed that neural representational similarity increased across loose chunk decomposition induction stages, particularly in regions related to cognitive control, mental operations, and the default mode network. These increases predicted activation in the anterior cingulate cortex and medial frontal lobe during tight chunk decomposition trials. Furthermore, the medial frontal lobe moderated the impact of increased similarity during mental set induction, affecting representational changes from loose chunk decomposition to tight chunk decomposition in perceptual, operative, and executive processing regions. In summary, our findings suggest that increased neural representational similarity in goal-directed mental manipulation networks and the default mode network supports mental set induction, enhancing conflict resolution and representational change during creative problem-solving with different strategies.</span>

We examined the neural mechanisms supporting numerical and visuospatial processing in 4- to 8-year-old children and adults using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), with three tasks: numerical matching, geometric shape matching, and number line estimation. We found that specialization for numerical and geometric processing in parietal cortex exists by 4–8 years of age, and that children exhibited greater conjunctive activation between numerical and geometric tasks throughout the parietal cortex compared to adults. During the number line task, children’s neural activity significantly overlapped with activity from both number and geometric shape matching tasks, whereas adults’ activity only overlapped with the number task. These findings provide the first neural evidence that number line estimation relies on both numerical and geometric processing in children, whereas it depends primarily on number-specific processing in adults.</span>

Electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded when participants performed an adapted social judgment paradigm with three stages: social feedback expectation, social feedback evaluation, and expectation updating.

EEG results revealed that at the social feedback expectation stage, rejection evoked a larger stimulus-preceding negativity magnitude than acceptance in the SNE but not SPE condition. At the social feedback evaluation stage, rejection feedback evoked a smaller early frontal theta than acceptance feedback in the SNE but not SPE condition; unexpected acceptance evoked a larger P300 than unexpected rejection in the SPE but not SNE condition. At the expectation updating stage, unexpected acceptance elicited larger late posterior theta than expected acceptance in the SNE but not SPE condition. These results suggest that shared positive experiences reduce vigilance toward impending rejection and increase sensitivity to pleasantness, whereas shared negative experiences blunt reactivity to rejection feedback and foster social learning from unexpected acceptance to enhance positive expectation.</span>

                The prevalence of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) is rising globally, especially in lower-middle-income countries, underscoring the need for effective public health interventions. There is limited evidence that mobile health interventions can assist in identifying the risk of NCDs in the community. Leveraging existing grassroots infrastructure, such as the Lady Health Worker (LHW) program, presents a promising opportunity to address this challenge. We developed a mHealth application to address this issue. This study protocol describes the design of a pilot study aimed at developing a mHealth application, assessing the feasibility, acceptability (barriers and facilitators), and usability to triage the risk of NCDs and pilot test it in the hands of the LHWs in Pakistan. This study consists of three phases. In phase 1, we develop a comprehensive mHealth application incorporating validated tools for NCD assessment, including the Rose Angina Questionnaire, Questionnaire for Verifying Stroke-free Status, Risk Assessment of Pakistani Individuals for Diabetes, Global Adult Tobacco Survey, International Physical Activity Questionnaire, Refined Food Frequency Questionnaire, and WHO 5 Wellness Index. Phase 2 involves qualitative focus group discussions with LHWs to refine the prototype. Phase 3 entails piloting the application with a sample of 30 LHWs in Karachi and Hyderabad, followed by qualitative exit feedback from LHWs, supervisors, healthcare providers, and community members. The outcomes will be analyzed by means, standard deviation or median with interquartile range for continuous data based on the normality assumption. The frequency with percentages will be registered for the categorical variables to describe the risk identifiers using the NCD tool kit. Internal consistency as validity evidence of the assessment can be determined using Cronbach’s alpha and the content validation index. If deemed feasible or acceptable, our mHealth app will address gaps in the literature and advance NCD research by identifying and improving the quality of life of people in the community in developing countries like Pakistan. The functioning and dissemination of this MHealth application can be an essential step towards highly scalable NCD data collection for a population at high risk for developing NCDs.

                Purpose The objective of this research was to assess the prevalence of musculoskeletal symptoms in online students. Materials and methods A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed by searching the PubMed, Cochrane Library, SCOPUS, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, ProQuest, CINAHL plus with full text, and Wiley InterScience databases. A total of 3,749 studies were identified between January 2020 and December 2023. The Joanna Briggs Tool for studies reporting prevalence was used to assess the quality of studies. Jamovi 2.4 was used in the meta-analysis. Results Sixteen studies were included and used for the meta-analysis. The average age of participants was 22 years, with an age range of 17–45 years, Sample range 120-3,705. There were 6 studies of high quality, 9 studies of medium quality and 1 study of low quality. The areas with the highest prevalence of musculoskeletal pain were the neck (51%, 95% CI = 36–66%, I2 = 99.96), lower back (51%, 95% CI = 42–59%, I2 = 99.96) and shoulder (36%, 95% CI = 26–47%, I2 = 99.61). Conclusions The shift to online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic has emerged as a potential factor influencing musculoskeletal pain in students. Educational institutions should study the duration of online learning that begins to impact student injury outcomes.

                Background This study addresses the challenge of stabilizing rice retail prices in Indonesia, where rice is a critical staple food, as in many Asian countries. The government prioritizes price stability to prevent sharp increases that could trigger social unrest during shortages. Price control approaches are categorized as direct or indirect. Direct controls involve immediate interventions, such as boosting rice stocks through imports to quickly influence market prices. Indirect controls consist of longer-term measures, like enhancing domestic production capacity for gradual stabilization. This study proposes an optimization model to determine the optimal rice import volume to minimize bi-monthly retail price fluctuations. Methods A linear programming model is formulated to minimize bimonthly price changes, subject to constraints including local production capacity, import limits, rice flow balance, and demand fulfillment. The monthly retail price is modeled using a compound linear regression approach with seven explanatory variables: the rupiah exchange rate against the US dollar, GDP per capita, the price of ground dry rice (GKG) per kilogram, domestic rice procurement, rice imports, rice distribution, and government-managed rice stock aimed at ensuring domestic availability and price stability. The explanatory variable is forecasted using methods best suited to its historical pattern. Results The model was tested using data from 2020 to 2023. The results indicate that bimonthly rice prices increases can be effectively controlled, with maximum price change rates maintained between 0.75% and 1.14% and a standard deviation ranging from 0.20% to 0.34%. These values are significantly lower than the anticipated inflation rate of 2–3%. Conclusions The optimization model effectively determines the required volume of rice imports to minimize bimonthly retail price fluctuations. By regulating import volumes, excessive price increases can be prevented. Enhanced data-driven forecasting with granular historical data may further improve the accuracy of retail rice price predictions and strengthen price stabilization initiatives.

                Background Stroke survivors, particularly those of working age, are at an increased risk of recurrent stroke within one–five years of the initial event, largely due to suboptimal management of risk factors. This study aimed to identify lifestyle and occupational factors associated with recurrent stroke in this demographic population. Methods This case-control study included 100 patients with recurrent ischemic stroke and 200 ischemic stroke survivors without recurrence, who were recruited from the hospital database. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify significant factors associated with recurrence, which were presented as adjusted odds ratios (aORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results The mean age was 45.4 years (SD = 15.1) among cases and 50.6 years (SD = 6.5) among controls. The male-to-female ratios were 1.17:1 and 1.94:1 in the case and control groups, respectively. Significant factors associated with recurrent stroke included female sex (aOR: 1.83; 95% CI [1.10–3.29]), high fasting blood sugar (aOR: 3.70; 95% CI [1.66–8.27]), current alcohol consumption (aOR: 3.63; 95% CI [2.01–6.54]), sedentary lifestyle (aOR: 2.77; 95% CI [1.50–5.13]), and lack of workplace support for health (aOR: 2.02; 95% CI [1.13–3.63]). The associations between these factors and stroke recurrence varied according to the age group. Conclusions This study highlights the critical role of modifiable lifestyle and occupational factors in stroke recurrence among working-age adults. Tailored age-specific prevention strategies—emphasizing physical activity, reduced alcohol use, and improved workplace health environments—may reduce the risk of recurrence and enhance health outcomes in this population.

                <p>by Carlos A. Gomez-Uribe, Japheth Gado, Meiirbek Islamov</p>

We present a protein engineering approach to directed evolution with machine learning that integrates a new semi-supervised neural network fitness prediction model, Seq2Fitness, and an innovative optimization algorithm, biphasic annealing for diverse and adaptive sequence sampling (BADASS) to design sequences. Seq2Fitness leverages protein language models to predict fitness landscapes, combining evolutionary data with experimental labels, while BADASS efficiently explores these landscapes by dynamically adjusting temperature and mutation energies to prevent premature convergence and to generate diverse high-fitness sequences. Compared to alternative models, Seq2Fitness improves Spearman correlation with experimental fitness measurements, increasing from 0.34 to 0.55 on sequences containing mutations at positions entirely not seen during training. BADASS requires less memory and computation compared to gradient-based Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, while generating more high-fitness and diverse sequences across two protein families. For both families, 100% of the top 10,000 sequences identified by BADASS exceed the wildtype in predicted fitness, whereas competing methods range from 3% to 99%, often producing far fewer than 10,000 sequences. BADASS also finds higher-fitness sequences at every cutoff (top 1, 100, and 10,000). Additionally, we provide a theoretical framework explaining BADASS’s underlying mechanism and behavior. While we focus on amino acid sequences, BADASS may generalize to other sequence spaces, such as DNA and RNA.

Neuronal regeneration in the adult brain, which is restricted compared to that in the embryonic brain, is a long-standing topic in neuroscience and medical research. Based on studies in mammals, a small number of newly generated immature neurons (neuroblasts) migrate toward damaged sites and contribute to functional recovery. During migration, neuroblasts form chain-like collectives and modify the morphology of glial cells (astrocytes), which are the main components of the surrounding environment. However, it remains unclear how neuroblasts form collectives and how efficient migration is achieved through collective formation in a pool of astrocytes. The main difficulty lies in tracking individual neuroblasts within the collective, both in vitro and in vivo, over a period. To address this impasse, we built a mathematical model of the neuroblast-astrocyte system to assess its long-term performance in silico. Our simulations showed that individual neuroblasts gathered into chain-like collectives through occasional contact, astrocyte confinement, and moderate adhesion between the neuroblasts. The forward movement of neuroblasts in an astrocyte-dense environment was accelerated if we assumed a simple interaction: the higher the number of neuroblasts near an astrocyte, the stronger the shrinkage of astrocytic protrusions. Furthermore, temporal changes in neuroblast behavior, as indicated by our observation of living neuroblasts in culture, reinforce the advantages of simulated collectives. A collective of neuroblasts with constant behavior sometimes repeated non-migratory movements, whereas those with inconstant behavior were easily untangled, resulting in a rapid migration. These results highlight the potential for neuroblast collectivity and inconstancy in enhancing neuronal regeneration in the adult brain.

                <p>by Takuya Kawamura, Megumi Shigematsu, Yohei Kirino</p>

tRNA halves are among the most abundant short non-coding RNAs in the cellular transcriptome. Here we report that in androgen receptor-positive LNCaP prostate cancer cells, the hormone-dependent 5′-tRNA<sup>LysCUU</sup> half promoted cell proliferation by facilitating cell cycle progression. Global mRNA profiling upon the 5′-tRNA<sup>LysCUU</sup> half depletion revealed that the mRNA of p21, a negative regulator of the cell cycle, is post-transcriptionally destabilized via a 5′-tRNA<sup>LysCUU</sup> half-driven mechanism. YBX1, identified as a protein interacting with 5′-tRNA<sup>LysCUU</sup> half in the cytosol, was shown to stabilize p21 mRNA. Specific sequences resembling the 5′-tRNA<sup>LysCUU</sup> half, located in the 3′-UTR of p21 mRNA and termed LL588, were identified as the binding site for YBX1 and are required for p21 mRNA stability. In vitro binding assays demonstrated that the 5′-tRNA<sup>LysCUU</sup> half is capable of displacing YBX1 from LL588. Collectively, our findings suggest that the 5′-tRNA<sup>LysCUU</sup> half directly binds to and displaces YBX1 from p21 mRNA, leading to the destabilization of p21 mRNA and the promotion of cell cycle progression in hormone-dependent cancers. Our study illuminates the role of tRNA halves in regulating mRNA stability and suggests that this may be part of broader regulatory networks affecting mRNA levels, orchestrated by various tRNA halves and their interacting proteins.

Body ownership disorders can be triggered by disease or body damage. Methods to probe limb embodiment are required to address those disorders. This includes the development of neuroprostheses that better integrate into the body scheme of the user. To this end, the “rubber hand illusion” protocol is a key behavioral method to probe the powerful embodiment that can be triggered by congruent somatosensory and visual inputs from the limb. So far, the neurophysiology of limb embodiment remains poorly known, in part because translating the rubber hand illusion to animal models such as the mouse remains challenging. Yet, mapping out the brain circuits of embodiment thanks to the use of genetic and optogenetic research tools would allow to propose novel embodiment restoration strategies. Here, we show that the rubber hand illusion described in humans can be translated to the mouse forelimb model using an automated, videography-based procedure. We exposed head-fixed mice to a visible, static 3D-printed replica of the right forelimb, while their own forelimb was hidden from their sight. We synchronously brushed their hidden forelimb and the replica. Following these visuo-tactile associations, the replica was visually threatened, and we probed the reaction of the mice using automated tracking of pupils and facial expression. The mice focused significantly more of their gaze toward the threatened forelimb replica after receiving synchronous tactile and visual information compared to asynchronous. More generally, across test and control conditions, the mouse pupillary response was consistent with the human overt response to the rubber hand illusion. Thus, our results show that mice exhibit quantifiable behavioral markers of the embodiment of an artificial forelimb.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003180">Sensory stimuli dominate over rhythmic electrical stimulation in modulating behavior</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yuranny Cabral-Calderin, Molly J. Henry</p>

Neural tracking (entrainment) of auditory rhythms enhances perception. We previously demonstrated that transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) can enhance or suppress entrainment to rhythmic auditory stimuli, depending on the timing between the electrical and auditory signals, although tACS effects are primarily modulatory. This study further investigated entrainment to tACS and auditory rhythms when the electrical and auditory signals were presented together (Experiment 1, <i>N</i> = 34) or independently (Experiment 2, <i>N</i> = 24; Experiment 3, <i>N</i> = 12). We hypothesized that tACS effects would be more pronounced when the auditory rhythm was made less perceptually salient to reduce the competition with the electrical rhythm. Participants detected silent gaps in modulated or unmodulated noise stimuli. In Experiment 1, auditory stimuli predominated in entraining behavior. While behavioral entrainment to sound rhythms was affected by the modulation depth of the auditory stimulus, entrainment to tACS was not. In Experiment 2, with no rhythmic information from the sound, 17 of 24 participants showed significant behavioral entrainment to tACS, although the most effective tACS frequency varied across participants. An oscillator model with a free parameter for the individual resonance frequency produced profiles similar to those we observed behaviorally. In Experiment 3, both neural and behavioral entrainment to rhythmic sounds were affected by the auditory stimulus frequency, but again the most effective entraining frequency varied across participants. Our findings suggest that tACS effects depend on the individual’s preferred frequency when there is no competition with sensory stimuli, emphasizing the importance of targeting individual frequencies in tACS experiments. When both sensory and electrical stimuli are rhythmic and compete, sensory stimuli prevail, indicating the superiority of sensory stimulation in modulating behavior.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003174">Neural evidence that humans reuse strategies to solve new tasks</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Sam Hall-McMaster, Momchil S. Tomov, Samuel J. Gershman, Nicolas W. Schuck</p>

Generalization from past experience is an important feature of intelligent systems. When faced with a new task, one efficient computational approach is to evaluate solutions to earlier tasks as candidates for reuse. Consistent with this idea, we found that human participants (<i>n</i> = 38) learned optimal solutions to a set of training tasks and generalized them to novel test tasks in a reward-selective manner. This behavior was consistent with a computational process based on the successor representation known as successor features and generalized policy improvement (SF&GPI). Neither model-free perseveration or model-based control using a complete model of the environment could explain choice behavior. Decoding from functional magnetic resonance imaging data revealed that solutions from the SF&GPI algorithm were activated on test tasks in visual and prefrontal cortex. This activation had a functional connection to behavior in that stronger activation of SF&GPI solutions in visual areas was associated with increased behavioral reuse. These findings point to a possible neural implementation of an adaptive algorithm for generalization across tasks.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We aimed to characterize the phenotypic spectrum and functional consequences associated with variants in <i>HCN2</i>, encoding for the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide (HCN) gated channel 2.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>GeneMatcher facilitated the recruitment of 21 individuals with <i>HCN2</i> variants from 15 unrelated families, carrying <i>HCN2</i> variants. In vitro functional studies were performed by electrophysiology with <i>Xenopus laevis</i> oocytes and membrane trafficking was investigated in HEK cells by confocal imaging. Structural 3D-analysis of the <i>HCN2</i> variants was performed.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The phenotypic spectrum included developmental delay/intellectual disability (DD/ID, 17/21), epilepsy (10/21), language disorders (16/21), movement disorders (12/21), and axial hypotonia (10/21). Thirteen pathogenic variants (12 new and 1 already described) were identified: 11 missense (8 monoallelic and 3 biallelic), 1 recurrent inframe deletion (monoallelic), and 1 frameshift (biallelic). Functional analysis of p.(Arg324His) variant showed a strong increase of HCN2 conductance, whereas p.(Ala363Val) and p.(Met374Leu) exhibited dominant negative effects. The p.(Leu377His), p.(Pro493Leu), and p.(Gly587Asp) variants rendered HCN2 electrophysiologically silent and impaired membrane trafficking. Structural 3D-analysis revealed that, except for p.(Arg324His), all variants altered HCN2 stability.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings broadened the HCN2 disease clinical spectrum to include DD/ID with or without epilepsy. Functional analysis in cellular models reveal that pathogenic <i>HCN2</i> variants can cause either loss-of-function or gain-of-function, providing critical information for the development of targeted therapies for <i>HCN2</i>-related disorders.

                ABC transporters modulate lipid homeostasis and are implicated in neurodegenerative diseases. In a recent study, Chen et al. uncovered unexpected dual roles for the Drosophila ABCA protein eater of debris (Eato), which suppresses phospholipid exposure in both neurons and phagocytes, conferring opposite functional outcomes in each cell type. This challenges classical models of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter function and reveals new mechanisms by which lipid signaling regulates neuron–glia interactions in neurodegenerative contexts.

                Physical activity (PA) has emerged as a modifiable protective lifestyle factor for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In a recent study by Kim and colleagues, higher levels of PA were associated with reduced phosphorylated tau (ptau) 217 concentrations even after accounting for β-amyloid (Aβ) brain uptake, suggesting a link with tau pathophysiology; this link also mediated better general cognition.

                In a recent study, Thakur and O’Connor-Giles identified PDZD8 as a novel regulator of activity-dependent synaptic growth in Drosophila. Localized at endoplasmic reticulum (ER)–late endosome/lysosome (LEL) membrane contact sites (MCSs), PDZD8 promotes autophagy by coupling lipid transfer to autolysosome maturation to drive synaptic bouton formation, providing in vivo evidence that autophagy contributes directly to synaptic remodeling.

                Dijkstra et al. show that our brain distinguishes imagination from reality by monitoring how strongly the fusiform gyrus is activated. When imagined and real images produce similar activity, people can confuse them. This helps explain how we normally tell what is real—and why that sometimes fails.

The force-induced activation of TMEM63s is proposed to be mediated by a hydrophobic latch, sensing membrane thickness.

                Wang et al. identify phosphoglycerate mutase (PGAM) as a negative regulator of pathogenic Th17 cell differentiation, contrary to other glycolytic enzymes. PGAM inhibition suppresses a regulatory program in non-pathogenic Th17 cells. Inhibiting PGAM in Th17 cells exacerbates autoimmune responses in an adoptive transfer model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE).

Although it is dispensable for ILC3 maintenance and their IL-22 production, it is required for generating sufficient HB-EGF to alleviate colitis, thereby providing insights for the evaluation of RORγt inhibitors.
