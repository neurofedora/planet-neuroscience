              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11758">Early reduced dopaminergic tone mediated by D3 receptor and dopamine transporter in absence epileptogenesis</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.11758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Abstract Objective In Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rats From Strasbourg ( GAERS s), epileptogenesis takes place during brain maturation and correlates with increased mRNA expression of D3 dopamine receptors (D3R). Whether these alterations are the consequence of seizure repetition or contribute to the development of epilepsy remains to be clarified. Here, we addressed the involvement of the dopaminergic system in epilepsy onset in GAERS s. Methods Experiments were performed using rats at different stages of brain maturation from three strains according to their increasing propensity to develop absence seizures: nonepileptic control rats ( NEC s), Wistar Hannover rats, and GAERS s. Changes in dopaminergic neurotransmission were investigated using different behavioral and neurochemical approaches: autoradiography of D3R and dopamine transporter, single photon emission computed tomographic imaging, acute and chronic drug effects on seizure recordings (dopaminergic agonists and antagonists), quinpirole-induced yawns and dopamine synaptosomal uptake, microdialysis, brain tissue monoamines, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor quantification. Results Autoradiography revealed an increased expression of D3R in 14-day-old GAERS s, before absence seizure onset, that persists in adulthood, as compared to age-matched NEC s. This was confirmed by increased yawns, a marker of D3R activity, and increased seizures when animals were injected with quinpirole at low doses to activate D3R. We also observed a concomitant increase in the expression and activity of the dopamine transporter in GAERS s before seizure onset, consistent with both lowered dopamine basal level and increased phasic responses. Significance Our data show that the dopaminergic system is persistently altered in GAERS s, which may contribute not only to behavioral comorbidities but also as an etiopathogenic factor in the development of epilepsy. The data suggest that an imbalanced dopaminergic tone may contribute to absence epilepsy development and seizure onset, as its reversion by a chronic treatment with a dopamine stabilizer significantly suppressed epileptogenesis. Our data suggest a potential new target for antiepileptic therapies and/or improvement of quality of life of epileptic patients.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12124">Optimal Visual Search with Highly Heuristic Decision Rules</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.12124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual search is a fundamental natural task for humans and other animals. We investigated the decision processes humans use when searching briefly presented displays having well-separated potential target-object locations. Performance was compared with the Bayesian-optimal decision process under the assumption that the information from the different potential target locations is statistically independent. Surprisingly, humans performed slightly better than optimal, despite humans' substantial loss of sensitivity in the fovea, and the implausibility of the human brain replicating the optimal computations. We show that three factors can quantitatively explain these seemingly paradoxical results. Most importantly, simple and fixed heuristic decision rules reach near optimal search performance. Secondly, foveal neglect primarily affects only the central potential target location. Finally, spatially correlated neural noise causes search performance to exceed that predicted for independent noise. These findings have far-reaching implications for understanding visual search tasks and other identification tasks in humans and other animals.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11654">How to Build the Virtual Cell with Artificial Intelligence: Priorities and Opportunities</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.11654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cell is arguably the smallest unit of life and is central to understanding biology. Accurate modeling of cells is important for this understanding as well as for determining the root causes of disease. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), combined with the ability to generate large-scale experimental data, present novel opportunities to model cells. Here we propose a vision of AI-powered Virtual Cells, where robust representations of cells and cellular systems under different conditions are directly learned from growing biological data across measurements and scales. We discuss desired capabilities of AI Virtual Cells, including generating universal representations of biological entities across scales, and facilitating interpretable in silico experiments to predict and understand their behavior using Virtual Instruments. We further address the challenges, opportunities and requirements to realize this vision including data needs, evaluation strategies, and community standards and engagement to ensure biological accuracy and broad utility. We envision a future where AI Virtual Cells help identify new drug targets, predict cellular responses to perturbations, as well as scale hypothesis exploration. With open science collaborations across the biomedical ecosystem that includes academia, philanthropy, and the biopharma and AI industries, a comprehensive predictive understanding of cell mechanisms and interactions is within reach.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10163">Learning temporal relationships between symbols with Laplace Neural Manifolds</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2302.10163v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Firing across populations of neurons in many regions of the mammalian brain maintains a temporal memory, a neural timeline of the recent past. Behavioral results demonstrate that people can both remember the past and anticipate the future over an analogous internal timeline. This paper presents a mathematical framework for building this timeline of the future. We assume that the input to the system is a time series of symbols--sparse tokenized representations of the present--in continuous time. The goal is to record pairwise temporal relationships between symbols over a wide range of time scales. We assume that the brain has access to a temporal memory in the form of the real Laplace transform. Hebbian associations with a diversity of synaptic time scales are formed between the past timeline and the present symbol. The associative memory stores the convolution between the past and the present. Knowing the temporal relationship between the past and the present allows one to infer relationships between the present and the future. With appropriate normalization, this Hebbian associative matrix can store a Laplace successor representation and a Laplace predecessor representation from which measures of temporal contingency can be evaluated. The diversity of synaptic time constants allows for learning of non-stationary statistics as well as joint statistics between triplets of symbols. This framework synthesizes a number of recent neuroscientific findings including results from dopamine neurons in the mesolimbic forebrain.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12895">The emergence of the width of subjective temporality: the self-simulational theory of temporal extension from the perspective of the free energy principle</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2404.12895v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The self-simulational theory of temporal extension describes an information-theoretically formalized mechanism by which the width of subjective temporality emerges from the architecture of self-modelling. In this paper, the perspective of the free energy principle will be assumed, to cast the emergence of subjective temporality, along with a Bayesian mechanism for hierarchical duration estimation, from first principles of the physics of self-organization. Using active inference, a deep parametric generative model of temporal inference is simulated, which realizes the described dynamics on a computational level. Two biases (i.e. variations) of time-perception naturally emerge from the simulated computational model. This concerns the intentional binding effect (i.e. the subjective compression of the temporal interval between voluntarily initiated actions and subsequent sensory consequences) and empirically documented alterations of time perception in deep and concentrated states of meditative absorption (i.e. in minimal phenomenal experience). Generally, numerous systematic and domain-specific alterations of subjective temporal experience are computationally explained in a unified manner, as enabled by integration with current active inference accounts mapping onto the respective domains. This concerns the temporality-modulating role of valence, impulsivity, boredom, flow-states, and near death-experiences, amongst others; as well as more general scale-invariant effects of timing and central tendency effects. The self-simulational theory of temporal extension, from the perspective of the free energy principle, explains how the subjective temporal Now emerges and varies from first principles, accounting for why sometimes, subjective time seems to fly, and sometimes, moments feel like eternities; with the computational mechanism being readily deployable synthetically.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10078">Spurious reconstruction from brain activity</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2405.10078v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advances in brain decoding, particularly visual image reconstruction, have sparked discussions about the societal implications and ethical considerations of neurotechnology. As these methods aim to recover visual experiences from brain activity and achieve prediction beyond training samples (zero-shot prediction), it is crucial to assess their capabilities and limitations to inform public expectations and regulations. Our case study of recent text-guided reconstruction methods, which leverage a large-scale dataset (Natural Scene Dataset, NSD) and text-to-image diffusion models, reveals limitations in their generalizability. We found poor performance when applying these methods to a different dataset designed to prevent category overlaps between training and test sets. UMAP visualization of the text features with NSD images showed a limited diversity of semantic and visual clusters, with overlap between training and test sets. Formal analysis and simulations demonstrated that clustered training samples can lead to "output dimension collapse," restricting predictable output feature dimensions. Simulations further showed that diversifying the training set improved generalizability. However, text features alone are insufficient for mapping to the visual space. We argue that recent realistic reconstructions may primarily be a blend of classification into trained categories and generation of inauthentic images through text-to-image diffusion (hallucination). Diverse datasets and compositional representations spanning the image space are essential for genuine zero-shot prediction. Interdisciplinary discussions grounded in understanding the current capabilities and limitations, as well as ethical considerations, of the technology are crucial for its responsible development.

                arXiv:2408.10253v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a recent paper as an alternative to models based on the notion of ideal mathematical point, characterized by a property of separatedness, we considered a viewpoint based on the notion of continuous change, making use of elements of a non-classical logic, in particular the fuzzy sets theory, with events represented as spatiotemporally blurred blobs. Here we point out and discuss a number of aspects of this imperfect symbolic description that might potentially be misleading. Besides that, we analyze its relation to various concepts used commonly to model physical systems, denoted by terms like: point, set, continuous, discrete, infinite, or local, clarifying further how our viewpoint is different and asking whether, in light of our main postulate, any of these notions, or their opposites, if exist, are in their usual meanings suitable to accurately describe the natural phenomena.

Abstract: This paper introduces Inferno, a software library built on top of PyTorch that is designed to meet distinctive challenges of using spiking neural networks (SNNs) for machine learning tasks. We describe the architecture of Inferno and key differentiators that make it uniquely well-suited to these tasks. We show how Inferno supports trainable heterogeneous delays on both CPUs and GPUs, and how Inferno enables a "write once, apply everywhere" development methodology for novel models and techniques. We compare Inferno's performance to BindsNET, a library aimed at machine learning with SNNs, and Brian2/Brian2CUDA which is popular in neuroscience. Among several examples, we show how the design decisions made by Inferno facilitate easily implementing the new methods of Nadafian and Ganjtabesh in delay learning with spike-timing dependent plasticity.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11612">Hardware-Friendly Implementation of Physical Reservoir Computing with CMOS-based Time-domain Analog Spiking Neurons</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.11612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an analog spiking neuron that utilizes time-domain information, i.e., a time interval of two signal transitions and a pulse width, to construct a spiking neural network (SNN) for a hardware-friendly physical reservoir computing (RC) on a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) platform. A neuron with leaky integrate-and-fire is realized by employing two voltage-controlled oscillators (VCOs) with opposite sensitivities to the internal control voltage, and the neuron connection structure is restricted by the use of only 4 neighboring neurons on the 2-dimensional plane to feasibly construct a regular network topology. Such a system enables us to compose an SNN with a counter-based readout circuit, which simplifies the hardware implementation of the SNN. Moreover, another technical advantage thanks to the bottom-up integration is the capability of dynamically capturing every neuron state in the network, which can significantly contribute to finding guidelines on how to enhance the performance for various computational tasks in temporal information processing. Diverse nonlinear physical dynamics needed for RC can be realized by collective behavior through dynamic interaction between neurons, like coupled oscillators, despite the simple network structure. With behavioral system-level simulations, we demonstrate physical RC through short-term memory and exclusive OR tasks, and the spoken digit recognition task with an accuracy of 97.7% as well. Our system is considerably feasible for practical applications and also can be a useful platform for studying the mechanism of physical RC.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11617">HRA: A Multi-Criteria Framework for Ranking Metaheuristic Optimization Algorithms</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.11617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metaheuristic algorithms are essential for solving complex optimization problems in different fields. However, the difficulty in comparing and rating these algorithms remains due to the wide range of performance metrics and problem dimensions usually involved. On the other hand, nonparametric statistical methods and post hoc tests are time-consuming, especially when we only need to identify the top performers among many algorithms. The Hierarchical Rank Aggregation (HRA) algorithm aims to efficiently rank metaheuristic algorithms based on their performance across many criteria and dimensions. The HRA employs a hierarchical framework that begins with collecting performance metrics on various benchmark functions and dimensions. Rank-based normalization is employed for each performance measure to ensure comparability and the robust TOPSIS aggregation is applied to combine these rankings at several hierarchical levels, resulting in a comprehensive ranking of the algorithms. Our study uses data from the CEC 2017 competition to demonstrate the robustness and efficacy of the HRA framework. It examines 30 benchmark functions and evaluates the performance of 13 metaheuristic algorithms across five performance indicators in four distinct dimensions. This presentation highlights the potential of the HRA to enhance the interpretation of the comparative advantages and disadvantages of various algorithms by simplifying practitioners' choices of the most appropriate algorithm for certain optimization problems.

                arXiv:2409.11430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The widespread deployment of products powered by machine learning models is raising concerns around data privacy and information security worldwide. To address this issue, Federated Learning was first proposed as a privacy-preserving alternative to conventional methods that allow multiple learning clients to share model knowledge without disclosing private data. A complementary approach known as Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) is a quantum-safe cryptographic system that enables operations to be performed on encrypted weights. However, implementing mechanisms such as these in practice often comes with significant computational overhead and can expose potential security threats. Novel computing paradigms, such as analog, quantum, and specialized digital hardware, present opportunities for implementing privacy-preserving machine learning systems while enhancing security and mitigating performance loss. This work instantiates these ideas by applying the FHE scheme to a Federated Learning Neural Network architecture that integrates both classical and quantum layers.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11593">Self-Contrastive Forward-Forward Algorithm</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.11593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Forward-Forward (FF) algorithm is a recent, purely forward-mode learning method, that updates weights locally and layer-wise and supports supervised as well as unsupervised learning. These features make it ideal for applications such as brain-inspired learning, low-power hardware neural networks, and distributed learning in large models. However, while FF has shown promise on written digit recognition tasks, its performance on natural images and time-series remains a challenge. A key limitation is the need to generate high-quality negative examples for contrastive learning, especially in unsupervised tasks, where versatile solutions are currently lacking. To address this, we introduce the Self-Contrastive Forward-Forward (SCFF) method, inspired by self-supervised contrastive learning. SCFF generates positive and negative examples applicable across different datasets, surpassing existing local forward algorithms for unsupervised classification accuracy on MNIST (MLP: 98.7%), CIFAR-10 (CNN: 80.75%), and STL-10 (CNN: 77.3%). Additionally, SCFF is the first to enable FF training of recurrent neural networks, opening the door to more complex tasks and continuous-time video and text processing.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11601">DiffESM: Conditional Emulation of Temperature and Precipitation in Earth System Models with 3D Diffusion Models</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.11601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Earth System Models (ESMs) are essential for understanding the interaction between human activities and the Earth's climate. However, the computational demands of ESMs often limit the number of simulations that can be run, hindering the robust analysis of risks associated with extreme weather events. While low-cost climate emulators have emerged as an alternative to emulate ESMs and enable rapid analysis of future climate, many of these emulators only provide output on at most a monthly frequency. This temporal resolution is insufficient for analyzing events that require daily characterization, such as heat waves or heavy precipitation. We propose using diffusion models, a class of generative deep learning models, to effectively downscale ESM output from a monthly to a daily frequency. Trained on a handful of ESM realizations, reflecting a wide range of radiative forcings, our DiffESM model takes monthly mean precipitation or temperature as input, and is capable of producing daily values with statistical characteristics close to ESM output. Combined with a low-cost emulator providing monthly means, this approach requires only a small fraction of the computational resources needed to run a large ensemble. We evaluate model behavior using a number of extreme metrics, showing that DiffESM closely matches the spatio-temporal behavior of the ESM output it emulates in terms of the frequency and spatial characteristics of phenomena such as heat waves, dry spells, or rainfall intensity.

	<p>Introduction: Posterior cerebral artery (PCA) aneurysms represent up to 1% of all cerebral aneurysms. P1-P2 perforator aneurysms are thought to be even less prevalent and often require complex treatment strategies due to their anatomical and morphological characteristics, with risk of a perforator infarct. We studied the treatment of P1-P2 perforator aneurysms in a single-center cohort from a high-volume tertiary center, reporting clinical and anatomical characteristics, treatment strategies, and outcomes. Methods: A retrospective analysis of adult patients with a P1-P2 perforator aneurysm who presented at our institution between January 2000 and January 2023 was performed. The patients were analyzed for demographics, clinical presentation, imaging findings, treatment techniques, outcomes, and complications. Subgroup analyses between ruptured versus non-ruptured cases were included. Results: Out of 2733 patients with a cerebral aneurysm, 14 patients (0.5%) presented with a P1-P2 perforator aneurysm. All six patients with a ruptured aneurysm were treated by endovascular coiling, of whom one patient (16.7%) required surgical clipping of a recurrence. One out of eight (12.5%) patients with unruptured aneurysms was treated by surgical clipping. P1-P2 perforator aneurysms predominantly affected middle-aged individuals (median 59.5 years), with 10/14 (71.4%) being female. Endovascular coiling was the primary treatment modality overall, yielding favorable technical outcomes, however, it was complicated by a perforator infarct in two patients (33.3%) without new permanent morbidity or mortality secondary to treatment. Conclusions: P1-P2 perforator aneurysms are a rare subtype of intracranial aneurysm. Endovascular coiling could present an effective treatment modality; however, care should be taken for ischemic complications in the dependent perforator territory. Larger studies are required to provide more insights.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/44/38/e0036242024?rss=1">Disentangling Temporal and Rate Codes in the Primate Somatosensory Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>Millisecond-scale temporal spiking patterns encode sensory information in the periphery, but their role in the neocortex remains controversial. The sense of touch provides a window into temporal coding because tactile neurons often exhibit precise, repeatable, and informative temporal spiking patterns. In the somatosensory cortex (S1), responses to skin vibrations exhibit phase locking that faithfully carries information about vibratory frequency. However, the respective roles of spike timing and rate in frequency coding are confounded because vibratory frequency shapes both the timing and rates of responses. To disentangle the contributions of these two neural features, we measured S1 responses as rhesus macaques performed frequency discrimination tasks in which differences in frequency were accompanied by orthogonal variations in amplitude. We assessed the degree to which the strength and timing of responses could account for animal performance. First, we showed that animals can discriminate frequency, but their performance is biased by amplitude variations. Second, rate-based representations of frequency are susceptible to changes in amplitude but in ways that are inconsistent with the animals&rsquo; behavioral biases, calling into question a rate-based neural code for frequency. In contrast, timing-based representations are highly informative about frequency but impervious to changes in amplitude, which is also inconsistent with the animals&rsquo; behavior. We account for the animals&rsquo; behavior with a model wherein frequency coding relies on a temporal code, but frequency judgments are biased by perceived magnitude. We conclude that information about vibratory frequency is not encoded in S1 firing rates but primarily in temporal patterning on millisecond timescales.</p>

                <p>Navigation requires integrating sensory information with a stable schema to create a dynamic map of an animal&rsquo;s position using egocentric and allocentric coordinate systems. In the hippocampus, place cells encode allocentric space, but their firing rates may also exhibit directional tuning within egocentric or allocentric reference frames. We compared experimental and simulated data to assess the prevalence of tuning to egocentric bearing (EB) among hippocampal cells in rats foraging in an open field. Using established procedures, we confirmed egocentric modulation of place cell activity in recorded data; however, simulated data revealed a high false-positive rate (FPR). When we accounted for false positives by comparing with shuffled data that retain correlations between the animal&rsquo;s direction and position, only a very low number of hippocampal neurons appeared modulated by EB. Our study highlights biases affecting FPRs and provides insights into the challenges of identifying egocentric modulation in hippocampal neurons.</p>

                <p>Attention and decision-making processes are fundamental to cognition. However, they are usually experimentally confounded, making it difficult to link neural observations to specific processes. Here we separated the effects of selective attention from the effects of decision-making on brain activity obtained from human participants (both sexes), using a two-stage task where the attended stimulus and decision were orthogonal and separated in time. Multivariate pattern analyses of multimodal neuroimaging data revealed the dynamics of perceptual and decision-related information coding through time with magnetoencephalography (MEG), through space with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and their combination (MEG-fMRI fusion). Our MEG results showed an effect of attention before decision-making could begin, and fMRI results showed an attention effect in early visual and frontoparietal regions. Model-based MEG-fMRI fusion suggested that attention boosted stimulus information in the frontoparietal and early visual regions before decision-making was possible. Together, our results suggest that attention affects neural stimulus representations in the frontoparietal regions independent of decision-making.</p>

                <p>Making choices about whether and when to engage cognitive effort are a common feature of everyday experience, with important consequences for academic, career, and health outcomes. Yet, despite their hypothesized importance, very little is understood about the underlying mechanisms that support this form of human cost&ndash;benefit decision-making. To investigate these mechanisms, we used the Cognitive Effort Discounting Paradigm (Cog-ED) during fMRI scanning to precisely quantify the neural encoding of varying cognitive effort demands relative to reward outcomes, within two distinct cognitive domains (working memory, speech comprehension). The findings provide strong evidence that the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) plays a central and selective role in this decision-making process. Trial-by-trial modulations in dACC activation tracked the relative subjective value of the low-effort, low-reward option, with the strongest activity occurring when this was of greater value than the high-effort, high-reward option. In contrast, dACC activity was not modulated by decision difficulty, though such effects were found in other frontoparietal regions. Critically, dACC activity was also strongly correlated across the two decision-making task domains and further predicted subsequent choice behavior in both. Together, the results suggest that dACC activity modulation reflects a domain-general valuation comparison mechanism, which acts to bias participants away from decisions to engage in cognitive effort, when the perceived subjective costs of such engagement outweigh the reward-related benefits. These findings complement work in other cost domains and species by pointing to a clear role of the dACC in representing subjective value differences between choice options during cost&ndash;benefit decision-making.</p>

                <p>Neuroscience research has evolved to generate increasingly large and complex experimental data sets, and advanced data science tools are taking on central roles in neuroscience research. Neurodata Without Borders (NWB), a standard language for neurophysiology data, has recently emerged as a powerful solution for data management, analysis, and sharing. We here discuss our labs&rsquo; efforts to implement NWB data science pipelines. We describe general principles and specific use cases that illustrate successes, challenges, and non-trivial decisions in software engineering. We hope that our experience can provide guidance for the neuroscience community and help bridge the gap between experimental neuroscience and data science. Key takeaways from this article are that (1) standardization with NWB requires non-trivial design choices; (2) the general practice of standardization in the lab promotes data awareness and literacy, and improves transparency, rigor, and reproducibility in our science; (3) we offer several feature suggestions to ease the extensibility, publishing/sharing, and usability for NWB standard and users of NWB data.</p>

                <p>The frontal eye field (FEF) plays a well-established role in the control of visual attention. The strength of an FEF neuron's response to a visual stimulus presented in its receptive field is enhanced if the stimulus captures spatial attention by virtue of its salience. A stimulus can be rendered salient by cognitive factors as well as by physical attributes. These include surprise. The aim of the present experiment was to determine whether surprise-induced salience would result in enhanced visual-response strength in the FEF. Toward this end, we monitored neuronal activity in two male monkeys while presenting first a visual cue predicting with high probability that the reward delivered at the end of the trial would be good or bad (large or small) and then a visual cue announcing the size of the impending reward with certainty. The second cue usually confirmed but occasionally violated the expectation set up by the first cue. Neurons responded more strongly to the second cue when it violated than when it confirmed expectation. The increase in the firing rate was accompanied by a decrease in spike-count correlation as expected from capture of attention. Although both good surprise and bad surprise induced enhanced firing, the effects appeared to arise from distinct mechanisms as indicated by the fact that the bad-surprise signal appeared at a longer latency than the good-surprise signal and by the fact that the strength of the two signals varied independently across neurons.</p>

                <p>Circadian, infradian, and seasonal changes in steroid hormone secretion have been tied to changes in brain volume in several mammalian species. However, the relationship between circadian changes in steroid hormone production and rhythmic changes in brain morphology in humans is largely unknown. Here, we examined the relationship between diurnal fluctuations in steroid hormones and multiscale brain morphology in a precision imaging study of a male who completed 40 MRI and serological assessments at 7&nbsp;A.M. and 8&nbsp;P.M. over the course of a month, targeting hormone concentrations at their peak and nadir. Diurnal fluctuations in steroid hormones were tied to pronounced changes in global and regional brain morphology. From morning to evening, total brain volume, gray matter volume, and cortical thickness decreased, coincident with decreases in steroid hormone concentrations (testosterone, estradiol, and cortisol). In parallel, cerebrospinal fluid and ventricle size increased from A.M. to P.M. Global changes were driven by decreases within the occipital and parietal cortices. These findings highlight natural rhythms in brain morphology that keep time with the diurnal ebb and flow of steroid hormones.</p>

                <p>The presence of valence coding neurons in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) that form distinct projections to other brain regions implies functional opposition between aversion and reward during learning. However, evidence for opponent interactions in fear learning is sparse and may only be apparent under certain conditions. Here we test this possibility by studying the roles of the BLA-&gt;central amygdala (CeA) and BLA-&gt;nucleus accumbens (Acb) pathways in fear learning in male rats. First, we assessed the organization of these pathways in the rat brain. BLA-&gt;CeA and BLA-&gt;Acb pathways were largely segregated in the BLA but shared overlapping molecular profiles. Then we assessed activity of the BLA-&gt;CeA and BLA-&gt;Acb pathways during two different forms of fear learning&mdash;fear learning in a neutral context and fear learning in a reward context. BLA-&gt;CeA neurons were robustly recruited by footshock regardless of where fear learning occurred, whereas recruitment of BLA-&gt;Acb neurons was state-dependent because footshock only recruited this pathway in a reward context. Finally, we assessed the causal roles of activity in these pathways in fear learning. Photoinhibition of the BLA-&gt;CeA pathway during the footshock US impaired fear learning, regardless of where fear learning occurred. In contrast, photoinhibition of the BLA-&gt;Acb pathway augmented fear learning, but only in the reward context. Taken together, our findings show circuit- and state-dependent opponent processing of fear. Footshock activity in the BLA-&gt;Acb pathway limits how much fear is learned.</p>

                <p>Ribbon synapses of inner hair cells (IHCs) are uniquely designed for ultrafast and indefatigable neurotransmission of the sound. The molecular machinery ensuring the efficient, compensatory recycling of the synaptic vesicles (SVs), however, remains elusive. This study showed that hair cell knock-out of murine <I>Dmxl2</I>, whose human homolog is responsible for nonsyndromic sensorineural hearing loss DFNA71, resulted in auditory synaptopathy by impairing synaptic endocytosis and recycling. The mutant mice in the C57BL/6J background of either sex had mild hearing loss with severely diminished wave I amplitude of the auditory brainstem response. Membrane capacitance measurements of the IHCs revealed deficiency in sustained synaptic exocytosis and endocytic membrane retrieval. Consistent with the electrophysiological findings, 3D electron microscopy reconstruction showed reduced reserve pool of SVs and endocytic compartments, while the membrane-proximal and ribbon-associated vesicles remain intact. Our results propose an important role of DMXL2 in hair cell endocytosis and recycling of the SVs.</p>

                <p>The role of experience in the development and maintenance of emergent network properties such as cortical oscillations and states is poorly understood. To define how early-life experience affects cortical dynamics in the visual cortex of adult, head-fixed mice, we examined the effects of two forms of blindness initiated before eye opening and continuing through recording: (1) bilateral loss of retinal input (enucleation) and (2) degradation of visual input (eyelid suture). Neither form of deprivation fundamentally altered the state-dependent regulation of firing rates or local field potentials. However, each deprivation caused unique changes in network behavior. Laminar analysis revealed two different generative mechanisms for low-frequency synchronization: one prevalent during movement and the other during quiet wakefulness. The former was absent in enucleated mice, suggesting a mouse homolog of human alpha oscillations. In addition, neurons in enucleated animals were less correlated and fired more regularly, but no change in mean firing rate. Eyelid suture decreased firing rates during quiet wakefulness, but not during movement, with no effect on neural correlations or regularity. Sutured animals showed a broadband increase in depth EEG power and an increased occurrence, but reduced central frequency, of narrowband gamma oscillations. The complementary&mdash;rather than additive&mdash;effects of lid suture and enucleation suggest that the development of emergent network properties does not require vision but is plastic to modified input. Our results suggest a complex interaction of internal set points and experience determines mature cortical activity, with low-frequency synchronization being particularly susceptible to early deprivation.</p>

                <p>People parse continuous experiences at natural breakpoints called event boundaries, which is important for understanding an environment's causal structure and for responding to uncertainty within it. However, it remains unclear how different forms of uncertainty affect the parsing of continuous experiences and how such uncertainty influences the brain's processing of ongoing events. We exposed human participants of both sexes (<I>N</I> = 34) to a continuous sequence of semantically meaningless images. We generated sequences from random walks through a graph that grouped images into temporal communities. After learning, we asked participants to segment another sequence at natural breakpoints (event boundaries). Participants segmented the sequence at learned transitions between communities, as well as at novel transitions, suggesting that people can segment temporally extended experiences into events based on learned structure as well as prediction error. Greater segmentation at novel boundaries was associated with enhanced parietal scalp electroencephalography (EEG) activity between 250 and 450&nbsp;ms after the stimulus onset. Multivariate classification of EEG activity showed that novel and learned boundaries evoked distinct patterns of neural activity, particularly theta band power in posterior electrodes. Learning also led to distinct neural representations for stimuli within the temporal communities, while neural activity at learned boundary nodes showed predictive evidence for the adjacent community. The data show that people segment experiences at both learned and novel boundaries and suggest that learned event boundaries trigger retrieval of information about the upcoming community that could underlie anticipation of the next event in a sequence.</p>

                <p>Spike-and-wave discharges (SWDs) and sleep spindles are characteristic electroencephalographic (EEG) hallmarks of absence seizures and nonrapid eye movement sleep, respectively. They are commonly generated by the cortico&ndash;thalamo&ndash;cortical network including the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN). It has been reported that SWD development is accompanied by a decrease in sleep spindle density in absence seizure patients and animal models. However, whether the decrease in sleep spindle density precedes, coincides with, or follows, the SWD development remains unknown. To clarify this, we exploited <I>Pvalb</I>-tetracycline transactivator (tTA)::tetO-ArchT (PV-ArchT) double-transgenic mouse, which can induce an absence seizure phenotype in a time-controllable manner by expressing ArchT in PV neurons of the TRN. In these mice, EEG recordings demonstrated that a decrease in sleep spindle density occurred 1&nbsp;week before the onset of typical SWDs, with the expression of ArchT. To confirm such temporal relationship observed in these genetic model mice, we used a gamma-butyrolactone (GBL) pharmacological model of SWDs. Prior to GBL administration, we administered caffeine to wild-type mice for 3 consecutive days to induce a decrease in sleep spindle density. We then administered low-dose GBL, which cannot induce SWDs in normally conditioned mice but led to the occurrence of SWDs in caffeine-conditioned mice. These findings indicate a temporal relationship in which the decrease in sleep spindle density consistently precedes SWD development. Furthermore, the decrease in sleep spindle activity may have a role in facilitating the development of SWDs. Our findings suggest that sleep spindle reductions could serve as early indicators of seizure susceptibility.</p>

                <p>Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a family of genetically heterogeneous diseases still without a cure. Despite the causative genetic mutation typically not expressed in cone photoreceptors, these cells inevitably degenerate following the primary death of rods, causing blindness. The reasons for the "bystander" degeneration of cones are presently unknown but decrement of survival factors, oxidative stress, and inflammation all play a role. Targeting these generalized biological processes represents a strategy to develop mutation-agnostic therapies for saving vision in large populations of RP individuals. A classical method to support neuronal survival is by employing neurotrophic factors, such as NGF. This study uses painless human NGF (hNGFp), a TrkA receptor-biased variant of the native molecule with lower affinity for nociceptors and limited activity as a pain inducer; the molecule has identical neurotrophic power of the native form but a reduced affinity for the p75NTR receptors, known to trigger apoptosis. hNGFp has a recognized activity on brain microglial cells, which are induced to a phenotype switch from a highly activated to a more homeostatic configuration. hNGFp was administered to RP-like mice in vivo with the aim of decreasing retinal inflammation and also providing retinal neuroprotection. However, the ability of this treatment to counteract the bystander degeneration of cones remained limited.</p>

Viruses of microbes are ubiquitous biological entities that reprogram their hosts’ metabolisms during infection in order to produce viral progeny, impacting the ecology and evolution of microbiomes with broad implications for human and environmental health. Advances in genome sequencing have led to the discovery of millions of novel viruses and an appreciation for the great diversity of viruses on Earth. Yet, with knowledge of only <i>“who is there</i>?<i>”</i> we fall short in our ability to infer the impacts of viruses on microbes at population, community, and ecosystem-scales. To do this, we need a more explicit understanding <i>“who do they infect</i>?<i>”</i> Here, we developed a novel machine learning model (ML), Virus-Host Interaction Predictor (VHIP), to predict virus-host interactions (infection/non-infection) from input virus and host genomes. This ML model was trained and tested on a high-value manually curated set of 8849 virus-host pairs and their corresponding sequence data. The resulting dataset, ‘Virus Host Range network’ (VHRnet), is core to VHIP functionality. Each data point that underlies the VHIP training and testing represents a lab-tested virus-host pair in VHRnet, from which meaningful signals of viral adaptation to host were computed from genomic sequences. VHIP departs from existing virus-host prediction models in its ability to predict multiple interactions rather than predicting a single most likely host or host clade. As a result, VHIP is able to infer the complexity of virus-host networks in natural systems. VHIP has an 87.8% accuracy rate at predicting interactions between virus-host pairs at the species level and can be applied to novel viral and host population genomes reconstructed from metagenomic datasets.

Malaria is a global and deadly human disease caused by the apicomplexan parasites of the genus <i>Plasmodium</i>. Parasite proliferation within human red blood cells (RBCs) is associated with the clinical manifestations of the disease. This asexual expansion within human RBCs begins with the invasion of RBCs by <i>P</i>. <i>falciparum</i>, which is mediated by the secretion of effectors from 2 specialized club-shaped secretory organelles in merozoite-stage parasites known as rhoptries. We investigated the function of the Rhoptry Neck Protein 11 (RON11), which contains 7 transmembrane domains and calcium-binding EF-hand domains. We generated conditional mutants of the <i>P</i>. <i>falciparum</i> RON11. Knockdown of RON11 inhibits parasite growth by preventing merozoite invasion. The loss of RON11 did not lead to any defects in processing of rhoptry proteins but instead led to a decrease in the amount of rhoptry proteins. We utilized ultrastructure expansion microscopy (U-ExM) to determine the effect of RON11 knockdown on rhoptry biogenesis. Surprisingly, in the absence of RON11, fully developed merozoites had only 1 rhoptry each. The single rhoptry in RON11-deficient merozoites were morphologically typical with a bulb and a neck oriented into the apical polar ring. Moreover, rhoptry proteins are trafficked accurately to the single rhoptry in RON11-deficient parasites. These data show that in the absence of RON11, the first rhoptry is generated during schizogony but upon the start of cytokinesis, the second rhoptry never forms. Interestingly, these single-rhoptry merozoites were able to attach to host RBCs but are unable to invade RBCs. Instead, RON11-deficient merozoites continue to engage with RBC for prolonged periods eventually resulting in echinocytosis, a result of secreting the contents from the single rhoptry into the RBC. Together, our data show that RON11 triggers the de novo biogenesis of the second rhoptry and functions in RBC invasion.

                <p>by Tianyuan Lei, Xuhong Liao, Xinyuan Liang, Lianglong Sun, Mingrui Xia, Yunman Xia, Tengda Zhao, Xiaodan Chen, Weiwei Men, Yanpei Wang, Leilei Ma, Ningyu Liu, Jing Lu, Gai Zhao, Yuyin Ding, Yao Deng, Jiali Wang, Rui Chen, Haibo Zhang, Shuping Tan, Jia-Hong Gao, Shaozheng Qin, Sha Tao, Qi Dong, Yong He</p>

The modular structure of functional connectomes in the human brain undergoes substantial reorganization during development. However, previous studies have implicitly assumed that each region participates in one single module, ignoring the potential spatial overlap between modules. How the overlapping functional modules develop and whether this development is related to gray and white matter features remain unknown. Using longitudinal multimodal structural, functional, and diffusion MRI data from 305 children (aged 6 to 14 years), we investigated the maturation of overlapping modules of functional networks and further revealed their structural associations. An edge-centric network model was used to identify the overlapping modules, and the nodal overlap in module affiliations was quantified using the entropy measure. We showed a regionally heterogeneous spatial topography of the overlapping extent of brain nodes in module affiliations in children, with higher entropy (i.e., more module involvement) in the ventral attention, somatomotor, and subcortical regions and lower entropy (i.e., less module involvement) in the visual and default-mode regions. The overlapping modules developed in a linear, spatially dissociable manner, with decreased entropy (i.e., decreased module involvement) in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, ventral prefrontal cortex, and putamen and increased entropy (i.e., increased module involvement) in the parietal lobules and lateral prefrontal cortex. The overlapping modular patterns captured individual brain maturity as characterized by chronological age and were predicted by integrating gray matter morphology and white matter microstructural properties. Our findings highlight the maturation of overlapping functional modules and their structural substrates, thereby advancing our understanding of the principles of connectome development.

                Background: Physical therapy (PT) services can be essential for recovery from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. Maintaining an efficient healthcare service is achieved by ensuring the safety of a well-informed healthcare practitioner. This study aimed to assess the sources of knowledge, attitude, experience, and accessibility to the personal protective equipment (PPE) of the physical therapists working in Saudi Arabia. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted to survey on-duty PT practitioners using a web-based questionnaire. Licensed PT practitioners were invited to participate, and a sample of 424 therapists responded. The questionnaire comprised of 22 questions covering the demographic data and the following domains: sources of knowledge regarding the pandemic, experience, and attitude of the therapists during the pandemic, and accessibility to the PPE. Results: Around 83% of the participants (352) completed all the survey questions. Governmental websites were the most used source of knowledge (39%). Hand sanitization was implemented by the majority of participants (81%). Participants, mainly males and experienced therapist, were willing to treat COVID-19 patients. The COVID-19 complications of prolonged ventilation and immobilization were successfully treated by 91.2% of participants who treated positive cases. About a third of the participants were part of COVID-19 management planning teams or received training to deal with the pandemic. Most of the necessary PPE was adequately accessible during the pandemic. Conclusions: Therapists implemented the recommended hygienic practices and had no problems accessing the necessary PPE. More efforts should target therapists’ education about the social media misleading information and involving the therapists in the pandemic management planning teams.

                Background The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) had led to a global pandemic since December 2019. SARS-CoV-2 is a single-stranded RNA virus, which mutates at a higher rate. Multiple works had been done to study nonsynonymous mutations, which change protein sequences. However, there is little study on the effects of SARS-CoV-2 synonymous mutations, which may affect viral fitness. This study aims to predict the effect of synonymous mutations on the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Methods A total of 26645 SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences retrieved from Global Initiative on Sharing all Influenza Data (GISAID) database were aligned using MAFFT. Then, the mutations and their respective frequency were identified. Multiple RNA secondary structures prediction tools, namely RNAfold, IPknot++ and MXfold2 were applied to predict the effect of the mutations on RNA secondary structure and their base pair probabilities was estimated using MutaRNA. Relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) analysis was also performed to measure the codon usage bias (CUB) of SARS-CoV-2. Results A total of 150 synonymous mutations were identified. The synonymous mutation identified with the highest frequency is C3037U mutation in the nsp3 of ORF1a. Of these top 10 highest frequency synonymous mutations, C913U, C3037U, U16176C and C18877U mutants show pronounced changes between wild type and mutant in all 3 RNA secondary structure prediction tools, suggesting these mutations may have some biological impact on viral fitness. These four mutations show changes in base pair probabilities. All mutations except U16176C change the codon to a more preferred codon, which may result in higher translation efficiency. Conclusion Synonymous mutations in SARS-CoV-2 genome may affect RNA secondary structure, changing base pair probabilities and possibly resulting in a higher translation rate. However, lab experiments are required to validate the results obtained from prediction analysis.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The cerebral cortex accounts for substantial energy expenditure, primarily driven by the metabolic demands of synaptic signaling. Mitochondria, the organelles responsible for generating cellular energy, play a crucial role in this process. We investigated ultrastructural characteristics of the primary visual cortex in 18 phylogenetically diverse mammals, spanning a broad range of brain sizes from mouse to elephant. Our findings reveal remarkable uniformity in synapse density, postsynaptic density (PSD) length, and mitochondria density, indicating functional and metabolic constraints that maintain these fundamental features. Notably, we observed an average of 1.9 mitochondria per synapse across mammalian species. When considered together with the trend of decreasing neuron density with larger brain size, we find that brain enlargement in mammals is characterized by increasing proportions of synapses and mitochondria per cortical neuron. These results shed light on the adaptive mechanisms and metabolic dynamics that govern cortical ultrastructure across mammals.</p>

                Background The Indonesian government built the Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) in Jakarta to reduce traffic congestion and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. The objective of this study is to estimate the CO2 emissions reductions from switching from private transport to MRT by using a methodology proposed by the United Nations Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) for developing countries, namely the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) methodology, which generates Certified Emission Reductions (CERs). This methodology is more comprehensive than other available methodologies. However, this method has not been widely used to calculate greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions in mass transit projects because it is complex enough to require a lot of data based on primary surveys. Therefore, this research simplifies the CDM formula to make it easier and applicable in Indonesia. Methods The primary data were collected using a questionnaire distributed to 480 MRT Jakarta Phase 1 user respondents in September 2019 (baseline); the secondary data were obtained from The MRT Jakarta. The data were processed using IBM SPSS Statistics 27. The simplified Clean Development Mechanism Approved Consolidated Methodology 0016 (CDM ACM 0016) was the analysis method used. Result The results of this study indicate that 53.75% of MRT Jakarta Phase 1 users are shifting from private transportation, which has reduced CO2 emissions by 2,732.7 tons in 2019 and 6,043.9 tons in 2023. Increasing the number of MRT passengers who switch from private transportation will further reduce CO2 emissions. Conclusion and implications The simplified CDM ACM 0016 formula may be suitable for use in Indonesia. This would enable the measurement of CO2 emission reductions through mitigation actions through MRT development to be certified by the UNFCCC. Applying this method in calculating CO2 emission reductions, implementing strategies to increase MRT passengers, and using renewable energy electricity sources would increase CO2 emission reductions.

                Introduction The emotional impact of patient loss in oncology and palliative care profoundly affects healthcare professionals. This study explores clinicians’ experiences, emotional reactions, and coping mechanisms in these fields, focusing on their professional and personal growth. It aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how healthcare professionals from different regions and with varying years of experience deal with patient loss, emphasizing cultural, social, and institutional influences on their coping strategies. Methods A mixed-methods approach combined qualitative and quantitative elements. Data were collected using a Microsoft® Forms© survey targeting oncology and palliative care healthcare professionals. The survey included questions on experiences with patient loss, coping strategies, personal and professional growth, and beliefs. Statistical methods and thematic analysis were used to analyse quantitative and qualitative data. Ethical approval was obtained, and the survey ensured participant anonymity and confidentiality. Results The survey received 125 responses from nineteen countries. Emotional reactions to patient loss were significant, with various coping strategies reported, including spiritual practices, self-care, and professional support groups. Personal and professional growth were key outcomes of dealing with patient loss. Themes like Emotional Impact, Coping Mechanisms, and Reflections on Death and Dying were prevalent. Analysis revealed no significant correlation between the time taken by the participants to complete the survey and years of healthcare experience. Conclusion Healthcare professionals in oncology and palliative care face significant emotional challenges due to patient loss. The study emphasizes the importance of diverse and effective coping mechanisms, the supportive role of personal beliefs and workplace environments, and the journey of personal and professional growth amidst these challenges. It highlights the resilience of healthcare workers and underscores the need for supportive systems in managing the emotional aspects of patient care.

These daily variations could profoundly impact neuronal physiology because of capacitance’s influence on the membrane time constant. Consistent with this, the authors show strong changes in synaptic integration.

                Pumilio RNA-binding proteins are developmentally downregulated in the brain. Randolph et al. report that the simultaneous downregulation of Pumilio 1 and 2 promotes synapse maturation and increases the density of excitatory and inhibitory synapses. Thus, the regulation of Pumilio protein levels represents a cell-intrinsic mechanism for the modulation of synapse maturation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94631">OVO positively regulates essential maternal pathways by binding near the transcriptional start sites in the Drosophila female germline</a></h4>

              
                Differentiation of female germline stem cells into a mature oocyte includes the expression of RNAs and proteins that drive early embryonic development in <i>Drosophila</i>. We have little insight into what activates the expression of these maternal factors. One candidate is the zinc-finger protein OVO. OVO is required for female germline viability and has been shown to positively regulate its own expression, as well as a downstream target, <i>ovarian tumor</i>, by binding to the transcriptional start site (TSS). To find additional OVO targets in the female germline and further elucidate OVO’s role in oocyte development, we performed ChIP-seq to determine genome-wide OVO occupancy, as well as RNA-seq comparing hypomorphic and wild type rescue <i>ovo</i> alleles. OVO preferentially binds in close proximity to target TSSs genome-wide, is associated with open chromatin, transcriptionally active histone marks, and OVO-dependent expression. Motif enrichment analysis on OVO ChIP peaks identified a 5’-TAACNGT-3’ OVO DNA binding motif spatially enriched near TSSs. However, the OVO DNA binding motif does not exhibit precise motif spacing relative to the TSS characteristic of RNA polymerase II complex binding core promoter elements. Integrated genomics analysis showed that 525 genes that are bound and increase in expression downstream of OVO are known to be essential maternally expressed genes. These include genes involved in anterior/posterior/germ plasm specification (<i>bcd, exu, swa, osk, nos, aub, pgc, gcl</i>), egg activation (<i>png, plu, gnu, wisp, C(3)g, mtrm</i>), translational regulation (<i>cup</i>, <i>orb</i>, <i>bru1, me31B</i>), and vitelline membrane formation (<i>fs(1)N</i>, <i>fs(1)M3</i>, <i>clos</i>). This suggests that OVO is a master transcriptional regulator of oocyte development and is responsible for the expression of structural components of the egg as well as maternally provided RNAs that are required for early embryonic development.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96790">The common Sting1 HAQ, AQ alleles rescue CD4 T cellpenia, restore T-regs, and prevent SAVI (N153S) inflammatory disease in mice</a></h4>

              
                The significance of <i>STING1</i> gene in tissue inflammation and cancer immunotherapy has been increasingly recognized. Intriguingly, common human <i>STING1</i> alleles R71H-G230A-R293Q (<i>HAQ</i>) and G230A-R293Q (<i>AQ</i>) are carried by ~60% of East Asians and ~40% of Africans, respectively. Here, we examine the modulatory effects of <i>HAQ, AQ</i> alleles on STING-associated vasculopathy with onset in infancy (SAVI), an autosomal dominant, fatal inflammatory disease caused by gain-of-function human <i>STING1</i> mutations. CD4 T cellpenia is evident in SAVI patients and mouse models. Using <i>Sting1</i> knock-in mice expressing common human <i>STING1</i> alleles <i>HAQ</i>, <i>AQ</i>, and <i>Q293</i>, we found that <i>HAQ, AQ</i>, and <i>Q293</i> splenocytes resist STING1-mediated cell death ex vivo, establishing a critical role of STING1 residue 293 in cell death. The <i>HAQ/SAVI(N153S</i>) and <i>AQ/SAVI(N153S</i>) mice did not have CD4 T cellpenia. The <i>HAQ/SAVI(N153S), AQ/SAVI(N153S</i>) mice have more (~10-fold, ~20-fold, respectively) T-regs than <i>WT/SAVI(N153S</i>) mice. Remarkably, while they have comparable TBK1, IRF3, and NFκB activation as the <i>WT/SAVI</i>, the <i>AQ/SAVI</i> mice have no tissue inflammation, regular body weight, and normal lifespan. We propose that STING1 activation promotes tissue inflammation by depleting T-regs cells in vivo. Billions of modern humans have the dominant <i>HAQ, AQ</i> alleles. STING1 research and STING1-targeting immunotherapy should consider <i>STING1</i> heterogeneity in humans.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88412">Ca2+ channel and active zone protein abundance intersects with input-specific synapse organization to shape functional synaptic diversity</a></h4>

              
                Synaptic heterogeneity is a hallmark of nervous systems that enables complex and adaptable communication in neural circuits. To understand circuit function, it is thus critical to determine the factors that contribute to the functional diversity of synapses. We investigated the contributions of voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) abundance, spatial organization, and subunit composition to synapse diversity among and between synapses formed by two closely related <i>Drosophila</i> glutamatergic motor neurons with distinct neurotransmitter release probabilities (P<sub>r</sub>). Surprisingly, VGCC levels are highly predictive of heterogeneous P<sub>r</sub> among individual synapses of either low- or high-P<sub>r</sub> inputs, but not between inputs. We find that the same number of VGCCs are more densely organized at high-P<sub>r</sub> synapses, consistent with tighter VGCC-synaptic vesicle coupling. We generated endogenously tagged lines to investigate VGCC subunits in vivo and found that the α2δ–3 subunit Straightjacket along with the CAST/ELKS active zone (AZ) protein Bruchpilot, both key regulators of VGCCs, are less abundant at high-P<sub>r</sub> inputs, yet positively correlate with P<sub>r</sub> among synapses formed by either input. Consistently, both Straightjacket and Bruchpilot levels are dynamically increased across AZs of both inputs when neurotransmitter release is potentiated to maintain stable communication following glutamate receptor inhibition. Together, these findings suggest a model in which VGCC and AZ protein abundance intersects with input-specific spatial and molecular organization to shape the functional diversity of synapses.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97018">Does bumblebee preference of continuous over interrupted strings in string-pulling tasks indicate means-end comprehension?</a></h4>

              
                Bumblebees (<i>Bombus terrestris</i>) have been shown to engage in string-pulling behavior to access rewards. The objective of this study was to elucidate whether bumblebees display means-end comprehension in a string-pulling task. We presented bumblebees with two options: one where a string was connected to an artificial flower containing a reward and the other presenting an interrupted string. Bumblebees displayed a consistent preference for pulling connected strings over interrupted ones after training with a stepwise pulling technique. When exposed to novel string colors, bees continued to exhibit a bias towards pulling the connected string. This suggests that bumblebees engage in featural generalization of the visual display of the string connected to the flower in this task. If the view of the string connected to the flower was restricted during the training phase, the proportion of bumblebees choosing the connected strings significantly decreased. Similarly, when the bumblebees were confronted with coiled connected strings during the testing phase, they failed to identify and reject the interrupted strings. This finding underscores the significance of visual consistency in enabling the bumblebees to perform the task successfully. Our results suggest that bumblebees’ ability to distinguish between continuous strings and interrupted strings relies on a combination of image matching and associative learning, rather than means-end understanding. These insights contribute to a deeper understanding of the cognitive processes employed by bumblebees when tackling complex spatial tasks.

">Lateral prefrontal cortex controls interplay between working memory and actions</a></h4>

              
                Humans must often keep multiple task goals in mind, at different levels of priority and immediacy, while also interacting with the environment. We might need to remember information for an upcoming task while engaged in more immediate actions. Consequently, actively maintained working memory (WM) content may bleed into ongoing but unrelated motor behavior. Here, we experimentally test the impact of WM maintenance on action execution, and we transcranially stimulate lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) to parse its functional contributions to WM-motor interactions. We first created a task scenario wherein human participants (both sexes) executed cued hand movements during WM maintenance. We manipulated the compatibility between WM and movement goals at the trial level and the statistical likelihood that the two would be compatible at the block level. We found that remembering directional words (e.g., "left", "down") biased the trajectory and speed of hand movements that occurred during the WM delay, but the bias was dampened in blocks when WM content predictably conflicted with movement goals. Then we targeted left lateral PFC with two different transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) protocols before participants completed the task. We found that an intermittent theta-burst protocol, which is thought to be excitatory, dampened sensitivity to block-level control demands (i.e., proactive control), while a continuous theta-burst protocol, which is thought to be inhibitory, dampened adaptation to trial-by-trial conflict (i.e., reactive control). Therefore, lateral PFC is involved in controlling the interplay between WM content and manual action, but different PFC mechanisms may support different time-scales of adaptive control.

                Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a complex neurodegenerative disease characterized by heterogeneous progression patterns. Traditional clinical measures like the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) inadequately capture the full spectrum of disease progression, highlighting the need for advanced Disease Progression Modeling (DPM) approaches.This study harnesses cutting-edge neuroimaging and deep learning techniques to investigate deviations in subcortical volumes in MS patients. We analyze T1-weighted and Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data using advanced DL segmentation models, SynthSeg+ and SynthSeg-WMH, which address the challenges of conventional methods in the presence of white matter lesions. By comparing subcortical volumes of 326 MS patients to a normative model from 37,407 healthy individuals, we identify significant deviations that enhance our understanding of MS progression. This study highlights the potential of integrating DL with normative modeling to refine MS progression characterization, automate informative MRI contrasts, and contribute to data-driven DPM in neurodegenerative diseases.

">Precision-dependent modulation of social attention</a></h4>

              
                Social attention, guided by cues like gaze direction, is crucial for effective social interactions. However, how dynamic environmental context modulates this process remains unclear. Integrating a hierarchical Bayesian model with fMRI, this study investigated how individuals adjusted attention based on the predictions about cue validity (CV). Thirty-three participants performed a modified Posner location-cueing task with varying CV. Behaviorally, individuals' allocation of social attention was finely tuned to the precision (inverse variance) of CV predictions, with the predictions being updated by precision-weighted prediction errors (PEs) about the occurrence of target locations. Neuroimaging results revealed that the interaction between allocation of social attention and CV influenced activity in regions involved in spatial attention and/or social perception, such as the temporoparietal junction (TPJ), frontal eye field (FEF), superior temporal sulcus (STS), and inferior parietal sulcus (IPS). Precision-weighted PEs about target locations specifically modulated activity in the TPJ, STS, and primary visual cortex (V1), underscoring their roles in refining attentional predictions. Dynamic causal modeling (DCM) further demonstrated that enhanced absolute precision-weighted PEs about target locations strengthened the effective connectivity from V1 and STS to TPJ, emphasizing their roles in conveying residual error signals from low-level sensory areas to high-level critical attention areas. These findings elucidated how the precision of contextual predictions dynamically modulated social attention, offering insights into the computational and neurocognitive mechanisms of context-dependent social attention.

                Neural hyper-excitability and network dysfunction are neurophysiological hallmarks of Alzheimer disease (AD) in animal studies, but their presence and clinical relevance in humans remain poorly understood. We introduce a novel perturbation-based approach combining transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroencephalography (TMS-EEG), alongside resting-state EEG (rsEEG), to investigate neurophysiological basis of default mode network (DMN) dysfunction in early AD. While rsEEG revealed global neural slowing and disrupted synchrony, these measures reflected widespread changes in brain neurophysiology without network-specific insights. In contrast, TMS-EEG identified network-specific local hyper-excitability in the parietal DMN and disrupted connectivity with frontal DMN regions, which uniquely predicted distinct cognitive impairments and mediated the link between structural brain integrity and cognition. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into how network-specific neurophysiological disruptions contribute to AD-related cognitive dysfunction. Perturbation-based assessments hold promise as novel markers of early detection, disease progression, and target engagement for disease-modifying therapies aiming to restore abnormal neurophysiology in AD.

">Off-Equilibrium Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem Paves the Way in Alzheimer's Disease Research</a></h4>

              
                INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive cognitive decline. Although traditional methods have provided insights into brain dynamics in AD, they have limitations in capturing non-equilibrium dynamics across disease stages. Recent studies suggest that dynamic functional connectivity in resting-state networks (RSNs) may serve as a biomarker for AD, but the role of deviations from dynamical equilibrium remains underexplored. OBJECTIVE: This study applies the off-equilibrium fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT) [Monti2024] to analyze brain dynamics in AD, aiming to compare deviations from equilibrium in healthy controls, patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and those with AD. The goal is to identify potential biomarkers for early AD detection and understand disease progression's mechanisms. METHODS: We employed a model-free approach based on FDT to analyze functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, including healthy controls, MCI patients, and AD patients. Deviations from equilibrium in resting-state brain activity were quantified using fMRI scans. In addition, we performed model-based simulations incorporating Amyloid-Beta (ABeta), tau burdens, and Generative Effective Connectivity (GEC) for each subject. RESULTS: Our findings show that deviations from equilibrium increase during the MCI stage, indicating hyperexcitability, followed by a significant decline in later stages of AD, reflecting neuronal damage. Model-based simulations incorporating ABeta and tau burdens closely replicated these dynamics, especially in AD patients, highlighting their role in disease progression. Healthy controls exhibited lower deviations, while AD patients showed the most significant disruptions in brain dynamics. DISCUSSION: The study demonstrates that the off-equilibrium FDT framework can accurately characterize brain dynamics in AD, providing a potential biomarker for early detection. The increase in non-equilibrium deviations during the MCI stage followed by their decline in AD offers a mechanistic explanation for disease progression. Future research should explore how combining this framework with other dynamic brain measures could further refine diagnostic tools and therapeutic strategies for AD and other neurodegenerative diseases.

                Objective: Drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) poses significant challenges in treatment and management. While seizure-related alterations in peripheral immune players are increasingly recognized, the involvement of the complement system, central to immune function, remains insufficiently explored in DRE. This study aimed to investigate the levels of complement system components and their association with cytokine profiles in patients with DRE. Methods: We analyzed serum samples from DRE patients (n = 46) and age- and sex-matched healthy controls (n = 45). Complement components and cytokines were quantified using Multi- and Single-plex ELISA. Statistical analyses examined relationships between complement molecules, cytokines, and clinical outcomes including epilepsy duration, Full-Scale Intelligence Quotient (FSIQ) scores, and age. Results: We found common alterations in all DRE cases, including significant complement deficiencies (C1q, Factor H, C4, C4b, C3, and C3b/iC3b) and detectable bFGF levels. DRE females showed significantly lower levels of TNF- and IL-8 compared to healthy females. In DRE males, we observed a trend towards elevated CCL2 and CCL5 levels compared to healthy males. These findings suggest potential sex-dimorphism in immune profiles. Our analysis also indicated associations between specific complement and inflammatory markers (C2, IL-8, and IL-9) and Full-Scale Intelligence Quotient (FSIQ) scores in DRE patients. Interpretation: Our study reveals sex-specific peripheral complement deficiencies and cytokine dysregulation in DRE patients, indicating an underlying immune system vulnerability. These findings provide new insights into DRE mechanisms, potentially guiding future research on complement and cytokine signaling towards personalized treatments for DRE patients.

	<p>Parkinsonian syndromes are considered clinicopathological conditions that are challenging to diagnose. Molecular imaging with [18F]-FDOPA and [18F]-FDG contributes to a more accurate clinical diagnosis by evaluating presynaptic dopaminergic pathways and glucose metabolism, respectively. The aim of this study was to correlate diagnoses made from dual PET/CT with the initial clinical diagnoses, as well as during follow-ups in patients with Parkinsonian syndromes. A secondary objective was to describe the imaging findings. Methods: A total of 150 patients with a clinical diagnosis of neurodegenerative Parkinsonism were evaluated using dual PET/CT. Clinically, 82% were diagnosed with PD, while the remaining 18% had an atypical Parkinsonism. Results: Using dual PET/CT, the most frequent diagnosis was PD in 67% of the patients, with the rest being diagnosed with an atypical Parkinsonism. In an agreement analysis between the initial clinical diagnosis and the imaging diagnosis by dual PET/CT, a concordance of 94.1% (n = 95) was observed for PD. In the remaining patients, the clinical diagnosis differed from that suggested by dual PET/CT, with atypical Parkinsonian syndromes being diagnosed as DLB in 40% (n = 4), PSP in 46.7% (n = 7), MSA-C in 75% (n = 6), MSA-P in 70% (n = 7), and CBD in 66.7% (n = 4). A total of 38.66% (n = 58) of patients were followed up (median follow-up of 27 months), with a Kappa coefficient of 0.591 (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), suggesting substantial agreement. Conclusions: Dual FDOPA&amp;amp;ndash;FDG PET/CT demonstrated moderate agreement with the initial clinical diagnosis of Parkinsonism and moderate to substantial agreement during follow-up. This dual technique, therefore, stands out in differentiating between types of Parkinsonisms.</p>

	<p>Background: Sleep disturbances are a prevalent phenomenon in patients with multiple sclerosis (PwMS). The present study employs polysomnography (PSG) to quantify sleep efficiency and architecture in PwMS, aiming to elucidate the relationships between PSG parameters and factors including gender, disability level, brain lesion location, and subjective measures of insomnia, excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), fatigue, pain, and mood disorders. Methods: The study cohort comprised 51 adult PwMS, of whom 31 underwent overnight PSG. The demographic and clinical characteristics, including age, gender, and Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), were collated. The Athens Insomnia Scale, the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, the Fatigue Severity Scale, the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS), the Numerical Pain Rating Scale, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale were employed for the assessment of insomnia, EDS, fatigue, pain, and mood disorders. The brain and spinal cord magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were evaluated. Results: A reduced sleep efficiency was observed among 30 PwMS (aged 38.9 &amp;amp;plusmn; 12.9), with a mean of 80 &amp;amp;plusmn; 12%, especially in those with brainstem demyelinating lesions. In those PwMS aberrant sleep onset latency (SOL) and wake after sleep onset were also noted (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). The prevalence of sleep fragmentation, as measured by the total arousal index, was greater in male PwMS than in female (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Higher disability according to the EDSS correlated with longer SOL (&amp;amp;rho; = 0.48, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05), and reduced N2 sleep stage correlated with cognitive fatigue according to MFIS (&amp;amp;rho; = &amp;amp;minus;0.46, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Age, disease duration, insomnia, EDS, physical fatigue, and mood disorders did not impact PSG parameters. Conclusions: The study demonstrated the disruption of sleep architecture in PwMS, and highlighted the importance of a comprehensive PSG assessment of sleep disturbances in this population.</p>

	<p>Background: Selective attention declines with age, due to age-related functional changes in dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC). Real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rtfMRI) neurofeedback has been used in young adults to train volitional control of brain activity, including in dACC. Methods: For the first time, this study used rtfMRI neurofeedback to train 19 young and 27 older adults in volitional up- or down-regulation of bilateral dACC during a selective attention task. Results: Older participants in the up-regulation condition (experimental group) showed greater reward points and dACC BOLD signal across training sessions, reflective of neurofeedback training success; and faster reaction time and better response accuracy, suggesting behavioral benefits on selective attention. These effects were not observed for older participants in the down-regulation condition (inverse condition control group), supporting specificity of volitional dACC up-regulation training in older adults. These effects were, unexpectedly, also not observed for young participants in the up-regulation condition (age control group), perhaps due to a lack of motivation to continue the training. Conclusions: These findings provide promising first evidence of functional plasticity in dACC in late life via rtfMRI neurofeedback up-regulation training, enhancing selective attention, and demonstrate proof of concept of rtfMRI neurofeedback training in cognitive aging.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Problematic online gaming and gambling tend to co-occur. The exact mechanisms underlying this phenomenon and the potential effects of gender differences remain unknown. This study aimed to identify the early clustering patterns of problematic online gaming and gambling in a community sample of young adults without a lifetime history of psychiatric treatment. Methods: Data were collected through an online survey and analyzed using partial correlations and Bayesian networks. Results: Altogether, 1441 individuals (aged 18&amp;amp;ndash;40 years, 51.4% females) participated in the survey. Both problematic online behaviors were weakly interrelated, suggesting that they serve as distinct constructs. Men&amp;amp;rsquo;s networks appeared to be more complex and had significantly higher global connectivity. Moreover, men and women differed with respect to the specific nodes that bridged both constructs. In men, the bridge nodes were &amp;amp;ldquo;being criticized because of betting or being told about gambling problems&amp;amp;rdquo;, &amp;amp;ldquo;loss of previous interests due to gaming&amp;amp;rdquo;, &amp;amp;ldquo;deceiving other people because of gaming&amp;amp;rdquo;, and &amp;amp;ldquo;health consequences of gambling&amp;amp;rdquo;. Among women, the bridge nodes were &amp;amp;ldquo;feeling guilty because of gambling&amp;amp;rdquo;, &amp;amp;ldquo;loss of previous interests because of gaming&amp;amp;rdquo;, &amp;amp;ldquo;social consequences of gaming&amp;amp;rdquo;, and &amp;amp;ldquo;continued gaming problems with other people&amp;amp;rdquo;. In men, the strongest edge was found between &amp;amp;ldquo;borrowing money/selling anything to gamble&amp;amp;rdquo; and &amp;amp;ldquo;financial problems because of gambling&amp;amp;rdquo;, while in women, the strongest edge appeared between &amp;amp;ldquo;betting more than afforded to be lost&amp;amp;rdquo; and &amp;amp;ldquo;tolerance symptoms of gambling&amp;amp;rdquo;. Conclusions: The findings indicate that problematic online gaming and gambling tend to emerge in different ways among men and women. Therapeutic interventions should be planned considering gender differences.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Fibromyalgia (FM) is a chronic condition characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, and impaired motor performance. This study aimed to investigate the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) during virtual reality (VR) tasks on the motor performance of women with FM. Methods: Participants were divided into two groups: Group A received active tDCS for 10 days followed by sham tDCS for 10 days, while Group B received the opposite sequence. Both groups performed VR tasks using MoveHero software (v. 2.4) during the tDCS sessions. Motor performance was assessed by the number of hits (movement with correct timing to reach the targets) and absolute (accuracy measure) and variable (precision measure) errors during VR tasks. Participants were 21 women, aged 30&amp;amp;ndash;50 years, and diagnosed with FM. Results: Group A, which received active tDCS first, presented significant improvements in motor performance (number of hits and absolute and variable errors). The benefits of active tDCS persisted into the sham phase, suggesting a lasting neuroplastic effect. Conclusions: tDCS during VR tasks significantly improved motor performance in women with FM, particularly in complex, extensive movements. These findings indicate that tDCS enhances neuroplasticity, leading to sustained motor improvements, making it a promising therapeutic tool in FM rehabilitation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1066/v1?src=rss">Role, function, and expectations of research funding committees: Perspectives from committee members [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Research funding committees play an integral role in the research funding process, consisting of a range of skills, knowledge, and expertise (e.g., professional, and public contributors). Although there is some evidence that has explored the efficiency and effectiveness of funding committees in terms of the funding process, there is a lack of published evidence about the purpose, role, and function of funding committees, from the perspective of committee members. A subset of survey data from a cohort of six National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) research programmes, exploring the purpose of a funding committee, and the expectations and role of a funding committee member between October 2020 to December 2021. All committee members were eligible to participate in the survey. Using an inductive approach, 50 completed responses (22.5% response rate) were analysed, focusing on the role of a funding committee member and the functions of a funding committee. Participants highlighted seven key areas for the purpose of a funding committee: prioritising and recommending what research to fund (n=36) and assessment of quality (n=24) being the most common responses. Four areas were considered important to the expectations and role of funding committee members, with reviewing, critically appraising, and discussing applications (n=44); and being fair, objective, and unbiased (n=27) being the most common responses. The findings offer a unique insight into committee members’ expectations about the role, purpose and function of a funding committee and their contribution to the funding recommendation process. There was high agreement that the purpose and role of committees and their members was to offer expert advice to make fair, impartial decisions on which research should be prioritised. Exploring the purpose, role, and function of funding committees has relevance and importance for funding organisations seeking to enhance and optimise the decision-making practice of funding committees.

                Background The global rise in cases of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) poses a significant health challenge, which is why adult stem cells have gained great importance in recent years, due to their potential to promote the regeneration of the flowcardiac tissue, among which multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) stand out, thanks to their clinical usefulness. Objectives To evaluate the effect of the dose, timing, and route of administration of MSCs on their regenerative capacity after MI. Methods We searched for randomized clinical trials and experimental studies published up to April 25, 2024, in Medline (PubMed) and Scopus. Results Nine clinical studies were included in the qualitative assessment. The main routes of application were coronary, intramyocardially, epicardial topical and systemic venous perfusion, which could have clinical effectiveness with doses of 1x106 MSC/Kg,1 to 3 x 106, 4x106 and those greater than 0.5x106, respectively. The median number of viable cells administered was 2.4x106 (IQR: 1.6-2.4) in the PCI group versus 1.6x106 in the RCVI group (p=0.167). Median ex vivo retention was 2.55% in the RCVI group, 30 days after AMI, and 39.40% in the PCI group. At 4 and 12 months of follow-up, a better left ventricular end-to-end (LVEF) was observed in the group treated with ADSCs, at 4 (51.8% ±5.4% vs. 35.5% ±1.9%) and 8 weeks (52.1%± 3.4% versus 34.2% ±4.7%, p = 0.048). Conclusions The dosing, timing of administration, and routes of administration were important factors to assess the efficacy of the MSC.

                Fondrakö is the local wisdom of the Nias ethnic community and has two functions. First are the oral religious holy book teaching ancestors' values and philosophy. Second is the highest consensus institution of the traditional society formulating and making decisions on the socio-religious law to guarantee the order of the community. This paper explains that social differentiation has happened in the modern era; philosophical values of fondrakö remain to live up to this day and experience the proliferation of rites. The argumentation built through this paper is that primitive culture will not simply disappear in the modern community just because it experiences accommodation and the decrease of emotional intensity into new forms. Social laws of primitive religion are not always contradictory and can run parallel with civilization.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1063/v1?src=rss">“Nothing about us, without us”: A dis/abled depiction of psyche [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the themes of lack, desire, and denial in the realm of disability culture as conceptualized by Dan Goodley. In Disability Studies: An Interdisciplinary Introduction (2011), Goodley re-examines the psychoanalysis of disabled characters, Emphasizing the necessity of a critical approach to psychoanalysis rather than a blind alignment with it. Despite this caution, he investigates potential connections between Lacanian theory and disability studies, acknowledging the current literature on this topic is limited and lacks further development. Nevertheless, the author argues that psychoanalysis is most effective when used to understand the biases and prejudices faced by handicapped individuals in a culture, as well as the unrealistic expectations of extreme rationality and independence in modern society. Method The research juxtaposes the disability portrayals in J.M. Coetzee’s Slow Man, written from an abled author’s perspective, and John Green’s Turtles All the Way Down, written from a disabled author’s perspective. Through meticulous evaluation of these works, the article uncovers how the writers’ individual encounters and viewpoints influence their depiction of disability. Result The analysis uncovers notable disparities in the portrayal of disability in the two works. These disparities are influenced by the authors’ personal experiences and perspectives, highlighting the significant differences in how abled and disabled authors depict disability. Conclusion This approach reveals the significance of having a variety of perspectives in literature, specifically focusing on the influential role of authors with disabilities in establishing disability culture and promoting a nuanced comprehension of disability within society. It promotes a nuanced comprehension of disability within society, underlining the critical role of varied authorial viewpoints in enriching the understanding of disability.

                Traditional educational frameworks in Saudi Arabia have historically adopted a deficit-based approach to special education, potentially overlooking the benefits of neurodiversity. As global educational paradigms shift toward inclusive practices, examining the alignment of Saudi special education laws with neurodiversity principles becomes crucial. This content analysis study aimed to explore the existing literature on special education in Saudi Arabia to ascertain whether the laws and policies support or hinder the practice of neurodiversity, a concept that is gaining international recognition but remains nascent in Saudi Arabia. A systematic literature search was performed in Web of Science and Scopus, yielding 21 relevant studies after screening and application of inclusion criteria. A content analysis was conducted, focusing on the categorization of data relevant to special education laws and their implications for neurodiversity. The analysis identified seven key categories, including Implementation of Inclusive education and transition services, that reflect the current state of special education laws in relation to neurodiversity. A conceptual model was developed, illustrating the potential of special education laws to both support and impede neurodiversity in Saudi Arabia and potentially worldwide.

                Rab10 is a small GTPase involved in cargo transport from the trans-Golgi network to the plasma membrane and endocytic recycling back to the cell membrane. It has garnered significant interest in neurodegenerative disease research, particularly due to its phosphorylation by the LRRK2 kinase. This relationship underscores the importance of Rab10 in cellular processes related to disease pathology, specifically Parkinson’s disease. The accessibility of renewable and selective antibodies against Rab10 would advance research efforts, enabling further understanding of its function and implications in disease. Here, we have characterized eight Rab10 commercial antibodies for western blot, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence using a standardized experimental protocol based on comparing read-outs in knockout cell lines and isogenic parental controls. These studies are part of a larger, collaborative initiative seeking to address antibody reproducibility issues by characterizing commercially available antibodies for human proteins and publishing the results openly as a resource for the scientific community. While use of antibodies and protocols vary between laboratories, we encourage readers to use this report as a guide to select the most appropriate antibodies for their specific needs.

                Introduction Zero-dose children (ZDC) are defined as those that have never been reached by routine immunization services. In Latin America, almost 2.7 million infants younger than 1 year of age, have incomplete vaccination schedules, and vaccine preventable diseases such as measles or polio have increase worldwide. ZDC are reported to reside in high risk and fragile settings, including remote-rural areas, urban slums, and conflict-affected areas. Identifying the problem and settings in each country is mandatory to propose possible solutions to the immunization coverage situation. Areas covered In November 2023, a group of experts of the Latin America Society of Pediatric Infectious Diseases (SLIPE) analyzed the global and regional reality of ZDC, and present in this document an updated reality of the Latin American region and the weight of the possible interventions to overcome this problem. Expert commentary Communication is a key element to improve vaccination coverage, as it is quality and use of vaccination data. Campaigns that deliver targeted and effective messages to communities and families, provide education about vaccination, avoid missed vaccination opportunities, and coordinate efforts across different sectors and communities, among other strategies, could improve the current immunization situation.

Weinberger, Nathan D. Grubaugh</p>

Significant variations have been observed in viral copies generated during SARS-CoV-2 infections. However, the factors that impact viral copies and infection dynamics are not fully understood, and may be inherently dependent upon different viral and host factors. Here, we conducted virus whole genome sequencing and measured viral copies using RT-qPCR from 9,902 SARS-CoV-2 infections over a 2-year period to examine the impact of virus genetic variation on changes in viral copies adjusted for host age and vaccination status. Using a genome-wide association study (GWAS) approach, we identified multiple single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) corresponding to amino acid changes in the SARS-CoV-2 genome associated with variations in viral copies. We further applied a marginal epistasis test to detect interactions among SNPs and identified multiple pairs of substitutions located in the spike gene that have non-linear effects on viral copies. We also analyzed the temporal patterns and found that SNPs associated with increased viral copies were predominantly observed in Delta and Omicron BA.2/BA.4/BA.5/XBB infections, whereas those associated with decreased viral copies were only observed in infections with Omicron BA.1 variants. Our work showcases how GWAS can be a useful tool for probing phenotypes related to SNPs in viral genomes that are worth further exploration. We argue that this approach can be used more broadly across pathogens to characterize emerging variants and monitor therapeutic interventions.

                <p>by Hannah Zoller, Carlos Garcia Perez, Javier Betel Geijo Fernández, Wolfgang zu Castell</p>

Considering biological systems as information processing entities and analyzing their organizational structure via information-theoretic measures has become an established approach in life sciences. We transfer this framework to a field of broad general interest, the human gut microbiome. We use BacArena, a software combining agent-based modelling and flux-balance analysis, to simulate a simplified human intestinal microbiome (SIHUMI). In a first step, we derive information theoretic measures from the simulated abundance data, and, in a second step, relate them to the metabolic processes underlying the abundance data. Our study provides further evidence on the role of active information storage as an indicator of unexpected structural change in the observed system. Besides, we show that information transfer reflects coherent behavior in the microbial community, both as a reaction to environmental changes and as a result of direct effective interaction. In this sense, purely abundance-based information theoretic measures can provide meaningful insight on metabolic interactions within bacterial communities. Furthermore, we shed light on the important however little noticed technical aspect of distinguishing immediate and delayed effects in the interpretation of local information theoretical measures.

                <p>by Yoshitaka Kurikawa, Ikuko Koyama-Honda, Norito Tamura, Seiichi Koike, Noboru Mizushima</p>

Organelles have unique structures and molecular compositions for their functions and have been classified accordingly. However, many organelles are heterogeneous and in the process of maturation and differentiation. Because traditional methods have a limited number of parameters and spatial resolution, they struggle to capture the heterogeneous landscapes of organelles. Here, we present a method for multiparametric particle-based analysis of organelles. After disrupting cells, fluorescence microscopy images of organelle particles labeled with 6 to 8 different organelle markers were obtained, and their multidimensional data were represented in two-dimensional uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) spaces. This method enabled visualization of landscapes of 7 major organelles as well as the transitional states of endocytic organelles directed to the recycling and degradation pathways. Furthermore, endoplasmic reticulum–mitochondria contact sites were detected in these maps. Our proposed method successfully detects a wide array of organelles simultaneously, enabling the analysis of heterogeneous organelle landscapes.

                Background A multifaceted and interactive teaching approach is recommended for achieving proficiency in evidence-based practice, with critical thinking considered vital for connecting theory and practice. In this context, we advocate the strategic use of health claims in the media to promote critical thinking, complemented by a blended learning approach and a group exam. Method We conducted a convergent mixed methods study, including a cross-sectional survey with structured and open-ended questions as well as focus group interviews, at Oslo Metropolitan University, during the 2020-2021 academic year. Participants were bachelor’s students in healthcare. We employed a blended learning approach, combining digital learning resources, teaching in critical assessment of health claims and evidence-based practice, and a concurrent group exam assignment centered around media health claims. The outcome measures included students’ experiences integrating health claims into evidence-based practice teaching and their experiences with teaching approaches and the group exam. Results Out of 465 participants, 136 (29.2%) responded to the structured questions in the survey. In response to the open-ended questions within the survey, 109 (80.1%) of the respondents shared positive experiences about the course, while 98 (72%) suggested improvements. Additionally, 25 students participated in focus group interviews. Synthesizing the results, we found that students viewed the inclusion of health claim assessment as a useful entry point for learning evidence-based practice. In addition, the students identified both the blended learning design and the group exam as contributors to a positive perception of learning outcomes from the course. Conclusions Based on student feedback, integrating critical reflection on media health claims into evidence-based practice education, alongside a blended learning approach and a group exam, may be beneficial in teaching evidence-based practice to bachelor’s healthcare students. However, further rigorous study designs are needed to objectively assess the effect of the course on learning outcomes. Registration DOI 10.5281/zenodo.6985449

                Near-death experience (NDE) is a transcendent mental event of uncertain etiology that arises on the cusp of biological death. Since the discovery of NDE in the mid-1970s, multiple neuroscientific theories have been developed in an attempt to account for it in strictly materialistic or reductionistic terms. Therefore, in this conception, NDE is at most an extraordinary hallucination without any otherworldly, spiritual, or supernatural denotations. During the last decade or so, a number of animal and clinical studies have emerged which reported that about the time of death, there may be a surge of high frequency electroencephalogram (EEG) at a time when cortical electrical activity is otherwise at a very low ebb. This oscillatory rhythm falls within the range of the enigmatic brain wave-labelled gamma-band activity (GBA). Therefore, it has been proposed that this brief, paradoxical, and perimortem burst of the GBA may represent the neural foundation of the NDE. This study examines three separate but related questions concerning this phenomenon. The first problem pertains to the electrogenesis of standard GBA and the extent to which authentic cerebral activity has been contaminated by myogenic artifacts. The second problem involves the question of whether agents that can mimic NDE are also underlain by GBA. The third question concerns the electrogenesis of the surge in GBA itself. It has been contended that this is neither cortical nor myogenic in origin. Rather, it arises in a subcortical (amygdaloid) location but is recorded at the cortex via volume conduction, thereby mimicking standard GBA. Although this surge of GBA contains genuine electrophysiological activity and is an intriguing and provocative finding, there is little evidence to suggest that it could act as a kind of neurobiological skeleton for a phenomenon such as NDE.

     alt="Sensorimotor Synchronization and Neural Entrainment to Imagined Rhythms in Individuals With Proficient Imagery Ability"/>
<p>We examined the contribution of imagery to sensorimotor synchronization (SMS) performance of <i>proficient imagers</i>, utilizing a synchronization–continuation paradigm that included an auditory or visual distractor task during the continuation phase. While the visual distractor task had minimal effect, SMS consistency was significantly impacted by the auditory distractor task. Our electroencephalography analysis revealed beat-related (1.67 Hz) neural entrainment to the guiding visual stimulus during the synchronization phase (a) and during the continuation phase without guiding visual stimulus only when the visual (c) or auditory (d) distractor tasks were present. During continuation with the auditory distractor task (d), the neural entrainment showed an occipital electrode distribution, suggesting the involvement of visual imagery. Unique to SMS continuation with the auditory distractor task, neural and sub-vocal (measured with electromyography) entrainment were found at the three-beat pattern frequency. In this most difficult condition, <i>proficient imagers</i> employed both beat- and pattern-related imagery strategies. Our results suggest that <i>proficient imagers</i> effectively utilized beat-related imagery in one modality when imagery in another modality was limited.</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Sensorimotor synchronization (SMS) is the temporal coordination of motor movements with external or imagined stimuli. Finger-tapping studies indicate better SMS performance with auditory or tactile stimuli compared to visual. However, SMS with a visual rhythm can be improved by enriching stimulus properties (e.g., spatiotemporal content) or individual differences (e.g., one's vividness of auditory imagery). We previously showed that higher self-reported vividness of auditory imagery led to more consistent synchronization–continuation performance when participants continued without a guiding visual rhythm. Here, we examined the contribution of imagery to the SMS performance of <i>proficient imagers</i>, including an auditory or visual distractor task during the continuation phase. While the visual distractor task had minimal effect, SMS consistency was significantly worse when the auditory distractor task was present. Our electroencephalography analysis revealed beat-related neural entrainment, only when the visual or auditory distractor tasks were present. During continuation with the auditory distractor task, the neural entrainment showed an occipital electrode distribution, suggesting the involvement of visual imagery. Unique to SMS continuation with the auditory distractor task, we found neural and sub-vocal (measured with electromyography) entrainment at the three-beat pattern frequency. In this most difficult condition, <i>proficient imagers</i> employed both beat- and pattern-related imagery strategies. However, this combination was insufficient to restore SMS consistency to that observed with visual or no distractor task. Our results suggest that <i>proficient imagers</i> effectively utilized beat-related imagery in one modality when imagery in another modality was limited.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91046">Structure and evolution of alanine/serine decarboxylases and the engineering of theanine production</a></h4>

              
                Ethylamine (EA), the precursor of theanine biosynthesis, is synthesized from alanine decarboxylation by alanine decarboxylase (AlaDC) in tea plants. AlaDC evolves from serine decarboxylase (SerDC) through neofunctionalization and has lower catalytic activity. However, lacking structure information hinders the understanding of the evolution of substrate specificity and catalytic activity. In this study, we solved the X-ray crystal structures of AlaDC from <i>Camellia sinensis</i> (CsAlaDC) and SerDC from <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> (AtSerDC). Tyr<sup>341</sup> of AtSerDC or the corresponding Tyr<sup>336</sup> of CsAlaDC is essential for their enzymatic activity. Tyr<sup>111</sup> of AtSerDC and the corresponding Phe<sup>106</sup> of CsAlaDC determine their substrate specificity. Both CsAlaDC and AtSerDC have a distinctive zinc finger and have not been identified in any other Group II PLP-dependent amino acid decarboxylases. Based on the structural comparisons, we conducted a mutation screen of CsAlaDC. The results indicated that the mutation of L110F or P114A in the CsAlaDC dimerization interface significantly improved the catalytic activity by 110% and 59%, respectively. Combining a double mutant of CsAlaDC<sup>L110F/P114A</sup> with theanine synthetase increased theanine production 672% in an <i>in vitro</i> system. This study provides the structural basis for the substrate selectivity and catalytic activity of CsAlaDC and AtSerDC and provides a route to more efficient biosynthesis of theanine.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94349">Cell-type-specific origins of locomotor rhythmicity at different speeds in larval zebrafish</a></h4>

              
                Different speeds of locomotion require heterogeneous spinal populations, but a common mode of rhythm generation is presumed to exist. Here, we explore the cellular versus synaptic origins of spinal rhythmicity at different speeds by performing electrophysiological recordings from premotor excitatory interneurons in larval zebrafish. Chx10-labeled V2a neurons are divided into at least two morphological subtypes proposed to play distinct roles in timing and intensity control. Consistent with distinct rhythm generating and output patterning functions within the spinal V2a population, we find that descending subtypes are recruited exclusively at slow or fast speeds and exhibit intrinsic cellular properties suitable for rhythmogenesis at those speeds, while bifurcating subtypes are recruited more reliably at all speeds and lack appropriate rhythmogenic cellular properties. Unexpectedly, however, phasic firing patterns during locomotion in rhythmogenic and non-rhythmogenic V2a neurons alike are best explained by distinct modes of synaptic inhibition linked to cell type and speed. At fast speeds reciprocal inhibition in descending V2a neurons supports phasic firing, while recurrent inhibition in bifurcating V2a neurons helps pattern motor output. In contrast, at slow speeds recurrent inhibition in descending V2a neurons supports phasic firing, while bifurcating V2a neurons rely on reciprocal inhibition alone to pattern output. Our findings suggest cell-type-specific, not common, modes of rhythmogenesis generate and coordinate different speeds of locomotion.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100761">Teaching troubleshooting skills to graduate students</a></h4>

              
                Troubleshooting is an important part of experimental research, but graduate students rarely receive formal training in this skill. In this article, we describe an initiative called Pipettes and Problem Solving that we developed to teach troubleshooting skills to graduate students at the University of Texas at Austin.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96553">OsNF-YB7 inactivates OsGLK1 to inhibit chlorophyll biosynthesis in rice embryo</a></h4>

              
                As a master regulator of seed development, Leafy Cotyledon 1 (LEC1) promotes chlorophyll (Chl) biosynthesis in <i>Arabidopsis</i>, but the mechanism underlying this remains poorly understood. Here, we found that loss of function of <i>OsNF-YB7</i>, a <i>LEC1</i> homolog of rice, leads to chlorophyllous embryo, indicating that <i>OsNF-YB7</i> plays an opposite role in Chl biosynthesis in rice compared with that in <i>Arabidopsis</i>. OsNF-YB7 regulates the expression of a group of genes responsible for Chl biosynthesis and photosynthesis by directly binding to their promoters. In addition, OsNF-YB7 interacts with Golden 2-Like 1 (OsGLK1) to inhibit the transactivation activity of OsGLK1, a key regulator of Chl biosynthesis. Moreover, OsNF-YB7 can directly repress <i>OsGLK1</i> expression by recognizing its promoter in vivo, indicating the involvement of OsNF-YB7 in multiple regulatory layers of Chl biosynthesis in rice embryo. We propose that OsNF-YB7 functions as a transcriptional repressor to regulate Chl biosynthesis in rice embryo.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98834">Bidirectional dysregulation of synaptic glutamate signaling after transient metabolic failure</a></h4>

              
                Ischemia leads to a severe dysregulation of glutamate homeostasis and excitotoxic cell damage in the brain. Shorter episodes of energy depletion, for instance during peri-infarct depolarizations, can also acutely perturb glutamate signaling. It is less clear if such episodes of metabolic failure also have persistent effects on glutamate signaling and how the relevant mechanisms such as glutamate release and uptake are differentially affected. We modeled acute and transient metabolic failure by using a chemical ischemia protocol and analyzed its effect on glutamatergic synaptic transmission and extracellular glutamate signals by electrophysiology and multiphoton imaging, respectively, in the mouse hippocampus. Our experiments uncover a duration-dependent bidirectional dysregulation of glutamate signaling. Whereas short chemical ischemia induces a lasting potentiation of presynaptic glutamate release and synaptic transmission, longer episodes result in a persistent postsynaptic failure of synaptic transmission. We also observed unexpected differences in the vulnerability of the investigated cellular mechanisms. Axonal action potential firing and glutamate uptake were surprisingly resilient compared to postsynaptic cells, which overall were most vulnerable to acute and transient metabolic stress. We conclude that short perturbations of energy supply lead to a lasting potentiation of synaptic glutamate release, which may increase glutamate excitotoxicity well beyond the metabolic incident.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92173">DNL343 is an investigational CNS penetrant eukaryotic initiation factor 2B activator that prevents and reverses the effects of neurodegeneration caused by the integrated stress response</a></h4>

              
                The integrated stress response (ISR) is a conserved pathway in eukaryotic cells that is activated in response to multiple sources of cellular stress. Although acute activation of this pathway restores cellular homeostasis, intense or prolonged ISR activation perturbs cell function and may contribute to neurodegeneration. DNL343 is an investigational CNS-penetrant small-molecule ISR inhibitor designed to activate the eukaryotic initiation factor 2B (eIF2B) and suppress aberrant ISR activation. DNL343 reduced CNS ISR activity and neurodegeneration in a dose-dependent manner in two established in vivo models – the optic nerve crush injury and an eIF2B loss of function (LOF) mutant – demonstrating neuroprotection in both and preventing motor dysfunction in the LOF mutant mouse. Treatment with DNL343 at a late stage of disease in the LOF model reversed elevation in plasma biomarkers of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration and prevented premature mortality. Several proteins and metabolites that are dysregulated in the LOF mouse brains were normalized by DNL343 treatment, and this response is detectable in human biofluids. Several of these biomarkers show differential levels in CSF and plasma from patients with vanishing white matter disease (VWMD), a neurodegenerative disease that is driven by eIF2B LOF and chronic ISR activation, supporting their potential translational relevance. This study demonstrates that DNL343 is a brain-penetrant ISR inhibitor capable of attenuating neurodegeneration in mouse models and identifies several biomarker candidates that may be used to assess treatment responses in the clinic.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/88673">Vglut2-based glutamatergic signaling in central noradrenergic neurons is dispensable for normal breathing and chemosensory reflexes</a></h4>

              
                Central noradrenergic (NA) neurons are key constituents of the respiratory homeostatic network. NA dysfunction is implicated in several developmental respiratory disorders including Congenital Central Hyperventilation Syndrome (CCHS), Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), and Rett Syndrome. The current unchallenged paradigm in the field, supported by multiple studies, is that glutamate co-transmission in subsets of central NA neurons plays a role in breathing control. If true, NA-glutamate co-transmission may also be mechanistically important in respiratory disorders. However, the requirement of NA-derived glutamate in breathing has not been directly tested and the extent of glutamate co-transmission in the central NA system remains uncharacterized. Therefore, we fully characterized the cumulative fate maps and acute adult expression patterns of all three vesicular glutamate transporters (<i>Slc17a7</i> (Vglut1), <i>Slc17a6</i> (Vglut2), and <i>Slc17a8</i> (Vglut3)) in NA neurons, identifying a novel, dynamic expression pattern for Vglut2 and an undescribed co-expression domain for Vglut3 in the NA system. In contrast to our initial hypothesis that NA-derived glutamate is required to breathing, our functional studies showed that loss of Vglut2 throughout the NA system failed to alter breathing or metabolism under room air, hypercapnia, or hypoxia in unrestrained and unanesthetized mice. These data demonstrate that Vglut2-based glutamatergic signaling within the central NA system is not required for normal baseline breathing and hypercapnic, hypoxic chemosensory reflexes. These outcomes challenge the current understanding of central NA neurons in the control of breathing and suggests that glutamate may not be a critical target to understand NA neuron dysfunction in respiratory diseases.

">Interaction between facial expression and color in modulating EPR P3</a></h4>

              
                The relationships between facial expression and color affect human cognition functions such as perception and memory. However, whether these relationships influence attention remains unclear. Additionally, whether facial expressions affect selective attention is unknown; for example, reddish angry faces increase negative social evaluation or emotion intensity, but it is unclear whether selective attention is similarly enhanced. To investigate these questions, we examined whether event-related potentials for faces vary depending on facial expression and color by recording electroencephalography (EEG) data. We conducted an oddball task using stimuli that combined facial expressions (angry, neutral) and facial colors (original, red, green). The participants counted the number of times a rarely appearing target face stimulus appeared among the standard face stimuli. The results indicated that the difference in P3 amplitudes for the target and standard faces depended on the combinations of facial expressions and facial colors; the P3 amplitudes for red angry faces were greater than those for red neutral faces. Additionally, there was no significant main effect or interaction effect of facial expression or facial color on P1 amplitudes for the target, and there were significant main effects of facial expression only on the N170 amplitude. These findings suggest that the intensity of a human's selective attention to facial expressions varies according to the higher-order semantic processing of the relationship between emotion and color rather than simple facial expression or facial color effects individually. Our results support the idea that red color increases the human response to anger from an EEG perspective.

">Cortical state contributions to response variability in the early visual cortex: A system identification approach</a></h4>

              
                Neurons in the early visual cortex respond selectively to multiple features of visual stimuli, but they respond differently to repeated presentation of the same visual stimulus. Such trial-to-trial response variabilities are often treated as noise and addressed by simple trial-averaging to obtain the stimulus-driven response, though this approach is insufficient to fully remove the response variability. More importantly, there is evidence that response variability may primarily be caused by non-sensory factors, particularly by variations in cortical state. Here we recorded and analyzed neuronal spiking activity in response to natural images from areas 17 and 18 of cats, along with local population neuronal signals; local field potential (LFP) and multi-unit activity (MUA). We used a variability ratio (VR) measure to quantify the variability of neural responses across trials and two cortical state indicative measures; global fluctuation index (GFI) calculated using MUA and synchrony index (SI) calculated using LFP signals. We propose a compact convolutional neural network model with two parallel pathways, to capture the stimulus-driven activity and the cortical state-driven response variabilities. The stimulus-driven pathway contains a spatiotemporal filter, a parametric rectifier and a Gaussian map and the cortical state-driven pathway contains temporal filters for MUA and LFP. The model parameters are fit to best predict the spiking activity of each neuron. Single neurons showed highly varying degrees of trial-to-trial response variability, even when recorded simultaneously. The fitted model performed with a significantly higher accuracy in predicting neural responses compared to a basic model with a stimulus-driven pathway alone. The neurons with higher response variability benefited more from the cortical state-driven pathway compared to less variable neurons. These results provide insights to understanding the possibility of trial-to-trial response variabilities emerging as an effect of cortical state dynamics.

                This study investigates the neural activity patterns associated with impaired decision-making in Alzheimer's disease (AD) by examining the effects of amyloid pathology on prefrontal-hippocampal circuit dynamics in 5XFAD mice, a model system known for its pronounced early amyloid pathology. Using ecologically relevant ''approach food-avoid predator'' paradigms, we revealed that 5XFAD mice display impaired decision strategies in risky foraging tasks, characterized by rigid hippocampal place fields and diminished sharp-wave ripple (SWR) frequencies, accompanied by disrupted prefrontal-hippocampal connectivity. These neural deficits align with behavioral inflexibility in dynamic threat scenarios. Our findings indicate that disrupted SWR dynamics and corticolimbic connectivity contribute to decision-making deficits in AD, emphasizing the potential of targeting these specific neural mechanisms to ameliorate cognitive impairments. This research contributes significantly to our understanding of AD's impact on cognition, providing insights that could lead to more targeted therapeutic strategies.

">Limbic System White Matter in Children and Adolescents with ADHD: A Longitudinal Diffusion MRI Analysis</a></h4>

              
                Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is increasingly recognized as a disorder linked to atypical white matter development across large-scale brain networks. However, current research predominantly focuses on cortical networks, leaving the developmental trajectories of many subcortical networks, including the limbic system, largely unexplored. The limbic system is crucial for emotion and cognition, making it a key area of interest in ADHD research. This study employed multi-shell high angular resolution diffusion magnetic resonance imaging to map the development of limbic system white matter in individuals with ADHD (n = 72) and controls (n = 97) across three time points between ages 9 and 14. Diffusion kurtosis imaging and graph theory metrics were used to characterize limbic system white matter, alongside assessments of emotional regulation and ADHD symptom severity. Compared to controls, individuals with ADHD exhibited significantly lower microstructural organization, particularly in kurtosis anisotropy, within the bilateral cingulum bundle from childhood to adolescence. Brain-behavior analyses further revealed that higher ADHD symptom severity was associated with a lower number of limbic system white matter connections, notably decreased routing efficiency and network density. These findings offer novel insights into the role of disrupted limbic system white matter in ADHD pathophysiology, broadening our understanding of the disorder's neural mechanisms and opening promising avenues for future exploration of subcortical brain networks.

">Overabundant endocannabinoids in neurons are detrimental to cognitive function</a></h4>

              
                2-Arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) is the most prevalent endocannabinoid involved in maintaining brain homeostasis. Previous studies have demonstrated that inactivating monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL), the primary enzyme responsible for degrading 2-AG in the brain, alleviates neuropathology and prevents synaptic and cognitive decline in animal models of neurodegenerative diseases. However, we show that selectively inhibiting 2-AG metabolism in neurons impairs cognitive function in mice. This cognitive impairment appears to result from decreased expression of synaptic proteins and synapse numbers, impaired long-term synaptic plasticity and cortical circuit functional connectivity, and diminished neurogenesis. Interestingly, the synaptic and cognitive deficits induced by neuronal MAGL inactivation can be counterbalanced by inhibiting astrocytic 2-AG metabolism. Transcriptomic analyses reveal that inhibiting neuronal 2-AG degradation leads to widespread changes in expression of genes associated with synaptic function. These findings suggest that crosstalk in 2-AG signaling between astrocytes and neurons is crucial for maintaining synaptic and cognitive functions and that excessive 2-AG in neurons alone is detrimental to cognitive function.

">Activation of 5-HT7 receptors in the mouse dentate gyrus selectively enhances GABAergic inhibition of hilar mossy cells without affecting plasticity at the perforant path synapse</a></h4>

              
                Background: The study examined the effects of 5-HT7 receptor activation on GABAergic transmission within the dentate gyrus and plasticity at the glutamatergic perforant path input. Methods: Immunofluorescence imaging was performed using transverse hippocampal slices from transgenic mice expressing GFP under the Htr7 promoter. This was followed by whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiological recordings of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents recorded from dentate granule cells and hilar mossy cells -- two glutamatergic neuron types present in the dentate gyrus. Extracellular recordings of field excitatory postsynaptic potentials were then performed to assess whether 5-HT7 receptor activation influenced theta burst stimulation-evoked plasticity of the perforant path synaptic input. Results: It was found that parvalbumin and somatostatin interneurons in the dentate gyrus expressed GFP. Activation of 5-HT7 receptors increased GABAergic transmission targeting mossy cells but not granule cells. However, there was no effect of 5-HT7 receptor activation on perforant path plasticity either with intact or blocked GABAA receptor signaling. Conclusion: The presence of 5-HT7 receptors in a subset of parvalbumin and somatostatin interneurons in the mouse dentate gyrus could mean that they are involved in the inhibitory control of dentate gyrus activity, although the effect seems to be confined to mossy cells and did not translate to changes in perforant path plasticity. Further experiments are needed to fully elucidate the functional role of these receptors in the dentate gyrus.

This includes markerless keypoint trackers, which utilize deep network systems to label positions of interest on the surface of an animal (e.g., paws, snout, tail, etc.). These approaches mark a major technological achievement. However, they have a high error rate relative to motion capture in humans and are yet to be benchmarked against ground truth datasets in mice. Moreover, the extent to which they can be used to track joint or skeletal kinematics remains unclear. As the primary output of the motor system is the activation of muscles that, in turn, exert forces on the skeleton rather than the skin, it is important to establish potential limitations of techniques that rely on surface imaging. This can be accomplished by imaging implanted fiducial markers in freely moving mice. Here, we present a novel tracking method called QD-Pi (Quantum Dot-based Pose estimation in vivo), which employs injectable near-infrared fluorescent nanoparticles (quantum dots, QDs) immobilized on microbeads. We demonstrate that the resulting tags are biocompatible and can be imaged non-invasively using commercially available camera systems when injected into fatty tissue beneath the skin or directly into joints. Using this technique, we accurately capture 3D trajectories of up to ten independent internal positions in freely moving mice over multiple weeks. Finally, we leverage this technique to create a large-scale ground truth dataset for benchmarking and training the next generation of markerless keypoint tracker systems.

">Astrocyte glucocorticoid receptors mediate sex-specific changes in activity following stress</a></h4>

              
                Interactions between orexin neurons and astrocytes in the lateral hypothalamus influence activity levels including circadian and motivated behaviour. These behaviors are disrupted by stress in rodents and form a hallmark of stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders. Here we set out to understand how stress influences activity and the underlying cellular mechanisms. We report that the long-term effects of stress on activity levels correlate with spontaneous firing of orexin neurons with hyperactivity in males and hypoactivity presented by female mice. These neuronal changes were accompanied by extensive astrocyte remodelling. Causal manipulations identified lateral hypothalamic astrocytes as key regulators of activity patterns. In the context of stress, genetic deletion of glucocorticoid receptors in lateral hypothalamic astrocytes rescued the effects of stress on orexin neuron firing, restoring activity to control levels in both males and females. Overall, these data suggest that astrocytic regulation of orexin neuron firing enables the maintenance of activity levels, and their dysfunction drives stress-induced activity dysregulation.

">Unique Transcriptomic Cell Types of the Granular Retrosplenial Cortex are Preserved Across Mice and Rats Despite Dramatic Changes in Key Marker Genes</a></h4>

              
                The granular retrosplenial cortex (RSG) supports key functions ranging from memory consolidation to spatial navigation. The mouse RSG contains several cell types that are remarkably distinct from those found in other cortical regions. This includes the physiologically and transcriptomically unique low rheobase neuron that is the dominant cell-type in RSG layers 2/3 (L2/3 LR), as well as the similarly exclusive pyramidal cells that comprise much of RSG layer 5a (L5a RSG). While the functions of the RSG are extensively studied in both mice and rats, it remains unknown if the transcriptomically unique cell types of the mouse RSG are evolutionarily conserved in rats. Here, we show that mouse and rat RSG not only contain the same cell types, but key subtypes including the L2/3 LR and L5a RSG neurons are amplified in their representations in rats compared to mice. This preservation of cell types in male and female rats happens despite dramatic changes in key cell-type-specific marker genes, with the Scnn1a expression that selectively tags mouse L5a RSG neurons completely absent in rats. Important for Cre-driver line development, we identify alternative, cross-species genes that can be used to selectively target the cell types of the RSG in both mice and rats. Our results show that the unique cell types of the RSG are evolutionarily conserved across millions of years of evolution between mice and rats, but also emphasize stark species-specific differences in marker genes that need to be considered when making cell-type-specific transgenic lines of mice versus rats.

">Amygdala stimulation transforms short-term memory into remote memory by persistent activation of atypical PKC in the anterior cingulate cortex</a></h4>

              
                Although many studies have addressed the role of the amygdala in modulating long-term memory, it is not known whether weak training plus amygdala stimulation can transform a short-term memory into a remote memory. Object place recognition (OPR) memory after strong training remains hippocampus-dependent through the persistent action of PKM{zeta} for at least 6 days, but it is unknown whether weak training plus amygdala stimulation can transform short-term memory into an even longer memory, and whether such memory is stored through more persistent action of PKM{zeta} in hippocampus. We trained rats to acquire OPR and 15 min or 5 h later induced a brief pattern of electrical stimulation in basolateral amygdala (BLA). Our results reveal that a short-term memory lasting < 4 h can be converted into remote memory lasting at least 3 weeks if the BLA is activated 15 min, but not 5 h after learning. To examine how this remote memory is maintained, we injected ZIP, an inhibitor of atypical PKCs (aPKCs), PKM{zeta} and PKC{iota}/{lambda}, into either hippocampal CA1, dentate gyrus (DG), or anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Our data reveal amygdala stimulation produces consolidation into remote memory, not by persistent aPKC activation and capture by synaptic tagging processes in the hippocampal formation, but in ACC. Our data establish a powerful modulating role of the BLA in forming remote memory and open a path in the search for neurological restoration of memory, based on enhancing synaptic plasticity in aging or neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease.

">GABAergic neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus regulate social hierarchy in mice</a></h4>

              
                Social hierarchy serves as a fundamental organizational mechanism within most animal societies, exerting significant influence on health, survival, and reproductive success in both humans and animals. However, the neural mechanisms by which the brain regulates dominance hierarchies remain inadequately understood. Considering that GABAergic neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) exert substantial inhibitory control over serotonergic firing, which may be implicated in the acquisition of dominance, we hypothesized that DRN GABAergic neurons may play a pivotal role in regulating social hierarchy. To test this hypothesis, we employed a combination of optogenetics, chemogenetics, fiber photometry recordings, and behavioral assays in mice, to elucidate the functional contributions of these neurons. Our results revealed a biphasic activity pattern of DRN GABAergic neurons, characterized by increased firing during retreats and decreased firing during push-initiation in the tube test. Furthermore, the optogenetic and chemogenetic activation of DRN GABAergic neurons led to an increase in the number of retreats and a reduction in social rank, while inhibition of these neurons produced the opposite effects. These findings elucidate the bidirectional regulatory role of DRN GABAergic neurons in social hierarchies.

                Deep learning models based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been used to classify Alzheimer's disease or infer dementia severity from 3D T1-weighted brain MRI scans. Here, we examine the value of adding occlusion sensitivity analysis (OSA) and gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) to these models to make the results more interpretable. Much research in this area focuses on specific datasets such as the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) or National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC), which assess people of North American, predominantly European ancestry, so we examine how well models trained on these data generalize to a new population dataset from India (NIMHANS cohort). We also evaluate the benefit of using a combined dataset to train the CNN models. Our experiments show feature localization consistent with knowledge of AD from other methods. OSA and Grad-CAM resolve features at different scales to help interpret diagnostic inferences made by CNNs.

">Sex-specific maladaptive responses to acute stress upon in utero THC exposure are mediated by dopamine</a></h4>

              
                Cannabis remains by far the most consumed illicit drug in Europe. The availability of more potent cannabis has raised concerns regarding the enhanced health risks associated with its use, particularly among pregnant women. Growing evidence shows that cannabis use during pregnancy increases the risks of child psychopathology. We have previously shown that male rat offspring prenatally exposed to delta9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), a rat model of prenatal cannabinoid exposure (PCE), display a hyperdopaminergic phenotype associated with a differential susceptibility to acute THC- and stress-mediated effects on sensorimotor gating functions. Here, we explore the contribution of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, key regulator of body adaptive stress responses, to the detrimental effects of acute stress on ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neurons and sensorimotor gating function of PCE rats. We report a sex-dependent compromised balance in mRNA levels of genes encoding mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid receptors in the VTA, alongside with stress-induced prepulse inhibition (PPI) deficits. Notably, VTA dopamine neuronal activity is required for the manifestation of stress-dependent deterioration of PPI. Finally, pharmacological manipulations targeting glycogen-synthase-kinase-3-beta signaling during postnatal development correct these stress-induced, sex-specific and dopamine-dependent deficits of PPI. Collectively, these results highlight the critical sex-dependent interplay between HPA axis and dopamine system in the regulation of sensorimotor gating functions in rats.

">Neuroimaging model of visceral manipulation in awake rat</a></h4>

              
                Reciprocal neuronal connections exist between the internal organs of the body and the nervous system. These projections to and from the viscera play an essential role in maintaining and finetuning organ responses in order to sustain homeostasis and allostasis. Functional maps of brain regions participating in this bidirectional communication have been previously studied in awake humans and anesthetized rodents. To further refine the mechanistic understanding of visceral influence on brain states, however, new paradigms that allow for more invasive, and ultimately more informative, measurements and perturbations must be explored. Further, such paradigms should prioritize human translatability. In the current paper, we address these issues by demonstrating the feasibility of non-anesthetized animal imaging during visceral manipulation. More specifically, we used a barostat interfaced with an implanted gastric balloon to cyclically induce distension of a non-anesthetized rat's stomach during simultaneous BOLD fMRI. General linear modeling and spatial independent component analysis revealed several regions with BOLD activation temporally coincident with the gastric distension stimulus. The ON-OFF (20 mmHg - 0 mmHg) barostat-balloon pressure cycle resulted in widespread BOLD activation of the inferior colliculus, cerebellum, ventral midbrain, and a variety of hippocampal structures. These results suggest that neuroimaging models of gastric manipulation in the non-anesthetized rat are achievable and provide an avenue for more comprehensive studies involving the integration of other neuroscience techniques like electrophysiology.

                Synchronizing motoric responses to metrical sensory rhythms is key to social activities, e.g., group singing and dancing. It remains elusive, however, whether there is a common neural network for motoric synchronization to metrical rhythms from different sensory modalities. Here, we separate sensorimotor responses from basic sensory responses by combining a metrical sensorimotor synchronization task with frequency-domain magnetoencephalography (MEG) analysis. A common frontal-temporal network, not including visual cortex, is observed during both visual- and auditory-motor synchronization, and the network remains in congenitally deaf participants during visual-motor synchronization, suggesting the network is formed by intrinsic cortical connections instead of auditory experience. Furthermore, activation of the left and right frontal-temporal areas, as well as the ipsilateral white matter connection, separately predict the precision of auditory and visual synchronization. These results reveal a common but lateralized frontal-temporal network for visual- and auditory-motor synchronization, which is generated based on intrinsic cortical connections.

                Both goal-directed and automatic processes shape human behavior. These processes often conflict, and behavioral control is the decision about which determines behavior. Behavioral control, or deciding how to decide, is critical for adaptive behavior. However, the neural mechanisms underlying behavioral control remain unclear. We performed deep phenotyping of individual dopamine system function by combining PET measures of dopamine physiology, functional MRI, and administration of dopaminergic drugs in a within-subject, double-blind, placebo-controlled design. Subjects performed a rule-based response time task in which we operationalized goal-directed and automatic decision-making as model-based and model-free contributions to behavior, respectively. We found convergent and causal evidence that dopamine D2/3 receptors in the striatum regulate behavioral control by enhancing model-based and blunting model-free influences on behavior. In contrast, we found a double dissociation whereby presynaptic dopamine synthesis capacity in the striatum was linked to acquiring model-based knowledge but not behavioral control. Neuroimaging analysis suggested that striatal D2/3 receptors influence behavioral control by adjusting frontostriatal functional connectivity. This multimodal study establishes a specific role of D2/3 receptors in regulating behavioral control and could contribute to an improved understanding of dysregulated behavioral control in clinical disorders affecting dopamine neurotransmission.

">Realistic mossy fiber input patterns to unipolar brush cells evoke a continuum of temporal responses comprised of components mediated by different glutamate receptors</a></h4>

              
                Unipolar brush cells (UBCs) are excitatory interneurons in the cerebellar cortex that receive mossy fiber (MF) inputs and excite granule cells. The UBC population responds to brief burst activation of MFs with a continuum of temporal transformations, but it is not known how UBCs transform the diverse range of MF input patterns that occur in vivo. Here we use cell-attached recordings from UBCs in acute cerebellar slices to examine responses to MF firing patterns that are based on in vivo recordings. We find that MFs evoke a continuum of responses in the UBC population, mediated by three different types of glutamate receptors that each convey a specialized component. AMPARs transmit timing information for single stimuli at up to 5 spikes/s, and for very brief bursts. A combination of mGluR2/3s (inhibitory) and mGluR1s (excitatory) mediates a continuum of delayed, and broadened responses to longer bursts, and to sustained high frequency activation. Variability in the mGluR2/3 component controls the time course of the onset of firing, and variability in the mGluR1 component controls the duration of prolonged firing. We conclude that the combination of glutamate receptor types allows each UBC to simultaneously convey different aspects of MF firing. These findings establish that UBCs are highly flexible circuit elements that provide diverse temporal transformations that are well suited to contribute to specialized processing in different regions of the cerebellar cortex.

">Representational shifts from feedforward to feedback rhythms index phenomenological integration in natural vision</a></h4>

              
                How does the brain integrate complex and dynamic visual inputs into phenomenologically seamless percepts? Previous results demonstrate that when visual inputs are organized coherently across space and time, they are more strongly encoded in feedback-related alpha rhythms, and less strongly in feedforward-related gamma rhythms. Here, we tested whether this representational shift from feedforward to feedback rhythms is linked to the phenomenological experience of coherence. In an EEG study, we manipulated the degree of spatiotemporal coherence by presenting two segments from the same video across visual hemifields, either synchronously or asynchronously (with a delay between segments). We asked participants whether they perceived the stimulus as coherent or incoherent. When stimuli were presented at the perceptual threshold (i.e., when the same stimulus was judged as coherent 50% of times), perception co-varied with stimulus coding across alpha and gamma rhythms: When stimuli were perceived as coherent, they were represented in alpha activity; when stimuli were perceived as incoherent, they were represented in gamma activity. Whether the same visual input is perceived as coherent or incoherent thus depends on representational shifts between feedback-related alpha and feedforward-related gamma rhythms.

">Sparsity of population activity in the hippocampus is task-invariant across the tri-synaptic circuit and dorsal-ventral axis</a></h4>

              
                Evidence from neurophysiological and genetic studies demonstrates that activity sparsity, the proportion of neurons that are active at a given time in a population, systematically varies across the canonical trisynaptic circuit of the hippocampus. Recent work has also shown that sparsity varies across the hippocampal dorsoventral (long) axis, wherein activity is sparser in ventral than dorsal regions. While the hippocampus has a critical role in long term memory (LTM), whether sparsity across the trisynaptic circuit and hippocampal long axis is task dependent or invariant remains unknown. Importantly, representational sparsity has significant implications for neural computation and theoretical models of learning and memory within and beyond the hippocampus. Here we used functional molecular imaging to quantify sparsity in the rat hippocampus during performance of the Morris water task (MWT) and contextual fear discrimination (CFD); two popular and distinct assays of LTM. We found that activity sparsity is highly reliable across memory tasks, wherein activity increases sequentially across the trisynaptic circuit (DG < CA3 < CA1) and decreases across the long axis (ventral < dorsal). These results have important implications for models of hippocampal function and suggest that activity sparsity is a preserved property in the hippocampal system across cognitive settings.

">Variations in human trigeminal and facial nerve branches and foramina identified by dissection and microcomputed tomography</a></h4>

              
                The aim of this study was to identify branches of the trigeminal and facial nerves relevant to surgical incisions and injections and the scalp block techniques in the frontotemporal region, and to determine their relationships with superficial vascular structures and bony landmarks. Half-heads from consenting embalmed donors (6 male, 2 female, mean age at death 78.4 years) were used in this study. Detailed dissection was carried out to identify the position of the auriculotemporal nerve (ATN) relative to the superior temporal artery (STA) and the facial nerve (FN) in six subjects (5 male, 1 female). The results provide a minimum safe distance of 5 mm between the STA and the frontotemporal branches of the FN at the level of the low edge of zygoma and 8mm between the low edge of zygoma and the FN trunk, providing a pre-auricular triangle of safety for incisions and injections. Variability between subjects was up to 60%. Microcomputed tomography (microCT) scans were taken from all eight subjects and the three-dimensional reconstructions were used to identify the supraorbital notch (SON), the zygomaticotemporal foramen (ZTF) and the zygomaticofacial foramen (ZFF). The volume and relative locations of these foramina were calculated for 5-8 subjects. The closest distance between ZTF and the FZS ranged from 9 to 21mm (26% variation); 3 subjects had a single ZTF while 5 subjects had two ZTF. The angle at the centre of the orbit between ZFF and the FZS ranged from 156 to 166 degrees (2.5% variation). These findings demonstrate that both traditional cadaveric dissection methods as well as contemporary microCT methods can be used to investigate the relative locations of nerves or their foramina in the human head. The findings provide anatomical considerations for fronto-temporal incisions and local anaesthesia.

">Predictive filtering of sensory response via orbitofrontal top-down input</a></h4>

              
                Habituation is a crucial sensory filtering mechanism whose dysregulation can lead to a continuously intense world in disorders with sensory overload. While habituation is considered to require top-down predictive signaling to suppress irrelevant inputs, the exact brain loci storing the internal predictive model and the circuit mechanisms of sensory filtering remain unclear. We found that daily neural habituation in the primary auditory cortex (A1) was reversed by inactivation of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Top-down projections from the ventrolateral OFC, but not other frontal areas, carried predictive signals that grew with daily sound experience and suppressed A1 via somatostatin-expressing inhibitory neurons. Thus, prediction signals from the OFC cancel out behaviorally irrelevant anticipated stimuli by generating their "negative images" in sensory cortices.

">The tilt illusion arises from an efficient reallocation of neural coding resources at the contextual boundary</a></h4>

              
                The tilt illusion - a bias in the perceived orientation of a center stimulus induced by an oriented surround - illustrates how context shapes visual perception. While the tilt illusion has been the subject of quantitative study for over 85 years, we still lack a comprehensive account of the phenomenon that connects its neural and behavioral characteristics. Here, we demonstrate that the tilt illusion originates from a dynamic change in neural coding precision induced by the surround context. We simultaneously obtained psychophysical and fMRI responses from human subjects while they viewed gratings in the absence and presence of an oriented surround, and extracted sensory encoding precision from their behavioral and neural data. Both measures show that in the absence of a surround, encoding reflects the natural scene statistics of orientation. However, in the presence of an oriented surround, encoding precision is significantly increased for stimuli similar to the surround orientation. This local change in encoding is sufficient to accurately predict the behavioral characteristics of the tilt illusion using a Bayesian observer model. The effect of surround modulation increases along the ventral stream, and is localized to the portion of the visual cortex with receptive fields at the center-surround boundary. The pattern of change in coding accuracy reflects the surround-conditioned orientation statistics in natural scenes, but cannot be explained by local stimulus configuration. Our results suggest that the tilt illusion naturally emerges from a dynamic coding strategy that efficiently reallocates neural coding resources based on the current stimulus context.

">Brain-wide microstrokes affect the stability of memory circuits in the hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                Cognitive deficits affect over 70% of stroke survivors, yet the mechanisms by which multiple small ischemic events contribute to cognitive decline remain poorly understood. In this study, we employed chronic two-photon calcium imaging to longitudinally track the fate of individual neurons in the hippocampus of mice navigating a virtual reality environment, both before and after inducing brain-wide microstrokes. Our findings reveal that, under normal conditions, hippocampal neurons exhibit varying degrees of stability in their spatial memory coding. However, microstrokes disrupted this functional network architecture, leading to cognitive impairments. Notably, the preservation of stable coding place cells, along with the stability, precision, and persistence of the hippocampal network, was strongly predictive of cognitive outcomes. Mice with more synchronously active place cells near important locations demonstrated recovery from cognitive impairment. This study uncovers critical cellular responses and network alterations following brain injury, providing a foundation for novel therapeutic strategies preventing cognitive decline.

">Feasibility of laminar functional quantitative susceptibility mapping</a></h4>

              
                Layer fMRI is an increasingly utilized technique that provides insights into the laminar organization of brain activity. However, both blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI and vascular space occupancy data (VASO) have certain limitations, such as bias towards larger cortical veins in BOLD fMRI and high specific absorption rate in VASO. This study aims to explore the feasibility of whole-brain laminar functional quantitative susceptibility mapping (fQSM) compared to laminar BOLD fMRI and VASO at ultra-high field. Data were acquired using 3D EPI techniques. Complex data were denoised with NORDIC and susceptibility maps were computed using 3D path-based unwrapping, the variable-kernel sophisticated harmonic artifact reduction as well as the streaking artifact reduction for QSM algorithms. To assess layer-specific activation, twenty layers were segmented in the somatosensory and motor cortices, obtained from a finger tapping paradigm, and further averaged into six anatomical cortical layers. The magnitude of signal change and z-scores were compared across layers for each technique. fQSM showed the largest activation-dependent mean susceptibility decrease in Layers II/III in M1 and Layers I/ II in S1 with up to -1.3 ppb while BOLD fMRI showed the strongest mean signal increase in Layer I. Our data suggest that fQSM demonstrates less bias towards activation in superficial layers compared to BOLD fMRI. Moreover, activation-based susceptibility change was comparable to VASO data. Studying whole-brain, layer-dependent activation with submillimeter fQSM is feasible, and reduces bias towards venous drainage effects on the cortical surface compared to BOLD fMRI, thereby enabling better localization of laminar activation.

	<p>Background/Objectives: Given the importance of emotion recognition for communication purposes, and the impairment for such skill in CI users despite impressive language performances, the aim of the present study was to investigate the neural correlates of emotion recognition skills, apart from language, in adult unilateral CI (UCI) users during a music in noise (happy/sad) recognition task. Furthermore, asymmetry was investigated through electroencephalographic (EEG) rhythm, given the traditional concept of hemispheric lateralization for emotional processing, and the intrinsic asymmetry due to the clinical UCI condition. Methods: Twenty adult UCI users and eight normal hearing (NH) controls were recruited. EEG gamma and alpha band power was assessed as there is evidence of a relationship between gamma and emotional response and between alpha asymmetry and tendency to approach or withdraw from stimuli. The TAS-20 questionnaire (alexithymia) was completed by the participants. Results: The results showed no effect of background noise, while supporting that gamma activity related to emotion processing shows alterations in the UCI group compared to the NH group, and that these alterations are also modulated by the etiology of deafness. In particular, relative higher gamma activity in the CI side corresponds to positive processes, correlated with higher emotion recognition abilities, whereas gamma activity in the non-CI side may be related to positive processes inversely correlated with alexithymia and also inversely correlated with age; a correlation between TAS-20 scores and age was found only in the NH group. Conclusions: EEG gamma activity appears to be fundamental to the processing of the emotional aspect of music and also to the psychocognitive emotion-related component in adults with CI.</p>

	<p>Background: This report aims to supplement the existing knowledge on the inferior oblique muscle. In particular, this study presents detailed anatomical and histological data concerning the muscle&amp;amp;rsquo;s entry point (or entry zone) of the nerve to the inferior oblique muscle. Particular attention was paid to the topographical relationships of the nerve to the inferior oblique muscle (NTIO), including the location of its entry point to the muscle&amp;amp;rsquo;s belly and its anatomical variations. Methods: Sixty orbits from cadaveric hemi-heads fixed in 10% formalin were studied. The course of the NTIO was traced along the lateral border of the inferior rectus muscle as far as its entry point to the inferior oblique muscle. Particular attention was paid to the various ways in which the NTIO&amp;amp;rsquo;s muscular sub-branches penetrated between the fibers of the inferior oblique muscle. Results: Three types of NTIO entries to the inferior oblique muscle&amp;amp;rsquo;s belly were distinguished. In the most common type (48.3%), the nerve entered the muscle&amp;amp;rsquo;s inferior (orbital) surface. In the next most common type (36.7%), terminal muscular sub-branches of the NTIO joined the superior (also referred to as ocular or global) surface of the inferior oblique muscle. In the remaining four cases (15%), the terminal sub-branches of the NTIO were divided into two main groups (superior and inferior) that joined both the superior and inferior surfaces of the muscle. Histological examination confirmed that the distal part of the NTIO shows a characteristic arcuate course (angulation) just before reaching the muscle&amp;amp;rsquo;s belly. The process for splitting and forming separate muscular sub-branches of the NTIO was observed for all the examined histological specimens at the level of the nerve&amp;amp;rsquo;s angulation. Conclusions: The presented findings enhance the understanding of the anatomical variations and precise distribution of motor sub-branches reaching the inferior oblique muscle, which may deepen anatomical knowledge and potentially enhance the management of ocular motor disorders.</p>

	<p>Need for admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) confers an increased risk of hearing loss in the newborn and of later neurodevelopmental impairment. In this retrospective longitudinal case-controlled study, we assess how the degree of prematurity, measured via gestational age, birth weight, and z-scores, in 138 infants admitted to the NICU are associated with permanent childhood hearing loss (PCHI) and 2-year developmental outcomes. Logistic regression analyses, Kruskal&amp;amp;ndash;Wallis analysis of variance, and Chi-squared tests were used. Independent of prematurity, PCHI and NICU admission were predictive of poor developmental outcomes. Twenty-one (47%) children with PCHI had a moderate-to-severe developmental delay, compared to three (7%) matched controls. Days in the NICU but not z-scores predicted PCHI. Z-score was not prognostic of moderate or severe developmental impairment in children with PCHI. The odds ratio of moderate-to-severe neurodevelopmental impairment with PCHI was high, at 12.48 [95% CI = 3.37&amp;amp;ndash;46.40]. Children with PCHI were significantly more likely to have cerebral palsy than their matched counterparts (30% vs. 2%). These findings challenge the conventional focus on gestational age and birth weight on neurodevelopmental outcomes for children with PCHI and NICU admission. A more nuanced approach to monitoring and intervention is needed.</p>

                <p>Contemporary research has begun to show a strong relationship between movements and the perception of time. More specifically, concurrent movements serve to both bias and enhance time estimates. To explain these effects, we recently proposed a mechanism by which movements provide a secondary channel for estimating duration that is combined optimally with sensory estimates. However, a critical test of this framework is that by introducing "noise" into movements, sensory estimates of time should similarly become noisier. To accomplish this, we had human participants move a robotic arm while estimating intervals of time in either auditory or visual modalities (<I>n</I> = 24, ea.). Crucially, we introduced an artificial "tremor" in the arm while subjects were moving, that varied across three levels of amplitude (1&ndash;3 N) or frequency (4&ndash;12 Hz). The results of both experiments revealed that increasing the frequency of the tremor led to noisier estimates of duration. Further, the effect of noise varied with the base precision of the interval, such that a naturally less precise timing (i.e., visual) was more influenced by the tremor than a naturally more precise modality (i.e., auditory). To explain these findings, we fit the data with a recently developed drift-diffusion model of perceptual decision-making, in which the momentary, within-trial variance was allowed to vary across conditions. Here, we found that the model could recapitulate the observed findings, further supporting the theory that movements influence perception directly. Overall, our findings support the proposed framework, and demonstrate the utility of inducing motor noise via artificial tremors.</p>

                Background - The new increasing homeless lately consist of women, children, youth, the elderly and marginalized ethnic or migrant groups. Some of them are working and earn salaries, however, the income is not sufficient to live modestly. Purpose – The purpose of this research is to establish a desired support system to eradicate urban homelessness in the country. Design/methodology/approach – This is an exploratory descriptive method study which employed quantitative techniques.  The study employed a social ecological model to investigate behavior of homeless via multiple levels of influences including intrapersonal, interpersonal, organizational, community and public policy. Surveys have been conducted on sixty-five homeless individuals.  Findings – It was found that support systems and structures should be derived from the whole streams from families, communities, organizations and government. Employment opportunities, long-term shelters within the community places and highly demanded skills are needed to improve their living condition. Research limitations – This study is only focused on the socio-economic structures of the homeless in a capital city. Originality/value – This is an empirical research using a social ecological model for the homeless in the Kuala Lumpur area. Research on homeless study has received little attention and has yet to be fully explored.

                Background We evaluated if the course of recovery from sepsis-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) can be predicted using variables collected at admission. Methods A total of 63 patients admitted for sepsis-induced AKI in our Mangalore ICU were evaluated and baseline demographic and clinical/laboratory parameters, including serum creatinine (SCr), base excess (BE), Plethysmographic Variability Index (PVI), Caval Index, R wave variability index (RVI), mean arterial pressure (MAP) and renal resistivity index (RI) using renal doppler and need for inotropes were assessed on admission. Patients were managed as per standard protocol. After six hours of fluid resuscitation, patients were classified as volume responders or non-responders. Re-assessment was done at 24 hours and 72 hours after admission. Primary outcome was persistent AKI after 72 hours. Secondary outcome was initiation of dialysis or death within 15 days of admission. Results A total of 34 subjects recovered from AKI, of whom 32 patients were volume responders and 31 were non-responders. Response to fluid, MAP at admission and six hours, BE at admission, inotrope requirement, and PVI at admission did not correlate with recovery. Multiple logistic regression showed that SCr < 2.36 mg%, RVI > 14.45 and RI < 0.8 on admission correlated with recovery and they were evaluated further to model AKI recovery and develop PASS. PASS score = (SCr points × 5.4) + (RVI points × 4.0) + (RI points × 6.2). One point each was allotted if SCr was < 2.36, RVI was > 14.45 and RI was <0.8, and 0 otherwise. A score > 7.8 predicted recovery with a sensitivity of 79.4%, specificity of 72.4%, PPV 81.8%, NPV 76.7% and AuROC of 0.85. Conclusions The PASS score can be used to identify salvageable cases of sepsis-AKI, guiding fluid resuscitation and aiding early referral from rural to tertiary care centers for better management.

                Background Patient-related factors and limited medication adherence in patients with chronic diseases, are associated with poor clinical outcomes, long-term complications, and increased overall disease costs. Many methods have been tested with mixed results, and innovative approaches are needed to encourage patients to adhere to their prescribed drug regimens. Methods This randomised controlled trial examined a new multifactorial pharmacist-led intervention protocol (MPIP), including a medication therapy management (MTM) program with face-to-face counselling, patient-specific medication booklets, and a mobile application, from July 2021 to September 2022 in the Oud Al Touba diagnostic and screening ambulatory centre in 192 patients with type 2 diabetes in the United Arab Emirates. Medication adherence was assessed using the fixed medication possession ratio of medication refills and the medication adherence questionnaire. Results At 12 months follow-up, participants in the MPIP showed significant improvement in overall medication adherence with total (composite) medication possession ratio (MPRt) of mean (±SD) 0.95 (±0.09) compared to 0.92 (± 0.09) in the control group with mean difference of 0.03 (95%, CI 0.01–0.06), P =0.02. In addition, improvement trend was evident in the MPIP group for all medication regimens with P value <0.01. Comparable results were noticeable in adherence questionnaire scores at the end of the study, with 66 participants in the intervention group scored zero on the questionnaire, suggesting high adherence to medication compared to the control group (48 participants only). The MTM program performed 41 clinical interventions on drug-related problems, compared to six interventions in the control group, and the use of mobile application and medication booklet have increased to 45.7% compared to 21.4% before study exit. Conclusions The pharmacy intervention protocol effectively improved medication adherence and optimised medication regimens in diabetic patients with chronic medication regimens in an ambulatory healthcare centre.

                Background Schizophrenia is a severe mental illness characterized by psychosis, apathy, social withdrawal, and cognitive impairment, which results in impaired functioning in work, school, parenting, self-care, independent living, interpersonal relationships, and leisure time. Method A systematic search was conducted using Arksey and O’Malley’s framework with studies published on leisure-based intervention from January 1990 to December 2023. Results The review included 11 articles in the study. In total two studies were pilot interventional study, one randomized controlled study, one case-control, one retrospective study, three were cross sectional, one was cross sectional longitudinal study and two were qualitative in nature. Studies used different types of leisure activities like cooking group, discussions, board games, arts and craft, painting, beading, sewing, clay work, paper craft, etc were used as an intervention. Qualitative studies found that individuals with schizophrenia spent less time in social and leisure activities and more time relaxing and doing nothing. Conclusion The study highlights the need to conduct further research on leisure-based interventions using various study designs like randomized controlled trials and mixed methods to understand its effectiveness among individuals with schizophrenia.

                Background Knee osteoarthritis affects the performance of daily activities, independence, and quality of life. The etiopathogenesis of this condition considers the mechanisms of activation of metalloproteinase and reactive oxygen species production pathways. Metalloproteinases-3 (MMP-3) and Glutathione Peroxidase (GPx) may be responsible for cartilage destruction. Aquatic physiotherapy promotes a positive impact on the clinical picture of osteoarthritis, and this study presents an intervention protocol that aims to evaluate the effects of a single session of different aquatic physiotherapy modalities on the biochemical and functional behavior of patients with knee osteoarthritis. Methods This will be a crossover randomized controlled trial in which 15 individuals will be submitted to three aquatic physiotherapy modalities with a minimum 15-day wash-out period in patients over 50 years old and diagnosed with OA in at least one knee, presence of pain and at least one functional dysfunction for at least 6 months, absence of physical limitation that prevents the exercise protocol from being performed, Kellgren and Lawrence ranking between I and IV, walk independently and without auxiliary device. Variations in the concentrations of MMP-3 and GPx in peripheral blood, pain, edema, and flexibility resulting from the three aquatic physiotherapeutic interventions will be evaluated both pre- and immediate post-intervention. The reference group will be submitted to the same aquatic physiotherapy protocols, however, only the biochemical parameters and the self-perception questionnaires will be evaluated.

                Background Cesarean section is the most common obstetric procedure performed. This can lead to maternal anxiety, which is a significant contributor to postpartum depression. This can adversely affect pregnant women both mentally and emotionally, negatively impacting their well-being and family bonding. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the addition of an informative cesarean section operative steps video on the maternal anxiety score compared with standard pre-cesarean section care. Methods This randomized controlled trial was conducted at Thammasat University Hospital, Thailand, between April and September 2023. Pregnant women who underwent their first cesarean section were allocated to two groups: intervention and control groups. Participants in the intervention group were required to watch a 5-minute informative video that elaborately described the process from pre-operative steps until post-operative care on the day scheduled for cesarean delivery. All participants received the same routine pre-operative and post-operative care. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) was used to measure both populations on two occasions: the day of scheduled cesarean delivery and postpartum day 1. Results A total of 178 women were recruited. The demographic and obstetric characteristics were similar between the two groups. The pre-operative STAI scores of the intervention and control groups were 42.9 and 44.1 points, respectively, with no significant difference. However, the post-operative anxiety score showed a significant decline in the intervention group compared to that in the control group (p = 0.002). Moreover, most of the participants in the intervention group showed a low level of anxiety after the operation, while half of the control group remained at a moderate to high level score. Conclusions The provision of an informative educational video before cesarean delivery is a powerful tool that significantly reduces cesarean operative anxiety and improves health outcomes.

                Future viability depends on ensuring a sustainable society because green energy methods may efficiently reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Nevertheless, stakeholders, consumers, and developers continue to be notably ignorant of the financial incentives connected to green technology. Moreover, there is still a dearth of studies on the range of financial incentives offered by different authorities in India. Monetary incentives, such as tax breaks, indirect tax exemptions, and refunds, are crucial in encouraging the use of green technology in the modern world. This study explores the importance of financial incentives for green building technologies in India, which also looks at the wide range of incentives provided by federal, state, and local governments. Furthermore, the study highlights various state government programs such as goods subsidies, exemptions from local taxes, and fee waivers. Notably, several incentives aimed at consumers, developers, and other stakeholders have been implemented by the Indian Green Building Council (IGBC). This review study emphasizes the effectiveness of financial incentives in green construction projects and draws attention to a clear knowledge gap regarding the adoption of green technology. This study also provides insights into potential future directions. Studies and research results emphasize the importance of spreading the word about financial incentives as a key factor in determining the adoption of green technologies. Many parties, including governmental organizations, municipal governments, developers, and clients engaged in green building technology projects, stand to gain increased awareness.

An exploration using a novel, value-based, publication metric framework: the EMPIRE Index [version 4; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background The EMPIRE (EMpirical Publication Impact and Reach Evaluation) Index is a value-based, multi-component metric framework to assess the impact of medical publications in terms of relevance to different stakeholders. It comprises three component scores (social, scholarly and societal impact), each incorporating related altmetrics that indicate a different aspect of engagement with the publication. Here, we present an exploratory investigation of whether publication types or disease indications influence EMPIRE Index scores. Methods Article-level metrics were extracted and EMPIRE Index scores were calculated for 5825 journal articles published from 1 May 2017 to 1 May 2018, representing 12 disease indications (chosen to reflect a wide variety of common and rare diseases with a variety of aetiologies) and five publication types. Results There were significant differences in scores between article types and disease indications. Median (95% CI) social and scholarly impact scores ranged from 1.2 (0.3–1.6) to 4.8 (3.1–6.6), respectively, for phase 3 clinical trials, and from 0.3 (0.3–0.4) to 2.3 (1.9–2.6), respectively, for observational studies. Social and scholarly impact scores were highest for multiple sclerosis publications and lowest for non-small cell lung cancer publications. Systematic reviews achieved greater impact than regular reviews. Median trends in the social impact of different disease areas matched the level of public interest as assessed through Google search interest. Although most articles did not register societal impact, mean societal impact scores were highest for migraine publications. Conclusions The EMPIRE Index successfully identified differences in impact by disease area and publication type, which supports the notion that the impact of each publication needs to be evaluated in the context of these factors, and potentially others. These findings should be considered when using the EMPIRE Index to assess publication impact.

An often-overlooked aspect of biology is formed by the outliers of the protein length distribution, specifically those proteins with more than 5000 amino acids, which we refer to as huge proteins (HPs). By examining UniprotKB, we discovered more than 41 000 HPs throughout the tree of life, with the majority found in eukaryotes. Notably, the phyla with the highest propensity for huge proteins are Apicomplexa and Fornicata. Moreover, we observed that certain bacteria, such as Elusomicrobia or Planctomycetota, have a higher tendency for encoding huge proteins, even more than the average eukaryote. To investigate if these macro-polypeptides represent “real” proteins, we explored several indirect metrics. Additionally, orthology analyses reveals thousands of clusters of homologous sequences of HPs, revealing functional groups related to key cellular processes such as cytoskeleton organization and functioning as chaperones or as E3-ubiquitin ligases in eukaryotes. In the case of bacteria, the major clusters have functions related to Non-Ribosomomal peptide synthesis/Polyketide synthesis, followed by pathogen-host attachment or recognition surface proteins. Further exploration of the annotations for each HPs supported the previously identified functional groups. These findings underscore the need for further investigation of the cellular and ecological roles of these HPs and their potential impact on biology and biotechnology.

In addition to the classical HLA genes, the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) harbors a high number of other polymorphic genes with less established roles in disease associations and transplantation matching. To facilitate studies of the non-classical and non-HLA genes in large patient and biobank cohorts, we trained imputation models for <i>MICA</i>, <i>MICB</i>, <i>HLA-E</i>, <i>HLA-F</i> and <i>HLA-G</i> alleles on genome SNP array data. We show, using both population-specific and multi-population 1000 Genomes references, that the alleles of these genes can be accurately imputed for screening and research purposes. The best imputation model for <i>MICA</i>, <i>MICB</i>, <i>HLA-E</i>, <i>-F</i> and <i>-G</i> achieved a mean accuracy of 99.3% (min, max: 98.6, 99.9). Furthermore, validation of the 1000 Genomes exome short-read sequencing-based allele calling against a clinical-grade reference data showed an average accuracy of 99.8%, testifying for the quality of the 1000 Genomes data as an imputation reference. We also fitted the models for Infinium Global Screening Array (GSA, Illumina, Inc.) and Axiom Precision Medicine Research Array (PMRA, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) SNP content, with mean accuracies of 99.1% (97.2, 100) and 98.9% (97.4, 100), respectively.

Dengue virus (DENV) is currently causing epidemics of unprecedented scope in endemic settings and expanding to new geographical areas. It is therefore critical to track this virus using genomic surveillance. However, the complex patterns of viral genomic diversity make it challenging to use the existing genotype classification system. Here, we propose adding 2 sub-genotypic levels of virus classification, named major and minor lineages. These lineages have high thresholds for phylogenetic distance and clade size, rendering them stable between phylogenetic studies. We present an assignment tool to show that the proposed lineages are useful for regional, national, and subnational discussions of relevant DENV diversity. Moreover, the proposed lineages are robust to classification using partial genome sequences. We provide a standardized neutral descriptor of DENV diversity with which we can identify and track lineages of potential epidemiological and/or clinical importance. Information about our lineage system, including methods to assign lineages to sequence data and propose new lineages, can be found at: dengue-lineages.org.

Ancient divergences within Opisthokonta—a major lineage that includes organisms in the kingdoms Animalia, Fungi, and their unicellular relatives—remain contentious. To assess progress toward a genome-scale Opisthokonta phylogeny, we conducted the most taxon rich phylogenomic analysis using sets of genes inferred with different orthology inference methods and established the geological timeline of Opisthokonta diversification. We also conducted sensitivity analysis by subsampling genes or taxa from the full data matrix based on filtering criteria previously shown to improve phylogenomic inference. We found that approximately 85% of internal branches were congruent across data matrices and the approaches used. Notably, the use of different orthology inference methods was a substantial contributor to the observed incongruence: analyses using the same set of orthologs showed high congruence of 97% to 98%, whereas different sets of orthologs resulted in somewhat lower congruence (87% to 91%). Examination of unicellular Holozoa relationships suggests that the instability observed across varying gene sets may stem from weak phylogenetic signals. Our results provide a comprehensive Opisthokonta phylogenomic framework that will be useful for illuminating ancient evolutionary episodes concerning the origin and diversification of the 2 major eukaryotic kingdoms and emphasize the importance of investigating effects of orthology inference on phylogenetic analyses to resolve ancient divergences.

<p>Schematic of glymphatic system and hypothetical influence factors in MMD. CSF crosses the perivascular space from arteries entering the interstitium and drives metabolic waste toward perivenous spaces. Advanced Suzuki stage, abnormal anastomoses, and decreased CBF in MMD would alter para-arterial CSF flow. Enlarged perivascular space (EPVS) and deep and subcortical white matter hyperintensities (DSWMH) are markers of neuronal dysfunction, small vessel damage, and blocked glymphatic system circulation. These factors are associated with DTI-ALPS in MMD. CSF, cerebrospinal fluid; DTI-ALPS, diffusion tensor imaging analysis along perivascular spaces; ISF, interstitial fluid; MMD, moyamoya disease.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Assessing the glymphatic system activity using diffusion tensor imaging analysis along with the perivascular space (DTI-ALPS) may be helpful to understand the pathophysiology of moyamoya disease (MMD). 63 adult patients with MMD and 20 healthy controls (HCs) were included for T1-weighted images, T2-FLAIR, pseudocontinuous arterial spin labeling, and DTI. 60 patients had digital subtraction angiography more than 6 months after combined revascularization. The Suzuki stage, postoperative Matsushima grade, periventricular anastomoses (PA), enlarged perivascular spaces (EPVS), deep and subcortical white matter hyperintensities (DSWMH), DTI-ALPS, cerebral blood flow (CBF), and cognitive scales of MMD patients were assessed. MMD patients were divided into early and advanced stage based on the Suzuki stage. We detected lower DTI-ALPS in patients with advanced stage relative to HCs (<i>p</i> = 0.046) and patients with early stage (<i>p</i> = 0.004), hemorrhagic MMD compared with ischemic MMD (<i>p</i> = 0.048), and PA Grade 2 compared with Grade 0 (<i>p</i> = 0.010). DTI-ALPS was correlated with the EPVS in basal ganglia (<i>r</i> = −0.686, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), Suzuki stage (<i>r</i> = −0.465, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), DSWMH (<i>r</i> = −0.423, <i>p</i> = 0.001), and global CBF (<i>r</i> = 0.300, <i>p</i> = 0.017) and cognitive scores (<i>r</i> = 0.343, <i>p</i> = 0.018). The DTI-ALPS of patients with good postoperative collateral formation was higher compared to those with poor postoperative collateral formation (<i>p</i> = 0.038). In conclusion, the glymphatic system was impaired in advanced MMD patients and may affected cognitive function and postoperative neoangiogenesis.</p>

<br/>
<p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating, age-associated neurodegenerative disorder and the most common cause of dementia. The clinical continuum of AD spans from preclinical disease to subjective cognitive decline, mild cognitive impairment, and dementia stages (mild, moderate, and severe). Neuropathologically, AD is defined by the accumulation of amyloid β (Aβ) into extracellular plaques in the brain parenchyma and in the cerebral vasculature, and by abnormally phosphorylated tau that accumulates intraneuronally forming neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Development of treatment approaches that prevent or even reduce the cognitive decline because of AD has been slow compared to other major causes of death. Recently, the United States Food and Drug Administration gave full approval to 2 different Aβ-targeting monoclonal antibodies. However, this breakthrough disease modifying approach only applies to a limited subset of patients in the AD continuum and there are stringent eligibility criteria. Furthermore, these approaches do not prevent progression of disease, because other AD-related pathologies, such as NFTs, are not directly targeted. A non-mutually exclusive alternative is to address lifestyle interventions that can help reduce the risk of AD and AD-related dementias (ADRD). It is estimated that addressing such modifiable risk factors could potentially delay up to 40% of AD/ADRD cases. In this review, we discuss some of the many modifiable risk factors that may be associated with prevention of AD/ADRD and/or increasing brain resilience, as well as other factors that may interact with these modifiable risk factors to influence AD/ADRD progression.

                <p>Socioeconomic status (SES) is a multi-faceted theoretical construct associated with stroke risk and outcomes. Knowing which SES measures best correlate with population stroke metrics would improve its accounting in observational research and inform interventions. Using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Population Level Analysis and Community Estimates (PLACES) and other publicly available databases, we conducted an ecological study comparing correlations of different United States county-level SES, health care access and clinical risk factor measures with age-adjusted stroke prevalence. The prevalence of adults living below 150% of the federal poverty level most strongly correlated with stroke prevalence compared to other SES and non-SES measures (correlation coefficient = 0.908, <i>R</i>

                <p>Many antiseizure medications cause apoptotic cell death in developing brains. The newer antiseizure medication lacosamide is increasingly used in neonates and infants. Neurotoxicity of lacosamide and its combination with levetiracetam was studied in neonatal mice. Animals received single or repeat injections of saline, phenobarbital (75mg/kg), lacosamide (20–40mg/kg), levetiracetam (100mg/kg), lacosamide (40mg/kg) + levetiracetam (100mg/kg) and euthanized at 6 to 30 hours. Cells undergoing apoptosis were increased in the brains of phenobarbital-treated animals. Densities of apoptotic profiles following lacosamide and levetiracetam treatment did not differ from saline-treated controls. Findings suggest that lacosamide, levetiracetam and their combination do not cause apoptosis in developing mouse brains. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:812–818</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To investigate whether choroid plexus volumes in subacute coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients with neurological symptoms could indicate inflammatory activation or barrier dysfunction and assess their association with clinical data.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Choroid plexus volumes were measured in 28 subacute COVID-19 patients via cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), compared with those in infection-triggered non-COVID-19 encephalopathy patients (n = 25), asymptomatic individuals after COVID-19 (n = 21), and healthy controls (n = 21). Associations with inflammatory serum markers (peak counts of leukocytes, C-reactive protein [CRP], interleukin 6), an MRI-based marker of barrier dysfunction (CSF volume fraction [V-CSF]), and clinical parameters like olfactory performance and cognitive scores (Montreal Cognitive Assessment) were investigated.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>COVID-19 patients showed significantly larger choroid plexus volumes than control groups (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001, η<sup>2</sup> = 0.172). These volumes correlated significantly with peak leukocyte levels (<i>p</i> = 0.001, Pearson's r = 0.621) and V-CSF (<i>p</i> = 0.009, Spearman's rho = 0.534), but neither with CRP nor interleukin 6. No significant correlations were found with clinical parameters.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>In patients with subacute COVID-19, choroid plexus volume is a marker of central nervous system inflammation and barrier dysfunction in the presence of neurologic symptoms. The absence of plexus enlargement in infection-triggered non-COVID-19 encephalopathy suggests a specific severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 effect. This study also documents an increase in choroid plexus volume for the first time as a parainfectious event. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:715–725</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Multiple acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency (MADD) is a disorder of fatty acid oxidation and considered an inborn error of metabolism. In recent years, we have diagnosed an increasing number of patients where, despite extensive investigation, no disease-causing mutations have been found. We therefore investigated a cohort of consecutive patients, with the objective to detect possible non-genetic causes.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We searched the patient records and the registry of muscle biopsies, for patients with MADD, diagnosed within the past 10 years. The patient records were reviewed regarding symptoms, clinical findings, comorbidities, drugs, diagnostic investigations, and response to treatment. In addition, complementary investigations of muscle tissue were performed.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified 9 patients diagnosed with late-onset MADD. All presented with muscle weakness and elevated levels of creatine kinase. A lipid storage myopathy was evident in the muscle biopsies, as was elevated acylcarnitines in blood. Despite thorough genetic investigations, a probable genetic cause was found in only 2 patients. Remarkably, all 7 patients without disease-causing mutations were treated with sertraline. In some cases, a deterioration of symptoms closely followed dose increase, and discontinuation resulted in an improved acylcarnitine profile. All 9 patients responded to riboflavin treatment with normalization of creatine kinase and muscle biopsy findings, and in 8 patients the clinical symptoms clearly improved.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings strongly suggest that sertraline may induce an acquired form of MADD in some patients. Importantly, riboflavin treatment seems to be similarly effective as in genetic MADD, but discontinuation of sertraline is reasonably warranted. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:802–811</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To assess comparative effectiveness, safety, and tolerability of off-label rituximab, compared with frequently used therapies approved for multiple sclerosis (MS).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A Swedish cohort study of persons with relapsing–remitting MS, age 18 to 75 years at inclusion and with a first therapy start or a first therapy switch between 2011 and 2018. Low-dose rituximab was compared with MS-approved therapies. Primary outcomes were proportions with 12 months confirmed disability worsening and change in MS Impact Scale-29 (MSIS-29) scores, respectively. Secondary endpoints included relapses, therapy discontinuation, and serious adverse events. Analyses used an intention-to-treat approach and were adjusted for demographics, MS features, and health characteristics.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We included 2,449 participants as first therapy start and 2,463 as first therapy switch. Proportions with disability worsening at 3 years were 9.1% for rituximab as first therapy and 5.1% after therapy switch, with no differences to MS-approved comparators. Worsening on rituximab was mostly independent of relapses. MSIS-29 with rituximab at 3 years improved by 1.3/8.4 points (physical/psychological) for first disease-modifying therapy (DMT) and 0.4/3.6 for DMT switch, and was mostly similar across therapies. Rituximab had lower relapse rates and higher therapy persistence in both groups. The rate of hospital-treated infections was higher with rituximab after a therapy switch, but not as a first therapy.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This population-based real-world cohort study found low rates of disability progression, mostly independent of relapses, and without significant differences between rituximab and MS-approved comparators. Rituximab led to lower rates of inflammatory activity and higher treatment persistence, but was associated with an increased rate of serious infections. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:678–693</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27015?af=R">Lesions Causing Alice in Wonderland Syndrome Map to a Common Brain Network Linking Body and Size Perception</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Alice in Wonderland syndrome (AIWS) profoundly affects human perception of size and scale, particularly regarding one's own body and the environment. Its neuroanatomical basis has remained elusive, partly because brain lesions causing AIWS can occur in different brain regions. Here, we aimed to determine if brain lesions causing AIWS map to a distributed brain network.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A retrospective case–control study analyzing 37 cases of lesion-induced AIWS identified through systematic literature review was conducted. Using resting-state functional connectome data from 1,000 healthy individuals, the whole-brain connections of each lesion were estimated and contrasted with those from a control dataset comprising 1,073 lesions associated with 25 other neuropsychiatric syndromes. Additionally, connectivity findings from lesion-induced AIWS cases were compared with functional neuroimaging results from 5 non-lesional AIWS cases.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>AIWS-associated lesions were located in various brain regions with minimal overlap (≤33%). However, the majority of lesions (≥85%) demonstrated shared connectivity to the right extrastriate body area, known to be selectively activated by viewing body part images, and the inferior parietal cortex, involved in size and scale judgements. This pattern was uniquely characteristic of AIWS when compared with other neuropsychiatric disorders (family-wise error-corrected <i>p &lt;</i> 0.05) and consistent with functional neuroimaging observations in AIWS due to nonlesional causes (median correlation <i>r =</i> 0.56, interquartile range 0.24).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>AIWS-related perceptual distortions map to one common brain network, encompassing regions critical for body representation and size-scale processing. These findings lend insight into the neuroanatomical localization of higher-order perceptual functions, and may inform future therapeutic strategies for perceptual disorders.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27017?af=R">Association of Mismatch Profiles and Clinical Outcome from Endovascular Therapy in Large Infarct: A Post‐Hoc Analysis of the ANGEL‐ASPECT Trial</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>We investigated whether patients with large infarct and the presence or absence of perfusion mismatch are associated with endovascular treatment benefit.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This is a post-hoc analysis of the Endovascular Therapy in Anterior Circulation Large Vessel Occlusion with a Large Infarct (ANGEL-ASPECT) randomized trial, which enrolled patients within 24 hours of onset with ASPECTS 3 to 5 or ASPECTS 0 to 2 with an infarct core 70 to 100 ml. Mismatch ratio was defined as time-to-maximum (T<sub>max</sub>) &gt;6 s cerebral volume/ischemic core volume, and mismatch volume was defined as T<sub>max</sub> &gt;6 s volume minus ischemic core volume. We divided patients into mismatch ratio ≥1.2 and mismatch volume ≥10 ml, and mismatch ratio ≥1.8 and mismatch volume ≥15 ml groups. The primary outcome was the 90-day modified Rankin Scale score ordinal distribution. Safety outcomes were symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage and 90-day mortality.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>There were 425 patients included. In both the mismatch ratio ≥1.2 and mismatch volume ≥10 ml (mismatch+, <i>n</i> = 395; mismatch−, <i>n</i> = 31) and mismatch ratio ≥1.8 and mismatch volume ≥15 ml groups (mismatch+, <i>n</i> = 346; mismatch−, <i>n</i> = 80), better 90-day modified Rankin Scale outcomes were found in the endovascular treatment group compared with the MM group (4 [2–5] vs 4 [3–5], common odds ratio [cOR], 1.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3–2.7, <i>p</i> = 0.001; 4 [2–5] vs 4 [3–5], cOR, 1.9, 95% CI 1.3–2.8, <i>p</i> = 0.001, respectively), but not in patients without mismatch ratio ≥1.2 and mismatch volume ≥10 ml (5 [3–6] vs 5 [4–6], cOR, 1.2, 95% CI 0.3–4.1, <i>p</i> = 0.83), and mismatch ratio ≥1.8 and mismatch volume ≥15 ml (4 [3–6] vs 5 [3–6], cOR, 1.2, 95% CI 0.6–2.7, <i>p</i> = 0.60). However, no interaction effect was found in both subgroups (<i>p</i> interaction &gt;0.10).</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Endovascular treatment was more efficacious than MM in patients with mismatch profiles, but no treatment effect or interaction was noted in the no mismatch profile patients. However, the small sample size of patients with no mismatch may have underpowered our analysis. A pooled analysis of large core trials stratified by mismatch is warranted.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Most paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia (PKD) cases are hereditary, yet approximately 60% of patients remain genetically undiagnosed. We undertook the present study to uncover the genetic basis for undiagnosed PKD patients.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Whole-exome sequencing was performed for 106 <i>PRRT2</i>-negative PKD probands. The functional impact of the genetic variants was investigated in HEK293T cells and <i>Drosophila</i>.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Heterozygous variants in <i>KCNJ10</i> were identified in 11 individuals from 8 unrelated families, which accounted for 7.5% (8/106) of the <i>PRRT2</i>-negative probands. Both co-segregation of the identified variants and the significantly higher frequency of rare <i>KCNJ10</i> variants in PKD cases supported impacts from the detected <i>KCNJ10</i> heterozygous variants on PKD pathogenesis. Moreover, a <i>KCNJ10</i> mutation-carrying father from a typical EAST/SeSAME family was identified as a PKD patient. All patients manifested dystonia attacks triggered by sudden movement with a short episodic duration. Patch-clamp recordings in HEK293T cells revealed apparent reductions in K<sup>+</sup> currents of the patient-derived variants, indicating a loss-of-function. In <i>Drosophila</i>, milder hyperexcitability phenotypes were observed in heterozygous <i>Irk2</i> knock-in flies compared to homozygotes, supporting haploinsufficiency as the mechanism for the detected heterozygous variants. Electrophysiological recordings showed that excitatory neurons in <i>Irk2</i> haploinsufficiency flies exhibited increased excitability, and glia-specific complementation with human Kir4.1 rescued the <i>Irk2</i> mutant phenotypes.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our study established haploinsufficiency resulting from heterozygous variants in <i>KCNJ10</i> can be understood as a previously unrecognized genetic cause for PKD and provided evidence of glial involvement in the pathophysiology of PKD. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:758–773</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27019?af=R">Metabolic Syndrome and Risk of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis: Insights from a Large‐Scale Prospective Study</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Although metabolic abnormalities are implicated in the etiology of neurodegenerative diseases, their role in the development of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) remains a subject of controversy. We aimed to identify the association between metabolic syndrome (MetS) and the risk of ALS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This study included 395,987 participants from the UK Biobank to investigate the relationship between MetS and ALS. Cox regression model was used to estimate hazard ratios (HR). Stratified analyses were performed based on gender, body mass index (BMI), smoking status, and education level. Mediation analysis was conducted to explore potential mechanisms.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In this study, a total of 539 cases of ALS were recorded after a median follow-up of 13.7 years. Patients with MetS (defined harmonized) had a higher risk of developing ALS after adjusting for confounding factors (HR: 1.50, 95% CI: 1.19–1.89). Specifically, hypertension and high triglycerides were linked to a higher risk of ALS (HR: 1.53, 95% CI: 1.19–1.95; HR: 1.31, 95% CI: 1.06–1.61, respectively). Moreover, the quantity of metabolic abnormalities showed significant results. Stratified analysis revealed that these associations are particularly significant in individuals with a BMI &lt;25. These findings remained stable after sensitivity analysis. Notably, mediation analysis identified potential metabolites and metabolomic mediators, including alkaline phosphatase, cystatin C, γ-glutamyl transferase, saturated fatty acids to total fatty acids percentage, and omega-6 fatty acids to omega-3 fatty acids ratio.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>MetS exhibits a robust association with an increased susceptibility to ALS, particularly in individuals with a lower BMI. Furthermore, metabolites and metabolomics, as potential mediators, provide invaluable insights into the intricate biological mechanisms. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:788–801</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Elevated entorhinal cortex (EC) tau in low beta-amyloid individuals can predict accumulation of pathology and cognitive decline. We compared the accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-derived locus coeruleus integrity, neocortical beta-amyloid burden by positron emission tomography (PET), and hippocampal volume in identifying elevated entorhinal tau signal in asymptomatic individuals who are considered beta-amyloid PET-negative.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We included 188 asymptomatic individuals (70.78 ± 11.51 years, 58% female) who underwent 3T-MRI of the locus coeruleus, Pittsburgh compound-B (PiB), and Flortaucipir (FTP) PET. Associations between elevated EC tau and neocortical PiB, hippocampal volume, or locus coeruleus integrity were evaluated and compared using logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic analyses in the PiB− sample with a clinical dementia rating (CDR) of 0. Associations with clinical progression (CDR-sum-of-boxes) over a time span of 6 years were evaluated with Cox proportional hazard models.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified 26 (21%) individuals with high EC FTP in the CDR = 0/PiB− sample. Locus coeruleus integrity was a significantly more sensitive and specific predictor of elevated EC FTP (area under the curve [AUC] = 85%) compared with PiB (AUC = 77%) or hippocampal volume (AUC = 76%). Based on the Youden-index, locus coeruleus integrity obtained a sensitivity of 77% and 85% specificity. Using the resulting locus coeruleus Youden cut-off, lower locus coeruleus integrity was associated with a two-fold increase in clinical progression, including mild cognitive impairment.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Locus coeruleus integrity has promise as a low-cost, non-invasive screening instrument to detect early cortical tau deposition and associated clinical progression in asymptomatic, low beta-amyloid individuals. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:650–661</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To evaluate the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytokine/chemokine profile of central nervous system (CNS) neurosarcoidosis (NS), and its utility in differential diagnosis, treatment, and prognostication.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In this case–control study, we validated 17 cytokines/chemokines (interleukin [IL]-1-beta, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-13, IL-17A, BAFF, IL-8/CXCL8, CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL13, GM-CSF, interferon-gamma, and tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha) in a multiplexed automated immunoassay system (ELLA; Bio-Techne, Minneapolis, MN, USA), and assessed them in CSF and serum of symptomatic patients with probable or definite CNS NS (01/2011–02/2023) with gadolinium enhancement and/or CSF pleocytosis. Patients with multiple sclerosis, primary CNS lymphoma, aquaporin-4 immunoglobulin G positivity, non-inflammatory disorders, and healthy individuals were used as controls.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 32 NS patients (59% women; median age, 59 years [19–81]) were included; concurrent sera were available in 12. CSF controls consisted of 26 multiple sclerosis, 8 primary CNS lymphoma, 84 aquaporin-4 immunoglobulin G positive, and 34 patients with non-inflammatory disorders. Gadolinium enhancement was present in 31 of 32 NS patients, and CSF pleocytosis in 27 of 32 (84%). CSF IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, IL-13, BAFF, IL-8/CXCL8, CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL13, GM-CSF, interferon-gamma, and TNF-alpha levels were significantly higher in NS patients compared with non-inflammatory controls (<i>p</i> ≤ 0.02); elevations were more common in CSF than serum. Concurrent elevation of IL-6, CXCL9, CXCL10, GM-CSF, interferon-gamma, and TNF-alpha was present in 18 of 32 NS patients, but only in 1 control. Elevated IL-6, IL-10, IL-13, CXCL9, CXL10, GM-CSF, and TNF-alpha associated with measures of disease activity.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>NS CSF cytokine/chemokine profiles suggest T cell (mainly T helper cell type 1), macrophage, and B-cell involvement. These signatures aid in NS diagnosis, indicate disease activity, and suggest therapeutic avenues. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:704–714</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To investigate the association between infections and disability worsening in people with multiple sclerosis (MS) treated with either B-cell depleting therapy (rituximab) or interferon-beta/glatiramer acetate (IFN/GA).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This cohort study spanned from 2000 to 2021, using data from the Swedish MS Registry linked to national health care registries, comprising 8,759 rituximab and 7,561 IFN/GA treatment episodes. The risk of hospital-treated infection was estimated using multivariable Cox models. The association between infections and increase in Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores was assessed using a doubly robust generalized estimating equations model. Additionally, a piece-wise exponential model analyzed events of increased disability beyond defined cut-off values, controlling for relapses, and MRI activity.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Compared with IFN/GA, rituximab displayed increased risk of both inpatient- and outpatient-treated infections (hazard ratio [HR], 2.08; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.50–2.90 and HR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.13–1.67, respectively). An inpatient-treated infection was associated with a 0.19-unit increase in EDSS (95% CI, 0.12–0.26). Degree of worsening was greatest for progressive MS, and under IFN/GA treatment, which unlike rituximab, was more commonly associated with MRI activity. After controlling for relapses and MRI activity, inpatient-treated infections were associated with disability worsening in people with relapsing–remitting MS treated with IFN/GA (HR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.59–2.53), but not in those treated with rituximab.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Compared to IFN/GA, rituximab doubled the infection risk, but reduced the risk of subsequent disability worsening. Further, the risk of worsening after hospital-treated infection was greater with progressive MS than with relapsing–remitting MS. Infection risk should be considered to improve long term outcomes.

                <h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is a rare autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease. Objective surrogate markers sensitive to detect changes in disease severity are needed to reduce sample sizes in interventional trials and identification of predictors of faster disease progression would facilitate patient selection, enrichment, or stratification in such trials.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed a prospective 1-year longitudinal, multimodal study in 34 ataxic SCA1 individuals and 21 healthy controls. We collected clinical, patient-reported outcomes, biochemical and magnetic resonance (MR) biomarkers at baseline and after 1 year. We determined 1-year progression and evaluated the potential predictive value of several baseline markers on 1-year disease progression.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>At baseline, multiple structural and spectroscopic MR markers in pons and cerebellum differentiated SCA1 from healthy controls and correlated with disease severity. Plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) neurofilament light (NfL) chain and CSF glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were elevated in SCA1. In longitudinal analysis, total brainstem and pontine volume change, inventory of non-ataxia signs (INAS) count, and SCA functional index (SCAFI) showed larger responsiveness compared to the Scale for Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA).</p>
<p>Longer disease duration, longer non-expanded CAG repeat length, and higher disease burden were associated with faster SARA increase after 1-year in the SCA1 group. Similarly, lower baseline brainstem, pontine, and cerebellar volumes, as well as lower levels of N-acetylaspartate and glutamate in the cerebellar white matter, were also associated with faster SARA increase.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results guide the selection of the most sensitive measures of disease progression in SCA1 and have identified features associated with accelerated progression that could inform the design of clinical trials. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:774–787</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Blepharospasm (BSP), focal dystonia with the highest risk of spread, lacks clear understanding of early spreading risk factors and objective prognostic indicators. We aimed to identify these risk factors through clinical and electrophysiological assessments, and to establish a predictive model for dystonic spread in BSP.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We prospectively followed BSP patients for 4 years, collecting data on dystonic spread, and conducting electrophysiological evaluations. The blink reflex, masseter inhibitory reflex, and trigeminal somatosensory evoked potential were assessed. Univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to assess clinical characteristics associated with BSP dystonic spread. A predictive model was constructed using a nomogram, and performance of the model was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 136 enrolled participants (mean age 56.34 years) completed a 4-year follow-up. Among them, 62 patients (45.6%) showed spread to other body regions. Multivariable Cox regression analysis showed that a high Hamilton Anxiety Scale score (hazard ratio 1.19, 95% confidence interval 1.13–1.25, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), prolonged trigeminal somatosensory evoked potential mandibular branch P1-N2 peak interval (hazard ratio 1.11, 95% confidence interval 1.02–1.21, <i>p</i> = 0.017), and elevated trigeminal somatosensory evoked potential mandibular branch P1-N2 peak amplitude (hazard ratio 1.26, 95% confidence interval 1.12–1.41, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) were independent risk factors for BSP dystonic spread within 4 years. Combining these factors, the predictive models demonstrated excellent discriminative ability, with the receiver operating characteristic curve score being 0.797, 0.790, 0.847, and 0.820 at 1, 2, 3 and 4 years after enrollment, respectively.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We established a predictive model with significant value for anticipating dystonic spread in BSP, offering crucial evidence. These findings contribute essential insights into the early clinical identification of the development and evolution of BSP diseases. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:747–757</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Training clinician–scientists is a primary objective of many academic neurology departments, as these individuals are uniquely positioned to perform insightful clinical or laboratory-based research informed both by clinical knowledge and their own experiences caring for patients. Despite its importance, training clinician–scientists has perhaps never been so challenging. The National Institute of Neurologic Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) R25 program was designed in an attempt to support these individuals, decrease the time needed to obtain National Institutes of Health K awards, and to help educate a cohort of trainees preparing for a career in academic neurology. We endeavored to describe the structure and features of the program while examining its outcomes.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>R25 outcome data from 2009 to 2024 were reviewed. Statistical comparisons were made using 2-sided Mann–Whitney <i>U</i> testing.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 67% of adult neurologists who received an R25 had a successful application for a National Institutes of Health K award compared with 45% of adult neurologists who had not received R25 support (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001). Among child neurologists, 73% who applied went on to receive K funding after R25 support, compared with 45% who had not been part of the R25 program (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). The average time between completion of residency and obtaining a K award for R25 participants was decreased by 26 months among those with an MD/PhD degree, and 32 months for those with an MD degree compared with non-R25 individuals.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The R25 program has been successful in achieving its training goals, but stands as only one component of support for aspiring clinician–scientists. Investments and commitments made by academic neurology departments are key to supporting this success. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:625–632</p>

                Background Dentocraniofacial asymmetry is a common condition that affects many individuals. Accurate diagnosis of this condition is essential for effective treatment planning. Aim This study aimed to compare the diagnosis of dentocraniofacial asymmetry using two-dimensional and three-dimensional methods. Methods A cross-sectional, observational study was conducted at the Orthodontic Specialist Clinic of the Dental Hospital Faculty of Dentistry, University of Indonesia from March to April 2023. The study included 15 patients who had not undergone orthodontic treatment and were diagnosed with dentocraniofacial asymmetry. The study compared the results of diagnosing asymmetry in 15 different facial features, including the anterior nasal spine, upper and lower first incisors, pterygomaxillary fissure, orbita, menton, porion, upper and lower first molars, coronoid process, gonion, zygoma, latero nasale, and jugulare. Results The study found that there was no significant difference in the diagnosis of dentocraniofacial symmetry between the two- and three-dimensional methods across all 15 parameters measured. The researchers used Fisher's Exact Test to compare the proportion between dependent variables and found that the p-value was greater than 0.05, indicating that there was no significant difference in the diagnosis of dentocraniofacial symmetry between the two methods. The study also used Kappa Cohen analysis to measure the strength of agreement between the diagnosis of dentocraniofacial symmetry of the two-dimensional and three-dimensional methods on each parameter. Conclusion The findings of this study suggest that both two-dimensional and three-dimensional methods are equally effective in diagnosing dentocraniofacial asymmetry. This information may be useful for orthodontists in deciding which method to use when diagnosing dentocraniofacial asymmetry.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/11-779/v2?src=rss">Optimal timing for lithium levels [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Reddy and Reddy (2014) discuss the optimal timing for lithium levels in patients taking once-daily extended-release lithium formulations. They argue for blood sampling 24 h after the previous dose rather than the standard 12 h. I interpret the data quite differently. The authors start with the assumption that the clinician wants a trough level. I disagree. What one wants is to be able to compare a patient’s lithium level to the large body of published knowledge about lithium dosing. Almost all of that data comes from standard 12-h blood draws with plain (immediate-release) lithium carbonate or lithium citrate. So, the real question of interest is, with extended-release lithium formulations, at what time point does one draw the lithium level to compare most accurately with a standard 12-h blood draw with plain lithium carbonate? The answer is not obvious because extended-release formulations affect only the absorption and not the excretion of lithium. Their primary benefit is reducing the transient peak lithium serum concentration, not delaying the (already relatively slow) elimination of lithium. Emami and colleagues (2004) provide the needed data. First they show that 90% of the administered dose of a commercial extended-release formulation (Eskalith CR®) is absorbed by 4 h after a dose, and ~100% is absorbed by 8 h (their Figure 2A). Second, they show that at 12 h after a dose, the blood levels for immediate and extended release formulations are essentially identical (their Figure 3).  Thus 12 h after the previous dose is the ideal time for drawing blood levels for extended-release lithium tablets.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-649/v2?src=rss">Psychological interventions for early-phase schizophrenia: protocol for a systematic review and network meta-analysis [version 2; peer review: 2 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction Treating the early phase of schizophrenia is crucial for preventing further episodes and improving quality of life, functioning, and social inclusion. Pharmacotherapies are first-line treatments, but have limitations. There is consensus on the need for non-pharmacological interventions for individuals in the early phase of schizophrenia. Several psychological interventions have shown promising effects; however, their comparative effectiveness remains largely unknown. To address this issue, a network meta-analysis will be performed. We aim to develop a hierarchy of existing psychological treatments concerning their efficacy and tolerability, which will inform treatment guidelines. Protocol Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating psychological interventions for first-episode psychosis, first-episode schizophrenia, or early phase schizophrenia will be included. The primary outcome will be overall schizophrenia symptoms (measured up to 6 and 12 months, and at the longest follow-up) and relapse as a co-primary outcome. Secondary outcomes are premature discontinuation; change in positive, negative, and depressive symptoms of schizophrenia; response; quality of life; overall functioning; satisfaction with care; adherence; adverse events; and mortality. The study selection and data extraction are performed by two independent reviewers. We will assess the risk of bias of each study using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool 2 and evaluate the confidence in the results using Confidence in Network Meta-Analysis (CINeMA). Subgroup and sensitivity analyses will be conducted to explore heterogeneity and assess the robustness of our findings. Discussion This systematic review and network meta-analysis aims to compare multiple existing psychological interventions, establishing which are best for symptom reduction, relapse prevention, and other important outcomes in early phase schizophrenia. Our results may provide practical guidance concerning the most effective psychological intervention to reduce symptom severity and the societal burden associated with the disorder.
