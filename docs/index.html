Contrary to this intuition, we find that blind and sighted adults share causal understanding of color, despite not always agreeing about arbitrary color facts. Relative...

                Glycoconjugates play major roles in the infectious cycle of the trypanosomatid parasite Leishmania. While GDP-Fucose synthesis is essential, fucosylated glycoconjugates have not been reported in Leishmania major [H. Guo et al., J. Biol. Chem. 292, 10696–10708 (2017)]. Four predicted fucosyltransferases appear conventionally targeted to the secretory pathway; SCA1/2 play a...

                Perhaps the most magnificent animal building structure is the honeybee wax comb—a double-sided sheet of tessellated, near-horizontal hexagonal cells. The cells are built either side of a common backplane that forms a base for those to either side. This typically highly regular structure has been shown to be mathematically optimal...

                Skeletal muscle and bone homeostasis are regulated by members of the myostatin/GDF-11/activin branch of the transforming growth factor-β superfamily, which share many regulatory components, including inhibitory extracellular binding proteins and receptors that mediate signaling. Here, we present the results of genetic studies demonstrating a critical role for the binding protein...

                <p>The origin of human metaplastic states and their propensity for cancer is poorly understood. Barrett&rsquo;s esophagus is a common metaplastic condition that increases the risk for esophageal adenocarcinoma, and its cellular origin is enigmatic. To address this, we harvested tissues spanning the gastroesophageal junction from healthy and diseased donors, including isolation of esophageal submucosal glands. A combination of single-cell transcriptomic profiling, in silico lineage tracing from methylation, open chromatin and somatic mutation analyses, and functional studies in organoid models showed that Barrett&rsquo;s esophagus originates from gastric cardia through c-MYC and HNF4A-driven transcriptional programs. Furthermore, our data indicate that esophageal adenocarcinoma likely arises from undifferentiated Barrett&rsquo;s esophagus cell types even in the absence of a pathologically identifiable metaplastic precursor, illuminating early detection strategies.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Structural basis for target site selection in RNA-guided DNA transposition systems</a></h4>

              
                <p>CRISPR-associated transposition systems allow guide RNA&ndash;directed integration of a single DNA cargo in one orientation at a fixed distance from a programmable target sequence. We used cryo&ndash;electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to define the mechanism that underlies this process by characterizing the transposition regulator, TnsC, from a type V-K CRISPR-transposase system. In this scenario, polymerization of adenosine triphosphate&ndash;bound TnsC helical filaments could explain how polarity information is passed to the transposase. TniQ caps the TnsC filament, representing a universal mechanism for target information transfer in Tn7/Tn7-like elements. Transposase-driven disassembly establishes delivery of the element only to unused protospacers. Finally, TnsC transitions to define the fixed point of insertion, as revealed by structures with the transition state mimic ADP&bull;AlF<SUB>3</SUB>. These mechanistic findings provide the underpinnings for engineering CRISPR-associated transposition systems for research and therapeutic applications.</p>

                <p>The oomycete <I>Phytophthora infestans</I> is a damaging crop pathogen and a model organism to study plant-pathogen interactions. We report the discovery of a family of copper-dependent lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) in plant pathogenic oomycetes and its role in plant infection by <I>P. infestans</I>. We show that LPMO-encoding genes are up-regulated early during infection and that the secreted enzymes oxidatively cleave the backbone of pectin, a charged polysaccharide in the plant cell wall. The crystal structure of the most abundant of these LPMOs sheds light on its ability to recognize and degrade pectin, and silencing the encoding gene in <I>P. infestans</I> inhibits infection of potato, indicating a role in host penetration. The identification of LPMOs as virulence factors in pathogenic oomycetes opens up opportunities in crop protection and food security.</p>

                <p>Harnessing the potential wide-ranging quantum science applications of molecules will require control of their interactions. Here, we used microwave radiation to directly engineer and tune the interaction potentials between ultracold calcium monofluoride (CaF) molecules. By merging two optical tweezers, each containing a single molecule, we probed collisions in three dimensions. The correct combination of microwave frequency and power created an effective repulsive shield, which suppressed the inelastic loss rate by a factor of six, in agreement with theoretical calculations. The demonstrated microwave shielding shows a general route to the creation of long-lived, dense samples of ultracold polar molecules and evaporative cooling.</p>

Polyacetals are promising candidates for CRM but lack useful tensile strengths owing to the low molecular weights produced using current uncontrolled cationic ring-opening polymerization (CROP) methods. Here, we present reversible-deactivation CROP of cyclic acetals using a commercial halomethyl ether initiator and an indium(III) bromide catalyst. Using this method, we synthesize poly(1,3-dioxolane) (PDXL), which demonstrates tensile strength comparable to some commodity polyolefins. Depolymerization of PDXL using strong acid catalysts returns monomer in near-quantitative yield and even proceeds from a commodity plastic waste mixture. Our efficient polymerization method affords a tough thermoplastic that can undergo selective depolymerization to monomer.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">A characteristic optical variability time scale in astrophysical accretion disks</a></h4>

              
                <p>Accretion disks around supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei produce continuum radiation at ultraviolet and optical wavelengths. Physical processes in the accretion flow lead to stochastic variability of this emission on a wide range of time scales. We measured the optical continuum variability observed in 67 active galactic nuclei and the characteristic time scale at which the variability power spectrum flattens. We found a correlation between this time scale and the black hole mass extending over the entire mass range of supermassive black holes. This time scale is consistent with the expected thermal time scale at the ultraviolet-emitting radius in standard accretion disk theory. Accreting white dwarfs lie close to this correlation, suggesting a common process for all accretion disks.</p>

                <p>Molecular time trees indicating that embryophytes originated around 500 million years ago (Ma) during the Cambrian are at odds with the record of fossil plants, which first appear in the mid-Silurian almost 80 million years later. This time gap has been attributed to a missing fossil plant record, but that attribution belies the case for fossil spores. Here, we describe a Tremadocian (Early Ordovician, about 480 Ma) assemblage with elements of both Cambrian and younger embryophyte spores that provides a new level of evolutionary continuity between embryophytes and their algal ancestors. This finding suggests that the molecular phylogenetic signal retains a latent evolutionary history of the acquisition of the embryophytic developmental genome, a history that perhaps began during Ediacaran-Cambrian time but was not completed until the mid-Silurian (about 430 Ma).</p>

The coexistence of magnetic fluctuations and superconductivity, together with the crystal structure of this material, suggests that a distinctive set of symmetries, magnetic properties, and topology underlie the superconducting state. Here, we report observations of a nonzero polar Kerr effect and of two transitions in the specific heat upon entering the superconducting state, which together suggest that the superconductivity in UTe<SUB>2</SUB> is characterized by a two-component order parameter that breaks time-reversal symmetry. These data place constraints on the symmetries of the order parameter and inform the discussion on the presence of topological superconductivity in UTe<SUB>2</SUB>.</p>

                <p>Little is known about woolly mammoth (<I>Mammuthus primigenius</I>) mobility and range. Here we use high temporal resolution sequential analyses of strontium isotope ratios along an entire 1.7-meter-long tusk to reconstruct the movements of an Arctic woolly mammoth that lived 17,100 years ago, during the last ice age. We use an isotope-guided random walk approach to compare the tusk&rsquo;s strontium and oxygen isotope profiles to isotopic maps. Our modeling reveals patterns of movement across a geographically extensive range during the animal&rsquo;s ~28-year life span that varied with life stages. Maintenance of this level of mobility by megafaunal species such as mammoth would have been increasingly difficult as the ice age ended and the environment changed at high latitudes.</p>

                <p>Total daily energy expenditure ("total expenditure") reflects daily energy needs and is a critical variable in human health and physiology, but its trajectory over the life course is poorly studied. We analyzed a large, diverse database of total expenditure measured by the doubly labeled water method for males and females aged 8 days to 95 years. Total expenditure increased with fat-free mass in a power-law manner, with four distinct life stages. Fat-free mass&ndash;adjusted expenditure accelerates rapidly in neonates to ~50% above adult values at ~1 year; declines slowly to adult levels by ~20 years; remains stable in adulthood (20 to 60 years), even during pregnancy; then declines in older adults. These changes shed light on human development and aging and should help shape nutrition and health strategies across the life span.</p>

                <p>A Western-style, high-fat diet promotes cardiovascular disease, in part because it is rich in choline, which is converted to trimethylamine (TMA) by the gut microbiota. However, whether diet-induced changes in intestinal physiology can alter the metabolic capacity of the microbiota remains unknown. Using a mouse model of diet-induced obesity, we show that chronic exposure to a high-fat diet escalates <I>Escherichia coli</I> choline catabolism by altering intestinal epithelial physiology. A high-fat diet impaired the bioenergetics of mitochondria in the colonic epithelium to increase the luminal bioavailability of oxygen and nitrate, thereby intensifying respiration-dependent choline catabolism of <I>E. coli</I>. In turn, <I>E. coli</I> choline catabolism increased levels of circulating trimethlamine <I>N</I>-oxide, which is a potentially harmful metabolite generated by gut microbiota.</p>

                <p>Neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) elicited against the receptor binding site (RBS) of the spike protein of wild-type severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are generally less effective against recent variants of concern. RBS residues Glu<sup>484</sup>, Lys<sup>417</sup>, and Asn<sup>501</sup> are mutated in variants first described in South Africa (B.1.351) and Brazil (P.1). We analyzed their effects on angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 binding, as well as the effects of two of these mutations (K417N and E484K) on nAbs isolated from COVID-19 patients. Binding and neutralization of the two most frequently elicited antibody families (IGHV3-53/3-66 and IGHV1-2), which can both bind the RBS in alternative binding modes, are abrogated by K417N, E484K, or both. These effects can be structurally explained by their extensive interactions with RBS nAbs. However, nAbs to the more conserved, cross-neutralizing CR3022 and S309 sites were largely unaffected. The results have implications for next-generation vaccines and antibody therapies.</p>

                <p>Capturing the heterogeneous phenotypes of microbial populations at relevant spatiotemporal scales is highly challenging. Here, we present par-seqFISH (parallel sequential fluorescence in situ hybridization), a transcriptome-imaging approach that records gene expression and spatial context within microscale assemblies at a single-cell and molecule resolution. We applied this approach to the opportunistic pathogen <I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I>, analyzing about 600,000 individuals across dozens of conditions in planktonic and biofilm cultures. We identified numerous metabolic- and virulence-related transcriptional states that emerged dynamically during planktonic growth, as well as highly spatially resolved metabolic heterogeneity in sessile populations. Our data reveal that distinct physiological states can coexist within the same biofilm just several micrometers away, underscoring the importance of the microenvironment. Our results illustrate the complex dynamics of microbial populations and present a new way of studying them at high resolution.</p>

                <p>The neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) acts in part through a family of nicotinic ACh receptors (nAChRs), which mediate diverse physiological processes including muscle contraction, neurotransmission, and sensory transduction. Pharmacologically, nAChRs are responsible for tobacco addiction and are targeted by medicines for hypertension and dementia. Nicotinic AChRs were the first ion channels to be isolated. Recent studies have identified molecules that control nAChR biogenesis, trafficking, and function. These nAChR accessories include protein and chemical chaperones as well as auxiliary subunits. Whereas some factors act on many nAChRs, others are receptor specific. Discovery of these regulatory mechanisms is transforming nAChR research in cells and tissues ranging from central neurons to spinal ganglia to cochlear hair cells. Nicotinic AChR&ndash;specific accessories also enable drug discovery on high-confidence targets for psychiatric, neurological, and auditory disorders.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Prevalence of substance abuse and its associated factors among medical students: a cross-sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Substance abuse by medical students poses a significant risk not only on their personal life but also on their professional life by putting their patients at risk. Our study aims to find out the prevalence of substance abuse and factors associated with it among medical students. Methods: A descriptive, online-questionnaire based, cross-sectional study was carried out at Gandaki Medical College, a medical school in Gandaki Province of Nepal. Whole sampling technique was used. SPSS-25.0 software was used for statistical analysis. Descriptive statistics were used for analyzing demographic and substance abuse related variables. Chi square and Fishers exact test was used to find out if any differences existed in substance abuse by demographic characteristics. Results: Among 420 eligible participants, 219 participated in the survey (response rate: 52.2%). Alcohol was the most commonly used substance with overall lifetime prevalence of 58% followed by cigarette smoking and illegal drug abuse at 21.9% and 13.7%, respectively. The abuse of substances was significantly higher (p<0.05) in males, who were offered substances by friends, and amongst study participants who worked with an intoxicated colleague. The most common reason for substance abuse was “For pleasure, curiosity or to go along with friends” (23%, n=18). Major and minor dysfunction due to alcohol abuse was reported by 8(3.7%) and 33(15.1%) participants, while the same dysfunctions due to drug abuse were reported by 1(0.5%) and 14(6.4%) participants, respectively. Conclusions: The prevalence of substance abuse was high among medical students and was found to be associated with male gender, if offer of substances were made by friends, and amongst those who worked with an intoxicated colleague. This problem of substance abuse among medical students should be addressed timely as failing to do so might have serious consequences on the healthcare system of the country.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Whole genome sequencing of colonies derived from cannabis flowers and the impact of media selection on benchmarking total yeast and mold detection tools [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Cannabis products are subjected to microbial testing for human pathogenic fungi and bacteria. These testing requirements often rely on non-specific colony forming unit (CFU/g) specifications without clarity on which medium, selection or growth times are required. We performed whole genome sequencing to assess the specificity of colony forming units (CFU) derived from three different plating media: Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA), PDA with chloramphenicol and Dichloran Rose Bengal with chloramphenicol (DRBC). Methods: Colonies were isolated from each medium type and their whole genomes sequenced to identify the diversity of microbes present on each medium selection. Fungal Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS3) and Bacterial 16S RNA(16S) quantitative polymerase chain reactions (qPCR) were performed, to correlate these CFUs with fungi- and bacterial- specific qPCR. Results: Each plating medium displayed a ten-fold difference in CFU counts. PDA with chloramphenicol showed the highest diversity and the highest concordance with whole genome sequencing. According to ITS3 and 16S qPCR confirmed with whole genome sequencing, DRBC under counted yeast and mold while PDA without chloramphenicol over counted CFUs due to bacterial growth without selection. Conclusions: Colony Forming Unit regulations lack specificity. Each medium produces significant differences in CFU counts. These are further dependent on subjective interpretation, failure to culture most microbes, and poor selection between bacteria and fungi. Given the most human pathogenic microbes found on cannabis are endophytes which culture fails to detect, molecular methods offer a solution to this long-standing quantification problem in the cannabis testing field.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Future land use change simulations for the Lepelle River Basin using Cellular Automata Markov model with Land Change Modeller-generated transition areas [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Land cover/land cover (LULC) change is one of the major contributors to global environmental and climate variations. The ability to predict future LULC is crucial for environmental engineers, civil engineers, urban designers, and natural resources managers for planning activities. Methods: TerrSet Geospatial Monitoring and Modelling System and ArcGIS Pro 2.8 were used to process LULC data for the region of the Lepelle River Basin (LRB) of South Africa. Driver variables such as population density, slope, elevation as well as the Euclidean distances of cities, roads, highways, railroads, parks and restricted areas, towns to the LRB in combination with LULC data were analysed using the Land Change Modeller (LCM) and Cellular-Automata Markov (CAM) model. Results: The results reveal an array of losses (-) and gains (+) for certain LULC classes in the LRB by the year 2040: natural vegetation (+8.5%), plantations (+3.5%), water bodies (-31.6%), bare ground (-8.8%), cultivated land (-29.3%), built-up areas (+10.6%) and mines (+14.4%). Conclusions: The results point to the conversion of land uses from natural to anthropogenic by 2040. These changes also highlight how the potential losses associated with resources such as water that will negatively impact society and ecosystem functioning in the LRB by exacerbating water scarcity driven by climate change. This modelling study provides a decision support system for the establishment of sustainable land resource utilization policies in the LRB.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">LMO2 is essential to maintain the ability of progenitors to differentiate into T-cell lineage in mice</a></h4>

              
                Notch signaling primarily determines T-cell fate. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the maintenance of T-lineage potential in pre-thymic progenitors remain unclear. Here, we established two murine <i>Ebf1</i>-deficient pro-B cell lines, with and without T-lineage potential. The latter expressed lower levels of <i>Lmo2</i>; their potential was restored via ectopic expression of <i>Lmo2</i>. Conversely, the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion of <i>Lmo2</i> resulted in the loss of the T-lineage potential. Introduction of <i>Bcl2</i> rescued massive cell death of Notch-stimulated pro-B cells without efficient LMO2-driven <i>Bcl11a</i> expression but was not sufficient to retain their T-lineage potential. Pro-B cells without T-lineage potential failed to activate <i>Tcf7</i> due to DNA methylation; <i>Tcf7</i> transduction restored this capacity. Moreover, direct binding of LMO2 to the <i>Bcl11a</i> and <i>Tcf7</i> loci was observed. Altogether, our results highlight LMO2 as a crucial player in the survival and maintenance of T-lineage potential in T-cell progenitors via the regulation of the expression of <i>Bcl11a</i> and <i>Tcf7</i>.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Gaps in global wildlife trade monitoring leave amphibians vulnerable</a></h4>

              
                As the biodiversity crisis continues, we must redouble efforts to understand and curb pressures pushing species closer to extinction. One major driver is the unsustainable trade of wildlife. Trade in internationally regulated species gains the most research attention, but this only accounts for a minority of traded species and we risk failing to appreciate the scale and impacts of unregulated legal trade. Despite being legal, trade puts pressure on wild species via: direct collection, introduced pathogens, and invasive species. Smaller species-rich vertebrates, such reptiles, fish, and amphibians, may be particularly vulnerable to trading because of gaps in regulations, small distributions, and demand of novel species. Here we combine data from five sources: online web searches in six languages, CITES trade database, LEMIS trade inventory, IUCN assessments, and a recent literature review, to characterise the global trade in amphibians, and also map use by purpose including meat, pets, medicinal and for research. We show that 1,215 species are being traded (17% of amphibian species), almost three times previous recorded numbers, 345 are threatened, and 100 data deficient or unassessed. Traded species origin hotspots include South American, China, and Central Africa; sources indicate 42% of amphibians are taken from the wild. Newly described species can be rapidly traded (mean time lag of 6.5 years), including threatened and unassessed species. The scale and limited regulation of the amphibian trade, paired with the triptych of connected pressures (collection, pathogens, invasive species), warrants a re-examination of the wildlife trade status-quo, application of the precautionary principle in regards to wildlife trade, and a renewed push to achieve global biodiversity goals.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Loss of N1-methylation of G37 in tRNA induces ribosome stalling and reprograms gene expression</a></h4>

              
                <i>N</i><sup>1</sup>-methylation of G37 is required for a subset of tRNAs to maintain the translational reading-frame. While loss of m<sup>1</sup>G37 increases ribosomal +1 frameshifting, whether it incurs additional translational defects is unknown. Here we address this question by applying ribosome profiling to gain a genome-wide view of the effects of m<sup>1</sup>G37 deficiency on protein synthesis. Using <i>E. coli</i> as a model, we show that m<sup>1</sup>G37 deficiency induces ribosome stalling at codons that are normally translated by m<sup>1</sup>G37-containing tRNAs. Stalling occurs during decoding of affected codons at the ribosomal A site, indicating a distinct mechanism than that of +1 frameshifting, which occurs after the affected codons leave the A site. Enzyme- and cell-based assays show that m<sup>1</sup>G37 deficiency reduces tRNA aminoacylation and in some cases peptide-bond formation. We observe changes of gene expression in m<sup>1</sup>G37 deficiency similar to those in the stringent response that is typically induced by deficiency of amino acids. This work demonstrates a previously unrecognized function of m<sup>1</sup>G37 that emphasizes its role throughout the entire elongation cycle of protein synthesis, providing new insight into its essentiality for bacterial growth and survival.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A feedback loop between the androgen receptor and 6-phosphogluoconate dehydrogenase (6PGD) drives prostate cancer growth</a></h4>

              
                Alterations to the androgen receptor (AR) signalling axis and cellular metabolism are hallmarks of prostate cancer. This study provides insight into both hallmarks by uncovering a novel link between AR and the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). Specifically, we identify 6-phosphogluoconate dehydrogenase (<i>6PGD</i>) as an androgen-regulated gene that is upregulated in prostate cancer. AR increased the expression of <i>6PGD </i>indirectly via activation of sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP1). Accordingly, loss of 6PGD, AR or SREBP1 resulted in suppression of PPP activity, as revealed by 1,2-<sup>13</sup>C<sub>2</sub> glucose metabolic flux analysis. Knockdown of 6PGD also impaired growth and elicited death of prostate cancer cells, at least in part due to increased oxidative stress. We investigated the therapeutic potential of targeting 6PGD using two specific inhibitors, physcion and S3, and observed substantial anti-cancer activity in multiple models of prostate cancer, including aggressive, therapy-resistant models of castration-resistant disease as well as prospectively-collected patient-derived tumour explants. Targeting of 6PGD was associated with two important tumour-suppressive mechanisms: first, increased activity of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which repressed anabolic growth-promoting pathways regulated by ACC1 and mTOR; and second, enhanced AR ubiquitylation, associated with a reduction in AR protein levels and activity. Supporting the biological relevance of positive feedback between AR and PGD, pharmacological co-targeting of both factors was more effective in suppressing the growth of prostate cancer cells than single agent therapies. Collectively, this work provides new insight into the dysregulated metabolism of prostate cancer and provides impetus for further investigation of co-targeting AR and the PPP as a novel therapeutic strategy.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The cAMP effector PKA mediates Moody GPCR signaling in Drosophila blood-brain barrier formation and maturation</a></h4>

              
                The blood-brain barrier (BBB) of <i>Drosophila </i>is comprised of a thin epithelial layer of subperineural glia (SPG), which ensheath the nerve cord and insulate it against the potassium-rich hemolymph by forming intercellular septate junctions (SJs). Previously, we identified a novel Gi/Go protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), Moody, as a key factor in BBB formation at the embryonic stage. However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms of Moody signaling in BBB formation and maturation remain unclear. Here, we identify cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) as a crucial antagonistic Moody effector that is required for the formation, as well as for the continued SPG growth and BBB maintenance in the larva and adult stage. We show that PKA is enriched at the basal side of the SPG cell and that this polarized activity of the Moody/PKA pathway finely tunes the enormous cell growth and BBB integrity. Moody/PKA signaling precisely regulates the actomyosin contractility, vesicle trafficking, and the proper SJ organization in a highly coordinated spatiotemporal manner. These effects are mediated in part by PKA's molecular targets MLCK and Rho1. Moreover, 3D reconstruction of SJ ultrastructure demonstrates that the continuity of individual SJ segments, and not their total length, is crucial for generating a proper paracellular seal. Based on these findings, we propose that polarized Moody/PKA signaling plays a central role in controlling the cell growth and maintaining BBB integrity during the continuous morphogenesis of the SPG secondary epithelium, which is critical to maintain tissue size and brain homeostasis during organogenesis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sulfonylureas target the neurovascular response to decrease Alzheimer's pathology</a></h4>

              
                Hyperexcitability is a defining feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD), where aberrant neuronal activity is both a cause and consequence of AD. Therefore, identifying novel targets that modulate cellular excitability is an important strategy for treating AD. ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels are metabolic sensors that modulate cellular excitability. Sulfonylureas are KATP channel antagonists traditionally used to combat hyperglycemia in diabetic patients by inhibiting pancreatic KATP channels, thereby stimulating insulin release. However, KATP channels are not limited to the pancreas and systemic modulation of KATP channels has pleotropic physiological effects, including profound effects on vascular function. Here, we demonstrate that human AD patients have higher cortical expression of vascular KATP channels, important modulators of vasoreactivity. We demonstrate that peripheral treatment with the sulfonylurea and KATP channel inhibitor, glyburide, reduced the aggregation and activity-dependent production of amyloid-beta (A{beta}), a hallmark of AD, in mice. Since glyburide does not readily cross the blood brain barrier, our data suggests that glyburide targets vascular KATP channel activity to reduce arterial stiffness, improve vasoreactivity, and normalize pericyte-endothelial cell morphology, offering a novel therapeutic target for AD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Iba1+ cell density and morphology classification at postnatal day 10 in four hippocampal subregions of female and male C57BL/6J mice</a></h4>

              
                Microglia maintain normal brain function and support the brain's response to disease and injury. The hippocampus is an area of focus for microglial study due to its central role in numerous behavioral and cognitive functions. Interestingly, microglia and related cells in the hippocampus and throughout the brain are distinct in male vs. female rodents, even in early life. Indeed, postnatal day (P)-dependent sex differences in number, density, and morphology of microglia-like cells have been reported in certain hippocampal subregions. For example, P3 female mice have more phagocytic microglia in dentate gyrus (DG) molecular layer (Mol) and CA1-3 stratum oriens (SO) regions vs. male mice, while P8 -- but not P15 -- male rats have more volume immunoreactive for markers of microglia-like cells (Iba1 and CD68) in the CA1 stratum radiatum (SR) vs. female rats. In the mouse, P10 is roughly equivalent to human term gestation, making it a common time point to study for many translationally-relevant neurobiological processes. However, sex differences in hippocampal microglia have not been examined in the P10 mouse hippocampus. In addition, key subregions of the hippocampus -- CA3 SR, DG hilus -- have not yet been assessed for sex differences in microglia. To address these knowledge gaps, we quantified Iba1+ cell densities and classified Iba1+ cell morphology in P10 male and female C57BL/6J mice. Four subregions in the bilateral anterior hippocampus were analyzed in 40-m coronal sections: DG Mol (Mol), DG Hilus, CA1 SR and stratum lacunosum moleculare (CA1), and CA3 SR and stratum lucidum (CA3). Light microscope images (40x) were analyzed offline for Iba1+ cell density and morphology by an observer blind to sex. The morphology of each Iba1+ cell was used to place cells into one of four previously-published categories: Round or ameboid (round-ish soma, no processes), Stout (round-ish soma, short process), Thick (irregular soma with few, thick processes), or Thin (irregular soma with multiple thin processes). Analysis of Iba1+ cell density shows no difference between male and female mice in Mol, Hilus, CA3, or CA1 (male n=6, female n=7). However, morphology classification shows a sex-dependent difference in the Mol and Hilus, with female mice having a greater percentage of Thick Iba1+ cells vs. male mice (Mol, Hilus), and a lower percentage of Thin Iba1+ cells vs. male mice (Mol). With our analysis, it is unclear whether this greater percentage of thick and lower percentage of thin Iba1+ cells in the female vs. male hippocampus means Iba1+ microglia in female mice are ''younger'' or ''more active'' than those in male mice. However, these data are important as they reveal sex differences in Iba1+ microglia in the P10 mouse hippocampus. We discuss these results in the context of the large literature on sex differences in rodent microglia in the early postnatal period.

                The subiculum is positioned at a critical juncture at the interface of the hippocampus with the rest of the brain. However, the exact roles of the subiculum in most hippocampal-dependent memory tasks remain largely unknown. One obstacle to make analytical comparisons of neural firing patterns between the subiculum and hippocampal CA1 is the broad firing fields of the subicular cells. Here, we used spiking phases in relation to theta rhythm to parse the broad firing field of a subicular neuron into multiple subfields to find the unique functional contribution of the subiculum while male rats performed a hippocampal-dependent visual scene memory task. Some of the broad firing fields of the subicular neurons were successfully divided into multiple subfields by using the theta-phase precession cycle. The resulting phase-based fields in the subiculum were more similar to those in CA1 in terms of the field size and phase-precession strength. The new method significantly improved the detection of task-relevant information in subicular cells without affecting the information content represented by CA1 cells. Notably, multiple fields of a single subicular neuron, unlike those in the CA1, could carry heterogeneous task-related information such as visual context and choice response. Our findings suggest that the subicular cells integrate multiple task-related factors by using theta rhythm to associate environmental context with action.

                Schizophrenia (Scz) is a brain disorder that has a typical onset in early adulthood but otherwise maintains unknown disease origins. Unfortunately, little progress has been made in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying neurodevelopment of Scz due to ethical and technical limitations in accessing developing human brain tissue. To overcome this challenge, we have previously utilized patient-derived Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs) to generate self-developing, self-maturating, and self-organizing 3D brain-like tissue known as cerebral organoids. As a continuation of this prior work [1], here we provide a molecular architectural map of the developing Scz organoid proteome. Utilizing iPSCs from n = 25 human donors (n = 8 healthy Ctrl donors, and n = 17 Scz patients), we generated 3D human cerebral organoids, employed 16-plex isobaric sample-barcoding chemistry, and simultaneously subjected samples to comprehensive high-throughput liquid-chromatography/mass-spectrometry (LC/MS) quantitative proteomics. Of 3,705 proteins identified by high-throughput proteomic profiling, we identified that just ~2.62% of the organoid global proteomic landscape was differentially regulated in Scz organoids. In sum, just 43 proteins were up-regulated and 54 were down-regulated in Scz patient-derived organoids. Notably, a range of neuronal factors were depleted in Scz organoids (e.g., MAP2, TUBB3, SV2A, GAP43, CRABP1, NCAM1 etc.). Based on global enrichment analysis, alterations in key pathways that regulate nervous system development (e.g., axonogenesis, axon development, axon guidance, morphogenesis pathways regulating neuronal differentiation, as well as substantia nigra development) were perturbed in Scz patient-derived organoids. We also identified prominent alterations in two novel GWAS factors, Pleiotrophin (PTN) and Podocalyxin (PODXL), in Scz organoids. In sum, this work serves as both a report and a resource whereby researchers can leverage human-derived neurodevelopmental data from Scz patients, which can be used to mine, compare, contrast, or orthogonally validate novel factors and pathways related to Scz risk identified in datasets from observational clinical studies and other model systems.

                Androgens regulate behavioural flexibility, which is essential to adapt to a changing environment and depends on the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Testosterone (T) administration decreases behavioural flexibility. It is well known that T is produced in the gonads, but T is also produced in the mesocorticolimbic system, which modulates behavioural flexibility. It is unclear how T produced in the brain versus the gonads influences behavioural flexibility. Here, we assess the effects of the androgen synthesis inhibitor abiraterone acetate (ABI) and long-term gonadectomy (GDX) on behavioural flexibility in two paradigms. In Experiment 1, ABI independent of GDX reduced the number of trials to criterion and perseverative errors in a strategy set-shifting task. Similarly, in Experiment 2, ABI but not GDX reduced perseverative errors in a reversal learning task. In subjects from Experiment 1, we also examined tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity (TH-ir), and ABI but not GDX increased TH-ir in the mPFC. Our findings suggest that neurally-produced androgens modulate behavioural flexibility via modification of dopamine signalling in the mesocorticolimbic system. These results suggest novel roles for neurosteroids and possible side effects of ABI treatment for prostate cancer.

                Lack of physical activity is a predictor of poor health outcomes that can be prevented or reversed by exercise. Sedentary lifestyle, chronic disease or microgravity can cause muscle deconditioning that then has an impact on other physiological systems. An example is the nervous system, which is adversely affected by decreased physical activity resulting in increased incidence of neurological problems such as chronic pain. We sought to better understand how this might occur by conducting RNA sequencing experiments on muscle biopsies from human volunteers in a 5-week bed-rest study with an exercise intervention arm. We also used a computational method for examining ligand-receptor interactions between muscle and human dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, the latter of which play a key role in nociception and are generators of signals responsible for chronic pain. We identified 1352 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in bed rest subjects without an exercise intervention but only 132 DEGs in subjects with the intervention. Thirty-six genes were shared between the exercise and no intervention groups. Among 591 upregulated muscle genes in the no intervention arm, 26 of these were ligands that have receptors that are expressed by human DRG neurons. We detected a specific splice variant of one of these ligands, placental growth factor (PGF), in deconditioned muscle that binds to neuropilin 1, a receptor that is highly expressed in DRG neurons and known to promote neuropathic pain. We conclude that exercise intervention protects muscle from deconditioning transcriptomic changes, and prevents changes in expression of ligands that might sensitize DRG neurons that promote pain. Our work creates a set of actionable hypotheses to better understand how deconditioned muscle may influence the function of sensory neurons that innervate the entire body.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Deep learning based behavioral profiling of rodent stroke recovery</a></h4>

              
                Stroke research heavily relies on rodent behavior when assessing underlying disease mechanisms and treatment efficacy. Although functional motor recovery is considered the primary targeted outcome, tests in rodents are still poorly reproducible, and often unsuitable for unraveling the complex behavior after injury. Here, we provide a comprehensive 3D gait analysis of mice after focal cerebral ischemia based on the new deep learning-based software (DeepLabCut, DLC) that only requires basic behavioral equipment. We demonstrate a high precision 3D tracking of 10 body parts (including all relevant joints and reference landmarks) in several mouse strains with an accuracy of 99.4%. Building on this rigor motion tracking, a comprehensive post-analysis (with >100 parameters) unveils biologically relevant differences in locomotor profiles after a stroke over a time course of three weeks. We further refine the widely used ladder rung test using deep learning and compare its performance to human annotators. The generated DLC-assisted tests were then benchmarked to five widely used conventional behavioral set-ups (neurological scoring, rotarod, ladder rung walk, cylinder test, and single-pellet grasping) regarding sensitivity, accuracy, time use and costs. We conclude that deep learning-based motion tracking with comprehensive post-analysis provides accurate and sensitive data to describe the complex recovery of rodents following a stroke. The experimental set-up and analysis can also benefit a range of other neurological injuries that affect locomotion.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Identification of Subpallial Neuronal Populations Across Zebrafish Larval Stages that Express Molecular Markers for the Striatum</a></h4>

              
                Striatal neurons within the basal ganglia play a central role in vertebrate action selection; however, their location in larval zebrafish is not well defined. We assayed for conserved striatal markers in the zebrafish subpallium using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunohistochemistry. Whole mount FISH revealed an inhibitory neuronal cluster rostral to the anterior commissure that expresses tac1, the gene that encodes the precursor peptide for substance P. This molecular profile is shared by mammalian striatal direct pathway neurons. A second partially overlapping population of inhibitory neurons was identified that expresses penka, the gene that encodes the precursor peptide for enkephalin. This molecular profile is shared by striatal indirect pathway neurons. Immunostaining for substance P and enkephalin confirmed the presence of these peptides in the subpallium as well as the presence of dopaminergic innervation. The tac1 and penka populations were both found to increase linearly across larval stages. Together, these findings support the existence of a striatal homologue in larval zebrafish that grows to match the development and increasing behavioural complexity of the organism.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A gap-junction mutation in the mouse cochlea reveals cochlear amplification is driven by outer hair cell extracellular receptor potentials</a></h4>

              
                Cochlear amplification, whereby cochlear responses to low-to-moderate sound levels are 31 amplified and compressed to loud sounds, is attributed to outer hair cell (OHC) electromotility 32 driven by voltage changes across the OHC basolateral membranes due to sound-induced 33 receptor-current modulation. Cochlear operation at high acoustic frequencies is enigmatic 34 because the OHC intracellular receptor potential (RP) is severely attenuated at these 35 frequencies. Clues to understanding the voltage control of OHC electromotility at different 36 frequencies was provided by measurements from CD-1 mice with an A88V mutation of the 37 gap-junction (GJ) protein connexin 30 (Cx30), which with Cx26, form heterogeneous GJs 38 between supporting cells in the organ of Corti (OoC) and stria vascularis. The A88V mutation 39 results in a smaller GJ conductance which may explain why the resistance across the OoC in 40 CD-1Cx30A88V/A88V mutants is higher compared with wild-type mice. The endocochlear 41 potential, which drives the OHC receptor current and, consequently, the OHC RPs, is smaller 42 in CD-1Cx30A88V/A88V mutants. Even so, their high-frequency hearing sensitivity equals that of 43 wild-type mice. Preservation of high-frequency hearing correlates with similar amplitude of 44 extracellular receptor potentials (ERPs), measured immediately adjacent to the OHCs. ERPs 45 are generated through OHC receptor current flow across the OoC electrical resistance, which 46 is larger in CD-1Cx30A88V/A88V than in wild-type mice. Thus, smaller OHC receptor currents 47 flowing across a larger OoC resistance in CD-1Cx30A88V/A88V mice may explain why their ERP 48 magnitudes are similar to wild-type mice. It is proposed that the ERPs, which are not subject 49 to low-pass electrical filtering, drive high-frequency cochlear amplification.

	<p>In youths, callous–unemotional (CU) traits and conduct problems (CP) are independently associated with bullying perpetration and these effects are also observed when controlling for sex. Moreover, research indicates that the co-existence of high levels of both CU and CP further increase the risk. Although several studies have examined the relationship between CU traits and traditional bullying, few have also included a measure of cyberbullying and very few of them have focused the early adolescence. The aim of this study was to replicate and extend these findings in a large sample of Italian early adolescents considering both traditional and cyberbullying behaviors. Data were extracted from the Bullying and Youth Mental Health Naples study (BYMHNS) which included 2959 students of 10–15 years of age. CP, CU traits, traditional bullying behaviors, and cyberbullying behaviors were assessed by multi-item self-report scales. As expected, we replicated the significant and specific association between CU traits and traditional bullying, extending the findings to cyberbullying. In addition, in the latter case the effect was moderated by CP. The theoretical and clinical implications of these results were discussed.</p>

	<p>Despite improvements in diagnosis and treatment, multiple sclerosis (MS) is the leading neurological cause of disability in young adults. As a chronic disease, MS requires complex and challenging management. In this context, eHealth has gained an increasing relevance. Here, we aim to summarize beneficial features of a mobile app recently implemented in clinical MS routine as well as beyond MS. PatientConcept is a CE-certified, ID-associated multilingual software application allowing patients to record relevant health data without disclosing any identifying data. Patients can voluntarily share their health data with selected physicians. Since its implementation in 2018, about 3000 MS patients have used PatientConcept. Initially developed as a physician–patient communication platform, the app maps risk management plans of all current disease modifying therapies and thereby facilitates adherence to specified monitoring appointments. It also allows continuous monitoring of various PROs (PatientReportedOutcomes), enabling a broad overview of the disease course. In addition, various studies/projects currently assess monitoring, follow-up, diagnostics and telemetric evaluations of patients with other diseases beyond MS. Altogether, PatientConcept offers a broad range of possibilities to support physician–patient communication, implementation of risk management plans and assessment of PROs. It is a promising tool to facilitate patient-tailored management of MS and other chronic diseases.</p>

	<p>Impaired verbal ‘phonological’ short-term memory is considered a cardinal feature of the logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia (lv-PPA) and is assumed to underpin most of the language deficits in this syndrome. Clinically, examination of verbal short-term memory in individuals presenting with PPA is common practice and serves two objectives: (i) to help understand the possible mechanisms underlying the patient’s language profile and (ii) to help differentiate lv-PPA from other PPA variants or from other dementia syndromes. Distinction between lv-PPA and the non-fluent variant of PPA (nfv-PPA), however, can be especially challenging due to overlapping language profiles and comparable psychometric performances on verbal short-term memory tests. Here, we present case vignettes of the three PPA variants (lv-PPA, nfv-PPA, and the semantic variant (sv-PPA)) and typical Alzheimer’s disease (AD). These vignettes provide a detailed description of the short-term and working memory profiles typically found in these patients and highlight how speech output and language comprehension deficits across the PPA variants differentially interfere with verbal memory performance. We demonstrate that a combination of verbal short-term and working memory measures provides crucial information regarding the cognitive mechanisms underlying language disturbances in PPA. In addition, we propose that analogous visuospatial span tasks are essential for the assessment of PPA as they measure memory capacity without language contamination.</p>

     alt="Tonotopic distribution and inferior colliculus projection pattern of inhibitory and excitatory cell types in the lateral superior olive of Mongolian gerbils"/>
<p>In situ hybridization was used to identify inhibitory and excitatory principal neurons of the lateral superior olive (LSO) of Mongolian gerbil. Inhibitory LSO neurons were less numerous and projected contralaterally. One third of excitatory neurons projected ipsilaterally and were biased to the low-frequency limb of the LSO. This projection appears species specific in animals with good low frequency hearing.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Sound localization critically relies on brainstem neurons that compare information from the two ears. The conventional role of the lateral superior olive (LSO) is extraction of intensity differences; however, it is increasingly clear that relative timing, especially of transients, is also an important function. Cellular diversity within the LSO that is not well understood may underlie its multiple roles. There are glycinergic inhibitory and glutamatergic excitatory principal neurons in the LSO, however, there is some disagreement regarding their relative distribution and projection pattern. Here we employ in situ hybridization to definitively identify transmitter types combined with retrograde labeling of projections to the inferior colliculus (IC) to address these questions. Excitatory LSO neurons were more numerous (76%) than inhibitory ones. A smaller proportion of inhibitory neurons were IC-projecting (45% vs. 64% for excitatory) suggesting that inhibitory LSO neurons may have more projections to other regions such the lateral lemniscus or more distributed IC projections. Inhibitory LSO neurons almost exclusively projected ipsilaterally making up a sizeable proportion (41%) of the transmitter type-labeled ipsilateral IC projection from LSO and exhibited a moderate low frequency bias (10% difference H-L). Two thirds of excitatory neurons projected contralaterally and had a slight high frequency bias (4%). One third of excitatory LSO neurons projected ipsilaterally to the IC and these cells were strongly biased toward the low frequency limb of the LSO (37%). This projection appears to be species specific in animals with good low frequency hearing suggesting that it may be a specialization for such ability.</p>

                <p>Poststroke optogenetic stimulations can promote functional recovery. However, the circuit mechanisms underlying recovery remain unclear. Elucidating key neural circuits involved in recovery will be invaluable for translating neuromodulation strategies after stroke. Here, we used optogenetic functional magnetic resonance imaging to map brain-wide neural circuit dynamics after stroke in mice treated with and without optogenetic excitatory neuronal stimulations in the ipsilesional primary motor cortex (iM1). We identified key sensorimotor circuits affected by stroke. iM1 stimulation treatment restored activation of the ipsilesional corticothalamic and corticocortical circuits, and the extent of activation was correlated with functional recovery. Furthermore, stimulated mice exhibited higher expression of axonal growth&ndash;associated protein 43 in the ipsilesional thalamus and showed increased Synaptophysin<sup>+</sup>/channelrhodopsin<sup>+</sup> presynaptic axonal terminals in the corticothalamic circuit. Selective stimulation of the corticothalamic circuit was sufficient to improve functional recovery. Together, these findings suggest early involvement of corticothalamic circuit as an important mediator of poststroke recovery.</p>

                <p>Solid-state systems can host a variety of thermodynamic phases that can be controlled with magnetic fields, strain, or laser excitation. Many phases that are believed to exhibit exotic properties only exist on the nanoscale, coexisting with other phases that make them challenging to study, as measurements require both nanometer spatial resolution and spectroscopic information, which are not easily accessible with traditional x-ray spectromicroscopy techniques. Here, we use coherent diffractive imaging spectroscopy (CDIS) to acquire quantitative hyperspectral images of the prototypical quantum material vanadium oxide across the vanadium <I>L</I><SUB>2,3</SUB> and oxygen <I>K</I> x-ray absorption edges with nanometer-scale resolution. We extract the full complex refractive indices of the monoclinic insulating and rutile conducting phases of VO<SUB>2</SUB> from a single sample and find no evidence for correlation-driven phase transitions. CDIS will enable quantitative full-field x-ray spectromicroscopy for studying phase separation in time-resolved experiments and other extreme sample environments where other methods cannot operate.</p>

                <p>Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) is an abundant nuclear enzyme that plays important roles in DNA repair, chromatin organization and transcription regulation. Although binding and activation of PARP1 by DNA damage sites has been extensively studied, little is known about how PARP1 binds to long stretches of undamaged DNA and how it could shape chromatin architecture. Here, using single-molecule techniques, we show that PARP1 binds and condenses undamaged, kilobase-length DNA subject to sub-piconewton mechanical forces. Stepwise decondensation at high force and DNA braiding experiments show that the condensation activity is due to the stabilization of DNA loops by PARP1. PARP inhibitors do not affect the level of condensation of undamaged DNA but act to block condensation reversal for damaged DNA in the presence of NAD<sup>+</sup>. Our findings suggest a mechanism for PARP1 in the organization of chromatin structure.</p>

                <p>Human trophoblast stem cells (hTSCs) provide a valuable model to study placental development and function. While primary hTSCs have been derived from embryos/early placenta, and transdifferentiated hTSCs from nai&#x0308;ve human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), the generation of hTSCs from primed PSCs is problematic. We report the successful generation of TSCs from primed hPSCs and show that BMP4 substantially enhances this process. TSCs derived from primed hPSCs are similar to blastocyst-derived hTSCs in terms of morphology, proliferation, differentiation potential, and gene expression. We define the chromatin accessibility dynamics and histone modifications (H3K4me3/H3K27me3) that specify hPSC-derived TSCs. Consistent with low density of H3K27me3 in primed hPSC-derived hTSCs, we show that knockout of H3K27 methyltransferases (EZH1/2) increases the efficiency of hTSC derivation from primed hPSCs. Efficient derivation of hTSCs from primed hPSCs provides a simple and powerful model to understand human trophoblast development, including the pathogenesis of trophoblast-related disorders, by generating disease-specific hTSCs.</p>

                <p>Anticipating the medium- and long-term trajectory of pathogen emergence has acquired new urgency given the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. For many human pathogens, the burden of disease depends on age and previous exposure. Understanding the intersection between human population demography and transmission dynamics is therefore critical. Here, we develop a realistic age-structured mathematical model that integrates demography, social mixing, and immunity to establish a plausible range for future age incidence and mortality. With respect to COVID-19, we identify a plausible transition in the age structure of risks once the disease reaches seasonal endemism across a range of immunity durations and relative severity of primary versus subsequent reinfections. We train the model using diverse real-world demographies and age-structured mixing to bound expectations for changing age incidence and disease burden. The mathematical framework is flexible and can help tailor mitigation strategies in countries worldwide with varying demographies and social mixing patterns.</p>

                <p>Ceramic materials provide outstanding chemical and structural stability at high temperatures and in hostile environments but are susceptible to catastrophic fracture that severely limits their applicability. Traditional approaches to partially overcome this limitation rely on activating toughening mechanisms during crack growth to postpone fracture. Here, we demonstrate a more potent toughening mechanism that involves an intriguing possibility of healing the cracks as they form, even at room temperature, in an atomically layered ternary carbide. Crystals of this class of ceramic materials readily fracture along weakly bonded crystallographic planes. However, the onset of an abstruse mode of deformation, referred to as kinking in these materials, induces large crystallographic rotations and plastic deformation that physically heal the cracks. This implies that the toughness of numerous other layered ceramic materials, whose broader applications have been limited by their susceptibility to catastrophic fracture, can also be enhanced by microstructural engineering to promote kinking and crack-healing.</p>

                <p>Stochastic resonance, where noise synchronizes a system&rsquo;s response to an external drive, is a wide-reaching phenomenon found in noisy systems spanning from the dynamics of neurons to the periodicity of ice ages. Quantum tunneling can extend stochastic resonance to the quantum realm. We demonstrate quantum stochastic resonance for magnetic transitions in atoms by inelastic electron tunneling with a scanning tunneling microscope. Stochastic resonance is shown deep in the quantum regime, where spin-state fluctuations are driven by tunneling of the magnetization, and in a semiclassical crossover region, where thermally excited electrons drive transitions between ground and excited states. Inducing synchronization by periodically modulating transition rates provides a general mechanism to determine real-time spin dynamics ranging from milliseconds to picoseconds.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Spatial concepts of number, size, and time in an indigenous culture</a></h4>

              
                <p>In industrialized groups, adults implicitly map numbers, time, and size onto space according to cultural practices like reading and counting (e.g., from left to right). Here, we tested the mental mappings of the Tsimane&rsquo;, an indigenous population with few such cultural practices. Tsimane&rsquo; adults spatially arranged number, size, and time stimuli according to their relative magnitudes but showed no directional bias for any domain on any spatial axis; different mappings went in different directions, even in the same participant. These findings challenge claims that people have an innate left-to-right mapping of numbers and that these mappings arise from a domain-general magnitude system. Rather, the direction-specific mappings found in industrialized cultures may originate from direction-agnostic mappings that reflect the correlational structure of the natural world.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Orbital angular momentum multiplication in plasmonic vortex cavities</a></h4>

              
                <p>Orbital angular momentum of light is a core feature in photonics. Its confinement to surfaces using plasmonics has unlocked many phenomena and potential applications. Here, we introduce the reflection from structural boundaries as a new degree of freedom to generate and control plasmonic orbital angular momentum. We experimentally demonstrate plasmonic vortex cavities, generating a succession of vortex pulses with increasing topological charge as a function of time. We track the spatiotemporal dynamics of these angularly decelerating plasmon pulse train within the cavities for over 300 femtoseconds using time-resolved photoemission electron microscopy, showing that the angular momentum grows by multiples of the chiral order of the cavity. The introduction of this degree of freedom to tame orbital angular momentum delivered by plasmonic vortices could miniaturize pump probe&ndash;like quantum initialization schemes, increase the torque exerted by plasmonic tweezers, and potentially achieve vortex lattice cavities with dynamically evolving topology.</p>

                <p>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to burden society worldwide. Despite most patients having a mild course, severe presentations have limited treatment options. COVID-19 manifestations extend beyond the lungs and may affect the cardiovascular, nervous, and other organ systems. Current treatments are nonspecific and do not address potential long-term consequences such as pulmonary fibrosis, demyelination, and ischemic organ damage. Cell therapies offer great potential in treating severe COVID-19 presentations due to their customizability and regenerative function. This review summarizes COVID-19 pathogenesis, respective areas where cell therapies have potential, and the ongoing 89 cell therapy trials in COVID-19 as of 1 January 2021.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Protein detection in blood with single-molecule imaging</a></h4>

              
                <p>The ability to characterize individual biomarker protein molecules in patient blood samples could enable diagnosis of diseases at an earlier stage, when treatment is typically more effective. Single-molecule imaging offers a promising approach to accomplish this goal. However, thus far, single-molecule imaging methods have not been translated into the clinical setting. The detection limit of these methods has been confined to the picomolar (10<sup>&ndash;12</sup> M) range, several orders of magnitude higher than the circulating concentrations of biomarker proteins present in many diseases. Here, we describe single-molecule augmented capture (SMAC), a single-molecule imaging technique to quantify and characterize individual protein molecules of interest down to the subfemtomolar (&lt;10<sup>&ndash;15</sup> M) range. We demonstrate SMAC in a variety of applications with human blood samples, including the analysis of disease-associated secreted proteins, membrane proteins, and rare intracellular proteins. SMAC opens the door to the application of single-molecule imaging in noninvasive disease profiling.</p>

                <p>The history of Earth&rsquo;s climate and carbon cycle is preserved in deep-sea foraminiferal carbon and oxygen isotope records. Here, we show that the sub-million-year fluctuations in both records have exhibited negatively skewed non-Gaussian tails throughout much of the Cenozoic era (66 Ma to present), suggesting an intrinsic asymmetry that favors "hyperthermal-like" extreme events of abrupt global warming and oxidation of organic carbon. We show that this asymmetry is quantitatively consistent with a general mechanism of self-amplification that can be modeled using stochastic multiplicative noise. A numerical climate&ndash;carbon cycle model in which the amplitude of random biogeochemical fluctuations increases at higher temperatures reproduces the data well and can further explain the apparent pacing of past extreme warming events by changes in orbital parameters. Our results also suggest that, as anthropogenic warming continues, Earth&rsquo;s climate may become more susceptible to extreme warming events on time scales of tens of thousands of years.</p>

                <p>Cyclically sheared jammed packings form memories of the shear amplitude at which they were trained by falling into periodic orbits where each particle returns to the identical position in subsequent cycles. While simple models that treat clusters of rearranging particles as isolated two-state systems offer insight into this memory formation, they fail to account for the long training times and multiperiod orbits observed in simulated sheared packings. We show that adding interactions between rearranging clusters overcomes these deficiencies. In addition, interactions allow simultaneous encoding of multiple memories, which would not have been possible otherwise. These memories are different in an essential way from those found in other systems, such as multiple transient memories observed in sheared suspensions, and contain information about the strength of the interactions.</p>

                <p>When an amorphous solid is deformed cyclically, it may reach a steady state in which the paths of constituent particles trace out closed loops that repeat in each driving cycle. A remarkable variant has been noticed in simulations where the period of particle motions is a multiple of the period of driving, but the reasons for this behavior have remained unclear. Motivated by mesoscopic features of displacement fields in experiments on jammed solids, we propose and analyze a simple model of interacting soft spots&mdash;locations where particles rearrange under stress and that resemble two-level systems with hysteresis. We show that multiperiodic behavior can arise among just three or more soft spots that interact with each other, but in all cases it requires frustrated interactions, illuminating this otherwise elusive type of interaction. We suggest directions for seeking this signature of frustration in experiments and for achieving it in designed systems.</p>

                <p>Cell pluripotency is fundamental to biology. It has long been known that differentiated somatic plant cells may reacquire pluripotency, but the underlying mechanism remains elusive. In many plant species, a single isolated mesophyll protoplast may regenerate into an entire plant, which is widely used in gene transformation. Here, we identified two transcription factors whose ectopic activation promotes protoplast regeneration. Furthermore, we found that their expression was induced by protoplast isolation but at a very low frequency. Using live imaging and single-cell transcriptomics, we show that isolating protoplasts induces enhanced expression variation at the genome level. Isolating protoplasts also leads to genome-wide increases in chromatin accessibility, which promotes stochastic activation of gene expression and enhances protoplast regeneration. We propose that transcriptome chaos with increased expression variability among cells creates a cellular-level evolutionary driver selecting for regenerating cells.</p>

                <p>Despite the development of next-generation antiandrogens, metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) remains incurable. Here, we describe a unique semisynthetic bispecific antibody that uses site-specific unnatural amino acid conjugation to combine the potency of a T cell&ndash;recruiting anti-CD3 antibody with the specificity of an imaging ligand (DUPA) for prostate-specific membrane antigen. This format enabled optimization of structure and function to produce a candidate (CCW702) with specific, potent in vitro cytotoxicity and improved stability compared with a bispecific single-chain variable fragment format. In vivo, CCW702 eliminated C4-2 xenografts with as few as three weekly subcutaneous doses and prevented growth of PCSD1 patient-derived xenograft tumors in mice. In cynomolgus monkeys, CCW702 was well tolerated up to 34.1 mg/kg per dose, with near-complete subcutaneous bioavailability and a PK profile supporting testing of a weekly dosing regimen in patients. CCW702 is being evaluated in a first in-human clinical trial for men with mCRPC who had progressed on prior therapies (NCT04077021).</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">The structure of hippocampal circuitry relates to rapid category learning in humans</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Prior work suggests that complementary white matter pathways within the hippocampus (HPC) differentially support the learning of specific versus general information. In particular, while the trisynaptic pathway (TSP) rapidly forms memories for specific experiences, the monosynaptic pathway (MSP) slowly learns generalities. However, despite the theorized significance of such circuitry, characterizing how information flows within the HPC to support learning in humans remains a challenge. We leveraged diffusion-weighted imaging as a proxy for individual differences in white matter structure linking key regions along with TSP (HPC subfields CA<sub>3</sub> and CA<sub>1</sub>) and MSP (entorhinal cortex and CA<sub>1</sub>) and related these differences in hippocampal structure to category learning ability. We hypothesized that learning to categorize the “exception” items that deviated from category rules would benefit from TSP-supported mnemonic specificity. Participant-level estimates of TSP- and MSP-related integrity were constructed from HPC subfield connectomes of white matter streamline density. Consistent with theories of TSP-supported learning mechanisms, we found a specific association between the integrity of CA<sub>3</sub>–CA<sub>1</sub> white matter connections and exception learning. These results highlight the significant role of HPC circuitry in complex human learning.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Cocaine addiction is a devastating public health epidemic that continues to grow. Studies focused on identifying biological factors influencing cocaine craving and relapse vulnerability are necessary to promote abstinence in recovering drug users. Sex and ovarian hormones are known to influence cocaine addiction liability and relapse vulnerability in both humans and rodents. Previous studies have investigated sex differences in the time-dependent intensification or "incubation" of cue-induced cocaine craving that occurs during withdrawal from extended-access cocaine self-administration and have identified changes across the rat reproductive cycle (estrous cycle). Female rats in the estrus stage of the cycle (Estrus Females), the phase during which ovulation occurs, show an increase in the magnitude of incubated cue-induced cocaine craving compared with females in all other phases of the estrous cycle (Non-Estrus Females). Here we extend these findings by assessing incubated craving across the estrous cycle during earlier withdrawal periods (withdrawal day 1 and 15) and later withdrawal periods (withdrawal day 48). We found that this increase in the magnitude of incubated craving during estrus (Estrus Females) is present on withdrawal day 15, but not on withdrawal day 1, and further increases by withdrawal day 48. No difference in the magnitude of incubated craving was observed between Males and Non-Estrus Females. Our data indicate that the effects of hormonal fluctuations on cue-induced cocaine craving intensify during the first month and a half of withdrawal, showing an interaction among abstinence length, estrous cycle fluctuations, and cocaine craving.</p>

                <p>Increased mTOR activity has been shown to enhance regeneration of injured axons by increasing neuronal protein synthesis, while PTEN signaling can block mTOR activity to attenuate protein synthesis. MicroRNAs (miRs) have been implicated in regulation of PTEN and mTOR expression, and previous work in spinal cord showed an increase in miR-199a-3p after spinal cord injury (SCI) and increase in miR-21 in SCI animals that had undergone exercise. Pten mRNA is a target for miR-21 and miR-199a-3p is predicted to target mTor mRNA. Here, we show that miR-21 and miR-199a-3p are expressed in adult dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, and we used culture preparations to test functions of the rat miRs in adult DRG and embryonic cortical neurons. miR-21 increases and miR-199a-3p decreases in DRG neurons after in vivo axotomy. In both the adult DRG and embryonic cortical neurons, miR-21 promotes and miR-199a-3p attenuates neurite growth. miR-21 directly bound to Pten mRNA and miR-21 overexpression decreased Pten mRNA levels. Conversely, miR-199a-3p directly bound to mTor mRNA and miR-199a-3p overexpression decreased mTor mRNA levels. Overexpressing miR-21 increased both overall and intra-axonal protein synthesis in cultured DRGs, while miR-199a-3p overexpression decreased this protein synthesis. The axon growth phenotypes seen with miR-21 and miR-199a-3p overexpression were reversed by co-transfecting PTEN and mTOR cDNA expression constructs with the predicted 3' untranslated region (UTR) miR target sequences deleted. Taken together, these studies indicate that injury-induced alterations in miR-21 and miR-199a-3p expression can alter axon growth capacity by changing overall and intra-axonal protein synthesis through regulation of the PTEN/mTOR pathway.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Nicotine is an addictive substance historically consumed through smoking and more recently through the use of electronic vapor devices. The increasing prevalence and popularity of vaping prompts the need for preclinical rodent models of nicotine vapor exposure and an improved understanding of the impact of vaping on specific brain regions, bodily functions, and behaviors. We used a rodent model of electronic nicotine vapor exposure to examine the cellular and behavioral consequences of acute and repeated vapor exposure. Adult male C57BL/6J mice were exposed to a single 3-h session (acute exposure) or five daily sessions (repeated exposure) of intermittent vapes of 120 mg/ml nicotine in propylene glycol:vegetable glycerol (PG/VG) or PG/VG control. Acute and repeated nicotine vapor exposure did not alter body weight, and both exposure paradigms produced pharmacologically significant serum nicotine and cotinine levels in the 120 mg/ml nicotine group compared with PG/VG controls. Acute exposure to electronic nicotine vapor increased central amygdala (CeA) activity in individual neuronal firing and in expression of the molecular activity marker, cFos. The changes in neuronal activity following acute exposure were not observed following repeated exposure. Acute and repeated nicotine vapor exposure decreased core body temperature, however acute exposure decreased locomotion while repeated exposure increased locomotion. Collectively, these studies provide validation of a mouse model of nicotine vapor exposure and important evidence for how exposure to electronic nicotine vapor produces differential effects on CeA neuronal activity and on specific body functions and behaviors like thermoregulation and locomotion.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Implicit Visuomotor Adaptation Remains Limited after Several Days of Training</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Learning in sensorimotor adaptation tasks has been viewed as an implicit learning phenomenon. The implicit process affords recalibration of existing motor skills so that the system can adjust to changes in the body or environment without relearning from scratch. However, recent findings suggest that the implicit process is heavily constrained, calling into question its utility in motor learning and the theoretical framework of sensorimotor adaptation paradigms. These inferences have been based mainly on results from single bouts of training, where explicit compensation strategies, such as explicitly re-aiming the intended movement direction, contribute a significant proportion of adaptive learning. It is possible, however, that the implicit process supersedes explicit compensation strategies over repeated practice sessions. We tested this by dissociating the contributions of explicit re-aiming strategies and the implicit process in human participants over five consecutive days of training. Despite a substantially longer duration of training, the implicit process still plateaued at a value far short of complete learning and, as has been observed in previous studies, was inappropriate for a mirror-reversal task. Notably, we find significant between subject differences that call into question traditional interpretation of these group-level results.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Mutations in the X-linked cell adhesion protein PCDH19 lead to seizures, cognitive impairment, and other behavioral comorbidities when present in a mosaic pattern. Neither the molecular mechanisms underpinning this disorder nor the function of PCDH19 itself are well understood. By combining RNA <I>in situ</I> hybridization with immunohistochemistry and analyzing single-cell RNA sequencing datasets, we reveal <I>Pcdh19</I> expression in cortical interneurons and provide a first account of the subtypes of neurons expressing <I>Pcdh19</I>/<I>PCDH19</I>, both in the mouse and the human cortex. Our quantitative analysis of the <I>Pcdh19</I> mutant mouse exposes subtle changes in cortical layer composition, with no major alterations of the main axonal tracts. In addition, <I>Pcdh19</I> mutant animals, particularly females, display preweaning behavioral changes, including reduced anxiety and increased exploratory behavior. Importantly, our experiments also reveal an effect of the social environment on the behavior of wild-type littermates of <I>Pcdh19</I> mutant mice, which show alterations when compared with wild-type animals not housed with mutants.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Contribution of NMDA Receptors to Synaptic Function in Rat Hippocampal Interneurons</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The ability of neurons to produce behaviorally relevant activity in the absence of pathology relies on the fine balance of synaptic inhibition to excitation. In the hippocampal CA1 microcircuit, this balance is maintained by a diverse population of inhibitory interneurons that receive largely similar glutamatergic afferents as their target pyramidal cells, with EPSCs generated by both AMPA receptors (AMPARs) and NMDA receptors (NMDARs). In this study, we take advantage of a recently generated GluN2A-null rat model to assess the contribution of GluN2A subunits to glutamatergic synaptic currents in three subclasses of interneuron found in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. For both parvalbumin-positive and somatostatin-positive interneurons, the GluN2A subunit is expressed at glutamatergic synapses and contributes to the EPSC. In contrast, in cholecystokinin (CCK)-positive interneurons, the contribution of GluN2A to the EPSC is negligible. Furthermore, synaptic potentiation at glutamatergic synapses on CCK-positive interneurons does not require the activation of GluN2A-containing NMDARs but does rely on the activation of NMDARs containing GluN2B and GluN2D subunits.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>New information is rarely learned in isolation; instead, most of what we experience can be incorporated into or uses previous knowledge networks in some form. Previous knowledge in form of a cognitive map can facilitate knowledge acquisition and will influence how we learn new spatial information. Here, we developed a new spatial navigation task where food locations are learned in a large, gangway maze to test how mice learn a large spatial map over a longer time period&mdash;the HexMaze. Analyzing performance across sessions as well as on specific trials, we can show simple memory effects as well as multiple effects of previous knowledge of the map accelerating both online learning and performance increases over offline periods when incorporating new information. We could identify the following three main phases: (1) learning the initial goal location; (2) faster learning after 2 weeks when learning a new goal location; and then (3) the ability to express one-session learning, leading to long-term memory effect after 12 weeks. Importantly, we are the first to show that buildup of a spatial map is dependent on how much time passes, not how often the animal is trained.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Loss of miR-183/96 Alters Synaptic Strength via Presynaptic and Postsynaptic Mechanisms at a Central Synapse</a></h4>

              
                <p>A point mutation in miR-96 causes non-syndromic progressive peripheral hearing loss and alters structure and physiology of the central auditory system. To gain further insight into the functions of microRNAs (miRNAs) within the central auditory system, we investigated constitutive <I>Mir-183/96<sup>dko</sup></I> mice of both sexes. In this mouse model, the genomically clustered miR-183 and miR-96 are constitutively deleted. It shows significantly and specifically reduced volumes of auditory hindbrain nuclei, because of decreases in cell number and soma size. Electrophysiological analysis of the calyx of Held synapse in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) demonstrated strongly altered synaptic transmission in young-adult mice. We observed an increase in quantal content and readily releasable vesicle pool size in the presynapse while the overall morphology of the calyx was unchanged. Detailed analysis of the active zones (AZs) revealed differences in its molecular composition and synaptic vesicle (SV) distribution. Postsynaptically, altered clustering and increased synaptic abundancy of the AMPA receptor subunit GluA1 was observed resulting in an increase in quantal amplitude. Together, these presynaptic and postsynaptic alterations led to a 2-fold increase of the evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents in MNTB neurons. None of these changes were observed in deaf <I>Cldn14</I><sup>ko</sup> mice, confirming an on-site role of miR-183 and miR-96 in the auditory hindbrain. Our data suggest that the <I>Mir-183/96</I> cluster plays a key role for proper synaptic transmission at the calyx of Held and for the development of the auditory hindbrain.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The calyx of Held is the outstanding model system to study basic synaptic physiology. Yet, genetic factors driving its morphologic and functional maturation are largely unknown. Here, we identify the <I>Mir-183/96</I> cluster as an important factor to regulate its synaptic strength. Presynaptically, <I>Mir-183/96<sup>dko</sup></I> calyces show an increase in release-ready synaptic vesicles (SVs), quantal content and abundance of the proteins Bassoon and Piccolo. Postsynaptically, the quantal size as well as number and size of GluA1 puncta were increased. The two microRNAs (miRNAs) are thus attractive candidates for regulation of synaptic maturation and long-term adaptations to sound levels. Moreover, the different phenotypic outcomes of different types of mutations in the <I>Mir-183</I> cluster corroborate the requirement of mutation-tailored therapies in patients with hearing loss.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Synaptic Contributions to Cochlear Outer Hair Cell Ca2+ Dynamics</a></h4>

              
                <p>For normal cochlear function, outer hair cells (OHCs) require a precise control of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels. In the absence of regulatory elements such as proteinaceous buffers or extrusion pumps, OHCs degenerate, leading to profound hearing impairment. Influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup> occurs both at the stereocilia tips and the basolateral membrane. In this latter compartment, two different origins for Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx have been poorly explored: voltage-gated L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (VGCCs) at synapses with Type II afferent neurons, and &alpha;9&alpha;10 cholinergic nicotinic receptors at synapses with medio-olivochlear complex (MOC) neurons. Using functional imaging in mouse OHCs, we dissected Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx individually through each of these sources, either by applying step depolarizations to activate VGCC, or stimulating MOC axons. Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions originated in MOC synapses, but not by VGCC activation, was confined by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPases most likely present in nearby synaptic cisterns. Although Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents in OHCs are small, VGCC Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals were comparable in size to those elicited by &alpha;9&alpha;10 receptors, and were potentiated by ryanodine receptors (RyRs). In contrast, no evidence of potentiation by RyRs was found for MOC Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals over a wide range of presynaptic stimulation strengths. Our study shows that despite the fact that these two Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry sites are closely positioned, they differ in their regulation by intracellular cisterns and/or organelles, suggesting the existence of well-tuned mechanisms to separate the two different OHC synaptic functions.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Outer hair cells (OHCs) are sensory cells in the inner ear operating under very special constraints. Acoustic stimulation leads to fast changes both in membrane potential and in the intracellular concentration of metabolites such as Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Tight mechanisms for Ca<sup>2+</sup> control in OHCs have been reported. Interestingly, Ca<sup>2+</sup> is crucial for two important synaptic processes: inhibition by efferent cholinergic neurons, and glutamate release onto Type II afferent fibers. In the current study we functionally imaged Ca<sup>2+</sup> at these two different synapses, showing close positioning within the basolateral compartment of OHCs. In addition, we show differential regulation of these two Ca<sup>2+</sup> sources by synaptic cisterns and/or organelles, which could result crucial for functional segregation during normal hearing.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">An Early Cortical Progenitor-Specific Mechanism Regulates Thalamocortical Innervation</a></h4>

              
                <p>The cortical subplate is critical in regulating the entry of thalamocortical sensory afferents into the cortex. These afferents reach the subplate at embryonic day (E)15.5 in the mouse, but "wait" for several days, entering the cortical plate postnatally. We report that when transcription factor LHX2 is lost in E11.5 cortical progenitors, which give rise to subplate neurons, thalamocortical afferents display premature, exuberant ingrowth into the E15.5 cortex. Embryonic mutant subplate neurons are correctly positioned below the cortical plate, but they display an altered transcriptome and immature electrophysiological properties during the waiting period. The sensory thalamus in these cortex-specific <I>Lhx2</I> mutants displays atrophy and by postnatal day (P) 7, sensory innervation to the cortex is nearly eliminated leading to a loss of the somatosensory barrels. Strikingly, these phenotypes do not manifest if LHX2 is lost in postmitotic subplate neurons, and the transcriptomic dysregulation in the subplate resulting from postmitotic loss of LHX2 is vastly distinct from that seen when LHX2 is lost in progenitors. These results demonstrate a mechanism operating in subplate progenitors that has profound consequences on the growth of thalamocortical axons into the cortex.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Thalamocortical nerves carry sensory information from the periphery to the cortex. When they first grow into the embryonic cortex, they "wait" at the subplate, a structure critical for the guidance and eventual connectivity of thalamic axons with their cortical targets. How the properties of subplate neurons are regulated is unclear. We report that transcription factor LHX2 is required in the progenitor "mother" cells of the cortical primordium when they are producing their "daughter" subplate neurons, in order for the thalamocortical pathway to wait at the subplate. Without LHX2 function in subplate progenitors, thalamocortical axons grow past the subplate, entering the cortical plate prematurely. This is followed by their eventual attrition and, consequently, a profound loss of sensory innervation of the mature cortex.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Role of Smad2 in Adult Neuroplasticity as Seen through Hippocampal-Dependent Spatial Learning/Memory and Neurogenesis</a></h4>

              
                <p>Adult neural plasticity is an important and intriguing phenomenon in the brain, and adult hippocampal neurogenesis is directly involved in modulating neural plasticity by mechanisms that are only partially understood. We have performed gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments to study Smad2, a transcription factor selected from genes that are demethylated after exercise through the analysis of an array of physical activity-induced factors, and their corresponding gene expression, and an efficient inducer of plasticity. In these studies, changes in cell number and morphology were analyzed in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (cell proliferation and survival, including regional distribution, and structural maturation/differentiation, including arborization, dendritic spines, and neurotransmitter-specific vesicles) of sedentary male mice, after evaluation in a battery of behavioral tests. As a result, we reveal a role for Smad2 in the balance of proliferation versus maturation of differentiating immature cells (Smad2 silencing increases both the proliferation and survival of cycling cells in the dentate granule cell layer), and in the plasticity of both newborn and mature neurons in mice (by decreasing dendritic arborization and dendritic spine number). Moreover, Smad2 silencing specifically compromises spatial learning in mice (through impairments of spatial tasks acquisition both in long-term learning and working memory). These data suggest that Smad2 participates in adult neural plasticity by influencing the proliferation and maturation of dentate gyrus neurons.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Smad2 is one of the main components of the transforming growth factor-&beta; (TGF-&beta;) pathway. The commitment of cell fate in the nervous system is tightly coordinated by SMAD2 signaling, as are further differentiation steps (e.g., dendrite and axon growth, myelination, and synapse formation). However, there are no studies that have directly evaluated the role of <I>Smad2</I> gene in hippocampus of adult animals. Modulation of these parameters in the adult hippocampus can affect hippocampal-dependent behaviors, which may shed light on the mechanisms that regulate adult neurogenesis and behavior. We demonstrate here a role for Smad2 in the maturation of differentiating immature cells and in the plasticity of mature neurons. Moreover, Smad2 silencing specifically compromises the spatial learning abilities of adult male mice.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Multifaceted Functions of Rab23 on Primary Cilium-Mediated and Hedgehog Signaling-Mediated Cerebellar Granule Cell Proliferation</a></h4>

              
                <p>Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling from the primary cilium drives cerebellar granule cell precursor (GCP) proliferation. Mutations of hedgehog (Hh) pathway repressors commonly cause medulloblastoma, the most prevalent and malignant childhood brain tumor that arises from aberrant GCP proliferation. We demonstrate that Nestin Cre-driven conditional knock-out (CKO) of a Shh pathway repressor-<I>Rab23</I> in the mouse brain of both genders caused mis-patterning of cerebellar folia and elevated GCP proliferation during early development, but with no prevalent occurrence of medulloblastoma at adult stage. Strikingly, <I>Rab23-</I>depleted GCPs exhibited upregulated basal level of Shh pathway activities despite showing an abnormal ciliogenesis of primary cilia. In line with the compromised ciliation, <I>Rab23-</I>depleted GCPs were desensitized against Hh pathway activity stimulations by Shh ligand and Smoothened (Smo) agonist-SAG, and exhibited attenuated stimulation of Smo-localization on the primary cilium in response to SAG. These results implicate multidimensional actions of Rab23 on Hh signaling cascade. Rab23 represses the basal level of Shh signaling, while facilitating primary cilium-dependent extrinsic Shh signaling activation. Collectively, our findings unravel instrumental roles of <I>Rab23</I> in GCP proliferation and ciliogenesis. Furthermore, <I>Rab23</I>'s potentiation of Shh signaling pathway through the primary cilium and Smo suggests a potential new therapeutic strategy for Smo/primary cilium-driven medulloblastoma.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Primary cilium and Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling are known to regulate granule cell precursor (GCP) proliferation. Aberrant overactivation of Shh signaling pathway ectopically increases GCP proliferation and causes malignant childhood tumor called medulloblastoma. However, the genetic and molecular regulatory cascade of GCP tumorigenesis remains incompletely understood. Our finding uncovers Rab23 as a novel regulator of hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway activity and cell proliferation in GCP. Intriguingly, we demonstrated that Rab23 confers dual functions in regulating Shh signaling; it potentiates primary cilium and Shh/Smoothened (Smo)-dependent signaling activation, while antagonizes basal level Hh activity. Our data present a previously underappreciated aspect of Rab23 in mediating extrinsic Shh signaling upstream of Smo. This study sheds new light on the mechanistic insights underpinning Shh signaling-mediated GCP proliferation and tumorigenesis.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Dynamics of Neural Microstates in the VTA-Striatal-Prefrontal Loop during Novelty Exploration in the Rat</a></h4>

              
                <p>Neural activity at the large-scale population level has been suggested to be consistent with a sequence of brief, quasistable spatial patterns. These "microstates" and their temporal dynamics have been linked to myriad cognitive functions and brain diseases. Most of this research has been performed using EEG, leaving many questions, such as the existence, dynamics, and behavioral relevance of microstates at the level of local field potentials (LFPs), unaddressed. Here, we adapted the standard EEG microstate analysis to triple-area LFP recordings from 192 electrodes in rats to investigate the mesoscopic dynamics of neural microstates within and across brain regions during novelty exploration. We performed simultaneous recordings from the prefrontal cortex, striatum, and ventral tegmental area in male rats during awake behavior (object novelty and exploration). We found that the LFP data can be accounted for by multiple, recurring microstates that were stable for ~60&ndash;100 ms. The simultaneous microstate activity across brain regions revealed rhythmic patterns of coactivations, which we interpret as a novel indicator of inter-regional, mesoscale synchronization. Furthermore, these rhythmic coactivation patterns across microstates were modulated by behavioral states such as movement and exploration of a novel object. These results support the existence of a functional mesoscopic organization across multiple brain areas and present a possible link of the origin of macroscopic EEG microstates to zero-lag neuronal synchronization within and between brain areas, which is of particular interest to the human research community.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The coordination of neural activity across the entire brain has remained elusive. Here we combine large-scale neural recordings at fine spatial resolution with the analysis of microstates (i.e., short-lived, recurring spatial patterns of neural activity). We demonstrate that the local activity in different brain areas can be accounted for by only a few microstates per region. These microstates exhibited temporal dynamics that were correlated across regions in rhythmic patterns. We demonstrate that these microstates are linked to behavior and exhibit different properties in the frequency domain during different behavioral states. In summary, LFP microstates provide an insightful approach to studying both mesoscopic and large-scale brain activation within and across regions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Synergistic Organization of Neural Inputs from Spinal Motor Neurons to Extrinsic and Intrinsic Hand Muscles</a></h4>

              
                <p>Our current understanding of synergistic muscle control is based on the analysis of muscle activities. Modules (synergies) in muscle coordination are extracted from electromyographic (EMG) signal envelopes. Each envelope indirectly reflects the neural drive received by a muscle; therefore, it carries information on the overall activity of the innervating motor neurons. However, it is not known whether the output of spinal motor neurons, whose number is orders of magnitude greater than the muscles they innervate, is organized in a low-dimensional fashion when performing complex tasks. Here, we hypothesized that motor neuron activities exhibit a synergistic organization in complex tasks and therefore that the common input to motor neurons results in a large dimensionality reduction in motor neuron outputs. To test this hypothesis, we factorized the output spike trains of motor neurons innervating 14 intrinsic and extrinsic hand muscles and analyzed the dimensionality of control when healthy individuals exerted isometric forces using seven grip types. We identified four motor neuron synergies, accounting for &gt;70% of the variance of the activity of 54.1 &plusmn; 12.9 motor neurons, and we identified four functionally similar muscle synergies. However, motor neuron synergies better discriminated individual finger forces than muscle synergies and were more consistent with the expected role of muscles actuating each finger. Moreover, in a few cases, motor neurons innervating the same muscle were active in separate synergies. Our findings suggest a highly divergent net neural inputs to spinal motor neurons from spinal and supraspinal structures, contributing to the dimensionality reduction captured by muscle synergies.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We addressed whether the output of spinal motor neurons innervating multiple hand muscles could be accounted for by a modular organization, i.e., synergies, previously described to account for the coordination of multiple muscles. We found that motor neuron synergies presented similar dimensionality (implying a &gt;10-fold reduction in dimensionality) and structure as muscle synergies. Nonetheless, the synergistic behavior of subsets of motor neurons within a muscle was also observed. These results advance our understanding of how neuromuscular control arises from mapping descending inputs to muscle activation signals. We provide, for the first time, insights into the organization of neural inputs to spinal motor neurons which, to date, has been inferred through analysis of muscle synergies.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Causal Inference Gates Corticostriatal Learning</a></h4>

              
                <p>Attributing outcomes to your own actions or to external causes is essential for appropriately learning which actions lead to reward and which actions do not. Our previous work showed that this type of credit assignment is best explained by a Bayesian reinforcement learning model which posits that beliefs about the causal structure of the environment modulate reward prediction errors (RPEs) during action value updating. In this study, we investigated the brain networks underlying reinforcement learning that are influenced by causal beliefs using functional magnetic resonance imaging while human participants (<I>n</I> = 31; 13 males, 18 females) completed a behavioral task that manipulated beliefs about causal structure. We found evidence that RPEs modulated by causal beliefs are represented in dorsal striatum, while standard (unmodulated) RPEs are represented in ventral striatum. Further analyses revealed that beliefs about causal structure are represented in anterior insula and inferior frontal gyrus. Finally, structural equation modeling revealed effective connectivity from anterior insula to dorsal striatum. Together, these results are consistent with a possible neural architecture in which causal beliefs in anterior insula are integrated with prediction error signals in dorsal striatum to update action values.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Learning which actions lead to reward&mdash;a process known as reinforcement learning&mdash;is essential for survival. Inferring the causes of observed outcomes&mdash;a process known as causal inference&mdash;is crucial for appropriately assigning credit to one's own actions and restricting learning to effective action&ndash;outcome contingencies. Previous studies have linked reinforcement learning to the striatum, and causal inference to prefrontal regions, yet how these neural processes interact to guide adaptive behavior remains poorly understood. Here, we found evidence that causal beliefs represented in the prefrontal cortex modulate action value updating in posterior striatum, separately from the unmodulated action value update in ventral striatum posited by standard reinforcement learning models.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Sensory Coding of Limb Kinematics in Motor Cortex across a Key Developmental Transition</a></h4>

              
                <p>Primary motor cortex (M1) undergoes protracted development in mammals, functioning initially as a sensory structure. Throughout the first postnatal week in rats, M1 is strongly activated by self-generated forelimb movements&mdash;especially by the twitches that occur during active sleep. Here, we quantify the kinematic features of forelimb movements to reveal receptive-field properties of individual units within the forelimb region of M1. At postnatal day 8 (P8), nearly all units were strongly modulated by movement amplitude, especially during active sleep. By P12, only a minority of units continued to exhibit amplitude tuning, regardless of behavioral state. At both ages, movement direction also modulated M1 activity, though to a lesser extent. Finally, at P12, M1 population-level activity became more sparse and decorrelated, along with a substantial alteration in the statistical distribution of M1 responses to limb movements. These findings reveal a transition toward a more complex and informationally rich representation of movement long before M1 develops its motor functionality.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Primary motor cortex (M1) plays a fundamental role in the generation of voluntary movements and motor learning in adults. In early development, however, M1 functions as a prototypical sensory structure. Here, we demonstrate in infant rats that M1 codes for the kinematics of self-generated limb movements long before M1 develops its capacity to drive movements themselves. Moreover, we identify a key transition during the second postnatal week in which M1 activity becomes more informationally complex. Together, these findings further delineate the complex developmental path by which M1 develops its sensory functions in support of its later-emerging motor capacities.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Predictive Neural Computations Support Spoken Word Recognition: Evidence from MEG and Competitor Priming</a></h4>

              
                <p>Human listeners achieve quick and effortless speech comprehension through computations of conditional probability using Bayes rule. However, the neural implementation of Bayesian perceptual inference remains unclear. Competitive-selection accounts (e.g., TRACE) propose that word recognition is achieved through direct inhibitory connections between units representing candidate words that share segments (e.g., <I>hygiene</I> and <I>hijack</I> share /haid/). Manipulations that increase lexical uncertainty should increase neural responses associated with word recognition when words cannot be uniquely identified. In contrast, predictive-selection accounts (e.g., Predictive-Coding) propose that spoken word recognition involves comparing heard and predicted speech sounds and using prediction error to update lexical representations. Increased lexical uncertainty in words, such as <I>hygiene</I> and <I>hijack</I>, will increase prediction error and hence neural activity only at later time points when different segments are predicted. We collected MEG data from male and female listeners to test these two Bayesian mechanisms and used a competitor priming manipulation to change the prior probability of specific words. Lexical decision responses showed delayed recognition of target words (<I>hygiene</I>) following presentation of a neighboring prime word (<I>hijack</I>) several minutes earlier. However, this effect was not observed with pseudoword primes (<I>higent</I>) or targets (<I>hijure</I>). Crucially, MEG responses in the STG showed greater neural responses for word-primed words after the point at which they were uniquely identified (after /haid/ in <I>hygiene</I>) but not before while similar changes were again absent for pseudowords. These findings are consistent with accounts of spoken word recognition in which neural computations of prediction error play a central role.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Effective speech perception is critical to daily life and involves computations that combine speech signals with prior knowledge of spoken words (i.e., Bayesian perceptual inference). This study specifies the neural mechanisms that support spoken word recognition by testing two distinct implementations of Bayes perceptual inference. Most established theories propose direct competition between lexical units such that inhibition of irrelevant candidates leads to selection of critical words. Our results instead support predictive-selection theories (e.g., Predictive-Coding): by comparing heard and predicted speech sounds, neural computations of prediction error can help listeners continuously update lexical probabilities, allowing for more rapid word identification.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Spatial Representations in Rat Orbitofrontal Cortex</a></h4>

              
                <p>The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and hippocampus share striking cognitive and functional similarities. As a result, both structures have been proposed to encode "cognitive maps" that provide useful scaffolds for planning complex behaviors. However, while this function has been exemplified by spatial coding in neurons of hippocampal regions&mdash;particularly place and grid cells&mdash;spatial representations in the OFC have been investigated far less. Here we sought to address this by recording OFC neurons from male rats engaged in an open-field foraging task like that originally developed to characterize place fields in rodent hippocampal neurons. Single-unit activity was recorded as rats searched for food pellets scattered randomly throughout a large enclosure. In some sessions, particular flavors of food occurred more frequently in particular parts of the enclosure; in others, only a single flavor was used. OFC neurons showed spatially localized firing fields in both conditions, and representations changed between flavored and unflavored foraging periods in a manner reminiscent of remapping in the hippocampus. Compared with hippocampal recordings taken under similar behavioral conditions, OFC spatial representations were less temporally reliable, and there was no significant evidence of grid tuning in OFC neurons. These data confirm that OFC neurons show spatial firing fields in a large, two-dimensional environment in a manner similar to hippocampus. Consistent with the focus of the OFC on biological meaning and goals, spatial coding was weaker than in hippocampus and influenced by outcome identity.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and hippocampus have both been proposed to encode "cognitive maps" that provide useful scaffolds for planning complex behaviors. This function is exemplified by place and grid cells identified in hippocampus, the activity of which maps spatial environments. The current study directly demonstrates very similar, though not identical, spatial representatives in OFC neurons, confirming that OFC&mdash;like hippocampus&mdash;can represent a spatial map under the appropriate experimental conditions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Chronic Augmentation of Endocannabinoid Levels Persistently Increases Dopaminergic Encoding of Reward Cost and Motivation</a></h4>

              
                <p>Motivational deficits characterized by an unwillingness to overcome effortful costs are a common feature of neuropsychiatric and neurologic disorders that are insufficiently understood and treated. Dopamine (DA) signaling in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) facilitates goal-seeking, but how NAc DA release encodes motivationally salient stimuli to influence effortful investment is not clear. Using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry in male and female mice, we find that NAc DA release diametrically responds to cues signaling increasing cost of reward, while DA release to the reward itself is unaffected by its cost. Because endocannabinoid (eCB) signaling facilitates goal seeking and NAc DA release, we further investigated whether repeated augmentation of the eCB 2-arachidonoylglycerol with a low dose of a monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) inhibitor facilitates motivation and DA signaling without the development of tolerance. We find that chronic MAGL treatment stably facilitates goal seeking and DA encoding of prior reward cost, providing critical insight into the neurobiological mechanisms of a viable treatment for motivational deficits.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Decades of work has established a fundamental role for dopamine neurotransmission in motivated behavior and cue&ndash;reward learning, but how dopaminergic encoding of cues associates with motivated action has remained unclear. Specifically, how dopamine neurons signal future and prior reward cost, and whether this can be modified to influence motivational set points is not known. The current study provides important insight into how dopamine neurons encode motivationally relevant stimuli to influence goal-directed action and supports cannabinoid-based therapies for treatment of motivational disorders.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Hippocampal Sequencing Mechanisms Are Disrupted in a Maternal Immune Activation Model of Schizophrenia Risk</a></h4>

              
                <p>Episodic memory requires information to be stored and recalled in sequential order, and these processes are disrupted in schizophrenia. Hippocampal phase precession and theta sequences are thought to provide a biological mechanism for sequential ordering of experience at timescales suitable for plasticity. These phenomena have not previously been examined in any models of schizophrenia risk. Here, we examine these phenomena in a maternal immune activation (MIA) rodent model. We show that while individual pyramidal cells in the CA1 region continue to precess normally in MIA animals, the starting phase of precession as an animal enters a new place field is considerably more variable in MIA animals than in controls. A critical consequence of this change is a disorganization of the ordered representation of experience via theta sequences. These results provide the first evidence of a biological-level mechanism that, if it occurs in schizophrenia, may explain aspects of disorganized sequential processing that contribute to the cognitive symptoms of the disorder.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Hippocampal phase precession and theta sequences have been proposed as biophysical mechanisms by which the sequential structure of cognition might be ordered. Disturbances of sequential processing have frequently been observed in schizophrenia. Here, we show for the first time that phase precession and theta sequences are disrupted in a maternal immune activation (MIA) model of schizophrenia risk. This is a result of greater variability in the starting phase of precession, indicating that the mechanisms that coordinate precession at the assembly level are disrupted. We propose that this disturbance in phase precession underlies some of the disorganized cognitive symptoms that occur in schizophrenia. These findings could have important preclinical significance for the identification and treatment of schizophrenia risk factors.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Association between traumatic brain injury (TBI) patterns and mortality: a retrospective case-control study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Low and medium income countries (LMICs) such as Kenya experience nearly three times more cases of traumatic brain injury (TBI) compared to high income countries (HICs). This is primarily exacerbated by weak health systems especially at the pre-hospital care level. Generating local empirical evidence on TBI patterns and its influence on patient mortality outcomes is fundamental in informing the design of trauma-specific emergency medical service (EMS) interventions at the pre-hospital care level. This study determines the influence of TBI patterns and mortality. Methods: This was a case-control study with a sample of 316 TBI patients. Data was abstracted from medical records for the period of January 2017 to March 2019 in three tertiary trauma care facilities in Kenya. Logistic regression was used to assess influence of trauma patterns on TBI mortality, controlling for patient characteristics and other potential confounders. Results: The majority of patients were aged below 40 years (73%) and were male (85%). Road traffic injuries (RTIs) comprised 58% of all forms of trauma. Blunt trauma comprised 71% of the injuries. Trauma mechanism was the only trauma pattern significantly associated with TBI mortality. The risk of dying for patients sustaining RTIs was 2.83 times more likely compared to non-RTI patients [odds ratio (OR) 2.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.62-4.93, p=0.001]. The type of transfer to hospital was also significantly associated with mortality outcome, with a public hospital having a two times higher risk of death compared to a private hospital [OR 2.18 95%CI 1.21-3.94, p<0.009]. Conclusion: Trauma mechanism (RTI vs non-RTI) and type of tertiary facility patients are transferred to (public vs private) are key factors influencing TBI mortality burden. Strengthening local EMS trauma response systems targeting RTIs augmented by adequately resourced and equipped public facilities to provide quality lifesaving interventions can reduce the burden of TBIs.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Diffusion enables integration of heterogeneous data and user-driven learning in a desktop knowledge-base</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Tomasz Konopka, Sandra Ng, Damian Smedley</p>

Integrating reference datasets (e.g. from high-throughput experiments) with unstructured and manually-assembled information (e.g. notes or comments from individual researchers) has the potential to tailor bioinformatic analyses to specific needs and to lead to new insights. However, developing bespoke analysis pipelines from scratch is time-consuming, and general tools for exploring such heterogeneous data are not available. We argue that by treating all data as text, a knowledge-base can accommodate a range of bioinformatic data types and applications. We show that a database coupled to nearest-neighbor algorithms can address common tasks such as gene-set analysis as well as specific tasks such as ontology translation. We further show that a mathematical transformation motivated by diffusion can be effective for exploration across heterogeneous datasets. Diffusion enables the knowledge-base to begin with a sparse query, impute more features, and find matches that would otherwise remain hidden. This can be used, for example, to map multi-modal queries consisting of gene symbols and phenotypes to descriptions of diseases. Diffusion also enables user-driven learning: when the knowledge-base cannot provide satisfactory search results in the first instance, users can improve the results in real-time by adding domain-specific knowledge. User-driven learning has implications for data management, integration, and curation.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A large-scale brain network mechanism for increased seizure propensity in Alzheimer’s disease</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Luke Tait, Marinho A. Lopes, George Stothart, John Baker, Nina Kazanina, Jiaxiang Zhang, Marc Goodfellow</p>

People with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are 6-10 times more likely to develop seizures than the healthy aging population. Leading hypotheses largely consider hyperexcitability of local cortical tissue as primarily responsible for increased seizure prevalence in AD. However, in the general population of people with epilepsy, large-scale brain network organization additionally plays a role in determining seizure likelihood and phenotype. Here, we propose that alterations to large-scale brain network organization seen in AD may contribute to increased seizure likelihood. To test this hypothesis, we combine computational modelling with electrophysiological data using an approach that has proved informative in clinical epilepsy cohorts without AD. EEG was recorded from 21 people with probable AD and 26 healthy controls. At the time of EEG acquisition, all participants were free from seizures. Whole brain functional connectivity derived from source-reconstructed EEG recordings was used to build subject-specific brain network models of seizure transitions. As cortical tissue excitability was increased in the simulations, AD simulations were more likely to transition into seizures than simulations from healthy controls, suggesting an increased group-level probability of developing seizures at a future time for AD participants. We subsequently used the model to assess seizure propensity of different regions across the cortex. We found the most important regions for seizure generation were those typically burdened by amyloid-beta at the early stages of AD, as previously reported by in-vivo and post-mortem staging of amyloid plaques. Analysis of these spatial distributions also give potential insight into mechanisms of increased susceptibility to generalized (as opposed to focal) seizures in AD vs controls. This research suggests avenues for future studies testing patients with seizures, e.g. co-morbid AD/epilepsy patients, and comparisons with PET and MRI scans to relate regional seizure propensity with AD pathologies.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Wing structure and neural encoding jointly determine sensing strategies in insect flight</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Alison I. Weber, Thomas L. Daniel, Bingni W. Brunton</p>

Animals rely on sensory feedback to generate accurate, reliable movements. In many flying insects, strain-sensitive neurons on the wings provide rapid feedback that is critical for stable flight control. While the impacts of wing structure on aerodynamic performance have been widely studied, the impacts of wing structure on sensing are largely unexplored. In this paper, we show how the structural properties of the wing and encoding by mechanosensory neurons interact to jointly determine optimal sensing strategies and performance. Specifically, we examine how neural sensors can be placed effectively on a flapping wing to detect body rotation about different axes, using a computational wing model with varying flexural stiffness. A small set of mechanosensors, conveying strain information at key locations with a single action potential per wingbeat, enable accurate detection of body rotation. Optimal sensor locations are concentrated at either the wing base or the wing tip, and they transition sharply as a function of both wing stiffness and neural threshold. Moreover, the sensing strategy and performance is robust to both external disturbances and sensor loss. Typically, only five sensors are needed to achieve near-peak accuracy, with a single sensor often providing accuracy well above chance. Our results show that small-amplitude, dynamic signals can be extracted efficiently with spatially and temporally sparse sensors in the context of flight. The demonstrated interaction of wing structure and neural encoding properties points to the importance of understanding each in the context of their joint evolution.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A modular approach for modeling the cell cycle based on functional response curves</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jolan De Boeck, Jan Rombouts, Lendert Gelens</p>

Modeling biochemical reactions by means of differential equations often results in systems with a large number of variables and parameters. As this might complicate the interpretation and generalization of the obtained results, it is often desirable to reduce the complexity of the model. One way to accomplish this is by replacing the detailed reaction mechanisms of certain modules in the model by a mathematical expression that qualitatively describes the dynamical behavior of these modules. Such an approach has been widely adopted for ultrasensitive responses, for which underlying reaction mechanisms are often replaced by a single Hill function. Also time delays are usually accounted for by using an explicit delay in delay differential equations. In contrast, however, S-shaped response curves, which by definition have multiple output values for certain input values and are often encountered in bistable systems, are not easily modeled in such an explicit way. Here, we extend the classical Hill function into a mathematical expression that can be used to describe both ultrasensitive and S-shaped responses. We show how three ubiquitous modules (ultrasensitive responses, S-shaped responses and time delays) can be combined in different configurations and explore the dynamics of these systems. As an example, we apply our strategy to set up a model of the cell cycle consisting of multiple bistable switches, which can incorporate events such as DNA damage and coupling to the circadian clock in a phenomenological way.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Dpp and Hedgehog promote the glial response to neuronal apoptosis in the developing Drosophila visual system</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Sergio B. Velarde, Alvaro Quevedo, Carlos Estella, Antonio Baonza</p>

Damage in the nervous system induces a stereotypical response that is mediated by glial cells. Here, we use the eye disc of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> as a model to explore the mechanisms involved in promoting glial cell response after neuronal cell death induction. We demonstrate that these cells rapidly respond to neuronal apoptosis by increasing in number and undergoing morphological changes, which will ultimately grant them phagocytic abilities. We found that this glial response is controlled by the activity of Decapentaplegic (Dpp) and Hedgehog (Hh) signalling pathways. These pathways are activated after cell death induction, and their functions are necessary to induce glial cell proliferation and migration to the eye discs. The latter of these 2 processes depend on the function of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway, which is activated by Dpp signalling. We also present evidence that a similar mechanism controls glial response upon apoptosis induction in the leg discs, suggesting that our results uncover a mechanism that might be involved in controlling glial cells response to neuronal cell death in different regions of the peripheral nervous system (PNS).
