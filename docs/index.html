                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Early midlife bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) is associated with greater Alzheimer's disease risk compared to spontaneous/natural menopause. Previously, we found that participants with BSO had lower volume in the hippocampal dentate gyrus and cornu ammonis 2/3 composite subfield (DG-CA2/3). We sought to extend those hippocampal subfield findings by assessing whether BSO affected volumes along the anteroposterior hippocampal axis, anterolateral entorhinal cortex, and perirhinal cortex subregions (Brodmann area (BA) 35 and 36). We also correlated volumes with key demographic and wellbeing-related factors (age, depressive mood, education), hormone therapy characteristics, and recognition memory performance. Early midlife participants with BSO (with and without 17β-estradiol therapy (ET)) and age-matched control participants with intact ovaries (AMC) completed high-resolution T2-weighted structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Medial temporal lobe volumes and Remember-Know task recognition memory performance were compared between groups—BSO (<i>n</i> = 23), BSO + ET (<i>n</i> = 28), AMC (<i>n</i> = 34) using univariate analyses. Multivariate Partial Least Squares (PLS) analyses were used to examine how volumes related to demographic and wellbeing-related factors, as well as hormone therapy characteristics. Relative to BSO + ET, BSO had lower posterior hippocampal and DG-CA2/3 volumes but greater perirhinal BA 36 volumes. Compared to age, depressive mood, and education, ET was the strongest positive predictor of hippocampal volumes and negative predictor of perirhinal BA 36 volumes. For BSO + ET, hippocampal volumes were negatively related to ET duration and positively related to concurrent progestogen therapy. Relative to AMC, BSO had greater anterolateral entorhinal cortex and perirhinal BA 35 and BA 36 volumes. BSO groups (with and without ET) relied more on familiarity than recollection for successful recognition memory. BSO and ET may have distinct effects on medial temporal lobe volumes, with potential implications for memory processes affected by Alzheimer's disease risk.</p>

                Zhang et al. demonstrate that activation of the NAIP/NLRC4 inflammasome leads to acute lung injury. They identify pyroptosis of pulmonary macrophages and fibroblasts as an important mechanism driving inflammasome-mediated lung damage.

                Koley et al. indicate that fatty acid oxidation occurs concomitantly with fatty acid biosynthesis in multiple plant tissues, including seeds that are thought to stably house storage reserves. This study suggests that some lipid breakdown and fatty acid oxidation is the rule and not the exception in plant metabolism.

">Familial ALS/FTD-associated RNA-Binding deficient TDP-43 mutants cause neuronal and synaptic dysregulation in vitro</a></h4>

              
                TDP-43 is an RNA-binding protein constituting the pathological inclusions observed in ~95% of ALS and ~50% of FTD patients. In ALS and FTD, TDP-43 mislocalises to the cytoplasm and forms insoluble, hyperphosphorylated and ubiquitinated aggregates that enhance cytotoxicity and contribute to neurodegeneration. Despite its primary role as an RNA/DNA-binding protein, how RNA-binding deficiencies contribute to disease onset and progression is little understood. Among many identified familial mutations in TDP-43 causing ALS/FTD, only two mutations cause an RNA-binding deficiency, K181E and K263E. In this study, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to knock-in the two disease-linked RNA-binding deficient mutations in SH-SY5Y cells, generating both homozygous and heterozygous versions of the mutant TDP-43 to investigate TDP-43-mediated neuronal disruption. Significant changes were identified in the transcriptomic profiles of these cells, in particular, between K181E homozygous and heterozygous cells, with the most affected genes involved in neuronal differentiation and synaptic pathways. This result was validated in cell studies where the neuronal differentiation efficiency and neurite morphology were compromised in TDP-43 cells compared to unmodified control. Interestingly, divergent neuronal regulation was observed in K181E-TDP-43 homozygous and heterozygous cells, suggesting a more complex signalling network associated with TDP-43 genotypes and expression level which warrants further study. Overall, our data using cell models expressing the ALS/FTD disease-causing RNA-binding deficient TDP-43 mutations at endogenous levels show a robust impact on transcriptomic profiles at the whole gene and transcript isoform level that compromise neuronal differentiation and processing, providing further insights on TDP-43-mediated neurodegeneration.

">Single-dose administration of therapeutic divalent siRNA targeting MECP2 prevents lethality for one year in an MECP2 duplication mouse model</a></h4>

              
                MECP2 duplication syndrome (MDS) is a rare X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder caused by duplications of the dosage-sensitive methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2) gene. Developing effective therapies for MDS is particularly challenging due to the variability in MECP2 expression among patients and the potential risk of inducing Rett syndrome through excessive pharmacological intervention. Reducing dosage to optimize silencing levels often compromises durability and necessitates increased dosing frequency. We present here a series of fully chemically modified small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) designed for both isoform-selective and total MECP2 silencing. Among these, we identify six lead siRNA candidates across two distinct chemical scaffolds, achieving targeted total MECP2 expression reductions ranging from 25% to 75%, sustained for at least four months following a single administration. The efficacy and safety of human ortholog silencing were evaluated using two mouse models with distinct levels of human MECP2 transgene expression. In the severe duplication model, a single dose of the total isoform-silencing siRNA fully rescued early mortality and behavioral impairments. Additionally, we show that the isoform-selective targeting strategy may be safer in mild cases of MDS where exaggerated pharmacology may lead to Rett Syndrome. Overall, this study introduces a series of preclinical candidates with the capacity to address the varying levels of MECP2 duplication encountered in clinical settings. Furthermore, it establishes a target selection strategy that may be applied to other dosage-sensitive gene imbalances.

                Neurons encode information in a binary manner and process complex signals. However, predicting or generating diverse neural activity patterns remains challenging. In vitro and in vivo studies provide distinct advantages, yet no robust computational framework seamlessly integrates both data types. We address this by applying the Transformer model, widely used in large-scale language models, to neural data. To handle binary data, we introduced Dice loss, enabling accurate cross-domain neural activity generation. Structural analysis revealed how Dice loss enhances learning and identified key brain regions facilitating high-precision data generation. Our findings support the 3Rs principle in animal research, particularly Replacement, and establish a mathematical framework bridging animal experiments and human clinical studies. This work advances data-driven neuroscience and neural activity modeling, paving the way for more ethical and effective experimental methodologies.

">Deletion of the voltage-gated calcium channel gene, CaV1.3, reduces Purkinje cell dendritic complexity without altering cerebellar-mediated eyeblink conditioning</a></h4>

              
                Genetic variation in CACNA1D, the gene that encodes the pore-forming subunit of the L-type calcium channel CaV1.3, has been associated with increased risk for neuropsychiatric disorders that display abnormalities in cerebellar structures. We sought to clarify if deletion of CaV1.3 in mice would induce abnormalities in cerebellar cortex cytoarchitecture or synapse morphology. Since CaV1.3 is highly expressed in cerebellar molecular layer interneurons (MLIs) and L-type channels appear to regulate GABA release from MLIs, we hypothesized that loss of CaV1.3 would alter GABAergic synapses between MLIs and Purkinje cells (PCs) without altering MLI numbers or PC structure. As expected, we did not observe changes in the numbers of MLIs or PCs. Surprisingly, CaV1.3 KO mice do have decreased complexity of PC dendritic arbors without differences in the number or structure of GABAergic synapses onto PCs. Loss of CaV1.3 was not associated with impaired acquisition of delay eyeblink conditioning. Therefore, our data suggest that CaV1.3 expression is important for PC structure but does not affect other measures of cerebellar cortex morphology or cerebellar function as assessed by delay eyeblink conditioning.

">The neurocomputational mechanisms of hierarchical linguistic predictions during narrative comprehension</a></h4>

              
                Language comprehension requires a listener to predict the upcoming inputs of linguistic units with multiple timescales based on previous contexts, but how the prediction process is hierarchically represented and implemented in the human brain remains unclear. Combining the natural language processing (NLP) approach and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) in a narrative comprehension task, we first applied the group-based general linear model (gGLM) to identify the neural underpinnings associated with the language prediction on word and sentence. Our results revealed a cortical architecture supporting the prediction, extending from the superior temporal cortices to the regions in the default mode network. Then, we investigated how these adjacent levels interact with each other by testing two rival hypotheses: the continuous updating hypothesis posits that the higher level of the representational hierarchy is continuously updated as inputs unfold over time, while the sparse updating hypothesis states that the higher level is only updated at the end of their preferred timescales of linguistic units. By conducting computational modeling and autocorrelation analysis, we found the sparse model outperformed the continuous model and the updating might occur at the sentence boundaries. Together, our results extend the linguistic prediction from the small timescales such as words to large timescales such as sentences, providing novel insights into the neurocomputational mechanisms of information updating within the linguistic prediction hierarchy.

                The ability to synchronize bodily movements with regular auditory rhythm across a broad range of tempos underlies humans' capacity for playing music and dancing. This capability is prevalent across human cultures but relatively uncommon among non-human species. Recent research indicates that monkeys can predictively synchronize to regular, isochronous metronomes, exhibiting a preference for visual rather than auditory sequences. In this study, we trained macaques to perform a visual synchronization tapping task, testing their synchronization abilities over a wide tempo range and characterizing their precision and accuracy in timing intervals throughout rhythmic sequences. Additionally, we investigated whether the macaques employed priors or error correction strategies to maintain synchrony with the metronome. Our findings demonstrate that, following sufficient training, macaques exhibit a remarkable capability to synchronize across diverse tempos. Through an inference model analysis, we identified two distinct timing control strategies used by the macaques: an initial strong regression-to-the-mean effect transitioning dynamically into a more precise error correction approach at their preferred tempo. These results provide compelling evidence that primates possess sophisticated rhythmic timing mechanisms, effectively leveraging internal and external cues to regulate their tapping behavior according to task demands.

">Dissecting the Crosstalk Between Dopaminergic and Serotonergic Systems in the Striatum</a></h4>

              
                Dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) are neuromodulators implicated in reward processing, decision-making, and motivated behavior. While often viewed as opposing or complementary systems, how DA and 5-HT release are integrated in the striatum remains elusive. Using optogenetics, fiber photometry and slice electrophysiology we found that ventral tegmental area (VTA) DA neuron stimulation increased DA release without affecting 5-HT release. Dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) 5-HT neuron activation, on the other hand, induced serotonin release and a modest, transient increase in DA in the NAc, likely via glutamate co-release onto VTA DA neurons. These findings suggest that DA and 5-HT operate largely independently in the striatum, with selective circuit-dependent interactions. This work refines our understanding of DA-5HT interactions and provides a foundation for future research into their roles in motivated behaviors and neuropsychiatric disorders.

">Synaptic editing of frontostriatal circuitry prevents excessive grooming in SAPAP3-deficient mice</a></h4>

              
                Synaptic dysfunction has been implicated as a key mechanism underlying the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders. Most pharmacological therapeutics for schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and major depressive disorder temporarily augment chemical synapse function. Nevertheless, medication non-compliance is a major clinical challenge, and behavioral dysfunction often returns following pharmacotherapeutic discontinuation. Here, we deployed a designer electrical synapse to edit a single class of chemical synapses in a genetic mouse model of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Editing these synapses in juvenile mice normalized circuit function and prevented the emergence of pathological repetitive behavior in adulthood. Thus, we establish precision circuit editing as a putative strategy for preventative psychotherapeutics.

">Neural correlates in basolateral and central amygdala during reward seeking in the face of punishment</a></h4>

              
                The inability to suppress actions despite adverse consequences is a hallmark of compulsive behaviors and is amygdala dependent. To study the amygdala's role in responding despite adverse consequences, we compared single-unit activity in the basolateral (BLA) or central (CeA) amygdala before and after reward-seeking under punishment threat. Rats started each trial by pressing an initial lever, which triggered an outcome-specific 5-s auditory cue (white noise, pure tone, or clicker), signaling one of three reinforcement conditions: 100% sucrose reward, 20% reward/80% omission, or 80% reward/20% footshock punishment. Next, the active and inactive levers were extended, and pressing on the active lever terminated the auditory cue and triggered an outcome-specific 1-s visual cue predicting either reward, reward omission, or shock. After training, we implanted eight tetrodes in the BLA (n=7) or CeA (n=5) and recorded single-unit activity of ~100 neurons per region during task performance. CeA neurons, and to a lesser extent BLA neurons, responded differently to the distinct auditory cues and outcomes. The discrimination between conditions partially explained the capacity of neuronal activity to predict the latency to lever press to complete the trial. The failure to suppress reward-seeking behavior in the face of punishment coincided with the reactivation of reward-seeking-sensitive and the loss of inhibition of punishment-sensitive neuronal populations. In conclusion, we found that after extended training, opposing populations of activated and inhibited neurons in CeA, and to a lesser extent in BLA, control completion of reward-seeking despite punishment.

">Auditory regulation of hippocampal locomotion circuits by a non-canonical reticular-limbic pathway</a></h4>

              
                The ability to rapidly detect and respond to unexpected auditory stimuli is critical for adaptive behavior, especially during locomotion. Since movement suppresses auditory cortical activity, it remains unclear how salient auditory information influences locomotor circuits. In this work, using in vivo calcium imaging, electrophysiology, chemo- and optogenetics, we investigate the path that relays loud broadband sounds to the dorsal hippocampus (dHPC) and modulates theta oscillations. We demonstrate that noise accelerates theta frequency and decreases its power, effects mediated by entorhinal cortex (EC) and medial septum (MS) inputs while independent of the primary auditory cortex. Activation of dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) neurons projecting to the pontine reticular nucleus (PRN) mimics noise-driven hippocampal responses, supporting a brainstem-limbic auditory processing route. Furthermore, noise selectively modulates CA1 pyramidal neuron and interneuron activity, reflecting diverse circuit dynamics. Finally, loud broadband noise stimulus increased theta coherence between the dHPC and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), enhancing interregional synchronization. These results highlight the mechanisms in which the DCN filters behaviorally relevant sounds promoting acoustic motor integration in the hippocampus during locomotion, without direct influence of the auditory cortex.

">Cortical functional connectivity across the adult lifespan and its relation to sensorimotor integration</a></h4>

              
                The operation of the human brain relies on functional networks enabled by inter-areal oscillatory synchronization between neuronal populations. Although disruptions in this functional connectivity are associated with brain disorders, evidence on its healthy age-dependent variation and behavioral relevance remains limited. Utilizing magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings from 576 adults, we investigated the evolution of resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC) across the healthy adult lifespan. We observed age-related, frequency-specific changes in widespread cortical networks. Alpha-band (8-13 Hz) rs-FC decreased and theta-band (4-8 Hz) rs-FC increased with age, while beta-band (13-30 Hz) rs-FC followed a non-linear trajectory, peaking in middle age. These patterns differed from concurrent changes in oscillatory power, underscoring their dissociable contributions. Notably, reduced beta-band rs-FC was associated with increased sensorimotor attenuation, indicating that changes in rs-FC are behaviorally relevant. These findings advance our understanding of healthy brain aging and highlight a link between resting-state brain activity and sensorimotor integration.

">Functional populations in prefrontal cortex related to working memory encoding and maintenance</a></h4>

              
                Nonlinear mixed selectivity, with neurons responding to diverse combinations of task-relevant variables, has been proposed as a key mechanism to enable flexible behavior and cognition. However, it is debated whether the structure of neural population responses in fronto-parietal cortices is better described as random mixed-selective or as non-random, that is, in terms of multiple subpopulations with stereotypical response profiles. Here, we show that neural activity in the macaque prefrontal cortex during a working memory and a visual response task is organized into subpopulations that provide a comprehensive description of the low-dimensional population dynamics. First, analysis of the demixed Principal Components shows that the neural code faithfully represents stimulus identity, task condition, and elapsed time during the trial. Second, a model-free analysis of the population structure reveals a significant degree of clustering, implying a non-random distribution of feature selectivity that is incompatible with random mixed selectivity. Closer inspection shows that stimulus-selective neurons also tend to be task-selective. Third, examining the contribution of stimulus-selective neurons to task-condition-related variance reveals two contrasting activity profiles that correspond to functionally different populations. One population responds during visual stimulation while the other activates during memory maintenance. Finally, the observed neural geometry explains how stable task and stimulus information can be read out from the population response using a linear decoder. Our results highlight that despite the heterogeneity of prefrontal responses during working memory, neurons do not represent random mixtures of task features but are structured according to neural subpopulations.

">Cognition is associated with task - related brain network reconfiguration in late childhood</a></h4>

              
                In order to transition between a resting state and carrying out cognitively-demanding processes the brain makes a host of subtle changes to its network organization. In adults, less reconfiguration relates to better task performance, suggesting a preconfigured brain organization at rest is beneficial, such that only minute changes are required to execute task demands. Here, we take a developmental lens to this phenomenon, examining reconfiguration in late childhood by leveraging a large sample of 9-11 year olds from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development Study. We find more reconfiguration between the resting state and two executive function tasks is related to better task performance, as well as better crystalized and fluid cognition in some cases. These relationships hold even when accounting for network segregation. These findings suggest a less-preconfigured, and thus more flexible, brain organization that enacts more reconfiguration to move from the resting state into a task state is beneficial in children. This aligns with theories positioning late childhood and the beginning of adolescence as a period of increased brain plasticity where functional brain networks are still undergoing refinement, and thus preconfiguration may be less beneficial and, instead, may place premature constraints on brain organization.

                Schizophrenia is a severe mental illness with high heritability, but its underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. We meta-analyzed large-scale brain transcriptomic data from mice harboring individual loss-of-function mutations in seven schizophrenia risk genes (Akap11, Dagla, Gria3, Grin2a, Sp4, Srrm2, Zmym2). While all studied brain regions were affected, the striatum and the thalamus emerged as key brain regions of convergence. Striatum showed downregulation of synapse- and oxidative phosphorylation-related gene sets in all models. In the thalamus, mutants separated into two groups based on transcriptomic phenotype: synapse-related gene sets were upregulated in mutants with only schizophrenia and bipolar association, and were downregulated in mutants that are associated with developmental delay/intellectual disability in addition to schizophrenia. Overall, our meta-analysis reveals convergence and divergence in brain transcriptomic phenotype in these schizophrenia genetic models, supports the involvement of striatal disturbance and synapse dysfunction in schizophrenia, and points to a key role of the thalamus.

">A dynamic gene regulatory code drives synaptic development of hippocampal granule cells</a></h4>

              
                Connecting neurons into functional circuits requires the formation, maturation, and plasticity of synapses. While advances have been made in identifying individual genes regulating synapse development, the molecular programs orchestrating their action during circuit integration of neurons remain poorly understood. Here, we take a multiomic approach to reconstruct gene regulatory networks (GRNs), comprising transcription factors (TFs), regulatory regions, and predicted target genes, in hippocampal granule cells (GCs). We find a dynamic gene regulatory code, with early and late postnatal GRNs regulating cell morphogenesis and synapse organization and plasticity, respectively. Our results predict sequential regulations, with early-active TFs delaying the activation of later GRNs and their putative synaptic targets. Using a loss-of-function approach, we identify Bcl6 as a regulator of pre- and postsynaptic structural maturation, and Smad3 as a modulator of inhibitory synaptic transmission, in GCs. Together, these findings highlight the networks of key TFs and target genes orchestrating GC synapse development.

">A cortical-hippocampal communication undergoes rebalancing after new learning</a></h4>

              
                The brain's ability to consolidate a wide range of memories while maintaining their distinctiveness across experiences remains poorly understood. Sharp-wave ripples, neural oscillations that occur predominantly within CA1 of the hippocampus during immobility and sleep, have been shown to play a critical role in the consolidation process. More recently, evidence has uncovered functional heterogeneity of pyramidal neurons within distinct sublayers of CA1 that display unique properties during ripples, potentially contributing to memory specificity. Despite this, it remains unclear exactly how ripples shift the activity of CA1 neuronal populations to accommodate the consolidation of specific memories and how sublayer differences manifest. Here, we studied interactions between the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and CA1 neurons during ripples and discovered a reorganization of their communication following learning. Notably, this reorganization appeared specifically for CA1 superficial (CA1sup) sublayer neurons. Utilizing a generalized linear model decoder, we demonstrate the pre-existence of ACC-to-CA1sup communication, which is suppressed during new learning and subsequent sleep suggesting that ACC activity may reallocate the contribution of CA1sup neurons during memory acquisition and consolidation. Further supporting this notion, we found that optogenetic stimulations of the ACC preferentially suppressed CA1sup interneurons while activating a unique subset of CA1 interneurons. Overall, these findings highlight a possible role of the ACC in rebalancing CA1 neuronal populations' contribution to ripple contents surrounding learning.

">Serotonergic and noradrenergic interactions in pupil-linked arousal</a></h4>

              
                Changes in central arousal state shape cortical computations underlying perception, thought, and action. Variations in arousal are accompanied by fluctuations in pupil size. In turn, pupil dynamics are often used as a marker of noradrenaline release from neurons of the locus coeruleus. The serotonergic system of the dorsal raphe also contributes to the brainstem control of waking states. However, little is known about its relationship to noradrenergic activity and arousal dynamics in awake animals. Here, we simultaneously accessed both systems in awake mice and unraveled their unique and joint contributions to pupil-linked arousal. Serotonergic and noradrenergic systems co-fluctuated, and serotonergic dorsal raphe neurons affected pupil size partly via noradrenergic populations in the locus coeruleus. Yet, part of the serotonergic control of pupil dynamics was independent of the locus coeruleus. Our findings challenge common assumptions about the neuromodulatory control of pupil dynamics and illuminate the interplay between distinct neurochemical systems within the arousal network of the brainstem.

">Sensory and action neural tuning explains how priors guide human visual decisions</a></h4>

              
                Prior expectations bias how we perceive the world. Despite well-characterized behavioral effects of priors, such as confirmation bias, their neural mechanisms remain unclear. Contemporary theories postulate conflicting predictions: does the brain enhance expected sensory information (sharpening the expected representation) or rather prioritize unexpected information (dampening the expected representations)? Here, we combined reversal learning with a noisy motion discrimination task to investigate how priors impact sensory and action information processing. Using behavioral modeling to infer participants' latent priors and EEG to track neural dynamics, we demonstrated that priors differentially impact sensory and action representations over time. While priors introduced long-lasting biases on action coding irrespective of their validity, sensory information was selectively enhanced with confirmatory evidence. Critically, dampening of action representations predicted confirmation biases, whereas sensory tuning dynamics tracked speed-accuracy trade-offs. These findings reveal a dissociable and temporally dynamic influence of priors in visual decisions, reconciling competing theories of predictive perception.

">Genomic and Transcriptomic Signatures of SETD1A Disruption in Human Excitatory Neuron Development and Psychiatric Disease Risk</a></h4>

              
                Genetic disruption of SETD1A markedly increases the risk for schizophrenia. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms, we generated isogenic organoid models of the developing human cerebral cortex harboring a SETD1A loss-of-function schizophrenia risk mutation. Employing chromatin profiling combined with RNA sequencing, we identified high-confidence SETD1A target genes, analyzed the impact of the mutation on SETD1A binding and transcriptional regulation and validated key findings with orthogonal approaches. Disruption of SETD1A function disturbs the finely tuned temporal gene expression in the excitatory neuron lineage, yielding an aberrant transcriptional program that compromises key regulatory and metabolic pathways essential for neurodevelopmental transitions. Although overall SETD1A binding remains unchanged in mutant neurons, we identified localized alterations in SETD1A binding that correlate with shifts in H3K4me3 levels and gene expression. These changes are enriched at enhancer regions, suggesting that enhancer-regulated genes are especially vulnerable to SETD1A reduction. Notably, target genes with enhancer-bound SETD1A are primarily linked to neuronal functions while those with promoter-bound SETD1A are enriched for basic cellular functions. By mapping the SETD1A binding landscape in excitatory neurons of the human fetal frontal cortex and integrating multimodal neuroimaging and genetic datasets, we demonstrate that the genomic context of SETD1A binding differentially correlates with macroscale brain organization and establish a link between SETD1A-bound enhancers, schizophrenia-associated brain alterations and genetic susceptibility. Our study advances our understanding of the role of SETD1A binding patterns in schizophrenia pathogenesis, offering insights that may guide future therapeutic strategies.

">Sensitivity analysis enlightens effects of connectivity in a Neural Mass Model under Control-Target mode</a></h4>

              
                Biophysical models of human brain represent the latter as a graph of inter-connected neural regions. Building from the model by Naskar et al. [1], our motivation was to understand how these brain regions can be connected at neural level to implement some inhibitory control, which calls for inhibitory connectivity rarely considered in such models. In this model, regions are made of inter connected excitatory and inhibitory pools of neurons, but are long-range connected only via excitatory pools (mutual excitation). We thus extend this model by generalizing connectivity, and we analyse how connectivity affects the behaviour of this model. Focusing on the simplest paradigm made of a Control area and a Target area, we explore four typical kinds of connectivity: mutual excitation, Target inhibition by Control, Control inhibition by Target, and mutual inhibition. For this, we build an analytical sensitivity framework, nesting up sensitivities of isolated pools, of isolated regions, and of the full system. We show that inhibitory control can emerge only in Target inhibition by Control and mutual inhibition connectivities. We next offer an analysis of how the model sensitivities depends on connectivity structure, depending on a parameter controling the strength of the self inhibition within Target region. Finally, we illustrate the effect of connectivity structure upon control effectivity in response to an external forcing in the Control area. Beyond the case explored here, our methodology to build analytical sensitivities by nesting up levels (pool, region, system) lays the groundwork for expressing nested sensitivities for more complex network configurations, either for this model or any other one.

">Long-term, age-associated activity quantification in the DE50-MD dog model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD)</a></h4>

              
                Animal models with a clinically relevant phenotype remain important for robust evaluation of novel therapeutics for the fatal, X-linked genetic disorder, Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD). Demonstration of functional improvement is crucial for both patients and regulatory authorities. DMD is associated with a decline in musculoskeletal function with progressive paresis, muscle atrophy and fibrosis: phenotypic features that are also seen in the DE50-MD canine model of DMD. Here we investigate non-invasive methods to quantify changes in activity and behaviour in DE50-MD dogs, using collar-based, tri-axial accelerometers. We measured activity in affected DE50-MD male dogs (3-8 per age point) and littermate wild-type (WT) male controls (3-13 per age point) at monthly intervals from 3 to 18 months of age using Axivity-AX3 accelerometers attached ventrally on each dog's collar. Data were recorded for 48 hours while dogs remained in their kennels with outside runs following their normal routine. Acceleration vector magnitudes were used to derive various activity indicators over a 24-hour period. Mixed model analyses were used to examine differences between affected and WT groups at different ages. DE50-MD dogs' activity indicators were significantly higher for % time spent at rest (p<0.001) and significantly lower for all other activity indicators (all p<0.05), when compared to age-matched WT dogs. Sample size calculations reveal that these non-invasive, unbiased and objective biomarkers offer significant promise for preclinical testing of therapeutics in this model of DMD. Our approach reveals opportunities for cross-model standardisation of activity monitoring methods, applicable to both research and companion animal settings.

                <p>Neurons adapt to chronic activity changes by modifying synaptic properties, including neurotransmitter release. However, whether neuropeptide release via dense core vesicles (DCVs)&mdash;a distinct regulated secretory pathway&mdash;undergoes similar adaptation remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that 24&nbsp;h action potential blockade leads to significant DCV accumulation in primary mouse cortical neurons of both sexes. Reactivation with action potential trains induced enhanced Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and 700% more DCV exocytosis compared with control neurons. Notably, total DCV cargo protein levels were unchanged, while mRNA levels of corresponding genes were reduced. Blocking neurotransmitter release with Tetanus toxin induced DCV accumulation, similar to that induced by network silencing with TTX. Hence, chronic network silencing triggers increased DCV accumulation due to reduced exocytosis during silencing. These accumulated DCVs can be released upon reactivation resulting in a massive potentiation of DCV exocytosis, possibly contributing to homeostatic mechanisms.</p>

                Objectives Infectious diseases present significant challenges to global health security in contemporary, interconnected global environments. This study aimed to evaluate and compare health security performance in Western Asia (WA), with a focus on income group-based disparities and region-specific insights. Methods This study utilized the Global Health Security Index (GHSI) to assess health security across 17 WA countries categorized by income level. Health security indicators for 2019 and 2021 were analyzed using the D-CRITIC method to determine the relative importance of each indicator (Global Health Security Index, 2021): https://ghsindex.org/report-model/). A combined D-CRITIC-CoCoSo framework was employed to rank the countries, followed by K-means clustering for grading. The study also investigated correlations between financial allocation’s indicators and health security outcomes using Spearman’s rank correlation. A comparative analysis elucidated regional disparities across income categories. Results This study highlights WA’s progress in health security by prioritizing foundational health systems, detection/reporting, rapid response, and risk management. From 2019 to 2021, priorities varied by income group, with high-income countries focusing on detection, upper-middle-income countries focusing on risk environments, and low-income countries focusing on prevention. While some nations demonstrated improvement, others, such as Armenia, experienced decline, revealing persistent vulnerabilities. This study revealed significant variability in health security capacity, with both progress and setbacks among countries in different clusters. High- and upper-middle-income countries, such as Qatar and Georgia, leverage investments and international partnerships to improve their rankings, while conflict-affected, low-resource countries, including Iraq, Yemen, and Syria, face stagnation or decline. Strong correlations were observed between financial resource allocation indicators and health performance. Higher investments in countries like Armenia and Georgia led to significantly improved health outcomes, while minimal spending in Syria and Yemen weakened their resilience to health threats. Conclusion Disparities in health resilience persist, underscoring the need for equitable resource allocation and regional cooperation to enhance public health security.

                Background The increasing incidence of emerging infectious diseases is posing serious global threats. Therefore, there is a clear need for developing computational methods that can assist and speed up experimental research to better characterize the molecular mechanisms of microbial infections. Methods In this context, we developed mimicINT, an open-source computational workflow for large-scale protein-protein interaction inference between microbe and human by detecting putative molecular mimicry elements mediating the interaction with host proteins: short linear motifs (SLiMs) and host-like globular domains. mimicINT exploits these putative elements to infer the interaction with human proteins by using known templates of domain-domain and SLiM-domain interaction templates. mimicINT also provides (i) robust Monte-Carlo simulations to assess the statistical significance of SLiM detection which suffers from false positives, and (ii) an interaction specificity filter to account for differences between motif-binding domains of the same family. We have also made mimicINT available via a web server. Results In two use cases, mimicINT can identify potential interfaces in experimentally detected interaction between pathogenic Escherichia coli type-3 secreted effectors and human proteins and infer biologically relevant interactions between Marburg virus and human proteins. Conclusions The mimicINT workflow can be instrumental to better understand the molecular details of microbe-host interactions.

                Background Predicting the number and distribution of Olympic medals in the future has become a hot topic, but predicting the number of Olympic medals is not easy and requires comprehensive consideration of multiple factors such as historical data, athlete performance, and host country effects. Method This article uses the GA-BP algorithm model, combined with genetic algorithm (GA) and backpropagation neural network (BPNN), to optimize the weights and bias parameters of the BP neural network using the global search capability of genetic algorithm, thereby improving training efficiency and prediction performance. By estimating the number of Olympic gold medals and total medals, verifying the accuracy of the model, and predicting the medal table for the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics. Meanwhile, based on the synthetic control model, Estonia and China were selected as research subjects to construct a virtual control group and two experimental groups for analysis. Result The experimental results showed that Estonia and China won more medals with a head coach than without one. In 1992, Estonia won 1 gold medal and 2 bronze medals under the guidance of excellent coaches, indicating the significant role of head coaches in improving athletes’ performance. Conclusion This study provides valuable insights for the decision-making of the Olympic Committee, revealing key factors in medal distribution, optimizing the allocation of national strategic resources, and predicting the performance of countries at future Olympic Games.

                Background The study investigates the impact of Managerial Ability (MA) on Working Capital Management Efficiency (WCME), focusing on how skilled management influences working capital practices. It also explores the variation in this relationship across firms with different characteristics such as profitability and market valuations within India’s economic landscape. Methods Using a balanced panel dataset of 150 listed companies from the National Stock Exchange (NSE) of India for the period 2014–2023, the study employs Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). WCME is assessed as a multidimensional efficiency metric incorporating inventory, accounts receivable, accounts payable, cost of goods sold , net revenue, and net income. MA is estimated using a two-step DEA-based approach, separating managerial ability from firm-specific characteristics. Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) regression models are applied to examine the individual and interactive effects of MA and Tobin’s Q (TBQ) on WCME along with other important variables. Results The results demonstrate that MA significantly enhances WCME, particularly in firms with lower TBQ. The analysis also reveals that skilled managerial characteristics amplifies the efficiency of working capital management, aligning with the Upper Echelon Theory's (UET) claim that managerial attributes play a critical role in organizational efficiency. Conclusion The study demonstrates managerial ability has a strong influence on corporate working capital policies. This advocates prevalence of certain fundamental concepts such as viz. Upper Echelon Theory (UET), Resource-Based View (RBV), and Agency Theory (AT). From managerial point of view, it is suggested to adopt strategic approaches in practicing WCME that will enhance firm’s competitive advantage and long-term sustainability.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-346/v1?src=rss">Assessing neuroinflammation in vitro in a microglial model: advancing cannabinoid-based therapeutic insights [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Neuroinflammation plays a critical role in the progression of neurological disorders such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases, as well as chronic pain. It is characterized by elevated production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, and TNF-α, by microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system. Emerging research highlights the involvement of the endocannabinoid system (ECS) in neuroinflammation, proposing cannabinoids as potential therapeutic agents owing to their immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory properties. Methods This study used an in vitro model, specifically the BV-2 murine microglial cell line, to assess neuroinflammation. Cell viability was measured using the MTT assay, and cytokine production was quantified using advanced nanobiosensor technologies, including Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR). Immunocytochemistry (ICC) was used to evaluate protein expression. Microglial cells were treated with varying concentrations of dexamethasone sodium phosphate (Dex-SP), cannabidiol (CBD), a full-spectrum tetrahydrocannabinol (FSE-THC) extract (70% THC), or a combination of the two at a 1:1 ratio (FSE-THC/CBD). Results The treatments did not affect BV-2 microglial cell viability. Nitric oxide (NO) production remained unaltered following treatment with Dex-SP, CBD, FSE-THC 70%, or FSE-THC:CBD in LPS-stimulated BV-2 microglia. However, CBD and FSE-THC:CBD significantly reduced TNF-α levels, whereas Dex-SP and CBD decreased IL-6 expression. Furthermore, Dex-SP, CBD, FSE-THC (70%), and FSE-THC:CBD modulated the activation of Bcl-2, Bax, TNF-α, IFN-γ, NF-κB, and iNOS in concentration- and treatment-specific manners. Conclusions Dex-SPs demonstrate acute anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-stimulated BV2 microglial cells. Specific cannabinoids at particular concentrations exhibit comparable or superior efficacy in modulating key inflammatory mediators. These findings suggest the therapeutic potential of cannabinoids in neuroinflammation, and emphasize the need for further investigation to optimize their application.

                The fields of epidemiology and viral phylodynamics share the ultimate goal of disease control, but concepts, methodologies and data employed by each differ in ways that confer complementary strengths and different areas of weakness. We recently introduced EpiFusion, a model for joint inference of outbreak characteristics using phylogenetic and case incidence data via particle filtering and demonstrated its usage to infer the effective reproduction number of simulated and real outbreaks. Here we provide a series of vignettes demonstrating data analysis using the EpiFusion Analysis Framework, consisting of the R package EpiFusionUtilities and the Java program in which the model is implemented, including an example using a new feature incorporated since EpiFusion’s last description: the option to provide a phylogenetic tree posterior as the phylogenetic data input to the program. By outlining these examples, we aim to improve the usability of our model, and promote workflow reproducibility and open research.

                Background Motivational variables are of critical importance concerning students' performance. The objective of the present study was to investigate the interrelationships between extrinsic and intrinsic motivation, self-efficacy, self-regulation, critical thinking, and academic performance among university students. Methods The participants were 250 students enrolled in university programs in education and psychology. The research instrument was a self-report questionnaire designed to assess intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, critical thinking, self-regulation, and academic achievement among university students. A path model analysis was employed to identify the relationships among the investigated variables. Results The results demonstrated that self-efficacy was predicted by intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, critical thinking was predicted by self-efficacy, and self-regulation was predicted by self-efficacy and critical thinking, thereby underscoring the pivotal role of self-efficacy. The findings indicate that academic achievement is predicted by critical thinking, and self-regulation, thereby underscoring the pivotal role of these variables in academic contexts. Conclusions The contributions of the present research are twofold, both theoretical and practical. On the one hand, the findings offer a more nuanced understanding of the interconnections between motivation, self-efficacy, critical thinking, and self-regulation. On the other hand, they provide valuable insights for developing educational strategies that enhance academic achievement by fostering these key factors.

                <p>by Barry Ryan, Riccardo Marioni, T. Ian Simpson</p>

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor symptoms resulting from the loss of dopamine-producing neurons in the brain. Currently, there is no cure for the disease which is in part due to the heterogeneity in patient symptoms, trajectories and manifestations. There is a known genetic component of PD and genomic datasets have helped to uncover some aspects of the disease. Understanding the longitudinal variability of PD is essential as it has been theorised that there are different triggers and underlying disease mechanisms at different points during disease progression. In this paper, we perform longitudinal and cross-sectional experiments to identify which data modalities or combinations of modalities are informative at different time points. We use clinical, genomic, and proteomic data from the Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative. We validate the importance of flexible data integration by highlighting the varying combinations of data modalities for optimal stratification at different disease stages in idiopathic PD. We show there is a shared signal in the DNAm signatures of participants with a mutation in a causal gene of PD and participants with idiopathic PD. We also show that integration of SNPs and DNAm data modalities has potential for use as an early diagnostic tool for individuals with a genetic cause of PD.

                <p>by Raheel Asghar, Nan Wu, Noman Ali, Yulei Wang, Mahinur Akkaya</p>

Understanding the biological functions of <i>Puccinia striiformis</i> f. sp. <i>tritici</i> (<i>Pst</i>) effectors is fundamental for uncovering the mechanisms of pathogenicity and variability, thereby paving the way for developing durable and effective control strategies for stripe rust. However, due to the lack of an efficient genetic transformation system in <i>Pst</i>, progress in effector function studies has been slow. Here, we modeled the structures of 15,201 effectors from twelve <i>Pst</i> races or isolates, a <i>Puccinia striiformis</i> isolate, and one <i>Puccinia striiformis</i> f. sp. <i>hordei</i> isolate using AlphaFold2. Of these, 8,102 folds were successfully predicted, and we performed sequence- and structure-based annotations of these effectors. These effectors were classified into 410 structure clusters and 1,005 sequence clusters. Sequence lengths varied widely, with a concentration between 101-250 amino acids, and motif analysis revealed that 47% and 5.81% of the predicted effectors contain known effector motifs [Y/F/W]xC and RxLR, respectively highlighting the structural conservation across a substantial portion of the effectors. Subcellular localization predictions indicated a predominant cytoplasmic localization, with notable chloroplast and nuclear presence. Structure-guided analysis significantly enhances effector prediction efficiency as demonstrated by the 75% among 8,102 have structural annotation. The clustering and annotation prediction both based on the sequence and structure homologies allowed us to determine the adopted folding or fold families of the effectors. A common feature observed was the formation of structural homologies from different sequences. In our study, one of the comparative structural analyses revealed a new structure family with a core structure of four helices, including Pst27791, PstGSRE4, and PstSIE1, which target key wheat immune pathway proteins, impacting the host immune functions. Further comparative structural analysis showed similarities between <i>Pst</i> effectors and effectors from other pathogens, such as AvrSr35, AvrSr50, Zt-KP4-1, and MoHrip2, highlighting a possibility of convergent evolutionary strategies, yet to be supported by further data encompassing on some evolutionarily distant species. Currently, our initial analysis is the most one on <i>Pst</i> effectors’ sequence, structural and annotation relationships providing a novel foundation to advance our future understanding of <i>Pst</i> pathogenicity and evolution.

                <p>by David Acunzo, Damiano Grignolio, Clayton Hickey</p>

The visual environment is complicated, and humans and other animals accordingly prioritize some sources of information over others through the deployment of spatial attention. Cognitive theories propose that one core purpose of this is to gather information that can be used in downstream cognitive processes, including the development of concepts and categories. However, neuroscientific investigation has focused closely on the identification of the systems and algorithms that support attentional control or that instantiate the effect of attention on sensation and perception. Much less is known about how attention impacts the acquisition and activation of concepts. Here, we use machine learning of EEG and concurrently recorded EEG/MRI to temporally and anatomically characterize the neural network that abstracts from attended perceptual information to activate and construct semantic and conceptual representations. We find that variance in the amplitude of N2pc—an event-related potential (ERP) component closely linked to selective attention—predicts the emergence of conceptual information in a network including VMPFC, posterior parietal cortex, and anterior insula. This network appears to play a key role in the attention-mediated translation of perceptual information to concepts, semantics, and action plans.

                TDP-43 pathology characterizes neurodegenerative diseases. Scialò et al. use in vitro-generated and patient-derived TDP-43 aggregates as seeds to show that seed-induced TDP-43 cytoplasmic aggregation causes its loss of function and downstream RNA misregulation. This new cell model shows TDP-43 aggregation and loss of function without overexpression or knockdown.

                Rummens et al. demonstrate that amyloid-like fibrils trigger TDP-43 aggregation and nuclear depletion, key hallmarks of neurodegenerative disorders. This provokes a unique transcriptomic signature with RNA splicing defects, including disease-specific cryptic splicing in human cells. Over time, fibril-induced TDP-43 pathology recapitulates distinct aggregate shapes and causes toxicity in iPSC-derived neurons.

                Xia et al. identify a mechanism of ovarian cancer resistance to cisplatin (CDDP) that involves arginine methylation of METTL3 by PRMT5, leading to enhanced HR-mediated DSBR. MST4 activates PRMT5 through direct phosphorylation. Inhibition of PRMT5 or METTL3 disrupts HR-DSBR and augments the cytotoxic effects of CDDP in ovarian tumor xenografts.

Through in vivo studies, the authors find that PDZD8 functions at neuronal ER-late endosome/lysosome membrane contact sites to promote lysosome maturation and accelerate autophagic flux. Increased autophagy in turn induces activity-dependent synapse formation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100527">A peptide-neurotensin conjugate that crosses the blood-brain barrier induces pharmacological hypothermia associated with anticonvulsant, neuroprotective, and anti-inflammatory properties following status epilepticus in mice</a></h4>

              
                Preclinical and clinical studies show that mild to moderate hypothermia is neuroprotective in sudden cardiac arrest, ischemic stroke, perinatal hypoxia/ischemia, traumatic brain injury, and seizures. Induction of hypothermia largely involves physical cooling therapies, which induce several clinical complications, while some molecules have shown to be efficient in pharmacologically induced hypothermia (PIH). Neurotensin (NT), a 13 amino acid neuropeptide that regulates body temperature, interacts with various receptors to mediate its peripheral and central effects. NT induces PIH when administered intracerebrally. However, these effects are not observed if NT is administered peripherally, due to its rapid degradation and poor passage of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). We conjugated NT to peptides that bind the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) to generate ‘vectorized’ forms of NT with enhanced BBB permeability. We evaluated their effects in epileptic conditions following peripheral administration. One of these conjugates, VH-N412, displayed improved stability, binding potential to both the LDLR and NTSR-1, rodent/human cross-reactivity and improved brain distribution. In a mouse model of kainate (KA)-induced status epilepticus (SE), VH-N412 elicited rapid hypothermia associated with anticonvulsant effects, potent neuroprotection, and reduced hippocampal inflammation. VH-N412 also reduced sprouting of the dentate gyrus mossy fibers and preserved learning and memory skills in the treated mice. In cultured hippocampal neurons, VH-N412 displayed temperature-independent neuroprotective properties. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report describing the successful treatment of SE with PIH. In all, our results show that vectorized NT may elicit different neuroprotection mechanisms mediated by hypothermia and/or by intrinsic neuroprotective properties.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101103">3D reconstruction of neuronal allometry and neuromuscular projections in asexual planarians using expansion tiling light sheet microscopy</a></h4>

              
                The intricate coordination of the neural network in planarian growth and regeneration has remained largely unrevealed, partly due to the challenges of imaging the CNS in three dimensions (3D) with high resolution and within a reasonable timeframe. To address this gap in systematic imaging of the CNS in planarians, we adopted high-resolution, nanoscale imaging by combining tissue expansion and tiling light-sheet microscopy, achieving up to fourfold linear expansion. Using an automatic 3D cell segmentation pipeline, we quantitatively profiled neurons and muscle fibers at the single-cell level in over 400 wild-type planarians during homeostasis and regeneration. We validated previous observations of neuronal cell number changes and muscle fiber distribution. We found that the increase in neuron cell number tends to lag behind the rapid expansion of somatic cells during the later phase of homeostasis. By imaging the planarian with up to 120 nm resolution, we also observed distinct muscle distribution patterns at the anterior and posterior poles. Furthermore, we investigated the effects of <i>β-catenin-1</i> RNAi on muscle fiber distribution at the posterior pole, consistent with changes in anterior-posterior polarity. The glial cells were observed to be close in contact with dorsal-ventral muscle fibers. Finally, we observed disruptions in neural-muscular networks in <i>inr-1</i> RNAi planarians. These findings provide insights into the detailed structure and potential functions of the neural-muscular system in planarians and highlight the accessibility of our imaging tool in unraveling the biological functions underlying their diverse phenotypes and behaviors.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100390">Electrophysiology and morphology of human cortical supragranular pyramidal cells in a wide age range</a></h4>

              
                The basic excitatory neurons of the cerebral cortex, the pyramidal cells, are the most important signal integrators for the local circuit. They have quite characteristic morphological and electrophysiological properties that are known to be largely constant with age in the young and adult cortex. However, the brain undergoes several dynamic changes throughout life, such as in the phases of early development and cognitive decline in the aging brain. We set out to search for intrinsic cellular changes in supragranular pyramidal cells across a broad age range: from birth to 85 y of age and we found differences in several biophysical properties between defined age groups. During the first year of life, subthreshold and suprathreshold electrophysiological properties changed in a way that shows that pyramidal cells become less excitable with maturation, but also become temporarily more precise. According to our findings, the morphological features of the three-dimensional reconstructions from different life stages showed consistent morphological properties and systematic dendritic spine analysis of an infantile and an old pyramidal cell showed clear significant differences in the distribution of spine shapes. Overall, the changes that occur during development and aging may have lasting effects on the properties of pyramidal cells in the cerebral cortex. Understanding these changes is important to unravel the complex mechanisms underlying brain development, cognition, and age-related neurodegenerative diseases.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97579">Dimeric R25CPTH(1–34) activates the parathyroid hormone-1 receptor in vitro and stimulates bone formation in osteoporotic female mice</a></h4>

              
                Osteoporosis, characterized by reduced bone density and strength, increases fracture risk, pain, and limits mobility. Established therapies of parathyroid hormone (PTH) analogs effectively promote bone formation and reduce fractures in severe osteoporosis, but their use is limited by potential adverse effects. In the pursuit of safer osteoporosis treatments, we investigated <sup>R25C</sup>PTH, a PTH variant wherein the native arginine at position 25 is substituted by cysteine. These studies were prompted by our finding of high bone mineral density in a hypoparathyroidism patient with the R25C homozygous mutation, and we explored its effects on PTH type-1 receptor (PTH1R) signaling in cells and bone metabolism in mice. Our findings indicate that <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1–84) forms dimers both intracellularly and extracellularly, and the synthetic dimeric peptide, <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1–34), exhibits altered activity in PTH1R-mediated cyclic AMP (cAMP) response. Upon a single injection in mice, dimeric <sup>R25C</sup>PTH(1–34) induced acute calcemic and phosphaturic responses comparable to PTH(1–34). Furthermore, repeated daily injections increased calvarial bone thickness in intact mice and improved trabecular and cortical bone parameters in ovariectomized (OVX) mice, akin to PTH(1–34). The overall results reveal a capacity of a dimeric PTH peptide ligand to activate the PTH1R in vitro and in vivo as PTH, suggesting a potential path of therapeutic PTH analog development.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96941">Compositional editing of extracellular matrices by CRISPR/Cas9 engineering of human mesenchymal stem cell lines</a></h4>

              
                Tissue engineering strategies predominantly rely on the production of living substitutes, whereby implanted cells actively participate in the regenerative process. Beyond cost and delayed graft availability, the patient-specific performance of engineered tissues poses serious concerns on their clinical translation ability. A more exciting paradigm consists in exploiting cell-laid, engineered extracellular matrices (eECMs), which can be used as off-the-shelf materials. Here, the regenerative capacity solely relies on the preservation of the eECM structure and embedded signals to instruct an endogenous repair. We recently described the possibility to exploit custom human stem cell lines for eECM manufacturing. In addition to the conferred standardization, the availability of such cell lines opened avenues for the design of tailored eECMs by applying dedicated genetic tools. In this study, we demonstrated the exploitation of CRISPR/Cas9 as a high precision system for editing the composition and function of eECMs. Human mesenchymal stromal/stem cell (hMSC) lines were modified to knock out vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and Runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) and assessed for their capacity to generate osteoinductive cartilage matrices. We report the successful editing of hMSCs, subsequently leading to targeted VEGF and RUNX2-knockout cartilage eECMs. Despite the absence of VEGF, eECMs retained full capacity to instruct ectopic endochondral ossification. Conversely, RUNX2-edited eECMs exhibited impaired hypertrophy, reduced ectopic ossification, and superior cartilage repair in a rat osteochondral defect. In summary, our approach can be harnessed to identify the necessary eECM factors driving endogenous repair. Our work paves the road toward the compositional eECMs editing and their exploitation in broad regenerative contexts.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100478">Layer 6 corticocortical neurons are a major route for intra- and interhemispheric feedback</a></h4>

              
                The neocortex comprises anatomically discrete yet interconnected areas that are symmetrically located across the two hemispheres. Determining the logic of these macrocircuits is necessary for understanding high level brain function. Here in mice, we have mapped the areal and laminar organization of the ipsi- and contralateral cortical projection onto the primary visual, somatosensory, and motor cortices. We find that although the ipsilateral hemisphere is the primary source of cortical input, there is substantial contralateral symmetry regarding the relative contribution and areal identity of input. Laminar analysis of these input areas show that excitatory Layer 6 corticocortical cells (L6 CCs) are a major projection pathway within and between the two hemispheres. Analysis of the relative contribution of inputs from supra- (feedforward) and infragranular (feedback) layers reveals that contra-hemispheric projections reflect a dominant feedback organization compared to their ipsi-cortical counterpart. The magnitude of the interhemispheric difference in hierarchy was largest for sensory and motor projection areas compared to frontal, medial, or lateral brain areas due to a proportional increase in input from L6 neurons. L6 CCs therefore not only mediate long-range cortical communication but also reflect its inherent feedback organization.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105005">Functionally important residues from graph analysis of coevolved dynamic couplings</a></h4>

              
                The relationship between protein dynamics and function is essential for understanding biological processes and developing effective therapeutics. Functional sites within proteins are critical for activities such as substrate binding, catalysis, and structural changes. Existing computational methods for the predictions of functional residues are trained on sequence, structural, and experimental data, but they do not explicitly model the influence of evolution on protein dynamics. This overlooked contribution is essential as it is known that evolution can fine-tune protein dynamics through compensatory mutations either to improve the proteins’ performance or diversify its function while maintaining the same structural scaffold. To model this critical contribution, we introduce DyNoPy, a computational method that combines residue coevolution analysis with molecular dynamics simulations, revealing hidden correlations between functional sites. DyNoPy constructs a graph model of residue–residue interactions, identifies communities of key residue groups, and annotates critical sites based on their roles. By leveraging the concept of coevolved dynamical couplings—residue pairs with critical dynamical interactions that have been preserved during evolution—DyNoPy offers a powerful method for predicting and analysing protein evolution and dynamics. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DyNoPy on SHV-1 and PDC-3, chromosomally encoded β-lactamases linked to antibiotic resistance, highlighting its potential to inform drug design and address pressing healthcare challenges.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100002">Deciphering the preeclampsia-specific immune microenvironment and the role of pro-inflammatory macrophages at the maternal–fetal interface</a></h4>

              
                Preeclampsia (PE), a major cause of maternal and perinatal mortality with highly heterogeneous causes and symptoms, is usually complicated by gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). However, a comprehensive understanding of the immune microenvironment in the placenta of PE and the differences between PE and GDM is still lacking. In this study, cytometry by time of flight indicated that the frequencies of memory-like Th17 cells (CD45RA<sup>−</sup>CCR7<sup>+</sup>IL-17A<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup>), memory-like CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (CD38<sup>+</sup>CXCR3<sup>−</sup>CCR7<sup>+</sup>Helios<sup>−</sup>CD127<sup>−</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup>) and pro-inflam Macs (CD206<sup>−</sup>CD163<sup>−</sup>CD38<sup>mid</sup>CD107a<sup>low</sup>CD86<sup>mid</sup>HLA-DR<sup>mid</sup>CD14<sup>+</sup>) were increased, while the frequencies of anti-inflam Macs (CD206<sup>+</sup>CD163<sup>−</sup>CD86<sup>mid</sup>CD33<sup>+</sup>HLA-DR<sup>+</sup>CD14<sup>+</sup>) and granulocyte myeloid-derived suppressor cells (gMDSCs, CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD15<sup>hi</sup>HLA-DR<sup>low</sup>) were decreased in the placenta of PE compared with that of normal pregnancy (NP), but not in that of GDM or GDM&amp;PE. The pro-inflam Macs were positively correlated with memory-like Th17 cells and memory-like CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells but negatively correlated with gMDSCs. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that transferring the F4/80<sup>+</sup>CD206<sup>−</sup> pro-inflam Macs with a Folr2<sup>+</sup>Ccl7<sup>+</sup>Ccl8<sup>+</sup>C1qa<sup>+</sup>C1qb<sup>+</sup>C1qc<sup>+</sup> phenotype from the uterus of PE mice to normal pregnant mice induced the production of memory-like IL-17a<sup>+</sup>Rora<sup>+</sup>Il1r1<sup>+</sup>TNF<sup>+</sup>Cxcr6<sup>+</sup>S100a4<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>+</sup> Th17 cells via IGF1–IGF1R, which contributed to the development and recurrence of PE. Pro-inflam Macs also induced the production of memory-like CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells but inhibited the production of Ly6g<sup>+</sup>S100a8<sup>+</sup>S100a9<sup>+</sup>Retnlg<sup>+</sup>Wfdc21<sup>+</sup> gMDSCs at the maternal–fetal interface, leading to PE-like symptoms in mice. In conclusion, this study revealed the PE-specific immune cell network, which was regulated by pro-inflam Macs, providing new ideas about the pathogenesis of PE.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/98896">Natural variation in salt-induced changes in root:shoot ratio reveals SR3G as a negative regulator of root suberization and salt resilience in Arabidopsis</a></h4>

              
                Soil salinity is one of the major threats to agricultural productivity worldwide. Salt stress exposure alters root and shoots growth rates, thereby affecting overall plant performance. While past studies have extensively documented the effect of salt stress on root elongation and shoot development separately, here we take an innovative approach by examining the coordination of root and shoot growth under salt stress conditions. Utilizing a newly developed tool for quantifying the root:shoot ratio in agar-grown <i>Arabidopsis</i> seedlings, we found that salt stress results in a loss of coordination between root and shoot growth rates. We identify a specific gene cluster encoding domain-of-unknown-function 247 (DUF247), and characterize one of these genes as <span class="underline">S</span>alt <span class="underline">R</span>oot:shoot <span class="underline">R</span>atio <span class="underline">R</span>egulator <span class="underline">G</span>ene (SR3G). Further analysis elucidates the role of SR3G as a negative regulator of salt stress tolerance, revealing its function in regulating shoot growth, root suberization, and sodium accumulation. We further characterize that <i>SR3G</i> expression is modulated by <i>WRKY75</i> transcription factor, known as a positive regulator of salt stress tolerance. Finally, we show that the salt stress sensitivity of <i>wrky75</i> mutant is completely diminished when it is combined with <i>sr3g</i> mutation. Together, our results demonstrate that utilizing root:shoot ratio as an architectural feature leads to the discovery of a new stress resilience gene. The study’s innovative approach and findings not only contribute to our understanding of plant stress tolerance mechanisms but also open new avenues for genetic and agronomic strategies to enhance crop environmental resilience.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99957">The value of initiating a pursuit in temporal decision-making</a></h4>

              
                Reward-rate maximization is a prominent normative principle in behavioral ecology, neuroscience, economics, and AI. Here, we identify, compare, and analyze equations to maximize reward rate when assessing whether to initiate a pursuit. In deriving expressions for the value of a pursuit, we show that time’s cost consists of both apportionment and opportunity cost. Reformulating value as a discounting function, we show precisely how a reward-rate-optimal agent’s discounting function (1) combines hyperbolic and linear components reflecting apportionment and opportunity costs, and (2) is dependent not only on the considered pursuit’s properties but also on time spent and rewards obtained outside the pursuit. This analysis reveals how purported signs of suboptimal behavior (hyperbolic discounting, and the Delay, Magnitude, and Sign effects) are in fact consistent with reward-rate maximization. To better account for observed decision-making errors in humans and animals, we then analyze the impact of misestimating reward-rate-maximizing parameters and find that suboptimal decisions likely stem from errors in assessing time’s apportionment—specifically, underweighting time spent outside versus inside a pursuit—which we term the ‘Malapportionment Hypothesis’. This understanding of the true pattern of temporal decision-making errors is essential to deducing the learning algorithms and representational architectures actually used by humans and animals.

">Hsp90 buffers behavioral plasticity by regulating Pdf transcription in clock neurons of Drosophila melanogaster</a></h4>

              
                Circadian rhythms are prevalent on Earth and temporally organize behaviour and physiology of organisms to occur in species-specific 'temporal niches'. However, species differ in how strictly individuals are controlled by their circadian clock, suggesting that it may offer a selective advantage for an individual to extend its temporal niche under certain circumstances, for example during stressful environmental conditions. A potential mechanism controlling temporal niche adherence involves the evolutionary capacitor and chaperon protein HSP90, known to assist the proper folding of important signalling molecules. If HSP90 becomes rate limiting (e.g., under environmental stress) hidden genetic variation will be expressed, producing novel and potentially beneficial phenotypes for the individual. While this role of HSP90 is well established for morphological traits, we show here that it extends to regulation of temporal behavioural patterns. We show that within a small subset of clock neurons in the fly brain, HSP83, the fly homologue of HSP90, mitigates inter-individual behavioural plasticity. We provide evidence for the requirement of HSP83 for efficient transcription of the gene encoding the circadian neuropeptide Pigment Dispersing Factor (PDF), and for correct PDF accumulation in central clock neurons. Strikingly, Hsp83 mutants affect synchronized oscillations of the clock protein PERIOD (PER) in subsets of circadian clock neurons in the same way as flies without PDF, further supporting a role of Hsp83 in regulating Pdf. Our findings therefore provide a mechanistic explanation for HSP83 function in regulation of behavioural plasticity, and offer an explanation for how to restrict temporal niche extension to stressful environmental conditions.

">Dynamic structural connectivity changes in cortical and cortico-striatal strokes in mice</a></h4>

              
                Stroke is a primary global health concern, leading to significant mortality and long-term disability. Beyond immediate neuronal damage, functional and structural connectivity is altered brain-wide with implications for functional deficits and recovery. It remains unclear, however, if the level of degeneration, i.e. reduced myelination and axonal damage, as well as compensatory plasticity, i.e., axonal sprouting and remyelination, depend on the lesion size and topology. This study compares for the first time two different stroke models in adult male mice, with the aim of uncovering the dynamics in white matter changes. Repetitive diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) over four weeks post photothrombotic cortical (1.41+/-0.92% of brain volume), and middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) cortico-striatal (11.53+/-2.8% of brain volume), strokes were used to map structural connectivity changes at the whole-brain level. We quantified inter- and intra-hemispheric seed strength changes over time, with seed strength reflecting how strongly each region is connected to the rest of the brain. Differences between groups and time points were assessed using a mixed model corrected for multiple comparisons. In conclusion, large cortico-striatal lesions led increased structural connectivity in sensorimotor regions, whereas small cortical lesions induced asymmetric connectivity changes: an increase extending globally from the ischemic hemisphere and a decrease expanding globally from the healthy hemisphere. These findings highlight that stroke severity and lesion size significantly affect the temporal dynamics and spatial distribution of connectivity disruptions, emphasizing the need for targeted monitoring of neural changes post-stroke.

">Aggregation of the constitutively active K296E rhodopsin mutant contributes to retinal degeneration</a></h4>

              
                A K296E mutation in rhodopsin causes autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa, a progressive retinal degenerative disease. Early in vitro characterizations of this mutation studied on a bovine rhodopsin background indicated that the mutation causes the receptor to be constitutively active. This molecular defect has been the primary focus when considering the pathogenic mechanism of the mutation. Knockin mice expressing the K296E rhodopsin mutant were generated and characterized to better understand the pathogenic mechanism of the mutation. Knockin mice exhibited progressive retinal degeneration characteristic of retinitis pigmentosa. The K296E rhodopsin mutant mislocalized in photoreceptor cells and, surprisingly, appeared to aggregate, as indicated by the dye PROTEOSTAT, which binds protein aggregates. The propensity of the K296E rhodopsin mutant to aggregate was tested and confirmed in vitro but was dependent on the species background of rhodopsin. The K296E mutation on either murine or human rhodopsin backgrounds exhibited similar propensities to aggregate. The same mutation on a bovine rhodopsin background, however, exhibited a lower propensity to aggregate, indicating this species background does not adequately model the effects of the K296E mutation. In contrast to previous expectations, we demonstrate here that aggregation of the K296E rhodopsin mutant can promote photoreceptor cell loss.

">Vulnerability to memory decline in aging. A mega-analysis of structural brain change.</a></h4>

              
                Brain atrophy is a key factor behind episodic memory loss in aging, but the nature and ubiquity of this relationship remains poorly understood. This study leveraged 13 longitudinal datasets, including 3,737 cognitively healthy adults (10,343 MRI scans; 13,460 memory assessments), to determine whether brain change-memory change associations are more pronounced with age and genetic risk for Alzheimer's Disease. Both factors are associated with accelerated brain decline, yet it remains unclear whether memory loss is exacerbated beyond what atrophy alone would predict. Additionally, we assessed whether memory decline aligns with a global pattern of atrophy or stems from distinct regional contributions. Our mega-analysis revealed a nonlinear relationship between memory decline and brain atrophy, primarily affecting individuals with above-average brain structural decline. The associations were stronger in the hippocampus but also spread across diverse cortical and subcortical regions. The associations strengthened with age, reaching moderate associations in participants in their eighties. While APOE {varepsilon}4 carriers exhibited steeper brain and memory loss, genetic risk had no effect on the change-change associations. These findings support the presence of common biological macrostructural substrates underlying memory function in older age which are vulnerable to multiple age-related factors, even in the absence of overt pathological changes.

">A therapeutic role for a regulatory glucose transporter1 (Glut1)-associated natural antisense transcript</a></h4>

              
                The mammalian brain relies primarily on glucose for its energy needs. Delivery of this nutrient to the brain is mediated by the glucose transporter-1 (Glut1) protein. Low Glut1 thwarts glucose entry into the brain, causing an energy crisis and, triggering, in one instance, the debilitating neurodevelopmental condition, Glut1 deficiency syndrome (Glut1DS). Current treatments for Glut1DS are sub-optimal, as none address the root cause, low Glut1, of the condition. Levels of this transporter must respond rapidly to the brain's changing energy requirements. This necessitates fine-tuning its expression. Here we describe a long-noncoding RNA (lncRNA) antisense to Glut1 and show that it is involved in such regulation. Raising levels of the lncRNA had a concordant effect on Glut1 in cultured human cells and transgenic mice; reducing levels elicited the opposite effect. Delivering the lncRNA to Glut1DS model mice via viral vectors induced Glut1 expression, enhancing brain glucose levels to mitigate disease. Direct delivery of such a lncRNA to combat disease has not been reported previously and constitutes a unique therapeutic paradigm. Moreover, considering the importance of maintaining homeostatic Glut1 levels, calibrating transporter expression via the lncRNA could become broadly relevant to the myriad conditions, including Alzheimer's disease, wherein Glut1 concentrations are perturbed.

">A factor-based analysis of individual human microglia uncovers regulators of an Alzheimer-related transcriptional signature</a></h4>

              
                Human microglial heterogeneity is only beginning to be appreciated at the molecular level. Here, we present a large, single-cell atlas of expression signatures from 441,088 live microglia broadly sampled across a diverse set of brain regions and neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory diseases obtained from 161 donors sampled at autopsy or during a neurosurgical procedure. Using single-cell hierarchical Poisson factorization (scHPF), we derived a 23-factor model for continuous gene expression signatures across microglia which capture specific biological processes (e.g., metabolism, phagocytosis, antigen presentation, inflammatory signaling, disease-associated states). Using external datasets, we evaluated the aspects of microglial phenotypes that are encapsulated in various in vitro and in vivo microglia models and identified and replicated the role of two factors in human postmortem tissue of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Further, we derived a complex network of transcriptional regulators for all factors, including regulators of an AD-related factor enriched for the mouse disease-associated microglia 2 (DAM2) signature: ARID5B, CEBPA, MITF, and PPARG. We replicated the role of these four regulators in the AD-related factor and then designed a multiplexed MERFISH panel to assess our microglial factors using spatial transcriptomics. We find that, unlike cells with high expression of the interferon-response factor, cells with high expression of the AD DAM2-like factor are widely distributed in neocortical tissue. We thus propose a novel analytic framework that provides a taxonomic approach for microglia that is more biologically interpretable and use it to uncover new therapeutic targets for AD.

">The development of visual acuity and crowding: Finding the balance between fine detail and 'gist' processing</a></h4>

              
                The adult visual system is characterised by high-resolution foveal vision and a peripheral field limited by crowding, the disruption to object recognition in clutter that gives a summary 'gist' in place of fine detail. In children, crowding is elevated in the fovea, with estimates of the age where foveal crowding drops to adult-like levels varying widely from 5 to 12+ years. As crowding restricts key processes like reading, better characterisation of this developmental trajectory is critical. We developed methods optimised to measure crowding in children, whereby adults and typically developing children aged 3-13 years (n=119) judged the orientation of a foveal 'VacMan' target either in isolation or surrounded by 'ghost' flankers. Stimulus sizes and separation were scaled adaptively. In the isolated condition, acuity (measured as gap-size thresholds) dropped rapidly to adult-like levels at 5-6 years. Thresholds rose when flankers were added, demonstrating foveal crowding at all ages. These elevations were highest at 3-4 years and persisted at 5-6 years, dropping to adult-like levels at 7-8 years. A meta-analysis of our thresholds and those from 11 prior studies reveals the same overall developmental trajectory, despite widely varying stimuli and procedures, with some divergent estimates likely driven by measurement confounds such as underestimated adult crowding levels. We further demonstrate that developmental foveal crowding shows the same selectivity for target-flanker similarity as peripheral crowding, consistent with common mechanisms. This prolonged development of crowding reveals a shifting balance in the visual system between the processing of fine detail vs. the 'gist' of the scene.

">Working memory readout varies with frontal theta rhythms</a></h4>

              
                Increasing evidence suggests that attention varies rhythmically, phase-locked to ongoing cortical oscillations. Here, we report that the phase of theta oscillations (3 to 6 Hz) in the frontal eye field (FEF) is associated with temporal and spatial variation of the read-out of information from working memory (WM). Non-human primates were briefly shown a sample array of colored squares. A short time later, they viewed a test array and were rewarded for identifying which square changed color (the target). Better performance (accuracy and reaction time) varied systematically with the phase of local field potential (LFP) theta at the time of test array onset as well as the target location. This is consistent with theta scanning across the FEF and thus visual space from top to bottom. Theta was coupled, on opposing phases, to both spiking and beta (12 to 20 Hz). These results could be explained by a wave of activity that moves across the FEF, modulating the readout of information from WM.

">On variability in local field potentials</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal coding and decoding would be compromised if neuronal responses were highly variable. Intriguingly, neuronal spike counts (SCs) show a reduction in across-trial variance (ATV) in response to sensory stimulation, when SC variance is normalized by SC mean, that is, when using the Fano factor 1. Inspired by this seminal finding, ATV has also been studied in electroencephalography (EEG) signals, revealing effects of various stimulus and cognitive factors as well as disease states. Here, we empirically show that outside of evoked potentials, the ATV of the EEG or local field potential (LFP) is very highly correlated to the intra-trial variance (ITV), which corresponds to the well-known power metric. We propose that the LFP power, rather than the raw LFP signal, should be considered with regard to putative changes of its variability. We quantify LFP power variability as the standard deviation of the logarithm of the power ratio between an active and a baseline condition, normalized by the mean of that log(power ratio), that is the coefficient of variation (CV) of the log(power ratio). This CV(log(power ratio)) is reduced for gamma and alpha power when they are enhanced by stimulation, and it is enhanced for alpha power when it is reduced by stimulation. This suggests a potential inverse relation between changes in band-limited power and the corresponding CV. We propose that the CV(log(power ratio)) is a useful metric that can be computed for numerous existing and future LFP, EEG or MEG datasets, which will provide insights into those signals' frequency-specific variability and how they might be used for neuronal coding and decoding.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-341/v1?src=rss">Hybrid optimization technique for matrix chain multiplication using Strassen’s algorithm [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Matrix Chain Multiplication (MCM) is a fundamental problem in computational mathematics and computer science, often encountered in scientific computing, graphics, and machine learning. Traditional MCM optimization techniques use Dynamic Programming (DP) with Memoization to determine the optimal parenthesization for minimizing the number of scalar multiplications. However, standard matrix multiplication still operates in O(n3) time complexity, leading to inefficiencies for large matrices. Methods In this paper, we propose a hybrid optimization technique that integrates Strassen’s algorithm into MCM to further accelerate matrix multiplication. Our approach consists of two key phases: (i) matrix chain order optimization, using a top-down memoized DP approach, we compute the best multiplication sequence, and (ii) hybrid multiplication strategy, we selectively apply Strassen’s algorithm for large matrices (n ≥ 128), reducing the complexity from O(n3) to O(n2.81), while using standard multiplication for smaller matrices to avoid recursive overhead. We evaluate the performance of our hybrid method through computational experiments comparing execution time, memory usage, and numerical accuracy against traditional MCM and Strassen’s standalone multiplication. Results Our results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid method achieves significant speedup (4x–8x improvement) and reduces memory consumption, making it well-suited for large-scale applications. This research opens pathways for further optimizations in parallel computing and GPU-accelerated matrix operations. Conclusion This study presents a hybrid approach to Matrix Chain Multiplication by integrating Strassen’s algorithm, reducing execution time and memory usage. By selectively applying Strassen’s method for large matrices, the proposed technique improves efficiency while preserving accuracy. Future work can focus on parallel computing and GPU acceleration for further optimization.

                In cases where vaginal delivery is not feasible and the mother's or the child's health is in danger, a Caesarean section (CS) is medically warranted. The World Health Organization (WHO) projects that between 10% and 15% of all births will have medically justifiable CS rates. Globally, WHO estimates that 6.2 million CSs are performed each year without medical justification. The determination to proceed with or forgo a CS can be understood as the result of weighing three key categories of influence: demand-side factors, supply-side factors, and clinical factors. Each of these categories contributes uniquely to the ultimate decision of whether to perform a CS, highlighting the multifaceted nature of this healthcare challenge. Within each input, there is also, often, a complex interplay. For example, there is a local narrative of mothers seeking an elective CS being "too posh to push", inextricably linking household socioeconomic factors and maternal preferences. On the supply side there are issues of the policy within the healthcare facility (private hospitals prefer CSs) and an interplay with time management and maximizing the efficiency of the facility. Bangladesh's CS has been on the rise; according to the most recent survey, it was 45%, far higher than the WHO recommendation. The private sector interacts with the high rates of CS in Bangladesh; MOH Bangladesh has little control over this sector. To optimize the CS rate, the nation must first recognize that needless CS is an issue and take all necessary action to address it.

                Background Iron deficiency is the most common nutritional deficiency worldwide, affecting more than 1 billion people. Recent evidence has highlighted iron status as a key requirement for effective immune responses. Iron deficiency is common in pregnant women and vaccines are mandated at this stage of life. In the antenatal clinics (ANC) of the Shoklo Malaria Research Unit on the Thailand-Myanmar border, all pregnant women receive nutritional iron supplements at prophylactic or treatment dosages, as determined by haematocrit. Migrant pregnant women have been offered vaccination against diphtheria-tetanus since 1997, and since April-2022 COVID-19 vaccination, as indicated by vaccine history. In this setting, nearly 10% of pregnant women are anaemic at their first ANC visit; approximately 50% of anaemic women receiving treatment doses of nutritional supplements respond by increasing haematocrit after one month of supplementation. Methods This study aimed to investigate whether response to iron supplementation is associated with improved vaccine responses in pregnant women with anemia in this setting. We will monitor three groups of pregnant women vaccinated at their first ANC visit before 28 weeks of gestation receiving nutritional iron-containing multiple micronutrient supplements (Sangobion®, Procter&Gamble): 1) non-anaemic women who receive preventive doses of supplementation, 2) anaemic women who display a haematocrit response to treatment doses, and 3) anaemic women who do not respond to treatment doses. The primary endpoint is the difference in the geometric mean titer ratio (rGMT, comparing baseline to 28 days post-vaccination) of diphtheria-tetanus and COVID vaccine-specific antibodies between anaemic women who respond and those who fail to make a haematocrit response to iron-containing interventions. Discussion Iron deficiency in different populations is associated with poor vaccine efficacy, and nutritional iron supplementation may improve the immune response to vaccines. Interventions that significantly increase vaccine efficacy would represent a major benefit to public health.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-722/v4?src=rss">Legal aspects and government policy in increasing the role of MSMEs in the Halal ecosystem [version 4; peer review: 1 approved, 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Indonesia currently could not make it to the top ten global halal due to some external and internal factors, although it is the largest Muslim country. In the external sector, the competition map is getting tougher, while internally, there are handicaps in the form of weak public awareness of competition. As a country with the largest Muslim population in the world, Indonesia can become one of the largest markets in the world. As indicated in the Global Islamic Economic Report (GIER), Indonesia is one of the top ten countries that control the Islamic economic market, yet it fails to dominate its Islamic market. Accordingly, the government needs to play a stronger role through regulatory policies to encourage the development of the Islamic economic ecosystem in Indonesia (halal value chain). The purpose of this study is to find out and analyse the existence of Micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in Indonesia in the world’s market for Halal products and Services. Methods The researchers have conducted a form of normative juridical research with the analytical descriptive method, namely by collecting, describing, analysing, and presenting what is (das sein) and what ought to be (das sollen). Results Support from the government and stakeholders has not been optimal in improving welfare - capital access, management, and halal certification, so the existence of the global halal ecosystem has not yet impacted MSMEs’ ability to compete competitively. Conclusions The conclusion of this study shows that the quadruple helix innovation system is capable of guaranteeing the development of MSMEs in a manner to achieves a high level of competitiveness - efficiency, and effectiveness of the products and services produced.

                <p>Stress is a common occurrence for military personnel. This can include the stress of deployment and active combat. Anxiety is considered a reaction to stress, and with anxiety-related disorders on the rise, it is imperative that stress be considered a preexisting condition when studying a number of neurological conditions. To determine the effects of stress on the behavioral outcomes of traumatic brain injury (TBI), we used a 3&nbsp;d acute unpredictable stress (AUS) model followed by blast-induced neurotrauma (BINT) to assess social anhedonia and anxiety-like behaviors in male and female rats. The animals were divided into four groups including unstressed and uninjured control (Con), stress-only animals (AUS), injury-only animals (BINT), and animals that received both stress and injury (AUS + BINT). In the males, behavioral tests such as elevated plus and three-chamber sociability (3-CS) showed that stress plays a dominant role in determining behavioral outcomes after TBI with the AUS + BINT animals behaving more similarly to the AUS animals than the BINT animals. Other tests, such as open field, showed that AUS + BINT had an additive effect on anxiety-like behavior or that prestress could even have a protective effect as seen in three-chamber social novelty (3-CSN). Behavioral assessment of female animals showed that AUS + BINT had the opposite effect than it did on the males in both three-chamber sociability and three-chamber social novelty, while the open field results were similar to the males. This study shows that neurological changes driven by stress have an effect on the behavioral outcomes of BINT.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/12/3/ENEURO.0033-24.2025?rss=1">Characteristics of Spontaneous Anterior-Posterior Oscillation-Frequency Convergences in the Alpha Band</a></h4>

              
                <p>Anterior&ndash;posterior interactions in the alpha band (8&ndash;12&nbsp;Hz) have been implicated in various functions including perception, attention, and working memory. The underlying neural communication can be flexibly controlled by adjusting phase relations when activities across anterior&ndash;posterior regions oscillate at a matched frequency. We thus investigated how alpha oscillation frequencies spontaneously converged along anterior&ndash;posterior regions by tracking oscillatory EEG activity while participants rested. As more anterior&ndash;posterior regions (scalp sites) frequency-converged, the probability of additional regions joining the frequency convergence increased, and so did oscillatory synchronization (i.e., oscillatory power) at participating regions, suggesting that anterior&ndash;posterior frequency convergences are driven by inter-regional entrainment. Notably, frequency convergences were accompanied by two types of approximately linear phase gradients, one progressively phase lagged in the anterior direction, the posterior-to-anterior (P-A) gradient, and the other progressively phase lagged in the posterior direction, the anterior-to-posterior (A-P) gradient. These gradients implied traveling waves propagating in the feedforward and feedback directions, respectively. Interestingly, while in natural viewing frequency convergences were accompanied by both gradient types (occurring at different frequencies) regardless of anterior&ndash;posterior routes, when the eyes were closed, the P-A and A-P gradients spatially segregated, channeling feedforward flows of information primarily through the midline and feedback flows primarily through each hemisphere. Future research may investigate how eye closure organizes information flows in this way and how it influences hierarchical information processing. Future research may also investigate the functional roles of frequency-convergence contingent traveling waves in contrast to those generated by other mechanisms.</p>

                <p>Delayed motor development is an early clinical sign of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. However, changes at the neural circuit level that underlie early motor differences are underexplored. The striatum, the principal input nucleus of the basal ganglia, plays an important role in motor learning in adult animals, and the maturation of the striatal circuit has been associated with the development of early motor behaviors. Here, we briefly exposed pregnant C57BL/6 dams to ethanol (5% w/w) in a liquid diet on embryonic days 13.5&ndash;16.5 and assessed the mouse progeny using a series of nine brief motor behavior tasks on postnatal days 2&ndash;14. Live brain slices were then obtained from behaviorally tested mice for whole-cell voltage- and current-clamp electrophysiology to assess GABAergic/glutamatergic synaptic activity and passive/active properties in two populations of striatal neurons: GABAergic interneurons and spiny striatal projection neurons. Electrophysiologically recorded spiny striatal projection neurons were also filled intracellularly with biocytin for post hoc analysis of dendritic morphology. We found that prenatal ethanol exposure resulted in developmental motor delays that were more severe in male mice and coincided with sex-dependent differences in the maturation of striatal neurons. Our findings indicate that prenatal ethanol exposure results in dynamic morphological and functional changes to the developmental trajectories of striatal neurons commensurate with the development of motor behaviors that differ between male and female mice.</p>

                <p>When attempting to concurrently perform two distinct cognitive tasks, the performance of either task is frequently compromised. This phenomenon is known as dual-task interference. Although multiple task features have been postulated to influence on dual-task interference, the primary determinant remains unclear. The determinant factor causing dual-task interference is an important issue to understand its mechanism and associated functions including switching tasks and planning task order. The present study investigated this issue using monkeys and three behavioral tasks requiring distinct cognitive processes (spatial working memory, SWM; working memory and long-term memory of objects, PA; object working memory, DMS) and manipulating task pair (SWM and PA or SWM and DMS), task order (fixed or randomized), and task difficulty (different delay lengths). The task introduced first showed better performance as compared with the task introduced second, suggesting the task order as an important factor. However, the performance of the SWM task decreased when preceded by the PA and DMS tasks, while the latter tasks were unaffected when the SWM task was introduced first. This tendency was more obvious in random-order conditions than fixed-order conditions. Further, interference effect increased as task difficulty increased. Although the task order is one determinant, our results show the difference in cognitive process needed for tasks, its complexity, and the demand of working memory resources as more significant determinants for deciding the dominant task in dual-task conditions, indicating importance of neural mechanisms including managing working memory resources and coordinating multiple cognitive processes to understand the cause of dual-task interference.</p>

                Primary pancreatic lymphoma (PPL) is an exceptionally rare malignancy, often misdiagnosed as pancreatic adenocarcinoma due to overlapping and non-specific clinical and radiological features. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has been increasingly associated with the development of lymphoproliferative disorders, particularly B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL). Herein, we present a case of a 63-year-old male with chronic HCV infection and F2 hepatic fibrosis who presented with abdominal pain, pruritus, and weight loss. Radiological imaging revealed a pancreatic mass which was subsequently confirmed via histopathological examination to be diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Despite the initiation of antiviral therapy, the patient succumbed before starting chemotherapy. This case underscores the potential association between HCV infection and PPL, highlighting the importance of early antiviral treatment to prevent severe extrahepatic complications.

The study investigated the impact of conventional mouthwashes on orthodontic archwires' Modulus of Elasticity (MoE). Methods It was an in vitro study that tested MoE of stainless steel (SS), nickel-titanium (NiTi), and β-titanium (β-Ti) archwires after immersing them in chlorhexidine (CHX), sodium fluoride (NaF), and HiORA mouthwashes along with distilled water (control) for one minute daily over three months. The wires were then subjected to a three-point bending test to measure their flexural modulus of elasticity (MoE) while applying loading and unloading forces at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, and 2.5 mm deflections. Statistical analysis included two-way ANOVA and Tukey’s Post Hoc test at significant α≤0.05. Results NaF reduced MoE for SS (loading 172.99 ± 7.71 GPa, unloading 148.88 ± 14.65 GPa), NiTi (Loading: 48.42 ± 6.13 GPa, unloading 30.60 ± 4.29 GPa), β-Ti wires (unloading 79.51 ± 1.62 GPa) than Control (loading 185.35 ± 8.06 GPa, unloading 199.78 ± 9.49 GPa) with p<0.05. CHX mouthwash reduced SS (loading -158.58 ± 4.47 GPa, unloading-138.54 ± 6.12 GPa), NiTi (unloading 37.05 ± 2.58 GPa), β-Ti (unloading 81.58 ± 7.94 GPa) with p<0.05. HiORA showed no significant differences in MoE for SS (loading 190.28 ± 7.54 GPa, unloading 185.58 ± 5.35 GPa), NiTi (loading 58.85 ± 2.39, unloading 37.05 ± 2.58), or β-Ti archwire (loading 89.92 ± 2.20, unloading 104.22 ± 5.00) compared to the controls with p<0.05. Conclusion HiORA herbal mouthwash is safe for NiTi, SS, and β-Ti archwires at all stages. Chlorhexidine (CHX) mouthwash should be prescribed briefly to prevent MoE degradation in NiTi and β-Ti archwires. NaF-based rinses should be cautiously used and monitored in SS, NiTi, and β-Ti archwires patients.

                Background Cognitive decline and dementia disproportionately affect Black/African populations in the United States, influenced by lifestyle, socioeconomic, and health disparities. This study examines the association between lifestyle factors and cognitive decline using data from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) dataset. Methods A cross-sectional analysis was conducted using NACC data on 24,476 Black/African adults. Key variables included age, sex, education, BMI, smoking status, alcohol use, mental health indicators (depression, anxiety, PTSD), and vascular health markers (hypertension, blood pressure). Multivariable regression models were used to assess the relationship between lifestyle factors and cognitive decline, measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) sum scores. Results The study population had a mean age of 74.5 years, with 74.1% being female. Education levels varied, with 46.84% completing high school and 18.74% attaining a bachelor’s degree or higher. The mean BMI was 29.46 kg/m2, indicating a high prevalence of overweight and obesity, and 77.1% had hypertension, yet only 8.02% were on antihypertensive medication. MMSE scores declined significantly with increasing age (β = -0.09, p < 0.001) and higher depression scores (β = -0.27, p < 0.001), while higher education levels were associated with better cognitive performance (β = 0.42, p < 0.001). Obesity showed a non-linear association, with midlife obesity linked to higher dementia risk but late-life low BMI correlated with frailty and cognitive impairment. Hypertension and elevated systolic blood pressure were weak but significantly associated with cognitive decline (p < 0.001). Alcohol consumption (48.77%) and smoking (8%) had mixed effects, with heavy drinking negatively affecting cognition. Conclusion Modifiable risk factors, including obesity, hypertension, depression, and limited educational attainment, significantly influence cognitive outcomes in Black/African populations. Targeted public health interventions, improved healthcare access, and culturally tailored lifestyle modifications could mitigate cognitive decline and dementia risk in this population.

                Background The heavy metal contamination of water leads to major environmental and health problems throughout the Mantaro River basin area. The study assesses the adsorption capacity of surface-modified chak’o nano-clay for extracting lead (Pb2+) and arsenic (As5+). Methods Surface modifications of unmodified nano-clay were achieved using through Aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES), iron oxide (Fe3O4), and combined APTES + Fe3O4 modifications of unmodified nano-clay particles. Adsorption performance was assessed through batch experiments over 8 hours. BET and XPS analyses were conducted to determine surface area, pore volume, and functional group availability. Adsorption kinetics were modeled using a pseudo-second-order model, and equilibrium data were analyzed using the Langmuir isotherm. Results The dual surface modification produced maximum removal capacities which led to a 95–100% removal performance of Pb2+ and As5+ over 8 hours. The BET and XPS analysis demonstrated that surface area (300 m2/g to 375 m2/g) and pore volume (0.420 cm3/g to 0.600 cm3/g) as well as functional group availability increased substantially thus resulting in improved adsorption. The pseudo-second-order model fit well for adsorption kinetic data while equilibrium data fit Langmuir isotherm behavior to describe monolayer adsorption. The dual treatment of APTES in combination with iron oxide generated an adsorbent with better magnetic properties and electrical conductivity thus improving its recovery potential and structural stability. The dual-modified nano-clay showed high stability during three cycles through desorption tests because it maintained more than 90% of its original adsorption capacity throughout the process. Conclusion The research shows that specialized surface treatments deliver advanced heavy metal absorption abilities to chak’o nano-clay which positions it as a leading choice for sustainable water system heavy metal remediation.

                <p>by Carla M. Kumbale, Qiang Zhang, Eberhard O. Voit</p>

Dioxins are persistent environmental pollutants known for their multiple health effects, from skin rashes to liver dysfunction, reproductive toxicity and cancer. While the hazards of dioxins have been well documented, the challenge of developing a comprehensive understanding of the overall health impact of dioxins remains. We propose to address this challenge with a new approach methodology (NAM) consisting of a novel adaptation of the Template-and-Anchor (T&A) modeling paradigm. Generically, the template model is defined as a high-level coarse-grained model capturing the main physiological processes of the system. The variables of this template model are anchor models, which represent component sub-systems in greater detail at lower biological levels. For the case of dioxin, we design the template to capture the systemic effects of dioxin on the body’s handling of cholesterol. Two new anchor models within this template elucidate the effects of dioxin on cholesterol transport in the bloodstream and on sex hormone steroidogenesis and the menstrual cycle. A third anchor model, representing dioxin-mediated effects on cholesterol biosynthesis via the mevalonate pathway, had been developed previously. The T&A modeling paradigm enables a holistic evaluation of the impact of toxicants, which in the future may be translated into a powerful tool for comprehensive computational health risk assessments, personalized medicine, and the development of virtual clinical trials.

Aortic stenosis (AS) leads to alterations of supra-valvular flow patterns which can cause increased damage of red blood cell (RBC) membranes. We investigated these patient specific patterns of a severe AS patient and their reversal in healthy flow through a 4D Flow MRI-based CFD methodology. Computational models of subject-specific aortic geometries were created using in-vivo medical imaging data. Temporally and spatially resolved boundary conditions derived from 4D Flow MRI were implemented for an AS patient and a healthy subject. After validation of the in-silico results with in-vivo data, a healthy inflow profile was set for the AS patient in the CFD model. Pathological versus healthy flow fields were compared regarding their blood flow characteristics, i.e., shear stresses on RBCs and helicity. The accuracy of the 4D Flow MRI-based CFD model was proven with excellent agreement between in-vivo and in-silico velocity fields and R² = 0.9. A pathological high shear stress region in the bulk flow was present during late systole with an increase of 125% compared to both healthy flow. The physiological bihelical structure with predominantly right-handed helices vanished for the pathological state. Instead, a left-handed helix appeared, accompanied by an overall increase in turbulent kinetic energy in areas of accumulated left-handed helicity. The validated 4D Flow MRI-based CFD model identified marked differences between AS and healthy flow. It suggests that altered turbulent and helical structures in the bulk flow are the cause for increased, potentially damaging forces acting upon RBCs in AS.

Soil organisms represent the most abundant and diverse organisms on the planet and support almost every ecosystem function we know, and thus impact our daily lives. Some of these impacts have been well-documented, such as the role of soil organisms in regulating soil fertility and carbon sequestration; processes that have direct implications for essential ecosystem services including food security and climate change mitigation. Moreover, soil biodiversity also plays a critical role in supporting other aspects from One Health—the combined health of humans, animals, and the environment—to the conservation of historic structures such as monuments. Unfortunately, soil biodiversity is also highly vulnerable to a growing number of stressors associated with global environmental change. Understanding how and when soil biodiversity supports these functions, and how it will adapt to changing environmental conditions, is crucial for conserving soils and maintaining soil processes for future generations. In this Essay, we discuss the fundamental importance of soil biodiversity for supporting multiple ecosystem services and One Health, and further highlight essential knowledge gaps that need to be addressed to conserve soil biodiversity for the next generations.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27223?af=R">Dopamine Transporter Imaging as Objective Monitoring Biomarker in Parkinson's Disease</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Although dopamine transporter (DaT) imaging is a valuable diagnostic biomarker, few studies have investigated its utility in objectively monitoring disease progression in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). To date, no study has established a longitudinal relationship between the DaT signal decline and the motor symptom increase, potentially due to neglected factors such as brain regions, disease laterality, and symptom subtypes, which this study addresses.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This cohort study included participants who met the Movement Disorder Society (MDS) criteria for PD, with longitudinal imaging and clinical data from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative Database. Linear mixed model analyses were used to investigate the relationship between the DaT signal decline and the motor symptom severity increase over time. We hypothesized that a decline in putaminal DaT availability in the less affected hemisphere would be associated with increasing contralateral motor symptoms, measured by the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). Additional models explored the effects of different brain regions (caudate and putamen), symptom categories (MDS UPDRSIII score with and without tremor items), and disease onset laterality (left or right hemisphere).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We included 719 participants (443 male patients and 276 female patients; mean age = 62.2 ± 9.5 years) with 1,981 available data points. As hypothesized, we observed a significant association between the decrease in the less affected putaminal DaT signal and motor symptom increase in the contralateral body side, independent of including or excluding tremor scores.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings support the use of repetitive DaT imaging for objectively monitoring PD progression. This could facilitate personalized disease tracking, subtyping, and intervention testing in the future. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

     alt="Evidence for Auditory Stimulus-Specific Adaptation But Not Deviance Detection in Larval Zebrafish Brains"/>
<p>The mismatch negativity response is brain activity following an unexpected auditory stimulus in humans. We used whole-brain calcium imaging to characterize auditory responses to unexpected sounds in larval zebrafish. Auditory neuron responses decrease after repetition of specific frequencies without generalization between frequencies, evidence of stimulus-specific adaptation. However, we did not find evidence for deviance responses to unexpected sounds within a sequence or to the unexpected omission of sounds from a sequence.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Animals receive a constant stream of sensory input, and detecting changes in this sensory landscape is critical to their survival. One signature of change detection in humans is the auditory mismatch negativity (MMN), a neural response to unexpected stimuli that deviate from a predictable sequence. This process requires the auditory system to adapt to specific repeated stimuli while remaining sensitive to novel input (stimulus-specific adaptation [SSA]). MMN was originally described in humans, and equivalent responses have been found in other mammals and birds, but it is not known to what extent this deviance detection circuitry is evolutionarily conserved. Here we present the first evidence for SSA in the brain of a teleost fish, using whole-brain calcium imaging of larval zebrafish at single-neuron resolution with selective plane illumination microscopy. We found frequency-specific responses across the brain with variable response amplitudes for frequencies of the same volume and created a loudness curve to model this effect. We presented an auditory “oddball” stimulus in an otherwise predictable train of pure tone stimuli and did not find a population of neurons with specific responses to deviant tones that were not otherwise explained by SSA. Further, we observed no deviance responses to an unexpected omission of a sound in a repetitive sequence of white noise bursts. These findings extend the known scope of auditory adaptation and deviance responses across the evolutionary tree and lay groundwork for future studies to describe the circuitry underlying auditory adaptation at the level of individual neurons.</p>

                The human brain is characterized by impressive cognitive abilities. The neocortex is the seat of higher cognition, and neocortex expansion is a hallmark of human evolution. While developmental programs are similar in different species, the timing of developmental transitions and the capacity of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) to proliferate differ, contributing to the increased production of neurons during human cortical development. Here, we review the epigenetic regulation of developmental transitions during corticogenesis, focusing mostly on humans while building on knowledge from studies in mice. We discuss metabolic-epigenetic interplay as a potential mechanism to integrate extracellular signals into neural chromatin. Moreover, we synthesize current understanding of how epigenetic and metabolic deregulation can cause neurodevelopmental disorders. Finally, we outline how developmental timing can be investigated using brain organoid models.

                Oligodendrocyte lineage cells (OLCs), comprising oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) and oligodendrocytes, are pivotal in sculpting central nervous system (CNS) architecture and function. OPCs mature into oligodendrocytes, which enwrap axons with myelin sheaths that are critical for enhancing neural transmission. Notably, OLCs actively respond to neuronal activity, modulating neural circuit functions. Understanding neuron–OLC interactions is key to unraveling how OLCs contribute to CNS health and pathology. This review highlights insights from zebrafish and mouse models, revealing how synaptic and extrasynaptic pathways converge to shape spatiotemporal calcium (Ca2+) dynamics within OLCs. We explore how Ca2+ signal integration across spatial and temporal scales acts as a master regulator of OLC fate determination and myelin plasticity.

                Spontaneous pain, characterized by episodic shooting or stabbing sensations, is a significant complaint among neuropathic pain patients but remains poorly understood. Xie et al. provide evidence that triggers of spontaneous pain and clustered firings are dynamic movements of blood vessels in the sensory ganglion, detected by Piezo2 receptors in adjacent neurons.
