	<p>Nocardia brain abscess is relatively rare, accounting for about 1–2% of all brain abscesses, and its mortality rate is three times higher than of other types of bacterial brain abscesses; thus, early diagnosis and treatment are essential. Nocardia brain abscess generally occurs in immunodeficient patients. We report a case of Nocardia farcinica brain abscess in a multiple myeloma patient treated with proteasome inhibitor (bortezomib and ixazomib), cyclophosphamide, and corticosteroid. The patient was treated with ceftriaxone and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, together with drainage of the brain abscess. Regular brain MRI follow-ups showed that intracranial lesions were gradually absorbed and improved.</p>

	<p>The ability to rapidly process others’ emotional signals is crucial for adaptive social interactions. However, to date it is still unclear how observing emotional facial expressions affects the reactivity of the human motor cortex. To provide insights on this issue, we employed single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to investigate corticospinal motor excitability. Healthy participants observed happy, fearful and neutral pictures of facial expressions while receiving TMS over the left or right motor cortex at 150 and 300 ms after picture onset. In the early phase (150 ms), we observed an enhancement of corticospinal excitability for the observation of happy and fearful emotional faces compared to neutral expressions specifically in the right hemisphere. Interindividual differences in the disposition to experience aversive feelings (personal distress) in interpersonal emotional contexts predicted the early increase in corticospinal excitability for emotional faces. No differences in corticospinal excitability were observed at the later time (300 ms) or in the left M1. These findings support the notion that emotion perception primes the body for action and highlights the role of the right hemisphere in implementing a rapid and transient facilitatory response to emotional arousing stimuli, such as emotional facial expressions.</p>

<p>In the mammalian peripheral nervous system, axon regeneration occurs spontaneously after injury. This study examined if axon regeneration after sciatic nerve crush injury was sex dependent and found that the extent of axon regeneration was indistinguishable in male and female mice. Transcriptome analysis revealed that many genes associated with neurite outgrowth were commonly induced in the two sexes, despite that a majority of genes were sex-dependently induced by injury. Therefore, although male and female mice exhibit similar axon regeneration, the mechanisms involved might not be identical.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Axons in the adult mammalian central nervous system fail to regenerate after injury. By contrast, spontaneous axon regeneration occurs in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) due to a supportive PNS environment and an increase in the intrinsic growth potential induced by injury via cooperative activation of multifaceted biological pathways. This study compared axon regeneration and injury responses in C57BL/6 male and female mice after sciatic nerve crush (SNC) injury. The extent of axon regeneration <i>in vivo</i> was indistinguishable in male and female mice when observed at 3 days after SNC injury, and primary dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons from injured, male and female mice extended axons to a similar length. Moreover, the induction of selected regeneration-associated genes (RAGs), such as <i>Atf3</i>, <i>Sprr1a</i>, <i>Gap43</i>, <i>Sox11</i>, <i>Jun</i>, <i>Gadd45a</i>, and <i>Smad1</i> were comparable in male and female DRGs when assessed by quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Furthermore, the RNA-seq analysis of male and female DRGs revealed that differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in SNC groups compared to sham-operated groups included many common genes associated with neurite outgrowth. However, we also found that a large number of genes in the DEGs were sex dependent, implicating the involvement of distinct gene regulatory network in the two sexes following peripheral nerve injury. In conclusion, we found that male and female mice mounted a comparable axon regeneration response and many RAGs were commonly induced in response to SNC. However, given that many DEGs were sex-dependently expressed, future studies are needed to investigate whether they contribute to peripheral axon regeneration, and if so, to what extent.</p>

     alt="Neuroimmunological complications arising from chemotherapy-induced gut toxicity and opioid exposure in female dark agouti rats"/>
<p>5-Fluorouracil-induced gut toxicity resulted in a main neuroimmunological effect in the thoracic region with carprofen ameliorating this effect. Buprenorphine and tramadol increased astrocyte reactivity marker expression, yet decreased thoracic IL-1beta expression. Understanding the peripheral-to-central complications arising in chemotherapy-induced toxicities and analgesic treatments may elucidate potential mechanisms contributing to the central complications arising from chemotherapy.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Cancer patients may experience symptom clusters, including chemotherapy-induced (CI) gut toxicity (CIGT) and cognitive impairment. Analgesic selection for pain associated with CIGT is difficult as opioids induce glial reactivity and unwanted side effects. This study quantified central glial reactivity and proinflammatory effects in rats with CIGT using three mechanistically different analgesics. Regional adaptations were indicative of immune-to-brain signaling routes. Utilizing a 5-fluorouracil-induced GT (5IGT) rat model and analgesic intervention (carprofen (CAR), buprenorphine (BUP), and tramadol (TRAM)), spinal and brain neuroimmune modulation was examined via microglial, astrocyte, and proinflammatory (cluster of differentiation molecule 11b; CD11b, glial fibrillary associated protein; GFAP, and interleukin-1 beta; IL1β) reactivity marker expression changes by western blot analysis. 5IGT significantly increased thoracic GFAP (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) and IL-1β (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001) expression, CAR and BUP ameliorated these effects. BUP and TRAM with 5-FU synergistically increased hippocampal GFAP expression. CAR administered with 5IGT significantly elevated hippocampal and thoracic CD11b expression levels (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). The neuroimmune responses observed in this study suggest activation of peripheral-to-central immune signaling pathways. We speculate that the opioid-induced hippocampal changes inferred a humorally mediated mechanism, whereas thoracic neuroimmune modifications indicated activation of an indirect neural route. Although TRAM ameliorated 5IGT-intestinal inflammation, this opioid presents complications relating to bodyweight and regional glial dysregulation (neuroinflammation) and may not be optimal in the management of pain associated with 5IGT. The chemotherapy-induced gut-derived neuroimmune consequences observed suggest a potential mechanistic contribution to central components of the cancer symptom cluster experience, while the opioid-related glial changes have implications for optimal pain management in this setting warranting further investigation.</p>

<p>Mice were subjected to the acquisition, extinction, and reinstatement of methamphetamine-induced conditioned place preference, and fecal samples were collected at each phase.

<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The gut–brain axis provides a pathway for the interaction between gut microbiota and methamphetamine (METH) addiction. However, the gut microbial signatures during different phases of METH use remain unclear. In the present study, we established models of acquisition, extinction, and reinstatement of METH-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) in male mice and detected the gut microbiome profiles of the fecal samples at the three phases by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Our results revealed that the richness of the gut microbiome increased following repeated METH administration, and it decreased after 4 weeks of abstinence. The microbial richness remained at a low level after one METH challenge at the reinstatement phase. The abundance of several genera including <i>Prevotella</i>, <i>Bacteroides</i>, and <i>Lactobacillus</i> differentially altered among phases of METH-induced CPP. The co-occurrence networks of the gut microbiome became weaker and more unstable during the development of METH-induced CPP at the extinction and reinstatement phases. Notably, the predicted gene functions of short-chain fatty acid metabolism, which were correlated with the abundance of <i>Prevotella</i>, <i>Bacteroides</i>, and <i>Lactobacillus</i>, were found differentially enriched among phases of METH-induced CPP. Our findings highlight a potential association between perturbations of the gut microbiome and different phases of METH use.</p>

<p>The differential effects of osteopontin on major functions of primary resting and activated astrocytes.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The glycoprotein osteopontin is highly upregulated in central nervous system (CNS) disorders such as ischemic stroke. Osteopontin regulates cell growth, cell adhesion, homeostasis, migration, and survival of various cell types. Accordingly, osteopontin is considered an essential regulator of regeneration and repair in the ischemic milieu. Astrocytes are the most abundant cells in the CNS and play significant roles in health and disease. Astrocytes are involved in homeostasis, promote neuroprotection, and regulate synaptic plasticity. Upon activation, astrocytes may adopt different phenotypes, termed A1 and A2. The direct effects of osteopontin on astrocytes, especially in distinct activation states, are yet unknown. The current study aimed to elucidate the impact of osteopontin on resting and active astrocytes. We established an inflammatory <i>in vitro</i> model of activated (A1) primary astrocytes derived from neonatal wistar rats by exposure to a distinct combination of proinflammatory cytokines. To model ischemic stroke <i>in vitro</i>, astrocytes were subjected to oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) in the presence or absence of osteopontin. Osteopontin modulated the activation phenotype by attenuating A1- and restoring A2-marker expression without compromising the active astrocytes’ immunocompetence. Osteopontin promoted the proliferation of active and the migration of resting astrocytes. Following transient OGD, osteopontin mitigated the delayed ongoing death of primary astrocytes, promoting their survival. Data suggest that osteopontin differentially regulates essential functions of resting and active astrocytes and confirm a significant regulatory role of osteopontin in an <i>in vitro</i> ischemia model. Furthermore, the data suggest that osteopontin constitutes a promising target for experimental therapies modulating neuroregeneration and repair.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) has been shown to improve vestibular function potentially via stochastic resonance, however, it remains unknown how central vestibular nuclei process these signals. <i>In vivo</i> work applying electrical stimuli to the vestibular apparatus of animals has shown changes in neuronal discharge at the level of the primary vestibular afferents and hair cells. This study aimed to determine the cellular impacts of stochastic, sinusoidal, and stochastic + sinusoidal stimuli on individual medial vestibular nucleus (MVN) neurons of male and female C57BL/6 mice. All stimuli increased the irregularity of MVN neuronal discharge, while differentially affecting neuronal gain. This suggests that the heterogeneous MVN neuronal population (marked by differential expression of ion channels), may influence the impact of electrical stimuli on neuronal discharge. Neuronal subtypes showed increased variability of neuronal firing, where Type A and B neurons experienced the largest gain changes in response to stochastic and sinusoidal stimuli. Type C neurons were the least affected regarding neuronal firing variability and gain changes. The membrane potential (MP) of neurons was altered by sinusoidal and stochastic + sinusoidal stimuli, with Type B and C neuronal MP significantly affected. These results indicate that GVS-like electrical stimuli impact MVN neuronal discharge differentially, likely as a result of heterogeneous ion channel expression.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The brain undergoes rapid, dramatic, and reversible transitioning between states of wakefulness and unconsciousness during natural sleep and in pathological conditions such as hypoxia, hypotension, and concussion. Transitioning can also be induced pharmacologically using general anesthetic agents. The effect is selective. Mobility, sensory perception, memory formation, and awareness are lost while numerous housekeeping functions persist. How is selective transitioning accomplished? Classically a handful of brainstem and diencephalic “arousal nuclei” have been implicated in driving brain-state transitions on the grounds that their net activity systematically varies with brain state. Here we used transgenic targeted recombination in active populations mice</p>

<p>Overexpression of WT α-syn and the mutant α-syn A30P promotes the increase of Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in mitochondria and the reduction in contact sites between the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, disrupting the IP3R-GRP75 interaction. Disruption of mitochondria-associated ER membranes causes a reduction in calcium transfer from endoplasmic reticulum to mitochondria.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Mitochondria-associated ER membranes (MAMs) are formed by close and specific components in the contact sites between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria, which participate in several cell functions, including lipid metabolism, autophagy, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling. Particularly, the presence of α-synuclein (α-syn) in MAMs was previously demonstrated, indicating a physical interaction among some proteins in this region and a potential involvement in cell dysfunctions. MAMs alterations are associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and contribute to the pathogenesis features. Here, we investigated the effects of α-syn on MAMs and Ca<sup>2+</sup> transfer from the ER to mitochondria in WT- and A30P α-syn-overexpressing SH-SY5Y or HEK293 cells. We observed that α-syn potentiates the mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψ<sub>m</sub>) loss induced by rotenone, increases mitophagy and mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload. Additionally, in α-syn-overexpressing cells, we found a reduction in ER–mitochondria contact sites through the impairment of the GRP75–IP3R interaction, however, with no alteration in VDAC1–GRP75 interaction. Consequently, after Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the ER, α-syn-overexpressing cells demonstrated a reduction in Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffering by mitochondria, suggesting a deregulation in MAM activity. Taken together, our data highlight the importance of the α-syn/MAMs/Ca<sup>2+</sup> axis that potentially affects cell functions in PD.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Cognitive impairments are characteristics of patients with white matter hyperintensities (WMHs), and hypoperfusion is currently a relatively recognized mechanism of WMHs. Brain activity is closely coupled to the regulation of local blood flow. This study aimed to investigate the abnormal local brain activity of patients with WMHs from the viewpoint of the static amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (sALFF) and dynamic amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (dALFF). Seventy-four patients with WMHs and 35 healthy controls (HCs) were included. Based on the Fazekas scale, patients with WMHs were further divided into a mild WMH group (<i>n</i> = 33, Fazekas score 1–2) and moderate-severe WMH group (<i>n</i> = 41, Fazekas score 3–6). The sALFF and dALFF values were calculated separately and neuropsychological tests including the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT), Trail Making Test (TMT), and Boston Naming Test (BNT) were completed by all participants. Patients with WMHs showed increased sALFF and dALFF values in the bilateral thalamus and decreased performance in the MoCA test, AVLT-immediate, AVLT-delay, AVLT-recognition, TMT-A, and BNT. The dALFF values in the bilateral thalamus was correlated with the MoCA in HCs. The sALFF values in the bilateral thalamus correlated with TMT-B in patients with WMHs. Patients with WMHs showed abnormal brain activity and decreased functional stability of the bilateral thalamus, which may be a potential mechanism of decreased executive function.</p>

                Mitochondrial defects are tightly linked to axon degeneration, yet the underlying cellular mechanisms remain poorly understood. In C. elegans, PVQ axons that lack mitochondria degenerate spontaneously with age. Using an unbiased genetic screen, we found that cell-specific activation of CaMKII/UNC-43 suppresses axon degeneration due to loss of mitochondria. Unexpectedly, CaMKII/UNC-43 protects against degeneration through the conserved Sarm1/TIR-1-ASK1/NSY-1 MAPK pathway. In addition, we show that disrupting a trafficking complex composed of calsyntenin/CASY-1, Mint/LIN-10, and kinesin suppresses axon degeneration. Further analysis indicates that disruption of this trafficking complex activates the CaMKII-Sarm1-MAPK pathway through L-type voltage-gated calcium channels. Our findings identify CaMKII as a pivot point between mitochondrial defects and axon degeneration, describe how it is regulated in this context, and uncover a surprising neuroprotective role for the Sarm1-ASK1 pathway.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Post-encoding modulation of spatial memory by a GABAA-agonist</a></h4>

              
                We investigated the role of the post-encoding period for consolidation of self-centered (egocentric) and world-centered (allocentric) spatial memory in neurologically normal human subjects. We used the GABAA-ergic anesthetic propofol to transiently modulate neural activity during the early stage of spatial memory consolidation. A total of 52 patients undergoing minor surgery learned to navigate to a target in a five-armed maze derived from animal experiments immediately prior to injection of propofol (early group) or more than 60 minutes before injection (late group). Two hundred and forty minutes after anesthesia, subjects were tested for memory-guided navigation. Our results show a selective impairment of memory-guided navigation in the early group and near-normal performance in the late group. Both egocentric and allocentric navigation were affected, albeit with distinct error patterns. In the egocentric condition, early group patients navigated significantly more often to a wrong alley of the maze but showed normal navigation times, thus suggesting a deficit mainly for memory of sequences of path segments. By contrast, in the allocentric condition, early group patients mostly navigated to the correct alley of the maze but showed a significant increase in detours and prolonged navigation times, thus suggesting a weakened representation of the relationship between landmarks. We conclude that presumably hippocampus-dependent networks contribute to early consolidation of representations underlying both egocentric and allocentric memory-guided navigation. Distinct aspects of these representations are susceptible to GABAA-ergic modulation within a post-encoding time-window of less than 60 minutes, indicating a redistribution and reconfiguration of spatial memory networks early during consolidation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The Drosophila TMEM184B ortholog Tmep ensures proper locomotion by restraining ectopic firing at the neuromuscular junction</a></h4>

              
                TMEM184B is a putative seven-pass membrane protein that promotes axon degeneration after injury. TMEM184B mutation causes aberrant neuromuscular architecture and sensory and motor behavioral defects in mice. The mechanism through which TMEM184B causes neuromuscular defects is unknown. We employed Drosophila melanogaster to investigate the function of the TMEM184B ortholog, Tmep (CG12004) at the neuromuscular junction. We show that Tmep is required for full adult viability and efficient larval locomotion. Tmep mutant larvae have a reduced body contraction rate compared to controls, with stronger deficits in females. Surviving adult Tmep mutant females show bang sensitivity, a phenotype associated with epileptic seizures. In recordings from body wall muscles, Tmep mutants show substantial hyperexcitability, with many post-synaptic potentials fired in response to a single stimulation, consistent with a role for Tmep in restraining synaptic excitability. Neuromuscular junctions in Tmep mutants show modest structural defects and satellite boutons, which could also contribute to poor locomotor performance. Tmep is expressed in endosomes and synaptic vesicles within motor neurons, suggesting a possible role in synaptic membrane trafficking. Using RNAi knockdown, we show that Tmep is required in motor neurons for proper larval locomotion and excitability. Locomotor defects can be rescued by presynaptic knock-down of endoplasmic reticulum calcium channels or by reducing evoked release probability, suggesting that excess synaptic activity drives behavioral deficiencies. Our work establishes a critical function for the TMEM184B ortholog Tmep in the regulation of synaptic transmission and locomotor behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A DROSOPHILA CIRCUIT FOR HABITUATION OVERRIDE</a></h4>

              
                Habituated animals retain a latent capacity for robust engagement with familiar stimuli. In most instances, the ability to override habituation is best explained by postulating: (a) that habituation arises from the potentiation of inhibitory inputs onto stimulus-encoding assemblies; and (b) fast habituation override occurs through disinhibition. Previous work has shown that inhibitory plasticity contributes to specific forms of olfactory and gustatory habituation in Drosophila. Here we analyze how exposure to a novel stimulus causes override of gustatory (proboscis-extension reflex or ''PER'') habituation. While brief sucrose contact with tarsal hairs causes na[i]ve Drosophila to extend their proboscis, persistent tarsal exposure to sucrose reduces PER to subsequent sucrose stimuli. We show that in so habituated animals, either brief exposure of the proboscis to yeast or direct thermogenetic activation of sensory neurons restores the PER response to tarsal sucrose stimulation. Similar override of PER habituation can also be induced by brief thermogenetic activation of a population of TH (Tyrosine-Hydroxylase) positive neurons, a subset of which send projections to the SEZ. Significantly, sensory-neuron induced habituation override requires transmitter release from these TH-positive cells. Treatments that cause override specifically influence the habituated state, with no effect on the na[i]ve sucrose response across a range of concentrations. Taken together, these and other findings are consistent with a model in which novel taste stimuli trigger activity in dopaminergic neurons which, directly or indirectly, inhibit GABAergic cells that drive PER habituation. The implications of these findings for general mechanisms of attentional and sensory override of habituation are discussed.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">PV neurons improve cortical complex scene analysis by enhancing timing-based coding</a></h4>

              
                Cortical representations underlying a wide range of cognitive abilities, which employ both rate and spike timing-based coding, emerge from underlying cortical circuits with a tremendous diversity of cell types. However, cell-type specific contributions to cortical coding are not well-understood. Here, we investigate the role of parvalbumin (PV) neurons in cortical complex scene analysis. Many complex scenes contain sensory stimuli, e.g., natural sounds, images, odors or vibrations, which are highly dynamic in time, competing with stimuli at other locations in space. PV neurons are thought to play a fundamental role in sculpting cortical temporal dynamics; yet their specific role in encoding complex scenes via timing-based codes, and the robustness of such temporal representations to spatial competition, have not been investigated. Here, we address these questions in auditory cortex using a cocktail party-like paradigm; integrating electrophysiology, optogenetic manipulations, and a family of novel spike-distance metrics, to dissect the contributions of PV neurons towards rate and timing-based coding. We find that PV neurons improve cortical discrimination of dynamic naturalistic sounds in a cocktail party-like setting by enhancing rapid temporal modulations in rate and spike timing reproducibility. Moreover, this temporal representation is maintained in the face of competing stimuli at other spatial locations, providing a robust code for complex scene analysis. These findings provide novel insights into the specific contributions of PV neurons in cortical coding of complex scenes.

	<p>Studies on parental interaction in the context of ASD has mainly focused on mothers, even if fathers and their children seem to form close and supportive relationships that may have unique effects on child development. Given the impact of ASD symptoms on a child’s ability to interact with significant others, recent findings strengthen the importance of including caregivers during treatment to guarantee a better adaptation to the child’s impairments. Despite this, fathers are scarcely involved, and interventions seem to not be tailored to their interactive characteristics and needs. For this reason, a systematic review was conducted to investigate fathers and children with ASD behaviors during interaction. This review found 12 observational studies that identified social, cognitive, and affective interactive modalities in father–child dyads through three psychology-focused journal databases: PubMed, PsycINFO and Scopus. The significant variation in both sample size and in the measures used to assess dyadic outcomes limits the ability of this work to make robust recommendations for intervention. Despite this, the results revealed characteristic behaviors of this dyad that consequently allow specific targets to be worked on during intervention. In fact, from fathers’ individual strengths and weaknesses, it is possible to implement interventions that are complementary with maternal characteristics from the perspective of personalized and optimized treatment.</p>

	<p>Fast rhythms excess is a hallmark of Parkinson’s Disease (PD). To implement innovative, non-pharmacological, neurostimulation interventions to restore cortical-cortical interactions, we need to understand the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying these phenomena. Here, we investigated effective connectivity on source-level resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) signals in 15 PD participants and 10 healthy controls. First, we fitted multivariate auto-regressive models to the EEG source waveforms. Second, we estimated causal connections using Granger Causality, which provide information on connections’ strength and directionality. Lastly, we sought significant differences connectivity patterns between the two populations characterizing the network graph features—i.e., global efficiency and node strength. Causal brain networks in PD show overall poorer and weaker connections compared to controls quantified as a reduction of global efficiency. Motor areas appear almost isolated, with a strongly impoverished information flow particularly from parietal and occipital cortices. This striking isolation of motor areas may reflect an impaired sensory-motor integration in PD. The identification of defective nodes/edges in PD network may be a biomarker of disease and a potential target for future interventional trials.</p>

	<p>Neuropathic pain (NP) is a chronic, debilitating, and resistant form of pain. The onset rate of NP following spinal cord injuries (SCI) is high and may reduce the quality of life more than the sensorimotor loss itself. The long-term ineffectiveness of current treatments in managing symptoms and counteracting maladaptive plasticity highlights the need to find alternative therapeutic approaches. Virtual reality (VR) is possibly the best way to administer the specific illusory or reality-like experience and promote behavioral responses that may be effective in mitigating the effects of long-established NP. This approach aims to promote a more systematic adoption of VR-related techniques in pain research and management procedures, highlighting the encouraging preliminary results in SCI. We suggest that the multisensory modulation of the sense of agency and ownership by residual body signals may produce positive responses in cases of brain-body disconnection. First, we focus on the transversal role embodiment and how multisensory and environmental or artificial stimuli modulate illusory sensations of bodily presence and ownership. Then, we present a brief overview of the use of VR in healthcare and pain management. Finally, we discus research experiences which used VR in patients with SCI to treating NP, including the most recent combinations of VR with further stimulation techniques.</p>

                Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by hallmark impairments in social functioning. Nevertheless, nonsocial cognition, including hippocampus-dependent spatial reasoning and episodic memory, is also commonly impaired in ASD. ASD symptoms typically emerge between 12 and 24 months of age, a time window associated with critical developmental events in the hippocampus. Despite this temporal overlap and evidence of hippocampal structural abnormalities in ASD individuals, relatively few human studies have focused on hippocampal function in ASD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The language network supports both lexical access and sentence generation during language production</a></h4>

              
                A network of left frontal and temporal brain regions has long been implicated in language comprehension and production. However, because of relatively fewer investigations of language production, the precise role of this 'language network' in production-related cognitive processes remains debated. Across four fMRI experiments that use picture naming/description to mimic the translation of conceptual representations into words and sentences, we characterize the response of the language regions to production demands. In line with prior studies, sentence production elicited strong responses throughout the language network. Further, we report three novel results. First, we demonstrate that production-related responses in the language network are robust to output modality (speaking vs. typing). Second, the language regions respond to both lexical access and sentence-generation demands. This pattern implies strong integration between lexico-semantic and combinatorial processes, mirroring the picture that has emerged in language comprehension. Finally, some have previously hypothesized the existence of production-selective mechanisms given that syntactic encoding is a critical part of sentence production, whereas comprehension is possible even when syntactic cues are degraded or absent. Contrary to this hypothesis, we find no evidence of brain regions that selectively support sentence generation. Instead, language regions respond overall more strongly during production than during comprehension, which suggests that production incurs a greater cost for the language network. Together, these results align with the idea that language comprehension and production draw on the same knowledge representations, which are stored in the language-selective network and are used both to interpret linguistic input and generate linguistic output.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The Ventrolateral Anterior Temporal Lobe is Commonly Engaged by Both Mental State Inference and Semantic Association Tasks</a></h4>

              
                A key challenge for neurobiological models of social cognition is to elucidate whether brain regions are specialised for that domain. In recent years, discussion surrounding the role of the anterior temporal lobe (ATL) epitomises such debates; some argue it is part of a domain-specific network for social processing, while others claim it is a domain-general hub for semantic representation. In the present study, we used ATL-optimised fMRI to map the contribution of different ATL structures to a variety of paradigms frequently used to probe a crucial social ability, namely theory of mind (ToM). Using multiple tasks enables a clearer attribution of activation to ToM as opposed to idiosyncratic features of stimuli. Further, we directly explored whether these same structures are also activated by a non-social task probing semantic representations. We revealed that common to all of the tasks was activation of a key ventrolateral ATL region that is typically invisible to standard fMRI. This constitutes novel evidence in support of the view that the ventrolateral ATL contributes to social cognition via a domain-general role in the retrieval of conceptual knowledge, and against claims of a specialised social function.

                Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling in the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) gates alcohol self-administration in rodents. The major source of BDNF in the striatum is the cortex, and we recently found that BDNF-expressing neurons in the ventrolateral orbitofrontal cortex (vlOFC) extend axonal projections to the DLS. We therefore hypothesized that BDNF in the vlOFC to DLS circuit moderates alcohol intake. We show that overexpression of BDNF in the vlOFC, which activates BDNF signaling in the DLS, is sufficient to attenuate voluntary consumption and seeking of 20% alcohol in the home cage using a two-bottle choice paradigm. Overexpressing BDNF in the vlOFC had no effect on the consumption of a sweetened saccharin solution. In addition, BDNF overexpression in the neighboring motor cortex did not alter alcohol intake. Finally, pathway-specific overexpression of BDNF in DLS-projecting vlOFC neurons significantly reduced alcohol intake and preference. Overall, BDNF in the vlOFC, and specifically in a vlOFC-DLS pathway, keeps alcohol drinking in moderation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Stimulation related artifacts and a multipurpose template-based offline removal solution for a novel sensing-enabled deep brain stimulation device</a></h4>

              
                Background: The Medtronic "Percept" is the first FDA approved deep brain stimulation (DBS) device with sensing capabilities during active stimulation. Its real-world signal recording properties have yet to be fully described. Objective: This study details sources of artifact (and potential mitigations) in local field potential (LFP) signals collected by the Percept, and assesses the potential impact of artifact on the future development of adaptive DBS (aDBS) using this device. Methods: LFP signals were collected from seven subjects in both experimental and clinical settings. The presence of artifacts and their effect on the spectral content of neural signals were evaluated in both the stimulation ON and OFF states using three distinct offline artifact removal techniques. Results: Template subtraction successfully removed multiple sources of artifact, including 1) electrocardiogram (ECG), 2) non-physiologic polyphasic artifacts, and 3) ramping related artifacts seen when changing stimulation amplitudes. ECG removal from stimulation ON (at 0 mA) signals recovered the spectral shape seen when OFF stimulation (averaged difference in normalized power in theta, alpha, and beta bands [&le;] 3.5%). ECG removal using singular value decomposition was similarly successful, though required subjective researcher input. QRS interpolation produced similar recovery of beta-band signal, but resulted in residual low-frequency artifact. Conclusions: Artifacts present when stimulation is enabled notably affected the spectral properties of sensed signals using the Percept. Multiple discrete artifacts could be successfully removed offline using an automated template subtraction method. The presence of unrejected artifact likely influences online power estimates, with the potential to affect aDBS algorithm performance.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Structured random receptive fields enable informative sensory encodings</a></h4>

              
                The brain must represent the outside world in a way that enables an animal to survive and thrive. In early sensory systems, populations of neurons have a variety of receptive fields that are structured to detect features in input statistics. Alongside this structure, experimental recordings consistently show that these receptive fields also have a great deal of unexplained variability, which has often been ignored in classical models of sensory neurons. In this work, we model neuronal receptive fields as random samples from probability distributions in two sensory modalities, using data from insect mechanosensors and from neurons of mammalian primary visual cortex (V1). In particular, we build generative receptive field models where our random distributions are Gaussian processes with covariance functions that match the second-order statistics of experimental receptive data. We show theoretical results that these random feature neurons effectively perform randomized wavelet transform on the inputs in the temporal domain for mechanosensory neurons and spatial domain for V1 neurons. Such a transformation removes irrelevant components in the inputs, such as high-frequency noise, and boosts the signal. We demonstrate that these random feature neurons produce better learning from fewer training samples and with smaller networks in a variety of artificial tasks. The random feature model of receptive fields provides a unifying, mathematically tractable framework to understand sensory encodings across both spatial and temporal domains.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Learning neural decoders without labels using multiple data streams</a></h4>

              
                Recent advances in neural decoding have accelerated the development of brain-computer interfaces aimed at assisting users with everyday tasks such as speaking, walking, and manipulating objects. However, current approaches for training neural decoders commonly require large quantities of labeled data, which can be laborious or infeasible to obtain in real-world settings. One intriguing alternative uses self-supervised models that share self-generated pseudo-labels between two data streams; such models have shown exceptional performance on unlabeled audio and video data, but it remains unclear how well they extend to neural decoding. Here, we learn neural decoders without labels by leveraging multiple simultaneously recorded data streams, including neural, kinematic, and physiological signals. Specifically, we apply cross-modal, self-supervised deep clustering to decode movements from brain recordings; these decoders are compared to supervised and unimodal, self-supervised models. We find that sharing pseudo-labels between two data streams during training substantially increases decoding performance compared to unimodal, self-supervised models, with accuracies approaching those of supervised decoders trained on labeled data. Next, we develop decoders trained on three modalities that match or slightly exceed the performance of supervised models, achieving state-of-the-art neural decoding accuracy. Cross-modal decoding is a flexible, promising approach for robust, adaptive neural decoding in real-world applications without any labels.

                BACKGROUND: Habituation is defined as a progressive decline in response to repeated exposure to a familiar and predictable stimulus and is highly conserved across species. Disrupted habituation is a signature of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In rodents, habituation is observed in neural, neuroendocrine and behavioral responses to repeated exposure to the predictable and moderately intense stress or restraint. We previously demonstrated that lesions to the posterior division of the paraventricular thalamic nucleus (pPVT) impairs habituation. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms and specific neural connections among the pPVT and other brain regions that underlie habituation are unknown. METHODS: Behavioral and neuroendocrine habituation was assessed in adult male Sprague-Dawley restraints using the repeated restraint paradigm. Pan neuronal and Cre-dependent Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs) were used to chemogenetically inhibit the pPVT and the subpopulation of pPVT neurons that project to the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), respectively. Activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc) expression was knocked down in the pPVT using siRNA directed towards Arc. Golgi staining was used to assess structural plasticity of pPVT neurons. Local field potential recordings were used to assess coherent neural activity between the pPVT and mPFC. The attentional set-shifting task was used to assess mPFC-dependent behavior. RESULTS: Here, we show that Arc promotes habituation by increasing stress-induced spinogenesis in the pPVT, increasing coherent neural activity with the mPFC, and improving mPFC-mediated cognitive flexibility. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that Arc induction in the pPVT regulates habituation to repeated restraint and mPFC function.

                Working memory is the cognitive capability to maintain and process information over short periods. Recent behavioral and computational studies have shown that increased visual information of the presented stimulus material is associated with enhanced working memory performance. However, the underlying neural correlates of this association are unknown. To identify how stimuli of different visual information levels affect working memory performance, we conducted behavioral experiments and single unit recordings in the avian analog of the prefrontal cortex, the nidopallium caudolaterale (NCL). On the behavioral level, we confirmed that feature-rich complex stimuli demonstrated higher working memory performance compared to feature-poor simple stimuli. This difference was reflected by distinct neural coding patterns at the single unit level. For complex stimuli, we found a highly multiplexed neuronal code. During the sample presentation, NCL neurons initially reflected both visual and value-related features of the presented stimuli that switched to a representation of the upcoming choice during a delay period. When processing simple stimuli, NCL neurons did not multiplex and represented the upcoming choice already during stimulus presentation and throughout the delay period. It is conceivable that the maintenance of the upcoming choice in working memory was prolonged for simple stimuli due to the early choice representation. This possibly resulted in increased decay of the working memory trace ultimately leading to a decrease in performance. In conclusion, we found that increases in stimulus complexity are associated with increased neuronal multiplexing of the working memory representation. This could possibly allow for a facilitated read-out of the neural code resulting in further enhancements of working memory performance.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">An in-vivo validation of ESI methods with focal sources</a></h4>

              
                Electrical source imaging (ESI) aims at reconstructing the electrical brain activity from measurements of the electric field on the scalp. Even though the localization of single focal sources should be relatively straightforward, different methods provide diverse solutions due to the different underlying assumptions. Furthermore, their input parameter(s) further affects the solution provided by each method, making localization even more challenging. In addition, validations and comparisons are typically performed either on synthetic data or through post-operative outcomes, in both cases with considerable limitations. We use an in-vivo high-density EEG dataset recorded during intracranial single pulse electrical stimulation, in which the true sources are substantially dipolar and their locations are known. We compare ten different ESI methods under multiple choices of input parameters, to assess the accuracy of the best reconstruction, as well as the impact of the parameters on the localization performance. Best reconstructions often fall within 1 cm from the true source, with more accurate methods outperforming less accurate ones by 1 cm, on average. Expectedly, dipolar methods tend to outperform distributed methods. Sensitivity to input parameters varies widely between methods. Depth weighting played no role for three out of six methods implementing it. In terms of regularization parameters, for several distributed methods SNR=1 unexpectedly turned out to be the best choice among the tested ones. Our data show similar levels of accuracy of ESI techniques when applied to "conventional" (32 channels) and dense (64, 128, 256 channels) EEG recordings. Overall findings reinforce the importance that ESI may have in the clinical context, especially when applied to identify the surgical target in potential candidates for epilepsy surgery.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Behavioral and Neurostructural changes associated with Chronic Amygdala Hyperactivation</a></h4>

              
                Background: The amygdala (AMY) is a key brain region of the limbic system that plays a critical role in emotion processing and stress response. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies identified abnormal AMY activation in psychiatric illnesses including major depressive disorder (MDD). Stress exposure is a major precipitating factor of MDD episodes which are associated with AMY hyperactivity. Preclinical studies using of pharmacologic, opto- and chemogenetic approaches to activate AMY neurons have consistently demonstrated that acute AMY hyperactivation induces anxiety-like behaviors in mice. However, it remains unknown if chronic hyperactivation of the amygdala (cHOA) is sufficient to induce chronic stress-like deficits or is a susceptibility factor for chronic stress-induced behavioral, volumetric and synaptic deficits. Methods: Using designer receptor exclusively activated by designer drug (DREADD) approach, basolateral amygdala (BLA) neurons of Camk2a-cre mice infected with a virus driving the expression of the Gq-coupled DREADD were activated with clozapine-N-oxide (in drink water for 5 weeks). Mice were then exposed to chronic restraint stress (CRS; 1X/day for 1hr) for 2 weeks. All mice were behaviorally assessed in the Phenotyper (PT), and sucrose consumption tests (SCT) each week and in the novelty supressed feeding (NSF, once at the end of the experiment). Animals were then perfused for ex vivo-MRI and puncta density analysis. Results: We found that mice with cHOA displayed a progressive increase in baseline anxiety-like deficits in the PT test and slightly more marked deficits following CRS compared to controls, but not statistically different from animals subjected to CRS alone. Also, cHOA did not exacerbate CRS effect in the NSF. No significant cAH effect was found in the SCT before or after CRS. MRI analysis revealed no statistical charges between groups, while increased synaptic puncta density was found in cHOA mice subjected to CRS compared to cHOA or CRS alone. Conclusion: We demonstrate that cAH is sufficient to induce anxiety and may exacerbate CRS effects on anxiety and synaptic measures. Results also suggest that cHOA was not sufficient to induce depressive-like behavior and was not a vulnerability factor for stress-induced depressive-like behavior in mice. Altogether, our findings imply that a strong causal link between AMY hyperactivity and elevated anxiety, but not depressive-like behaviors and provide critical information to clinical research focused on using AMY activity level as a biomarker in stress-related illnesses.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dense cortical input to the rostromedial tegmental nucleus mediates aversive signaling</a></h4>

              
                The rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg) encodes negative reward prediction error (RPE) and plays an important role in guiding behavioral responding to aversive stimuli. While initial studies describing the RMTg revealed the presence of cortical afferents, the density and distribution of this input has not been explored in detail. In addition, the functional consequences of cortical modulation of RMTg signaling are only just beginning to be investigated. The current study anatomically and functionally characterizes cortical input to the RMTg in rats. Findings from this work reveal dense input spanning the entire medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) as well as the orbitofrontal cortex and anterior insular cortex. Afferents were most dense in the dorsomedial subregion of the PFC (dmPFC), an area which has also been implicated in both RPE signaling and aversive responding. RMTg-projecting dmPFC neurons originate in layer V and collateralize extensively throughout the brain. In-situ mRNA hybridization further revealed that neurons in this circuit are predominantly D1 receptor expressing with a high degree of D2 receptor colocalization. Optogenetic stimulation of dmPFC terminals in the RMTg drives avoidance, and cFos expression is enhanced in this neural circuit during exposure to aversive stimuli. Exposure to such aversive stimuli results in significant physiological and structural plasticity suggestive of a loss of top-down modulation of RMTg-mediated signaling. Altogether, these data reveal the presence of a prominent cortico-subcortical projection involved in adaptive behavioral responding and provide a foundation for future work aimed at exploring alterations in circuit function in diseases characterized by deficits in cognitive control over the balance between reward and aversion.

                People regularly give in to daily temptations in spite of conflict with personal goals. To test hypotheses about neuropharmacological influences on self-control, we used positron emission tomography to measure dopamine D2-like receptors (D2R) and experience sampling surveys to naturalistically track daily desires outside the laboratory in everyday life in a sample of 103 adults. Higher D2R availability in the ventral striatum was associated with increased sensitivity to personal goal conflict but not desire strength in deciding whether to attempt to resist a desire. The influence of D2Rs on sensitivity to personal goal conflict depended on whether desires were experienced in a social context. D2R availability in the midbrain (but not the ventral striatum) influenced whether desires were enacted. These findings provide unique evidence that the dopamine system influences decision making and regulatory behavior and provides new insights into how these mechanisms interact with personal goals and social contexts.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Corticothalamic Projections Gate Alpha Rhythms in the Pulvinar</a></h4>

              
                Two types of corticothalamic (CT) terminals reach the pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus, and their distribution varies according to the hierarchical level of the cortical area they originate from. While type 2 terminals are more abundant at lower hierarchical levels, terminals from higher cortical areas mostly exhibit type 1 axons. Such terminals also evoke different excitatory postsynaptic potential dynamic profiles, presenting facilitation for type 1 and depression for type 2. As the pulvinar is involved in the oscillatory regulation between intercortical areas, fundamental questions about the role of these different terminal types in the neuronal communication throughout the cortical hierarchy are yielded. Our theoretical results support that the co-action of the two types of terminals produces different oscillatory rhythms in pulvinar neurons. More precisely, terminal types 1 and 2 produce alpha-band oscillations at a specific range of connectivity weights. Such oscillatory activity is generated by an unstable transition of the balanced state network's properties that it is found between the quiescent state and the stable asynchronous spike response state. While CT projections from areas 17 and 21a are arranged in the model as the empirical proportion of terminals types 1 and 2, the actions of these two cortical connections are antagonistic. As area 17 generates low-band oscillatory activity, cortical area 21a shifts pulvinar responses to stable asynchronous spiking activity and vice-versa when area 17 produces an asynchronous state. To further investigate such oscillatory effects through corticothalamo-cortical projections, the transthalamic pathway, we created a cortical feedforward network of two cortical areas, 17 and 21a, with CT connections to a pulvinar-like network. With this model, the transthalamic pathway propagates alpha waves from the pulvinar to area 21a. This oscillatory transfer ceases when reciprocal connections from area 21a reach the pulvinar, closing the cortico-thalamic loop. Taken together, results of our model suggest that the pulvnar shows a bi-stable spiking activity, oscillatory or regular asynchronous spiking, whose responses are gated by the different activation of cortico-pulvinar projections from lower to higher-order areas such as areas 17 and 21a.

                Purpose: To introduce a Deep-Learning-Based Accelerated and Noise-Suppressed Estimation (DANSE) method for reconstructing quantitative maps of biological tissue cellular-specific, and hemodynamic-specific, from Gradient-Recalled-Echo (GRE) MRI data with multiple gradient-recalled echoes. Methods: DANSE method adapts supervised learning paradigm to train a convolutional neural network for robust estimation of and maps free from the adverse effects of macroscopic (B0) magnetic field inhomogeneities directly from the GRE magnitude images without utilizing phase images. The corresponding ground-truth maps were generated by means of a voxel-by-voxel fitting of a previously-developed biophysical quantitative GRE (qGRE) model accounting for tissue, hemodynamic and -inhomogeneities contributions to GRE signal with multiple gradient echoes using nonlinear least square (NLLS) algorithm. Results: We show that the DANSE model efficiently estimates the aforementioned brain maps and preserves all features of NLLS approach with significant improvements including noise-suppression and computation speed (from many hours to seconds). The noise-suppression feature of DANSE is especially prominent for data with SNR characteristic for typical GRE data (SNR~50), where DANSE-generated and maps had three times smaller errors than that of NLLS method. Conclusions: DANSE method enables fast reconstruction of magnetic-field-inhomogeneity-free and noise-suppressed quantitative qGRE brain maps. DANSE method does not require any information about field inhomogeneities during application. It exploits spatial patterns in the qGRE MRI data and previously-gained knowledge from the biophysical model, thus producing clean brain maps even in the environments with high noise levels. These features along with fast computational speed can lead to broad qGRE clinical and research applications.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Deficits in decision-making induced by parietal cortex inactivation are compensated at two time scales</a></h4>

              
                Perceptual decisions arise through the transformation of samples of evidence into a commitment to a proposition or plan of action. Such transformation is thought to involve cortical circuits capable of computation over time scales associated with working memory, attention, and planning. Neurons in the lateral intraparietal area (LIP) are thought to play a role in all of these functions, and much of what is known about the neurobiology of decision making has been influenced by studies of LIP and its network of cortical and subcortical connections. However a causal role of neurons in LIP remains controversial. We used pharmacological and chemogenetic methods to inactivate LIP in one hemisphere of four rhesus monkeys. Inactivation produced clear biases in decisions, but the effects dissipated despite the persistence of neural inactivation, implying compensation by other unaffected areas. Compensation occurs on a rapid times scale, within an experimental session, and more gradually, across sessions. The findings resolve disparate studies and inform interpretation of focal perturbations of brain function.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Kinase activity profiling identifies putative downstream targets of cGMP/PKG signaling in inherited retinal neurodegeneration</a></h4>

              
                Inherited retinal diseases (IRDs) are a group of neurodegenerative disorders that lead to photoreceptor cell death and eventually blindness. IRDs are characterised by a high genetic heterogeneity, making it imperative to design mutation-independent therapies. Mutations in a number of IRD disease genes have been associated with a rise of cyclic 3',5'-guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) levels in photoreceptors. Accordingly, the cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) has emerged as a new potential target for the mutation-independent treatment of IRDs. However, the substrates of PKG and the downstream degenerative pathways triggered by its activity have yet to be determined. Here, we performed kinome activity profiling of different murine organotypic retinal explant cultures (diseased rd1 and wild-type controls) using multiplex peptide microarrays to identify proteins whose phosphorylation was significantly altered by PKG activity. In addition, we tested the downstream effect of a known PKG inhibitor CN03 in these organotypic retina cultures. Among the PKG substrates were potassium channels belonging to the Kv1 family (KCNA3, KCNA6), Cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein 1 (CREB1), DNA topoisomerase 2- (TOP2A), 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase 3 (F263), and the glutamate ionotropic receptor kainate 2 (GRIK2). The retinal expression of these PKG targets was further confirmed by immunofluorescence and could be assigned to various neuronal cell types, including photoreceptors, horizontal cells, and ganglion cells. Taken together, this study confirmed the key role of PKG in photoreceptor cell death and identified new downstream targets of cGMP/PKG signalling that will improve the understanding of the degenerative mechanisms underlying IRDs.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Horizontal connectivity in V1 : Prediction of coherence in contour and motion integration</a></h4>

              
                This study demonstrates the functional importance of the Surround context relayed laterally in V1 by the horizontal connectivity, in controlling the latency and the gain of the cortical response to the feedforward visual drive. We report here four main findings : 1) a centripetal apparent motion sequence results in a shortening of the spiking latency of V1 cells, when the orientation of the local inducer and the global motion axis are both co-aligned with the RF orientation preference; 2) this contextual effects grows with visual flow speed, peaking at 150-250 degrees per second until matching the propagation speed of horizontal connectivity (0.15-0.25 mm/ms); 3) For this speed range, axial sensitivity of V1 cells is tilted by 90 degrees to become co-aligned with the orientation preference axis; 4) the modulation strength by the surround context correlates with the spatiotemporal coherence of the apparent motion flow. Our results suggest an internally-generated binding process, linking local (orientation /position) and global (motion/direction) features as early as V1. This long-range diffusion process constitutes a plausible substrate in V1 of the human psychophysical bias in speed estimate for collinear motion. Since demonstrated in the anesthetized cat, this novel form of contextual control of the cortical transfer function is a built-in property in V1, whose expression does not require behavioral attention and top-down control from higher cortical areas. We propose that horizontal connectivity participates to the propagation of an internal prediction wave, linking contour co-alignment and global axial motion at an apparent speed in the range of saccadic-like eye-movements.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Probing neuropeptide volume transmission in vivo by a novel all-optical approach</a></h4>

              
                Neuropeptides are essential signaling molecules in the nervous system involved in modulating neural circuits and behavior. Although hypothesized to signal via volume transmission through G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR), remarkably little is known about their extrasynaptic diffusion. Here, we developed an all-optical approach to probe neuropeptide volume transmission in mouse neocortex. To control neuropeptide release, we engineered photosensitive nanovesicles with somatostatin-14 (SST) that is released with near-infrared light stimulation. To detect SST, we created a new cell-based neurotransmitter fluorescent engineered reporter (CNiFER) using the SST2 GPCR. Under two-photon imaging, we determined the time to activate SST2R at defined distances as well as the maximal distance and loss rate for SST volume transmission in neocortex. Importantly, we determined that SST transmission is significantly faster in neocortex with a chemically degraded extracellular matrix, a diseased condition indicated in neuroinflammation and Parkinson's disease. These new neurotechnologies can reveal important biological signaling processes previously not possible, and provide new opportunities to investigate volume transmission in the brain.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dynamic brain activity during associative learning examined with MEG/fMRI co-processing</a></h4>

              
                Background: Due to limitations of individual neuroimaging methods we examine spatial and temporal contributions to self-generation using multimodality imaging with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) within the Bayesian framework Multiple Sparse Priors (MSP). New Method: 24 healthy participants performed an fMRI and MEG paired-associate learning task. FMRI data were processed within Group ICA fMRI Toolbox. Independent components (ICs) were temporally sorted by task time series (|r|>0.30 threshold identified task-related ICs). Task-positive (generate) ICs were retained as spatial priors for MEG analyses. MEG data were processed by averaging trials to increase the signal-to-noise ratio within subjects and with an event-related theta power approach. MEG source reconstructions were constrained within the task-positive ICs for both analytical approaches. Results: For fMRI, five networks were identified as task-related. Four ICs underlying active generation spanned bilateral parietal, orbitofrontal, medial frontal and superior temporal regions, and occipital lobe. FMRI-constrained MEG source reconstructions yielded early visual cortex activity followed by left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and orbito-frontal cortex (OFC) recruitment to coalesce in the left inferior temporal lobe. For the event-related theta approach, reconstructions showed a progression of activity from bilateral temporal areas to left OFC and middle temporal gyrus, followed by right IFG. Comparison with Existing Methods: MSP analyses informed by fMRI produced more focused regional activity than reconstructions without priors suggesting increased attention and maintenance when selecting relevant semantic information during active generation. Conclusions: Constraining MEG source reconstruction to fMRI priors during active generation implicates interconnected fronto-temporal and fronto-parietal networks across time.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Identifying microstructural changes in diffusion MRI; How to break parameter degeneracy</a></h4>

              
                Biophysical models that attempt to infer real-world quantities from data usually have many free parameters. This over-parameterisation can result in degeneracies in model inversion and render parameter estimation ill-posed. However, often, we are not interested in estimating the parameters per se, but rather in identifying changes in parameters between experimental conditions (e.g. patients vs controls). Here we present a Bayesian framework to make inference on changes in the parameters of biophysical models even when model inversion is degenerate, which we refer to as Bayesian EstimatioN of CHange (BENCH). We infer the parameter changes in two steps; First, we train models that can estimate the pattern of change in the measurements given any hypothetical change in the parameters using simulations. Next, for any pair of real data sets, we use these pre-trained models to estimate the probability that an observed difference in the data is caused by each model of change. The approach is general and particularly useful for biophysical models with parameter degeneracies. In this paper, we apply the approach in the context of microstructural modelling of diffusion MRI data, where the models are usually over-parameterised and not invertible without injecting strong assumptions. Using simulations, we show that in the context of the standard model for diffusion our approach is able to identify changes in microstructural parameters from multi-shell diffusion MRI data. We also apply our approach to a subset of subjects from the UK-Biobank Imaging to identify the dominant standard model parameter change in areas of white matter hyperintensities.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">High-fat diet feeding reduces the expression of Rab3a, Rab3gap1, and Rab3Gap2 genes that are pivotal to neuronal exocytosis.</a></h4>

              
                The Rab3A and Rab3gaps are essential to the Ca+2-dependent neuronal exocytosis in the hypothalamus. The arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARC) controls food intake and energy expenditure. We have earlier described that the high-fat diet (HFD) feeding induces an obesity phenotype with high leptin production and alteration of proteins related to endosome sorting, and ubiquitination in the ARC of mice. In this study, real-time PCR data analysis revealed that HFD feeding decreases significantly Rab3a, Rab3gap1, and Rab3gap2 transcript levels in the ARC when compared to the group receiving a control diet. The decrease of Rab3gap1/2 transcript levels in the ARC was strongly associated with an increase in plasma leptin. Altogether, our studies demonstrate that HFD feeding could be altering the general network of endosome compartmentalization in the ARC of mice, contributing to a failure in exocytosis and receptor recycling.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Whole brain mapping of glutamate in adult and old primates at 11.7T</a></h4>

              
                Glutamate is the amino acid with the highest cerebral concentration. It plays a central role in brain metabolism. It is also the principal excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain and is involved in multiple cognitive functions. Alterations of the glutamatergic system may contribute to the pathophysiology of many neurological disorders. For example, changes of glutamate availability are reported in rodents and humans during Alzheimer's and Huntington's diseases, epilepsy as well as during aging. Most studies evaluating cerebral glutamate have used invasive or spectroscopy approaches focusing on specific brain areas. Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer imaging of glutamate (gluCEST) is a recently developed imaging technique that can map glutamate distribution in the entire brain with higher sensitivity and at higher resolution than previous techniques. It thus has strong potential clinical applications to assess glutamate changes in the brain. High field is a key condition to perform gluCEST images with a meaningful signal to noise ratio. Thus, even if some studies started to evaluate gluCEST in humans, most studies focused on rodent models that can be imaged at high magnetic field. In particular, systematic characterization of gluCEST contrast distribution throughout the whole brain has never been performed in humans or non-human primates. Here, we characterized for the first time the distribution of the glutamate index in the whole brain and in large-scale networks of mouse lemur primates at 11.7 Tesla. Because of its small size, this primate can be imaged in high magnetic field systems. It is widely studied as a model of cerebral aging or Alzheimer's disease. We observed high gluCEST contrast in cerebral regions such as the nucleus accumbens, septum, basal forebrain, cortical areas 24 and 25. Age-related alterations of this biomarker were detected in the nucleus accumbens, septum, basal forebrain, globus pallidus, hypophysis, cortical areas 24, 21, 6 and in olfactory bulbs. An age-related gluCEST contrast decrease was also detected in specific neuronal networks, such as fronto-temporal and evaluative limbic networks. These results outline regional differences of gluCEST contrast and strengthen its potential to provide new biomarkers of cerebral function in primates.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Laminar microcircuitry of visual cortex producing attention-associated electric fields</a></h4>

              
                Cognitive operations are widely studied by measuring electric fields through EEG and ECoG. However, despite their widespread use, the component neural circuitry giving rise to these signals remains unknown. Specifically, the functional architecture of cortical columns which results in attention-associated electric fields has not been explored. Here we detail the laminar cortical circuitry underlying an attention-associated electric field often measured over posterior regions of the brain in humans and monkeys. First, we identified visual cortical area V4 as one plausible contributor to this attention-associated electric field through inverse modeling of cranial EEG in macaque monkeys performing a visual attention task. Next, we performed laminar neurophysiological recordings on the prelunate gyrus and identified the electric-field-producing dipoles as synaptic activity in distinct cortical layers of area V4. Specifically, activation in the extragranular layers of cortex resulted in the generation of the attention-associated dipole. Feature selectivity of a given cortical column determined the overall contribution to this electric field. Columns selective for the attended feature contributed more to the electric field than columns selective for a different feature. Lastly, the laminar profile of synaptic activity generated by V4 was sufficient to produce an attention-associated signal measurable outside of the column. These findings suggest that the top-down recipient cortical layers produce an attention-associated electric field capable of being measured extracranially and the relative contribution of each column depends upon the underlying functional architecture.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Reproductive neuronal circuitry in adaptive changes of energy balance</a></h4>

              
                The crosstalk between metabolism and reproduction is essential for species survival. When dysfunctional, this interaction may decrease reproductive efficiency, but in physiological conditions of high energy demands, e.g., pregnancy and lactation, it is highly beneficial. Females display adaptive responses that assure offspring survival and health, including increased food intake and suppression of the reproductive function. Some of these physiological responses are modulated by leptin actions in neuronal pathways that are still unclear. The hypothalamic ventral premammillary nucleus (PMv) is a key integrative node of metabolic cues and reproductive status, comprised of either leptin-depolarized or -hyperpolarized neurons. Here, we show that the subset of leptin-hyperpolarized neurons coexpresses dopamine transporter (DAT) and prolactin receptor. DAT expression is higher in prepubertal conditions, when reproductive function is suppressed. These neurons innervate AgRP presynaptic terminals and may potentiate their inhibitory actions on reproduction. We further applied a mathematical model to reconcile our new findings with the current literature and to verify if those neurons are putative components of the metabolic control of reproduction. In our model, leptin-depolarized PMv neurons project to and directly stimulate kisspeptin and gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons. Leptin-hyperpolarized PMv DAT neurons are directly stimulated by prolactin and project to inhibitory control sites. During conditions of high prolactin levels, i.e., late pregnancy and lactation, this pathway may overcome the former, facilitating AgRP actions in the suppression of the reproductive function. Our model also predicts that overstimulation of this pathway may underlie earlier puberty and reproductive deficits observed in conditions of metabolic dysfunction.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A curved manifold orients rotational dynamics in motor cortex</a></h4>

              
                Controlling arm movements requires complex, time-varying patterns of muscle activity. Accordingly, the responses of neurons in motor cortex are complex, time-varying, and heterogeneous during reaching. When examined at the population level, patterns of neural activity evolve over time according to dynamical rules. During reaching, these rules have been argued to be "rotational" or variants thereof, containing coordinated oscillations in the spike rates of individual neurons. While these models capture key aspects of the neural responses, they fail to capture others -- accounting for only 20-50% of the neural response variance. Here, we consider a broader class of dynamical models. We find that motor cortex dynamics take an unexpected form: there were 3-4 rotations at fixed frequencies in M1 and PMd explaining more than 90% of neural responses, but these rotations occurred in different portions of state space when movements differ. These rotations appear to reflect a curved manifold of fixed points in state space, around which dynamics are locally rotational. These fixed-frequency rotations obeyed a simple relationship with movement: the orientation of rotations in motor cortex activity were related almost linearly to the movement the animal made, allowing linear decoding of reach kinematic time-courses on single trials. This model constitutes a fundamentally novel way to consider pattern generation: like placing a record player in a large bowl, the frequency of activity is fixed, but the location of motor cortex activity on a curved manifold sets the orientation of locally-rotational dynamics. This system simplifies motor control, helps reconcile conflicting frameworks for interpreting motor cortex, and enables greatly improved neural decoding.

                Understanding the neuronal basis of epileptiform activity is a major challenge in neurology. Interictal epileptiform discharges are associated with fast ripples (FRs, >200 Hz) in the local field potential (LFP) and are a promising marker of the epileptogenic zone. Here, by using a novel hybrid macro-micro depth electrode, combining classic depth recording of LFP and two or three tetrodes enabling up to 15 neurons in local circuits to be recorded simultaneously, we have characterized neuronal responses to FRs on the same hybrid and other electrodes targeting other brain regions. While FRs were associated with increased neuronal activity in local circuits only, they were followed by inhibition in large-scale networks. Neuronal responses to FRs were homogeneous in local networks but differed across brain areas. Similarly, post-FR inhibition varied across recording locations and subjects and was shorter than typical inter-FR intervals, suggesting that this inhibition is a fundamental refractory process for the networks. These findings demonstrate that FRs engage local and global networks and point to network features that pave the way for new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A linear neural circuit for light avoidance in Drosophila larvae</a></h4>

              
                Understanding how neural circuits underlie behaviour is challenging even in the era of the connectome because it requires a combined approach encompassing anatomical and functional analyses. This is exemplified in studying the circuit underlying the light-avoidance behaviour displayed by the larvae of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. While this behaviour is robust and the nervous system relatively simple, only bits and pieces of the circuit have been delineated. Indeed, some studies resulted in contradicting conclusions regarding the contributions of various neuronal types to this behaviour. Here we devise trans-Tango MkII, a new version of the transsynaptic circuit tracing and manipulation tool trans-Tango. We implement trans-Tango MkII in anatomical tracing and combine it with circuit epistasis analysis. We use neuronal inhibition to test necessity of particular neuronal types for light-avoidance. We complement these experiments by selective neuronal activation to examine sufficiency in rescuing light-avoidance deficiencies exhibited by photoreceptor mutants. Together, our studies reveal a four-order, linear circuit for light avoidance behaviour connecting the light-detecting photoreceptors with a pair of neuroendocrine cells via two types of clock neurons. Our combined approach could be readily expanded to other larval circuits. Further, this strategy provides the framework for studying more complex nervous systems and behaviours.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Lateralized phenotypic differences in females in the intrahippocampal kainic acid mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                Clinical evidence indicates that patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) often show differential outcomes of comorbid conditions dependent on the lateralization of the seizure focus. However, whether a left or right seizure focus produces differential effects on comorbid outcomes has not been investigated in a rodent model of chronic recurrent seizures. Here, we used the intrahippocampal kainic acid (IHKA) mouse model of TLE to determine whether targeting of left or right dorsal hippocampus for injection produces different outcomes in hippocampal sclerosis, body weight gain, and multiple measures of reproductive endocrine dysfunction in female mice. At one, two, and four months after injection, in vivo measurements of estrous cycles and weight were followed by ex vivo examination of hippocampal sclerosis, circulating ovarian hormone and corticosterone levels, ovarian morphology, and pituitary gene expression. IHKA mice with right-targeted injection (IHKA-R) showed greater granule cell dispersion and pituitary Fshb expression compared to mice with left-targeted injection (IHKA-L). By contrast, pituitary expression of Lhb and Gnrhr were higher in IHKA-L mice compared to IHKA-R, but these values were not different from respective saline-injected controls. IHKA-L mice also showed an increased rate of weight gain compared to IHKA-R mice. Disruptions to estrous cyclicity, however, were similar in both IHKA-L and IHKA-R mice. These findings indicate that although major reproductive endocrine dysfunction phenotypes present similarly after targeting left or right dorsal hippocampus in the IHKA model of TLE, distinct latent mechanisms based on lateralization of seizure focus may contribute to produce similar emergent reproductive endocrine outcomes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">ON/OFF domains shape receptive fields in mouse visual cortex</a></h4>

              
                In higher mammals, thalamic afferents to primary visual cortex (area V1) segregate according to their responses to increases (ON) or decreases (OFF) in luminance. This organization induces columnar, ON/OFF domains postulated to provide a scaffold for the emergence of orientation tuning. To further test this idea, we asked whether ON/OFF domains exist in mouse V1 -- a species containing orientation tuned, simple cells, like those found in other mammals. Here we show that mouse V1 is indeed parceled into ON/OFF domains. Revealingly, fluctuations in the relative density ON/OFF neurons on the cortical surface mirror fluctuations in the relative density of ON/OFF receptive field centers on the visual field. In each cortical volume examined, the average of simple-cell receptive fields correlates with the difference between the average of ON and OFF receptive fields. Moreover, the local diversity of simple-cell receptive fields is explained by a model in which neurons linearly combine a small number of ON and OFF signals available in their cortical neighborhoods. Altogether, these findings indicate that ON/OFF domains originate in fluctuations of the spatial density of ON/OFF inputs on the visual field which, in turn, shapes the structure of receptive fields.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Effects of vestibular stimulation on gait stability and variability</a></h4>

              
                Vestibular information modulates muscle activity during gait, presumably to contribute stability, because noisy electrical vestibular stimulation perturbs gait stability. An important mechanism to stabilize gait in the mediolateral direction is to coordinate foot placement based on a sensory estimate of the trunk center of mass state, to which vestibular information appears to contribute. We, therefore expected that noisy vestibular stimulation would decrease the correlation between foot placement and trunk center of mass state. Moreover, as vestibular modulation of muscle activity during gait depends on step width, we expected stronger effects for narrow-base than normal walking, and smaller effects for wide-base walking. In eleven healthy subjects we measured the kinematics of the trunk (as a proxy of the center of mass), and feet, while they walked on a treadmill in six conditions, including three different step widths: control (preferred step width), narrow-base (steps smaller than hip width), and wide-base (with steps greater than hip width). The three conditions were conducted with and without a bipolar electrical stimulus, applied behind the ears (5 mA). Walking with EVS reduced gait stability but increased the foot placement to center of mass correlation in different step width conditions. The narrow-base walking was the most stable condition and showed a stronger correlation between foot placement and center of mass state. We argue that EVS destabilized gait, but that this was partially compensated for by tightened control over foot placement, which would require successful use of other than vestibular sensory inputs, to estimate center of mass movement.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Kif11 overexpression rescues cognition, long-term potentiation, and spine defects in mouse and cell models of Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                Competitive inhibition of kinesin motor proteins by amyloid-beta (A{beta}) may contribute to alterations in the neuronal microtubule cytoskeleton that can disrupt plasticity mechanisms required for learning and memory, such as long-term potentiation (LTP), thus contributing to synaptic dysfunction and cognitive impairments associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we tested the hypothesis that overexpression of the microtubule motor protein KIF11 (Kinesin-5/Eg5) will rescue A{beta}-mediated synaptic dysfunction and cognitive impairments. We found that overexpression of Kif11 prevented spatial learning and LTP deficits in the 5xFAD mouse model of AD and rescued A{beta}-mediated decreases in postsynaptic dendritic spine density in neuronal cultures. Together, these data suggest that KIF11 function is important for preserving synaptic structures and functions that are critical for learning and memory and for protection against A{beta}-mediated loss of cognition in AD.

                The expansion of the cerebral cortex is one of the most distinctive changes in the evolution of the human brain. Cortical expansion and related increases in cortical folding may have contributed to emergence of our capacities for high-order cognitive abilities. Molecular analysis of humans, archaic hominins, and non-human primates has allowed identification of chromosomal regions showing evolutionary changes at different points of our phylogenetic history. In this study, we assessed the contributions of genomic annotations spanning 30 million years to human sulcal morphology measured via MRI in more than 18,000 participants from the UK Biobank. We found that variation within brain-expressed human gained enhancers, regulatory genetic elements that emerged since our last common ancestor with Old World monkeys, explained more trait heritability than expected for the left and right calloso-marginal posterior fissures and the right central sulcus. Intriguingly, these are sulci that have been previously linked to the evolution of locomotion in primates and later on bipedalism in our hominin ancestors.

	<p>Dopamine is an important neurotransmitter that plays a key role in neuropsychiatric illness. Sex differences in dopaminergic signaling have been acknowledged for decades and have been linked to sex-specific heterogeneity in both dopamine-related behaviours as well as in various neuropsychiatric disorders. However, the overall number of studies that have evaluated sex differences in dopamine signaling, both in health and in these disorders, is low. This review will bring together what is known regarding sex differences in innate dopamine receptor expression and function, as well as highlight the known sex-specific roles of dopamine in addiction, depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Due to differences in prognosis, diagnosis, and symptomatology between male and female subjects in disorders that involve dopamine signaling, or in responses that utilize pharmacological interventions that target dopamine receptors, understanding the fundamental sex differences in dopamine receptors is of vital importance for the personalization of therapeutic treatment strategies.</p>

	<p>Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) brings together neurodegenerative pathologies whose main characteristic is to start with a progressive language disorder. PPA diagnosis is often delayed in non-specialised clinical settings. With the technologies’ development, new writing parameters can be extracted, such as the writing pressure on a touch pad. Despite some studies having highlighted differences between patients with typical Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and healthy controls, writing parameters in PPAs are understudied. The objective was to verify if the writing pressure in different linguistic and non-linguistic tasks can differentiate patients with PPA from patients with AD and healthy subjects. Patients with PPA (n = 32), patients with AD (n = 22) and healthy controls (n = 26) were included in this study. They performed a set of handwriting tasks on an iPad® digital tablet, including linguistic, cognitive non-linguistic, and non-cognitive non-linguistic tasks. Average and maximum writing pressures were extracted for each task. We found significant differences in writing pressure, between healthy controls and patients with PPA, and between patients with PPA and AD. However, the classification of performances was dependent on the nature of the tasks. These results suggest that measuring writing pressure in graphical tasks may improve the early diagnosis of PPA, and the differential diagnosis between PPA and AD.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>When discussing procedural learning, it is now routine to consider both online and offline influences for skill acquisition. This is because it is commonly assumed that the evolution of a novel skill memory continues well after practice is over. Indeed, factors impacting offline contributions to skill memory development such as sleep and exercise have garnered considerable research interest in recent years. This is partly because of their capacity to foster postpractice consolidation, a process that has been identified as critical to moving a skill memory from a labile to more stable or elaborate form. While uncovering the potency of non-practice factors to facilitate consolidation is undoubtedly important, the present opinion is designed to remind the reader that a practice schedule, organized to challenge the learner, can, in and of itself, be effective in supporting consolidation resulting in significant gains in long-term skill retention.</p>

                Primary hyperoxaluria (PH) type 1 is a rare hereditary metabolic disorder resulting in accumulation of calcium oxalate in several organs, including the heart. Cardiac oxalosis in PH is poorly described in the medical literature. We report the case of a 42-year-old woman diagnosed with primary hyperoxaluria type 1 and end-stage renal failure who presented with syncope related to a paroxysmal third-degree atrioventricular block. The patient benefited from the implantation of a dual chamber pacemaker with a good outcome. Conduction blocks in case of primary hyperoxaluria type 1 are exceptional; in fact, less than five reports have previously been published in the medical literature. With this case, we would like to highlight the need for regular and careful monitoring of cardiac status in patients treated for primary oxalosis, especially when renal function is impaired.

                Background: In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic led to an unprecedented volume of almost 3,000 clinical trials registered worldwide. We aimed to describe the COVID-19 clinical trial research agenda in Germany during the first year of the pandemic. Methods: We identified randomized clinical trials assessing interventions to treat or prevent COVID-19 that were registered in 2020 and recruited or planned to recruit participants in Germany. We requested recruitment information from trial investigators as of April 2021. Results: In 2020, 65 trials were completely (n=27) or partially (n=38) conducted in Germany. Most trials investigated interventions to treat COVID-19 (86.2%; 56/65), in hospitalized patients (67.7%; 44/65), with industry funding (53.8%; 35/65). Few trials were completed (21.5%; 14/65). Overall, 187,179 participants were planned to be recruited (20,696 in Germany), with a median number of 106 German participants per trial (IQR 40 to 345).  From the planned German participants, 13.4%  were recruited (median 15 per trial (IQR 0 to 44). Conclusions: The overall German contribution to the worldwide COVID-19 clinical trial research agenda was modest. Few trials delivered urgently needed evidence. Most trials did not meet recruitment goals. Evaluation and international comparison of the challenges for conducting clinical trials in Germany is needed.

                Background: Knowledge about the origin of SARS-CoV-2 is necessary for both a biological and epidemiological understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic. Evidence suggests that a proximal evolutionary ancestor of SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the bat coronavirus family. However, as further evidence for a direct zoonosis remains limited, alternative modes of SARS-CoV-2 biogenesis should be also considered.    Results: Here we show that genomes from SARS-CoV-2 and from closely related coronaviruses are differentially enriched with short chromosomal sequences from the yeast S. cerevisiae at focal positions that are known to be critical for virus replication, host cell invasion, and host immune response. Specifically, for SARS-CoV-2, we identify two sites: one at the start of the viral replicase domain, and the other at the end of the spike gene past its critical domain junction; for SARS-CoV-1, one at the start of the RNA dependent RNA polymerase gene, and the other at the start of the spike protein’s receptor binding domain. As yeast is not a natural host for this virus family, we propose a directed passage model for viral constructs, including virus replicase, in yeast cells based on co-transformation of virus DNA plasmids carrying yeast selectable genetic markers followed by intra-chromosomal homologous recombination through gene conversion. Highly differential sequence homology data across yeast chromosomes congruent with chromosomes harboring specific auxotrophic markers further support this passage model. Model and data together allow us to infer a hypothetical tripartite genome assembly scheme for the synthetic biogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1.   Conclusions: These results provide evidence that the genome sequences of SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, but not that of RaTG13 and all other closest SARS coronavirus family members identified, are carriers of distinct homology signals that might point to large-scale genomic editing during a passage of directed replication and chromosomal integration inside genetically modified yeast cells.

                Background – Recently, there have been attempts to develop mHealth applications for asthma self-management. However, there is a lack of applications that can offer accurate predictions of asthma exacerbation using the weather triggers and demographic characteristics to give tailored response to users. This paper proposes an optimised Deep Neural Network Regression (DNNR) model to predict asthma exacerbation based on personalised weather triggers. Methods – With the aim of integrating weather, demography, and asthma tracking, an mHealth application was developed where users conduct the Asthma Control Test (ACT) to identify the chances of their asthma exacerbation. The asthma dataset consists of panel data from 10 users that includes 1010 ACT scores as the target output. Moreover, the dataset contains 10 input features which include five weather features (temperature, humidity, air-pressure, UV-index, wind-speed) and five demography features (age, gender, outdoor-job, outdoor-activities, location). Results – Using the DNNR model on the asthma dataset, a score of 0.83 was achieved with Mean Absolute Error (MAE)=1.44 and Mean Squared Error (MSE)=3.62. It was recognised that, for effective asthma self-management, the prediction errors must be in the acceptable loss range (error<0.5). Therefore, an optimisation process was proposed to reduce the error rates and increase the accuracy by applying standardisation and fragmented-grid-search. Consequently, the optimised-DNNR model (with 2 hidden-layers and 50 hidden-nodes) using the Adam optimiser achieved a 94% accuracy with MAE=0.20 and MSE=0.09. Conclusions – This study is the first of its kind that recognises the potentials of DNNR to identify the correlation patterns among asthma, weather, and demographic variables. The optimised-DNNR model provides predictions with a significantly higher accuracy rate than the existing predictive models and using less computing time. Thus, the optimisation process is useful to build an enhanced model that can be integrated into the asthma self-management for mHealth application.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Characterizing the Genetic Architecture of Parkinson's Disease in Latinos</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This work was undertaken in order to identify Parkinson's disease (PD) risk variants in a Latino cohort, to describe the overlap in the genetic architecture of PD in Latinos compared to European-ancestry subjects, and to increase the diversity in PD genome-wide association (GWAS) data.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We genotyped and imputed 1,497 PD cases and controls recruited from nine clinical sites across South America. We performed a GWAS using logistic mixed models; variants with a <i>p</i>-value &lt;1 × 10<sup>−5</sup> were tested in a replication cohort of 1,234 self-reported Latino PD cases and 439,522 Latino controls from 23andMe, Inc. We also performed an admixture mapping analysis where local ancestry blocks were tested for association with PD status.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>One locus, <i>SNCA</i>, achieved genome-wide significance (<i>p</i>-value &lt;5 × 10<sup>−8</sup>); rs356182 achieved genome-wide significance in both the discovery and the replication cohorts (discovery, G allele: 1.58 OR, 95% CI 1.35–1.86, <i>p</i>-value 2.48 × 10<sup>−8</sup>; 23andMe, G allele: 1.26 OR, 95% CI 1.16–1.37, <i>p</i>-value 4.55 × 10<sup>−8</sup>). In our admixture mapping analysis, a locus on chromosome 14, containing the gene <i>STXBP6</i>, achieved significance in a joint test of ancestries and in the Native American single-ancestry test (<i>p</i>-value &lt;5 × 10<sup>−5</sup>). A second locus on chromosome 6, containing the gene <i>RPS6KA2</i>, achieved significance in the African single-ancestry test (<i>p</i>-value &lt;5 × 10<sup>−5</sup>).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This study demonstrated the importance of the <i>SNCA</i> locus for the etiology of PD in Latinos. By leveraging the demographic history of our cohort via admixture mapping, we identified two potential PD risk loci that merit further study. ANN NEUROL 2021;90:353–365</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Subicular Caspase‐1 Contributes to Pharmacoresistance in Temporal Lobe Epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Unidentified mechanisms largely restrict the viability of effective therapies in pharmacoresistant epilepsy. Our previous study revealed that hyperactivity of the subiculum is crucial for the genesis of pharmacoresistance in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), but the underlying molecular mechanism is not clear.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Here, we examined the role of subicular caspase-1, a key neural pro-inflammatory enzyme, in pharmacoresistant TLE.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We found that the expression of activated caspase-1 in the subiculum, but not the CA1, was upregulated in pharmacoresistant amygdaloid-kindled rats. Early overexpression of caspase-1 in the subiculum was sufficient to induce pharmacoresistant TLE in rats, whereas genetic ablation of caspase-1 interfered with the genesis of pharmacoresistant TLE in both kindled rats and kainic acid-treated mice. The pro-pharmacoresistance effect of subicular caspase-1 was mediated by its downstream inflammasome-dependent interleukin-1β. Further electrophysiological results showed that inhibiting caspase-1 decreased the excitability of subicular pyramidal neurons through influencing the excitation/inhibition balance of presynaptic input. Importantly, a small molecular caspase-1 inhibitor CZL80 attenuated seizures in pharmacoresistant TLE models, and decreased the neuronal excitability in the brain slices obtained from patients with pharmacoresistant TLE.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These results support the subicular caspase-1-interleukin-1β inflammatory pathway as a novel alternative mechanism hypothesis for pharmacoresistant TLE, and present caspase-1 as a potential target. ANN NEUROL 2021;90:377–390</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Lewy Body–like Inclusions in Human Midbrain Organoids Carrying Glucocerebrosidase and α‐Synuclein Mutations</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We utilized human midbrain-like organoids (hMLOs) generated from human pluripotent stem cells carrying glucocerebrosidase gene (<i>GBA1)</i> and α-synuclein (α-syn; <i>SNCA)</i> perturbations to investigate genotype-to-phenotype relationships in Parkinson disease, with the particular aim of recapitulating α-syn– and Lewy body–related pathologies and the process of neurodegeneration in the hMLO model.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We generated and characterized hMLOs from <i>GBA1</i>
<sup>−/−</sup> and <i>SNCA</i> overexpressing isogenic embryonic stem cells and also generated Lewy body–like inclusions in <i>GBA1/SNCA</i> dual perturbation hMLOs and conduritol-b-epoxide–treated <i>SNCA</i> triplication hMLOs.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified for the first time that the loss of glucocerebrosidase, coupled with wild-type α-syn overexpression, results in a substantial accumulation of detergent-resistant, β-sheet–rich α-syn aggregates and Lewy body–like inclusions in hMLOs. These Lewy body–like inclusions exhibit a spherically symmetric morphology with an eosinophilic core, containing α-syn with ubiquitin, and can also be formed in Parkinson disease patient–derived hMLOs. We also demonstrate that impaired glucocerebrosidase function promotes the formation of Lewy body–like inclusions in hMLOs derived from patients carrying the <i>SNCA</i> triplication.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Taken together, the data indicate that our hMLOs harboring 2 major risk factors (glucocerebrosidase deficiency and wild-type α-syn overproduction) of Parkinson disease provide a tractable model to further elucidate the underlying mechanisms for progressive Lewy body formation.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Psychoses affecting people with epilepsy increase disease burden and diminish quality of life. We characterized postictal psychosis, which comprises about one quarter of epilepsy-related psychoses, and has unknown causation.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We conducted a case–control cohort study including patients diagnosed with postictal psychosis, confirmed by psychiatric assessment, with available data regarding epilepsy, treatment, psychiatric history, psychosis profile, and outcomes. After screening 3,288 epilepsy patients, we identified 83 with psychosis; 49 had postictal psychosis. Controls were 98 adults, matched by age and epilepsy type, with no history of psychosis. Logistic regression was used to investigate clinical factors associated with postictal psychosis; univariate associations with a <i>p</i> value &lt; 0.20 were used to build a multivariate model. Polygenic risk scores for schizophrenia were calculated.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Cases were more likely to have seizure clustering (odds ratio [OR] = 7.59, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), seizures with a recollected aura (OR = 2.49, <i>p =</i> 0.013), and a family history of psychiatric disease (OR = 5.17, <i>p</i> = 0.022). Cases showed predominance of right temporal epileptiform discharges (OR = 4.87, <i>p</i> = 0.007). There was no difference in epilepsy duration, neuroimaging findings, or antiseizure treatment between cases and controls. Polygenic risk scores for schizophrenia in an extended cohort of postictal psychosis cases (n = 58) were significantly higher than in 1,366 epilepsy controls (<i>R</i>
<sup>2</sup> = 3%, <i>p</i> = 6 × 10<sup>−3</sup>), but not significantly different from 945 independent patients with schizophrenia (<i>R</i>
<sup>2</sup> = 0.1%<i>, p</i> = 0.775).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Postictal psychosis occurs under particular circumstances in people with epilepsy with a heightened genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, illustrating how disease biology (seizures) and trait susceptibility (schizophrenia) may interact to produce particular outcomes (postictal psychosis) in a common disease.

                <p>At present, resilience refers to a highly heterogeneous concept with ill-defined determinants, mechanisms, and outcomes. This call for action argues for the need to define resilience as a person-centered multidimensional metric, informed by a dynamic lifespan perspective and combining observational and interventional experimental studies to identify specific neural markers and correlated behavioral measures. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic highlights the urgent need of such an effort with the ultimate goal of defining a new vital sign, an individual index of resilience, as a life-long metric with the capacity to predict an individual's risk for disability in the face of a stressor, insult, injury, or disease.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Histology reveals that early active multiple sclerosis lesions can be classified into 3 main interindividually heterogeneous but intraindividually stable immunopathological patterns of active demyelination (patterns I–III). In patterns I and II, a T-cell- and macrophage-associated demyelination is suggested, with pattern II only showing signs of a humoral immune response. Pattern III is characterized by inflammatory lesions with an oligodendrocyte degeneration. Patterns suggest pathogenic heterogeneity, and we postulated that they have distinct magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) correlates that may serve as biomarkers.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We evaluated in an international collaborative retrospective cohort study the MRI lesion characteristics of 789 conventional prebiopsy and follow-up MRIs in relation to their histopathologically classified immunopathological patterns (n = 161 subjects) and lesion edge features (n = 112).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A strong association of a ringlike enhancement and a hypointense T2-weighted (T2w) rim with patterns I and II, but not pattern III, was observed. Only a fraction of pattern III patients showed a ringlike enhancement, and this was always atypical. Ringlike enhancement and T2w rims colocalized, and ringlike enhancement showed a strong association with macrophage rims as shown by histology. A strong concordance of MRI lesion characteristics, meaning that different lesions showed the same features, was found when comparing biopsied and nonbiopsied lesions at a given time point, indicating lesion homogeneity within individual patients.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We provide robust evidence that MRI characteristics reflect specific morphological features of multiple sclerosis immunopatterns and that ringlike enhancement and T2w hypointense rims might serve as a valuable noninvasive biomarker to differentiate pathological patterns of demyelination.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Longitudinal Changes in Hippocampal Network Connectivity in Alzheimer's Disease</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The hippocampus is connected to 2 distinct cortical brain networks, the posterior–medial and the anterior–temporal networks, involving different medial temporal lobe (MTL) subregions. The aim of this study was to assess the functional alterations of these 2 networks, their changes over time, and links to cognition in Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We assessed MTL connectivity in 53 amyloid-β–positive patients with mild cognitive impairment and AD dementia and 68 healthy elderly controls, using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, cross-sectionally and longitudinally. First, we compared the functional connectivity of the posterior–medial and anterior–temporal networks within the control group to highlight their specificities. Second, we compared the connectivity of these networks between groups, and between baseline and 18-month follow-up in patients. Third, we assessed the association in the connectivity changes between the 2 networks, and with cognitive performance.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We found decreased connectivity in patients specifically between the hippocampus and the posterior–medial network, together with increased connectivity between several MTL subregions and the anterior–temporal network. Moreover, changes in the posterior–medial and anterior–temporal networks were interrelated such that decreased MTL–posterior–medial connectivity was associated with increased MTL–anterior–temporal connectivity. Finally, both MTL–posterior–medial decrease and MTL–anterior–temporal increase predicted cognitive decline.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings demonstrate that longitudinal connectivity changes in the posterior–medial and anterior–temporal hippocampal networks are linked together and that they both contribute to cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease. These results shed light on the critical role of the posterior–medial and anterior–temporal networks in Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology and clinical symptoms.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Genomic Insights into Myasthenia Gravis Identify Distinct Immunological Mechanisms in Early and Late Onset Disease</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The purpose of this study was to identify disease relevant genes and explore underlying immunological mechanisms that contribute to early and late onset forms of myasthenia gravis.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used a novel genomic methodology to integrate genomewide association study (GWAS) findings in myasthenia gravis with cell-type specific information, such as gene expression patterns and promotor-enhancer interactions, in order to identify disease-relevant genes. Subsequently, we conducted additional genomic investigations, including an expression quantitative analysis of 313 healthy people to provide mechanistic insights.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified several genes that were specifically linked to early onset myasthenia gravis including <i>TNIP1</i>, <i>ORMDL3</i>, <i>GSDMB</i>, and <i>TRAF3</i>. We showed that regulators of toll-like receptor 4 signaling were enriched among these early onset disease genes (fold enrichment = 3.85, <i>p</i> = 6.4 × 10<sup>−3</sup>). In contrast, T-cell regulators <i>CD28</i> and <i>CTLA4</i> were exclusively linked to late onset disease. We identified 2 causal genetic variants (rs231770 and rs231735; posterior probability = 0.98 and 0.91) near the <i>CTLA4</i> gene. Subsequently, we demonstrated that these causal variants result in low expression of <i>CTLA4</i> (rho = −0.66, <i>p</i> = 1.28 × 10<sup>−38</sup> and rho = −0.52, <i>p</i> = 7.01 × 10<sup>−22</sup>, for rs231735 and rs231770, respectively).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The disease-relevant genes identified in this study are a unique resource for many disciplines, including clinicians, scientists, and the pharmaceutical industry. The distinct immunological pathways linked to early and late onset myasthenia gravis carry important implications for drug repurposing opportunities and for future studies of drug development.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Targeted tDCS Mitigates Dual‐Task Costs to Gait and Balance in Older Adults</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Among older adults, the ability to stand or walk while performing cognitive tasks (ie, dual-tasking) requires coordinated activation of several brain networks. In this multicenter, double-blinded, randomized, and sham-controlled study, we examined the effects of modulating the excitability of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L-DLPFC) and the primary sensorimotor cortex (SM1) on dual-task performance “costs” to standing and walking.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Fifty-seven older adults without overt illness or disease completed 4 separate study visits during which they received 20 minutes of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) optimized to facilitate the excitability of the L-DLPFC and SM1 simultaneously, or each region separately, or neither region (sham). Before and immediately after stimulation, participants completed a dual-task paradigm in which they were asked to stand and walk with and without concurrent performance of a serial-subtraction task.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>tDCS simultaneously targeting the L-DLPFC and SM1, as well as tDCS targeting the L-DLPFC alone, mitigated dual-task costs to standing and walking to a greater extent than tDCS targeting SM1 alone or sham (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.02). Blinding efficacy was excellent and participant subjective belief in the type of stimulation received (real or sham) did not contribute to the observed functional benefits of tDCS.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These results demonstrate that in older adults, dual-task decrements may be amenable to change and implicate L-DPFC excitability as a modifiable component of the control system that enables dual-task standing and walking. tDCS may be used to improve resilience and the ability of older results to walk and stand under challenging conditions, potentially enhancing everyday functioning and reducing fall risks.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Gut Microbiome Signatures of Risk and Prodromal Markers of Parkinson Disease</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Alterations of the gut microbiome in Parkinson disease (PD) have been repeatedly demonstrated. However, little is known about whether such alterations precede disease onset and how they relate to risk and prodromal markers of PD. We investigated associations of these features with gut microbiome composition.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Established risk and prodromal markers of PD as well as factors related to diet/lifestyle, bowel function, and medication were studied in relation to bacterial α-/β-diversity, enterotypes, and differential abundance in stool samples of 666 elderly TREND (Tübingen Evaluation of Risk Factors for Early Detection of Neurodegeneration) study participants.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Among risk and prodromal markers, physical inactivity, occupational solvent exposure, and constipation showed associations with α-diversity. Physical inactivity, sex, constipation, possible rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD), and smoking were associated with β-diversity. Subthreshold parkinsonism and physical inactivity showed an interaction effect. Among other factors, age and urate-lowering medication were associated with α- and β-diversity. Constipation was highest in individuals with the Firmicutes-enriched enterotype, and physical inactivity was most frequent in the <i>Bacteroides</i>-enriched enterotype. Constipation was lowest and subthreshold parkinsonism least frequent in individuals with the <i>Prevotella</i>-enriched enterotype. Differentially abundant taxa were linked to constipation, physical inactivity, possible RBD, smoking, and subthreshold parkinsonism. Substantia nigra hyperechogenicity, olfactory loss, depression, orthostatic hypotension, urinary/erectile dysfunction, PD family history, and the prodromal PD probability showed no significant microbiome associations.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Several risk and prodromal markers of PD are associated with gut microbiome composition. However, the impact of the gut microbiome on PD risk and potential microbiome-dependent subtypes in the prodrome of PD need further investigation based on prospective clinical and (multi)omics data in incident PD cases.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Mechanical thrombectomy (MT) is not recommended for acute stroke with large vessel occlusion (LVO) and a large volume of irreversibly injured tissue (“core”). Perfusion imaging may identify a subset of patients with large core who benefit from MT.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We compared two cohorts of LVO-related patients with large core (&gt;50 ml on diffusion-weighted-imaging or CT-perfusion using RAPID), available perfusion imaging, and treated within 6 hours from onset by either MT + Best Medical Management (BMM) in one prospective study, or BMM alone in the pre-MT era from a prospective registry. Primary outcome was 90-day modified Rankin Scale ≤2. We searched for an interaction between treatment group and amount of penumbra as estimated by the mismatch ratio (MMRatio = critical hypoperfusion/core volume).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Overall, 107 patients were included (56 MT + BMM and 51 BMM): Mean age was 68 ± 15 years, median core volume 99 ml (IQR: 72–131) and MMRatio 1.4 (IQR: 1.0–1.9). Baseline clinical and radiological variables were similar between the two groups, except for a higher intravenous thrombolysis rate in the BMM group. The MMRatio strongly modified the clinical outcome following MT (<i>p</i>
<sub>interaction</sub> &lt; 0.001 for continuous MMRatio); MT was associated with a higher rate of good outcome in patients with, but not in those without, MMRatio&gt;1.2 (adjusted OR [95% CI] = 6.8 [1.7–27.0] vs 0.7 [0.1–6.2], respectively). Similar findings were present for MMRatio ≥1.8 in the subgroup with core ≥70 ml. Parenchymal hemorrhage on follow-up imaging was more frequent in the MT + BMM group regardless of the MMRatio.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Perfusion imaging may help select which patients with large core should be considered for MT. Randomized studies are warranted. ANN NEUROL 2021;90:417–427</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>We aimed to determine in relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS) whether intrathecal synthesis of immunoglobulin (Ig) M and IgG is associated with outcomes reflecting inflammatory activity and chronic worsening.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We compared cerebrospinal fluid analysis, clinical and magnetic resonance imaging data, and serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL) levels at baseline and follow-up in 530 patients with relapsing MS. Patients were categorized by the presence of oligoclonal IgG bands (OCGB) and intrathecal synthesis of IgG and IgM (intrathecal fraction [IF]: IgG<sub>IF</sub> and IgM<sub>IF</sub>). Relationships with the time to first relapse, sNfL concentrations, T2-weighted (T2w) lesions, MS Severity Score (MSSS), and time to initiation of high-efficacy therapy were analyzed in covariate-adjusted statistical models.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>By categorical analysis, in patients with IgM<sub>IF</sub> the median time to first relapse was 28 months shorter and MSSS on average higher by 1.11 steps compared with patients without intrathecal immunoglobulin synthesis. Moreover, patients with IgM<sub>IF</sub> had higher sNfL concentrations, more new/enlarging T2w lesions, and higher total T2w lesion counts (all <i>p</i> ≤ 0.01). These associations were absent or equally smaller in patients who were positive for only OCGB or OCGB/IgG<sub>IF</sub>. Furthermore, quantitative analyses revealed that in patients with IgM<sub>IF</sub> ≥ median, the time to first relapse and to initiation of high-efficacy therapy was shorter by 32 and by 203 months, respectively (both <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01), in comparison to patients with IgM<sub>IF</sub> &lt; median. Dose-dependent associations were also found for IgM<sub>IF</sub> but not for IgG<sub>IF</sub> with magnetic resonance imaging-defined disease activity and sNfL.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This large study supports the value of intrathecal IgM synthesis as an independent biomarker of disease activity and severity in relapsing MS. ANN NEUROL 2021;90:477–489</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) assess the individual genetic propensity to a condition by combining sparse information scattered across genetic loci, often displaying small effect sizes. Most PRSs are constructed in European-ancestry populations, limiting their use in other ethnicities. Here we constructed and validated a PRS for late-onset Alzheimer's Disease (LOAD) in Caribbean Hispanics (CH).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used a CH discovery (n = 4,312) and independent validation sample (n = 1,850) to construct an ancestry-specific PRS (“CH-PRS”) and evaluated its performance alone and with other predictors using the area under curve (AUC) and logistic regression (strength of association with LOAD and statistical significance). We tested if CH-PRS predicted conversion to LOAD in a subsample with longitudinal data (n = 1,239). We also tested the CH-PRS in an independent replication CH cohort (n = 200) and brain autopsy cohort (n = 33). Finally, we tested the effect of ancestry on PRS by using European and African American discovery cohorts to construct alternative PRSs (“EUR-PRS”, “AA-PRS”).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The full model (LOAD ~ CH-PRS + sex + age + <i>APOE-ɛ4)</i>, achieved an AUC = 74% (OR<sub>CH-PRS</sub> = 1.51 95%CI = 1.36–1.68), raising to &gt;75% in <i>APOE-ɛ4</i> non-carriers. CH-PRS alone achieved an AUC = 72% in the autopsy cohort, raising to AUC = 83% in full model. Higher CH-PRS was significantly associated with clinical LOAD in the replication CH cohort (OR = 1.61, 95%CI = 1.19–2.17) and significantly predicted conversion to LOAD (HR = 1.93, CI = 1.70–2.20) in the longitudinal subsample. EUR-PRS and AA-PRS reached lower prediction accuracy (AUC = 58% and 53%, respectively).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Enriching diversity in genetic studies is critical to provide an effective PRS in profiling LOAD risk across populations. ANN NEUROL 2021;90:366–376</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The purpose of this study was to examine the Alzheimer's disease metabolite signature through magnetic resonance spectroscopy in adults with Down syndrome and its relation with Alzheimer's disease biomarkers and cortical thickness.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We included 118 adults with Down syndrome from the Down Alzheimer Barcelona Imaging Initiative and 71 euploid healthy controls from the Sant Pau Initiative on Neurodegeneration cohort. We measured the levels of myo-inositol (a marker of neuroinflammation) and N-acetyl-aspartate (a marker of neuronal integrity) in the precuneus using magnetic resonance spectroscopy. We investigated the changes with age and along the disease continuum (asymptomatic, prodromal Alzheimer's disease, and Alzheimer's disease dementia stages). We assessed the relationship between these metabolites and Aβ<sub>42</sub>/Aβ<sub>40</sub> ratio, phosphorylated tau-181, neurofilament light (NfL), and YKL-40 cerebrospinal fluid levels as well as amyloid positron emission tomography uptake using Spearman correlations controlling for multiple comparisons. Finally, we computed the relationship between cortical thickness and metabolite levels using Freesurfer.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Asymptomatic adults with Down syndrome had a 27.5% increase in the levels of myo-inositol, but equal levels of N-acetyl-aspartate compared to euploid healthy controls. With disease progression, myo-inositol levels increased, whereas N-acetyl-aspartate levels decreased in symptomatic stages of the disease. Myo-inositol was associated with amyloid, tau, and neurodegeneration markers, mainly at symptomatic stages of the disease, whereas N-acetyl-aspartate was related to neurodegeneration biomarkers in symptomatic stages. Both metabolites were significantly associated with cortical thinning, mainly in symptomatic participants.</p>

                <p>The global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has contributed to more than 163 million confirmed infections and 3.3 million deaths worldwide. The severity of the pandemic has led to an unprecedented effort to develop multiple effective vaccines. Due to excellent safety and efficacy data from clinical trials, several vaccines were approved. We report a case series of postvaccinal encephalitis in temporal correlation to vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCov-19. The diagnostic criteria for possible autoimmune encephalitis were fulfilled. Our patients responded well to immunosuppressive therapy with corticosteroids. The incidence has been estimated to be approximately 8 per 10 million vaccine doses. Complication of postvaccinal encephalitis after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination still appear to be very rare, but need to be diagnosed and treated adequately. Large pooled data from observational epidemiologic studies are necessary to verify causality. ANN NEUROL 2021;90:506–511</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Evaluating the effectiveness of ensemble voting in improving the accuracy of consensus signals produced by various DTWA algorithms from step-current signals generated during nanopore sequencing</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Michael Smith, Rachel Chan, Maaz Khurram, Paul M. K. Gordon</p>

Nanopore sequencing device analysis systems simultaneously generate multiple picoamperage current signals representing the passage of DNA or RNA nucleotides ratcheted through a biomolecule nanopore array by motor proteins. Squiggles are a noisy and time-distorted representation of an underlying nucleotide sequence, “gold standard model”, due to experimental and algorithmic artefacts. Other research fields use dynamic time warped<i>-</i>space averaging <i>(DTWA)</i> algorithms to produce a consensus signal from multiple time-warped sources while preserving key features distorted by standard, linear-averaging approaches. We compared the ability of <i>DTW</i> Barycentre averaging (<i>DBA</i>), minimize mean (<i>MM</i>) and stochastic sub-gradient descent (<i>SSG) DTWA</i> algorithms to generate a consensus signal from squiggle-space ensembles of RNA molecules <i>Enolase</i>, <i>Sequin R1-71-1</i> and <i>Sequin R2-55-3</i> without knowledge of their associated gold standard model. We propose techniques to identify the leader and distorted squiggle features prior to <i>DTWA</i> consensus generation. New visualization and warping-path metrics are introduced to compare consensus signals and the best estimate of the “true” consensus, the study’s gold standard model. The <i>DBA</i> consensus was the best match to the gold standard for both <i>Sequin</i> studies but was outperformed in the <i>Enolase</i> study. Given an underlying common characteristic across a squiggle ensemble, we objectively evaluate a novel “voting scheme” that improves the local similarity between the consensus signal and a given fraction of the squiggle ensemble. While the gold standard is not used during voting, the increase in the match of the final voted-on consensus to the underlying <i>Enolase</i> and <i>Sequin</i> gold standard sequences provides an indirect success measure for the proposed voting procedure in two ways: First is the decreased least squares warped distance between the final consensus and the gold model, and second, the voting generates a final consensus length closer to known underlying RNA biomolecule length. The results suggest considerable potential in marrying squiggle analysis and <i>voted-on DTWA</i> consensus signals to provide low-noise, low-distortion signals. This will lead to improved accuracy in detecting nucleotides and their deviation model due to chemical modifications (a.k.a. epigenetic information). The proposed combination of ensemble voting and <i>DTWA</i> has application in other research fields involving time-distorted, high entropy signals.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">The importance of non-pharmaceutical interventions during the COVID-19 vaccine rollout</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Nicolò Gozzi, Paolo Bajardi, Nicola Perra</p>

The promise of efficacious vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 is fulfilled and vaccination campaigns have started worldwide. However, the fight against the pandemic is far from over. Here, we propose an age-structured compartmental model to study the interplay of disease transmission, vaccines rollout, and behavioural dynamics. We investigate, via in-silico simulations, individual and societal behavioural changes, possibly induced by the start of the vaccination campaigns, and manifested as a relaxation in the adoption of non-pharmaceutical interventions. We explore different vaccination rollout speeds, prioritization strategies, vaccine efficacy, as well as multiple behavioural responses. We apply our model to six countries worldwide (Egypt, Peru, Serbia, Ukraine, Canada, and Italy), selected to sample diverse socio-demographic and socio-economic contexts. To isolate the effects of age-structures and contacts patterns from the particular pandemic history of each location, we first study the model considering the same hypothetical initial epidemic scenario in all countries. We then calibrate the model using real epidemiological and mobility data for the different countries. Our findings suggest that early relaxation of safe behaviours can jeopardize the benefits brought by the vaccine in the short term: a fast vaccine distribution and policies aimed at keeping high compliance of individual safe behaviours are key to mitigate disease resurgence.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Networks of Causal Linkage Between Eigenmodes Characterize Behavioral Dynamics of Caenorhabditis elegans</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Erik Saberski, Antonia K. Bock, Rachel Goodridge, Vitul Agarwal, Tom Lorimer, Scott A. Rifkin, George Sugihara</p>

Behavioral phenotyping of model organisms has played an important role in unravelling the complexities of animal behavior. Techniques for classifying behavior often rely on easily identified changes in posture and motion. However, such approaches are likely to miss complex behaviors that cannot be readily distinguished by eye (e.g., high-dimensional dynamics). To explore this issue, we focus on the model organism <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>, where behaviors have been extensively recorded and classified. Using a dynamical systems lens, we identify high-dimensional, non-linear causal relationships between four basic shapes that describe worm motion (eigenmodes, also called “eigenworms”). We find relationships between all pairs of eigenmodes, but the timescales of the interactions vary between pairs and across individuals. Using these varying timescales, we create “interaction profiles” to represent an individual’s behavioral dynamics. As desired, these profiles are able to distinguish well-known behavioral states: i.e., the profiles for foraging individuals are distinct from those of individuals exhibiting an escape response. More importantly, we find that interaction profiles can distinguish high dimensional behaviors among divergent mutant strains that were previously classified as phenotypically similar. Specifically, we find it is able to detect phenotypic behavioral differences not previously identified in strains related to dysfunction of hermaphrodite-specific neurons.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Chromosomal neighbourhoods allow identification of organ specific changes in gene expression</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Rishi Das Roy, Outi Hallikas, Mona M. Christensen, Elodie Renvoisé, Jukka Jernvall</p>

Although most genes share their chromosomal neighbourhood with other genes, distribution of genes has not been explored in the context of individual organ development; the common focus of developmental biology studies. Because developmental processes are often associated with initially subtle changes in gene expression, here we explored whether neighbouring genes are informative in the identification of differentially expressed genes. First, we quantified the chromosomal neighbourhood patterns of genes having related functional roles in the mammalian genome. Although the majority of protein coding genes have at least five neighbours within 1 Mb window around each gene, very few of these neighbours regulate development of the same organ. Analyses of transcriptomes of developing mouse molar teeth revealed that whereas expression of genes regulating tooth development changes, their neighbouring genes show no marked changes, irrespective of their level of expression. Finally, we test whether inclusion of gene neighbourhood in the analyses of differential expression could provide additional benefits. For the analyses, we developed an algorithm, called DELocal that identifies differentially expressed genes by comparing their expression changes to changes in adjacent genes in their chromosomal regions. Our results show that DELocal removes detection bias towards large changes in expression, thereby allowing identification of even subtle changes in development. Future studies, including the detection of differential expression, may benefit from, and further characterize the significance of gene-gene neighbour relationships.

                Background: This article aims to explore the factors associated with Dubowitz neurological examination scores in preterm new-borns.       Methods: This is a cross-sectional study in which forty preterm new-borns were evaluated by using the Dubowitz neurological examination on their first outpatient visit following hospital discharge. A questionnaire was also deployed to explore parental variables.       Results: Preterm new-borns with low scores in the Dubowitz neurological examination were born at an even lower gestational age, required longer hospitalisation, and had more indicators for orotracheal intubation. Positive correlations between the subdomains of the Dubowitz neurological examination with birthweight, mother's age, Apgar score at 5 min, maternal and paternal education, and income were also significant. Linear regression analyses explained 26% of the of the Dubowitz neurological examination global score, retaining birthweight, income, and father’s age as significant predictors. Conclusions: Early, appropriated neurological assessments of preterm infants are critical to detect risk factors that may underpin developmental delays.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Cerebral venous thrombosis revealing celiac disease [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune enteropathy resulting from intolerance of an individual genetically predisposed to gluten. It has a large clinical polymorphism ranging from a classic digestive clinical presentation due to the malabsorption syndrome to extra-intestinal symptoms. Among the hematologic abnormalities, venous thromboembolic disease (VTE) has been reported, and they are most often located in the abdomen or lower limbs, but the cerebral localization was exceptionally described. We report a case of CD revealed by cerebral thrombophlebitis. A 44-year-old patient with no medical history and no drug intake, presented with hemiplegia followed by a status epilepticus in a context of apyrexia, initially hospitalized in intensive care. Magnetic imaging resonance displayed a cerebral venous thrombosis of the sigmoid sinus requiring anticoagulant treatment, then transferred to our department for the etiological investigation. On questioning, the patient reported chronic diarrhea and weight loss with no other associated symptoms. The examination revealed an underweight patient with pale conjunctiva, improvement of her deficit symptoms, and no other abnormalities. Laboratory tests noted biological signs of malabsorption. The thrombophilia assessment revealed a protein C deficiency with a slight increase in anticardiolipin antibodies and anti-Beta 2 glycoprotein 1 antibodies. Immunological tests noted positives anti-transglutaminase and IgA anti-endomysium antibodies. Duodenal biopsy demonstrated villous atrophy. After ruling out the other causes of VTE, the diagnosis of cerebral venous thrombosis secondary to CD was retained. Early diagnosis and treatment of CD improves the quality-of-life for patients and may spare them various long-term or even fatal complications.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Developing and validating a prediction model for frequent attenders at a Swedish emergency department using an electronic medical record system, a retrospective observational study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Frequent attenders (FA) account for a significant number of emergency department (ED) visits but to date there is no prediction model to identify patients at risk of becoming a FA. The aim of this research was to identify and describe FA using readily available data provided by electronic medical records and create a prediction model to identify future FA Method: Adults ≥18 years that visited the ED during 2015 were included. Patients with ≥4 visits were defined as FA, and patients with ≤3 visits were placed in the control group. Numerous variables were analyzed and differences between the groups compared. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the predictor variables and the model validated using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) on an independent sample. Results: 6635 patients were included in developing the model: 15.3 (n=1012) were classified as FA and 15.4 (n=1011) as the control group. Variables associated with at risk of becoming a FA were the following: age above 60 years OR 1.52 [CI 1.27 – 1.82], ED arrival by ambulance or helicopter OR 1.31 [CI 1.08 – 1.58], sheltered living OR 3.82 [CI 2.37 – 6.17], previous contact with psychiatric department OR 1.52 [CI 1.23 – 1.89], 10 outpatient care visits or more OR 4.81 [CI 3.81 – 6.08] and 10 outpatient care physician visits or more OR 3.94 [CI 3.25 – 4.78]. The ROC in the validation set had an area under the curve of 0.85 [CI 0.84 – 0.86]. Conclusion: Data from electronic medical record software can be used to create and validate the risk of becoming a FA in the ED. We found that age over 60 years, ED arrival by ambulance or helicopter, sheltered living, previous contact with psychiatric departments, and frequent visits at outpatient care together predict the risk of becoming a FA.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Seizures after ischemic stroke: a matched multicenter study</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To identify risk factors for acute symptomatic seizures and post-stroke epilepsy after acute ischemic stroke and evaluate the effects of reperfusion treatment.</p>
<h2>
Methods
</h2>
<p>
We assessed the risk factors for post-stroke seizures using logistic or Cox regression in a multicenter study including adults from eight European referral centers with neuroimaging-confirmed ischemic stroke. We compared the risk of post-stroke seizures between participants with or without reperfusion treatment following propensity score matching to reduce confounding due to treatment selection.</p>
<h2>
Results
</h2>
<p>
In the overall cohort of 4229 participants (mean age 71 years, 57% male), a higher risk of acute symptomatic seizures was observed in those with more severe strokes, infarcts located in the posterior cerebral artery territory, and strokes caused by large-artery atherosclerosis. Strokes caused by small-vessel occlusion carried a small risk of acute symptomatic seizures. The 6% developed post-stroke epilepsy. Risk factors for post-stroke epilepsy were acute symptomatic seizures, more severe strokes, infracts involving the cerebral cortex, and strokes caused by large-artery atherosclerosis. Electroencephalography findings within 7 days of stroke onset were not independently associated with the risk of post-stroke epilepsy. There was no association between reperfusion treatments in general or only intravenous thrombolysis or mechanical thrombectomy with the time to post-stroke epilepsy or the risk of acute symptomatic seizures.</p>
<h2>
Interpretation
</h2>
<p>
Post-stroke seizures are related to stroke severity, etiology, and location, whereas an early electroencephalogram was not predictive of epilepsy. We did not find an association of reperfusion treatment with risks of acute symptomatic seizures or post-stroke epilepsy.</p>

                Recent work suggests that dorsal striatum is critical in encoding the perception of time. Examining neuronal populations as rats judge vibration duration in a delayed comparison task, Toso et al. show that dorsal striatum represents the passage of time throughout the trial, a function distinct from the perception of stimulus duration.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/inpress.rss">RhoA drives actin compaction to restrict axon regeneration and astrocyte reactivity after CNS injury</a></h4>

              
                Stern et al. reveal cell type-specific roles of RhoA that affect axon regeneration in opposite ways. By acting on the cytoskeleton, neuronal RhoA restrains axon regrowth, but astrocytic RhoA attenuates inhibitory astrocyte reactivity. Therefore, only neuron-specific RhoA ablation stimulates regeneration.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Heterogeneous side-effects of cortical inactivation in behaving animals</a></h4>

              
                Cortical inactivation represents a key causal manipulation that allows the study of cortical circuits and their impact on behavior. A key assumption in these studies is that the neurons in the target area become silent while the surrounding cortical tissue is only negligibly impacted. However, individual neurons are embedded in complex local circuits comprised of excitatory and inhibitory cells with connections extending hundreds of microns. This raises the possibility that silencing one part of the network could induce complex, unpredictable activity changes in neurons outside the targeted inactivation zone. These off-target side effects can potentially complicate interpretations of inactivation manipulations, especially when they are related to changes in behavior. Here, we demonstrate that optogenetic inactivation of glutamatergic neurons in the superficial layers of monkey V1 induces robust suppression at the light-targeted site, but destabilizes stimulus responses in the neighboring, untargeted network. We identified 4 types of stimulus-evoked neuronal responses within a cortical column, ranging from full suppression to facilitation, and a mixture of both. Mixed responses were most prominent in middle and deep cortical layers. Importantly, these results demonstrate that response modulation driven by lateral network connectivity is diversely implemented throughout a cortical column. Furthermore, consistent behavioral changes induced by optogenetic inactivation were only achieved when cumulative network activity was homogeneously suppressed. Therefore, careful consideration of the full range of network changes outside the inactivated cortical region is required, as heterogeneous side-effects can confound interpretation of inactivation experiments.

                Eurasian jays have been reported to protect their caches by responding to cues about either the visual perspective or current desire of an observing conspecific, similarly to other corvids. Here, we used established paradigms to test whether these birds can - like humans - integrate multiple cues about different mental states and perform an optimal response accordingly. Across five experiments, which also include replications of previous work, we found little evidence that our jays adjusted their caching behaviour in line with the visual perspective and current desire of another agent, neither by integrating these social cues nor by responding to only one type of cue independently. These results raise questions about the reliability of the previously reported effects and highlight several key issues affecting reliability in comparative cognition research.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">End-of-life targeted auxin-mediated degradation of DAF-2 Insulin/IGF-1 receptor promotes longevity free from growth-related pathologies</a></h4>

              
                Preferably, lifespan-extending therapies should work when applied late in life without causing undesired pathologies. Reducing Insulin/IGF-1 signaling (IIS) increases lifespan across species, but the effects of reduced IIS interventions in extreme geriatric ages remains unknown. Using the nematode <i>C. elegans</i>, we engineered the conditional depletion of the DAF-2/insulin/IGF-1 transmembrane receptor using an auxin-inducible degradation (AID) system. This allowed for the temporal and spatial reduction in DAF-2 protein levels at time points after which interventions such as RNAi become ineffective. Using this system, we found that AID-mediated depletion of DAF-2 protein surpasses the longevity of <i>daf-2</i> mutants. Depletion of DAF-2 during early adulthood resulted in multiple adverse phenotypes, including growth retardation, germline shrinkage, egg retention, and reduced brood size. By contrast, AID-mediated depletion of DAF-2 post reproduction, or specifically in the intestine in early adulthood, resulted in an extension of lifespan without these deleterious effects. Strikingly, at geriatric ages, when 75% of the population had died, AID-mediated depletion of DAF-2 protein resulted in a doubling in lifespan. Thus, we provide a proof-of-concept that even close to the end of an individual's lifespan, it is possible to slow aging and promote longevity.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Structural basis for membrane recruitment of ATG16L1 by WIPI2 in Autophagy</a></h4>

              
                Autophagy is a cellular process that degrades cytoplasmic cargo by engulfing it in a double membrane vesicle, known as the autophagosome, and delivering it to the lysosome. The ATG12-5-16L1 complex is responsible for conjugating members of the ubiquitin-like ATG8 protein family to phosphatidylethanolamine in the growing autophagosomal membrane, known as the phagophore. ATG12-5-16L1 is recruited to the phagophore by a subset of the phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate-binding seven bladed â-propeller WIPI proteins. We determined the crystal structure of WIPI2d in complex with the WIPI2 interacting region (W2IR) of ATG16L1 comprising residues 207-230 at 1.85 Å resolution. The structure shows that the ATG16L1 W2IR adopts an alpha helical conformation and binds in an electropositive and hydrophobic groove between WIPI2 â-propeller blades 2 and 3. Mutation of residues at the interface reduces or blocks the recruitment of ATG12-5-16L1 and the conjugation of the ATG8 protein LC3B to synthetic membranes. Interface mutants show a decrease in starvation-induced autophagy. Comparisons across the four human WIPIs suggest that WIPI1 and 2 belong to a W2IR-binding subclass responsible for localizing ATG12-5-16L1 and driving ATG8 lipidation, whilst WIPI3 and 4 belong to a second W34IR-binding subclass responsible for localizing ATG2, and so directing lipid supply to the nascent phagophore. The structure provides a framework for understanding the regulatory node connecting two central events in autophagy initiation, the action of the autophagic PI 3-kinase complex on the one hand, and ATG8 lipidation on the other.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Coherent theta activity in the medial and orbital frontal cortices encodes reward value</a></h4>

              
                This study examined how the medial frontal (MFC) and orbital frontal (OFC) cortices process reward information. We simultaneously recorded local field potentials in the two areas as rats consumed liquid sucrose rewards. Both areas exhibited a 4-8 Hz 'theta' rhythm that was phase locked to the lick cycle. The rhythm tracked shifts in sucrose concentrations and fluid volumes, demonstrating that it is sensitive to differences in reward magnitude. The coupling between the rhythm and licking was stronger in MFC than OFC and varied with response vigor and absolute reward value in the MFC. Spectral analysis revealed zero-lag coherence between the cortical areas, and found evidence for a directionality of the rhythm, with MFC leading OFC. Our findings suggest that consummatory behavior generates simultaneous theta range activity in the MFC and OFC that encodes the value of consumed fluids, with the MFC having a top-down role in the control of consumption.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Coupling between motor cortex and striatum increases during sleep over long-term skill learning</a></h4>

              
                The strength of cortical connectivity to the striatum influences the balance between behavioral variability and stability. Learning to consistently produce a skilled action requires plasticity in corticostriatal connectivity associated with repeated training of the action. However, it remains unknown whether such corticostriatal plasticity occurs during training itself or 'offline' during time away from training, such as sleep. Here, we monitor the corticostriatal network throughout long-term skill learning in rats and find that non-REM (NREM) sleep is a relevant period for corticostriatal plasticity. We first show that the offline activation of striatal NMDA receptors is required for skill learning. We then show that corticostriatal functional connectivity increases offline, coupled to emerging consistent skilled movements and coupled cross-area neural dynamics. We then identify NREM sleep spindles as uniquely poised to mediate corticostriatal plasticity, through interactions with slow oscillations. Our results provide evidence that sleep shapes cross-area coupling required for skill learning.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A Tad-like apparatus is required for contact-dependent prey killing in predatory social bacteria</a></h4>

              
                <i>Myxococcus xanthus</i>, a soil bacterium, predates collectively using motility to invade prey colonies. Prey lysis is mostly thought to rely on secreted factors, cocktails of antibiotics and enzymes, and direct contac with <i>Myxococcus</i> cells. In this study, we show that on surfaces the coupling of A-motility and contact-dependent killing is the central predatory mechanism driving effective prey colony invasion and consumption. At the molecular level, contact-dependent killing involves a newly discovered type IV filament-like machinery (Kil) that both promotes motility arrest and prey cell plasmolysis. In this process, Kil proteins assemble at the predator-prey contact site, suggesting that they allow tight contact with prey cells for their intoxication. Kil-like systems form a new class of Tad-like machineries in predatory bacteria, suggesting a conserved function in predator-prey interactions. This study further reveals a novel cell-cell interaction function for bacterial pili-like assemblages.

                Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a debilitating and deadly disease characterized by low body mass index due to diminished food intake, and oftentimes concurrent hyperactivity. A high percentage of AN behavioral and metabolic phenotypes can be replicated in rodents given access to a voluntary running wheel and subject to food restriction, termed activity-based anorexia (ABA). Despite the well-documented body weight loss observed in AN human patients and ABA rodents, much less is understood regarding the neurobiological underpinnings of these maladaptive behaviors. Moreover, while exercise has been shown to diminish the activity of hunger-promoting hypothalamic agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neurons, much less is known regarding their activity and function in the mediation of food intake during ABA. Here, feeding microstructure analysis revealed ABA mice decreased food intake due to increased interpellet interval retrieval and diminished meal number. Longitudinal activity recordings of AgRP neurons in ABA animals revealed a maladaptive inhibitory response to food. We then demonstrated that ABA development or progression can be mitigated by chemogenetic AgRP activation through the reprioritization of food intake (increased meal number) over hyperactivity. These results elucidate a potential neural target for the amelioration of behavioral maladaptations present in AN patients.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">FIBCD1 is a Conserved Receptor for Chondroitin Sulphate Proteoglycans of the Brain Extracellular Matrix and a Candidate Gene for a Complex Neurodevelopmental Disorder</a></h4>

              
                The brain extracellular matrix (ECM) is enriched in chondroitin sulphate proteoglycans (CSPGs) with variable sulphate modifications that intimately participate in brain maturation and function. Very little is known about how the changing biophysical properties of the CSPGs are signalled to neurons. Here, we report Fibrinogen C Domain Containing 1 (FIBCD1), a known chitin-binding receptor of the innate immune system, to be highly expressed in the hippocampus and to specifically bind CSPGs containing 4-O sulphate modification (CS-4S). Cultured Fibcd1 knockout (KO) neurons lack phenotypic and transcriptomic responses to CSPG stimulation. Further, Fibcd1 KO mice exhibit accumulation of CS-4S, likely resulting in deficits of hippocampal-dependent learning tasks and abrogated synaptic remodelling, a phenotype rescued by enzymatic digestion of CSPGs. Likewise, neuronal specific knockdown of a Fibcd1 orthologue in flies results in neuronal morphological changes at the neuromuscular junctions and behavioural defects. Finally, we report two undiagnosed patients with a complex neurodevelopmental disorder with deleterious variants in FIBCD1, strongly implicating FIBCD1 in the development of the disease. Taken together, our results demonstrate that FIBCD1 is a novel, evolutionarily conserved component of ECM sulphation recognition that is crucial for neuronal development and function.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Spontaneous alpha-band oscillations bias subjective contrast perception</a></h4>

              
                Perceptual decisions depend both on the features of the incoming stimulus and on the ongoing brain activity at the moment the stimulus is received. Specifically, trial-to-trial fluctuations in cortical excitability have been linked to fluctuations in the amplitude of pre-stimulus alpha oscillations (~8-13 Hz), which are in turn are associated with fluctuations in subjects' tendency to report the detection of a stimulus. It is currently unknown whether alpha oscillations bias post-perceptual decision making, or even bias subjective perception itself. To answer this question, we used a contrast discrimination task in which subjects reported which of two gratings -- one in each hemifield -- was perceived as having a stronger contrast. Our EEG analysis showed that subjective contrast was reduced for the stimulus in the hemifield represented in the hemisphere with relatively stronger pre-stimulus alpha amplitude, reflecting reduced cortical excitability. Furthermore, the strength of this spontaneous hemispheric lateralization was strongly correlated with the magnitude of individual subjects' biases, suggesting that the spontaneous patterns of alpha lateralization play a role in explaining the inter-subject variability in contrast perception. These results indicate that spontaneous fluctuations in cortical excitability, indicted by patterns of pre-stimulus alpha amplitude, affect perceptual decisions by altering the phenomenological perception of the visual world.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Humans reconfigure target and distractor processing to address distinct task demands</a></h4>

              
                When faced with distraction, we can focus more on goal-relevant information (targets) or focus less goal-conflicting information (distractors). How people decide to distribute cognitive control across targets and distractors remains unclear. To help address this question, we developed a parametric attentional control task with a graded manipulation to both target discriminability and distractor interference. We find that participants exert independent control over target and distractor processing. We measured control adjustments through the influence of incentives and previous conflict on target and distractor sensitivity, finding that these have dissociable influences on control. Whereas incentives preferentially led to target enhancement, conflict on the previous trial preferentially led to distractor suppression. These distinct drivers of control altered sensitivity to targets and distractors early in the trial, and were promptly followed by reactive reconfiguration towards task-appropriate feature sensitivity. Finally, we provide a process-level account of these findings by show that these control adjustments are well-captured by an evidence accumulation model with attractor dynamics over feature weights. These results help establish a process-level account of control configuration that provides new insights into how multivariate attentional signals are optimized to achieve task goals.

                Objective: We investigated auditory temporal processing in children with amblyaudia (AMB), a subtype of auditory processing disorder, via cortical neural entrainment. Design and study samples: Evoked responses were recorded to click-trains at slow vs. fast (8.5 vs. 14.9/sec) rates in n=14 children with AMB and n=11 age-matched controls. Source and time-frequency analyses decomposed EEGs into oscillations (reflecting neural entrainment) stemming from the bilateral auditory cortex. Results: Phase-locking strength in AMB depended critically on the speed of auditory stimuli. In contrast to age-matched peers, AMB responses were largely insensitive to rate manipulations. This rate resistance was seen regardless of the ear of presentation and in both cortical hemispheres. Conclusion: Children with AMB show a stark inflexibility in auditory cortical entrainment to rapid sounds. In addition to reduced capacity to integrate information between the ears, we identify more rigid tagging of external auditory stimuli. Our neurophysiological findings may account for certain temporal processing deficits commonly observed in AMB and related auditory processing disorders (APDs) behaviorally. More broadly, our findings may inform communication strategies and future rehabilitation programs; increasing the rate of stimuli above a normal (slow) speech rate is likely to make stimulus processing more challenging for individuals with AMB/APD.

                Passive motion can induce kinetosis (motion sickness, MS) in susceptible individuals. MS is an evolutionary conserved mechanism caused by mismatches between motion related sensory information and past visual and motion memory, triggering a malaise accompanied by hypolocomotion, hypothermia, hypophagia and aversion to novel foods presented coincidentally. Vestibular nuclei (VN) are critical for the processing of movement input, and motion-induced activation of VN neurons recapitulates MS-related signs. However, the genetic identity of VN neurons mediating MS-related autonomic and aversive responses remains unknown. Here, we identify a glutamatergic vestibular circuitry necessary to elicit MS-related behavioral responses, defining a central role of cholecystokinin (CCK)-expressing glutamatergic VN neurons in vestibular-induced malaise. Moreover, we show that CCK VN inputs onto the parabrachial nucleus activate Calca-expressing neurons and are sufficient to establish hypothermia and aversion to novel food. Together, we provide novel insight into the neurobiological regulation of MS, unravelling key genetically defined neural substrates for kinetosis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cortical dopamine reduces the impact of motivational biases governing automated behaviour</a></h4>

              
                Motivations shape our behaviour: the promise of reward invigorates, while in the face of punishment, we hold back. Abnormalities of motivational processing are implicated in clinical disorders characterised by excessive habits and loss of top-down control, notably substance and behavioural addictions. Striatal and frontal dopamine have been hypothesised to play complementary roles in the respective generation and control of these motivational biases. However, while dopaminergic interventions have indeed been found to modulate motivational biases, these previous pharmacological studies used regionally non-selective pharmacological agents. Here, we tested the hypothesis that frontal dopamine controls the balance between Pavlovian, bias-driven automated responding and instrumentally learned action values. Specifically, we examined whether selective enhancement of cortical dopamine either (i) enables adaptive suppression of Pavlovian control when biases are maladaptive; or (ii) non-specifically modulates the degree of bias-driven automated responding. Healthy individuals (n=35) received the catechol-o-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor tolcapone in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over design, and completed a motivational Go NoGo task known to elicit motivational biases. In support of hypothesis (ii), tolcapone globally decreased motivational bias. Specifically, tolcapone improved performance on trials where the bias was unhelpful, but impaired performance in bias-congruent conditions. These results indicate a non-selective role for cortical dopamine in the regulation of motivational processes underpinning top-down control over automated behaviour. The findings have direct relevance to understanding neurobiological mechanisms underpinning addiction and obsessive-compulsive disorders, as well as highlighting a potential trans-diagnostic novel mechanism to address such symptoms.

                Auditory symptoms are one of the most frequent sensory issues described in people with Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), the most common genetic form of intellectual disability. However, the mechanisms that lead to these symptoms are under explored. In this study, we examined whether alterations in myelination in auditory brainstem circuitry contribute to auditory impairments in FXS mice. Specifically, we studied myelinated fibers that terminate in the Calyx of Held, which encode temporally precise sound arrival time, and are some of the most heavily myelinated axons in the brain. We measured anatomical myelination characteristics using coherent anti-stokes Raman spectroscopy (CARS) and electron microscopy (EM) in a FXS mouse model in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) where the Calyx of Held synapses. We measured number of mature oligodendrocytes (OL) and oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) to determine if changes in myelination were due to changes in the number of myelinating or immature glial cells. The two microscopy techniques (EM and CARS) showed a decrease in fiber diameter in FXS mice. Additionally, EM results indicated reductions in myelin thickness and axon diameter, and an increase in g-ratio, a measure of structural and functional myelination. Lastly, we showed an increase in both OL and OPCs in MNTB sections of FXS mice suggesting that the myelination phenotype is not due to an overall decrease in number of myelinating OLs. This is the first study to show that a potential myelination mechanism can explain alterations seen in FXS at the level of the auditory brainstem.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Prediction and action in cortical pain processing</a></h4>

              
                Predicting that a stimulus is painful facilitates action to avoid harm. But does the prediction of upcoming painful events engage the same or different processes than acting to avoid or reduce current pain? In this fMRI experiment, we investigated brain activity as a function of current and predicted painful or nonpainful thermal stimulation, and the ability of voluntary action to affect the duration of the upcoming stimulation. Participants (n = 30) performed a task which involved the administration of a painful or nonpainful stimulus (S1), which predicted an immediately subsequent very painful or nonpainful stimulus (S2). Participants' task was to press a response button within a short time window upon the presentation of a response cue during S1. On action-effective trials, pressing the button within the specified time window reduced the duration of the upcoming stimulation. On action-ineffective trials, pressing the button had no effect on upcoming stimulation. Predicted pain increased activation in regions including anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), midcingulate cortex (MCC), and insula; however, activation in ACC and MCC depended on whether a meaningful action was performed, with MCC activation showing a direct relationship with motor output. Region-of-interest analyses revealed that insula's responses for predicted pain were also modulated by potential action consequences, especially in the left hemisphere, albeit without a direct relationship with motor output. Taken together, these findings suggest that cortical pain processing is not specifically tied to the sensory stimulus, but instead depends on the consequences of that stimulus for sensorimotor control of behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Strong and specific connections between retinal axon mosaics and midbrain neurons revealed by large scale paired recordings</a></h4>

              
                The superior colliculus (SC) is a midbrain structure that plays important roles in visually guided behaviors. Neurons in the SC receive afferent inputs from retinal ganglion cells (RGC), the output cells of the retina, but how SC neurons integrate RGC activity in vivo is unknown. SC neurons might be driven by strong but sparse retinal inputs, thereby reliably transmitting specific retinal functional channels. Alternatively, SC neurons could sum numerous but weak inputs, thereby extracting new features by combining a diversity of retinal signals. Here, we discovered that high-density electrodes simultaneously capture the activity and the location of large populations of retinal axons and their postsynaptic SC target neurons, permitting us to investigate the retinocollicular circuit on a structural and functional level in vivo. We show that RGC axons in the mouse are organized in mosaics that provide a single cell precise representation of the retina as input to SC. This isomorphic mapping between retina and SC builds the scaffold for highly specific wiring in the retinocollicular circuit which we show is characterized by strong connections and limited functional convergence, established in log-normally distributed connection strength. Because our novel method of large-scale paired recordings is broadly applicable for investigating functional connectivity across brain regions, we were also able to identify retinal inputs to the avian optic tectum of the zebra finch. We found common wiring rules in mammals and birds that provide a precise and reliable representation of the visual world encoded in RGCs to neurons in retinorecipient areas.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A flow-based latent state generative model of neural population responses to natural images</a></h4>

              
                We present a joint deep neural system identification model for two major sources of neural variability: stimulus-driven and stimulus-conditioned fluctuations. To this end, we combine (1) state-of-the-art deep networks for stimulus-driven activity and (2) a flexible, normalizing flow-based generative model to capture the stimulus-conditioned variability including noise correlations. This allows us to train the model end-to-end without the need for sophisticated probabilistic approximations associated with many latent state models for stimulus-conditioned fluctuations. We train the model on the responses of thousands of neurons from multiple areas of the mouse visual cortex to natural images. We show that our model outperforms previous state-of-the-art models in predicting the distribution of neural population responses to novel stimuli, including shared stimulus-conditioned variability. Furthermore, it successfully learns known latent factors of the population responses that are related to behavioral variables such as pupil dilation, and other factors that vary systematically with brain area or retinotopic location. Overall, our model accurately accounts for two critical sources of neural variability while avoiding several complexities associated with many existing latent state models. It thus provides a useful tool for uncovering the interplay between different factors that contribute to variability in neural activity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The Temporal Pattern of Spiking Activity of a Thalamic Neuron are Related to the Amplitude of the Cortical Local Field Potential</a></h4>

              
                Neuron activity in the sensory cortices mainly depends on feedforward thalamic inputs. High-frequency activity of a thalamic input can be temporally integrated by a neuron in the sensory cortex and is likely to induce larger depolarization. However, feedforward inhibition (FFI) and depression of excitatory synaptic transmission in thalamocortical pathways attenuate depolarization induced by the latter part of high-frequency spiking activity and the temporal summation may not be effective. The spiking activity of a thalamic neuron in a specific temporal pattern may circumvent FFI and depression of excitatory synapses. The present study determined the relationship between the temporal pattern of spiking activity of a single thalamic neuron and the degree of cortical activation as well as that between the firing rate of spiking activity of a single thalamic neuron and the degree of cortical activation. Spiking activity of a thalamic neuron was recorded extracellularly from the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) in male Long-Evans rats. Degree of cortical activation was assessed by simultaneous recording of local field potential (LFP) from the visual cortex. A specific temporal pattern appearing in three consecutive spikes of an LGN neuron induced larger cortical LFP modulation than high-frequency spiking activity during a short period. These findings indicate that spiking activity of thalamic inputs is integrated by a synaptic mechanism sensitive to an input temporal pattern.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Spectral Separation of Evoked and Background Cortical Activity - Application to Short Latency Median Nerve Evoked Potentials</a></h4>

              
                Background: Spectral analysis of repeatedly evoked potentials (EPs) is challenging since recordings contain a superposition of evoked signals and background activity. We developed a novel approach, N-interval Fourier Transform Analysis (N-FTA), which allows for reliable separation and accurate assessment of evoked and background spectral components. We applied this approach to spectral analysis of median nerve short latency EPs for identifying spectral bands of clinical relevance. Methods: We performed right median nerve stimulation in two volunteers at 2.46 Hz and 3.95 Hz stimulation rate (600 and 1000 repetitions respectively). We applied N-FTA for splitting the periodically repeated evoked components from irregular background activity and investigated spectral components in the low, medium and high frequency (LF-, MF-, HF-) bands. We present a signal processing approach, which allows for accurately extracting diagnostically relevant features (signal morphology, latency and amplitude) using an 18 Hz to 240 Hz bandwidth. Results: In the LF-band below 10 Hz, evoked-to-background ratio (EBR) was below -15 dB due to the high level near DC background activity (1/f-activity, eye blinks, theta-band). Highest EBR was near -5 dB and obtained at a few tens of Hz. Relatively broad continuous segments of evoked activity were detected in the MF band. These frequencies of a few hundred Hz were linked to the signal segment between the N20 and P25 peaks in the time domain. High frequency oscillations (HFOs) near 600 Hz were approximately -25 dB below the background level and near the limit of the sensitivity of N-FTA. By subtracting stimulation artifacts and applying zero-phase filters it was possible to extract diagnostically relevant short latency EP features (signal morphology, latency and amplitude) only from the MF-band with a similar accuracy as a routinely used broad-band setting. HFOs displayed amplitudes of a few tenths of micro-volt. Summary: N-FTA allows for accurate, simultaneous spectral analysis of evoked and background activity in individual trials. The approach allowed for identifying target frequency bands of high evoked activity and for tailoring signal processing such, that morphology and latency can be obtained at a significantly reduced bandwidth. This should allow for development of more robust and faster recording techniques in the near future.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The Cortical Spectrum: a robust structural continuum in primate cerebral cortex revealed by histological staining and magnetic resonance imaging</a></h4>

              
                High-level characterizations of the primate cerebral cortex sit between two extremes: on one end the cortical mantle is seen as a mosaic of structurally and functionally unique areas, and on the other it is seen as a uniform six-layered structure in which functional differences are defined solely by extrinsic connections. Neither of these extremes captures the crucial neuroanatomical finding: that the cortex exhibits systematic gradations in architectonic structure. These gradations have been shown to predict cortico-cortical connectivity, which in turn suggests powerful ways to ground connectomics in anatomical structure, and by extension cortical function. A challenge to more widespread use of this concept is the labor-intensive and invasive nature of histological staining, which is the primary means of recognizing anatomical gradations. Here we show that a novel computational analysis technique can be used to derive a coarse-grained picture of cortical variation. For each of 78 cortical areas spanning the entire cortical mantle of the rhesus macaque, we created a high dimensional set of anatomical features derived from captured images of cortical tissue stained for myelin and SMI-32. The method involved semi-automated de-noising of images, and enabled comparison of brain areas without hand-labeling of features such as layer boundaries. We applied nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) to the dataset to visualize similarity among cortical areas. This analysis shows a systematic variation between weakly laminated (limbic) cortices and sharply laminated (eulaminate) cortices. We call this smooth continuum the 'cortical spectrum'. We also show that this spectrum is visible within subsystems of the cortex: the occipital, parietal, temporal, motor, prefrontal, and insular cortices. We compared the NMDS-derived spectrum with a spectrum produced using T1- and T2- weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data derived from macaque, and found close agreement of the two coarse-graining methods. This evidence suggests that T1/T2 data, routinely obtained in human MRI studies, can be used as an effective proxy for data derived from high-resolution histological methods. More generally, this approach shows that the cortical spectrum is robust to the specific method used to compare cortical areas, and is therefore a powerful tool to understand the principles of organization of the primate cortex.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A neural hub that coordinates learned and innate courtship behaviors</a></h4>

              
                Holistic behaviors often require the coordination of innate and learned movements. The neural circuits that enable such coordination remain unknown. Here we identify a midbrain cell group (A11) that enables male zebra finches to coordinate their learned songs with various innate behaviors, including female-directed calling, orientation and pursuit. Anatomical mapping reveals that A11 is at the center of a complex network including the song premotor nucleus HVC as well as brainstem regions crucial to innate calling and locomotion. Notably, lesioning A11 terminals in HVC blocked female-directed singing, but did not interfere with female-directed calling, orientation or pursuit. In contrast, lesioning A11 cell bodies abolished all female-directed courtship behaviors. However, males with either type of lesion still produced songs when in social isolation. Lastly, monitoring A11 terminals in HVC showed that during courtship A11 inputs to the song premotor cortex signal the transition from innate to learned vocalizations. These results show how a brain region important to reproduction in both birds and mammals coordinates learned vocalizations with innate, ancestral courtship behaviors.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Auditory word comprehension is less incremental in isolated words</a></h4>

              
                Speech input is often understood to trigger rapid and automatic activation of successively higher-level representations for comprehension of words. Here we show evidence from magnetoencephalography that incremental processing of speech input is limited when words are heard in isolation as compared to continuous speech. This suggests a less unified and automatic process than is often assumed. We present evidence that neural effects of phoneme-by-phoneme lexical uncertainty, quantified by cohort entropy, occur in connected speech but not isolated words. In contrast, we find robust effects of phoneme probability, quantified by phoneme surprisal, during perception of both connected speech and isolated words. This dissociation rules out models of word recognition in which phoneme surprisal and cohort entropy are common indicators of a uniform process, even though these closely related information-theoretic measures both arise from the probability distribution of wordforms consistent with the input. We propose that phoneme surprisal effects reflect automatic access of a lower level of representation of the auditory input (e.g., wordforms) while cohort entropy effects are task-sensitive, driven by a competition process or a higher-level representation that is engaged late (or not at all) during the processing of single words.

                The underlying mechanisms that promote precise spiking in upper motor neurons controlling fine motor skills are not well understood. Here we report that projection neurons in the adult zebra finch song nucleus RA display: 1) robust high-frequency firing, 2) ultra-narrow spike waveforms, 3) superfast Na+ current inactivation kinetics and 4) large resurgent Na+ currents (INaR). These properties of songbird pallial motor neurons closely resemble those of specialized large pyramidal neurons in mammalian primary motor cortex. They emerge during the early phases of song development in males, but not females, coinciding with a complete switch of Na+ channel subunit expression from Nav{beta}3 to Nav{beta}4. Dynamic clamping and dialysis of Nav{beta}4 C-terminal peptides into juvenile RA neurons provide evidence that Nav{beta}4, and its associated INaR, promote neuronal excitability. We thus propose that INaR can profoundly impact the excitability of upper motor neurons that are required for the execution of fine motor skills.

	<p>Background: In Down syndrome (DS), adaptive behaviour often shows a “surplus effect” (i.e., higher adaptive abilities than expected from cognitive skills). As inclusive schooling has become mandatory in Italy, we studied the impact of school inclusion on the surplus effect of adaptive behaviour in adult DS, considering potential confounding factors such as parental education. Methods: All consecutive DS individuals from three different sites were queried prospectively regarding type of schooling (inclusive and non-inclusive). Demographic data were documented; cognitive abilities and adaptive behaviour were assessed (Coloured Progressive Matrices and Vineland Adaptive Behaviour Scales). The aim was to establish the presence of a surplus effect in adaptive behaviour, primarily in the overall level and secondarily in the main domains and subdomains. A multivariable-adjusted logistic regression model was used for the association of schooling, and parental education. Results: The majority (65%) showed a surplus effect in adaptive behaviour and had attended inclusive schools (85%). Higher adaptive skills as well as early and longer functional treatment programmes were more readily available for younger individuals. In the group of inclusive schooling, the surplus effect on overall adaptive behaviour was present in 70% as opposed to 38% in the group without inclusive schooling, significant when adjusted for gender and maternal education. This was also observed in socialisation, written, and community, and after adjustment in playing and leisure time. Conclusions: Adaptive behaviour showed a surplus effect in the majority of DS adults, even more so after inclusive schooling. Younger adults showed higher adaptive skills. Moreover, female gender and higher maternal educational level significantly enhanced this surplus effect.</p>

	<p>A proportion of young people with Down syndrome (DS) experience unexplained regression that severely impacts on their daily lives. While this condition has been recognised by clinicians, there is a limited understanding of causation and an inconsistent approach to diagnosis and treatment. Varied symptomology and little knowledge of the cause of this regression have impacted on clinician’s ability to prevent or manage this condition. The purpose of this review was to examine the current evidence surrounding unexplained regression in adolescents and young adults, and to establish patterns that may be of use to clinicians, as well as raising awareness of this condition. Four areas were specifically reviewed, (1) terminology used to refer to this condition, (2) the symptoms reported, (3) potential trigger events and, (4) treatments and prognosis. A variety of terminology is used for this condition, which has constrained past attempts to identify patterns. An extensive number of symptoms were reported, however sleep impairment, loss of language and distinct changes in personality and behaviour, such as disinterest and withdrawal, were among the most frequently seen. Life events that were tentatively associated with the onset of a regressive period included a significant change in environmental circumstances or a transition, such as moving home or leaving school. Prognosis for this condition is relatively positive with the majority of individuals making at least a partial recovery. However, few patients were found to make a full recovery to their previous level of functioning and serious adverse effects could persist in those who have made a partial recovery. This is an under-researched condition with significant impacts on people with DS and their families. There are no established treatments for this condition and there is relatively little recognition in the research community. Further studies that focus on the prevention and treatment of this condition with controlled treatment trials are needed.</p>

	<p>Consistent evidence suggests that motor imagery involves the activation of several sensorimotor areas also involved during action execution, including the dorsal premotor cortex (dPMC) and the primary somatosensory cortex (S1). However, it is still unclear whether their involvement is specific for either kinesthetic or visual imagery or whether they contribute to motor activation for both modalities. Although sensorial experience during motor imagery is often multimodal, identifying the modality exerting greater facilitation of the motor system may allow optimizing the functional outcomes of rehabilitation interventions. In a sample of healthy adults, we combined 1 Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to suppress neural activity of the dPMC, S1, and primary motor cortex (M1) with single-pulse TMS over M1 for measuring cortico-spinal excitability (CSE) during kinesthetic and visual motor imagery of finger movements as compared to static imagery conditions. We found that rTMS over both dPMC and S1, but not over M1, modulates the muscle-specific facilitation of CSE during kinesthetic but not during visual motor imagery. Furthermore, dPMC rTMS suppressed the facilitation of CSE, whereas S1 rTMS boosted it. The results highlight the differential pattern of cortico-cortical connectivity within the sensorimotor system during the mental simulation of the kinesthetic and visual consequences of actions.</p>

	<p>The Early Start Denver Model (ESDM) is an evidence-based early intervention model for young children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). It is crucial to investigate the feasibility of the ESDM in community settings in contexts that are culturally different from American universities in which the model was originally developed. The aim was to further evaluate the effectiveness of the ESDM delivered within the Italian community setting at low intensity. We compared a group aged 19 to 43 months receiving the ESDM for 2 h per week over the course of 1 year with a concurrent, comparable, non-randomized control group receiving treatment as usual (TAU). Children were evaluated at baseline (T0) and after 6 months (T1) and 12 months (T2) of intervention. Feasibility was evaluated by parent and therapist questionnaires, retention rate, and therapist treatment fidelity. Both groups made similar gains in cognition and language abilities. The ESDM group made larger improvement in domains measured by the ESDM Curriculum Checklist, including communication, social skills, and maladaptive behaviors. Feasibility seemed well supported by retentions, therapists and parent satisfaction, and treatment fidelity. Our study further supports the feasibility of the ESDM implemented within the Italian public health system and suggests a better response in the ESDM-treated group than in the control group.</p>

	<p>Face processing relies on a network of occipito-temporal and frontal brain regions. Temporal regions are heavily involved in looking at and processing emotional faces; however, the contribution of each hemisphere to this process remains under debate. Semantic dementia (SD) is a rare neurodegenerative brain condition characterized by anterior temporal lobe atrophy, which is either predominantly left- (left-SD) or right-lateralised (right-SD). This syndrome therefore provides a unique lesion model to understand the role of laterality in emotional face processing. Here, we investigated facial scanning patterns in 10 left-SD and 6 right-SD patients, compared to 22 healthy controls. Eye tracking was recorded via a remote EyeLink 1000 system, while participants passively viewed fearful, happy, and neutral faces over 72 trials. Analyses revealed that right-SD patients had more fixations to the eyes than controls in the Fear (p = 0.04) condition only. Right-SD patients also showed more fixations to the eyes than left-SD patients in all conditions: Fear (p = 0.01), Happy (p = 0.008), and Neutral (p = 0.04). In contrast, no differences between controls and left-SD patients were observed for any emotion. No group differences were observed for fixations to the mouth, or the whole face. This study is the first to examine patterns of facial scanning in left- versus right- SD, demonstrating more of a focus on the eyes in right-SD. Neuroimaging analyses showed that degradation of the right superior temporal sulcus was associated with increased fixations to the eyes. Together these results suggest that right lateralised brain regions of the face processing network are involved in the ability to efficiently utilise changeable cues from the face.</p>

	<p>Background: During routine diagnosis of brain death, changes in pupil diameter in response to the stimulation of peripheral nerves are sometimes observed. For example, pupillary dilation after diagnosed brain death is described in the literature as the ciliospinal reflex. However, pupil constriction creates diagnostic doubts. Objective: The pupillometric analysis of pupil response to stimulation of the cervicothoracic spinal cord in patients with diagnosed brain death. Methods: Instrumental tests to confirm the arrest of cerebral circulation were performed in 30 adult subjects (mean age 53.5 years, range 26–75 years) with diagnosed brain death. In addition, a pupillometer was used to measure the change in pupil diameter in response to neck flexion. Intervention: Flexion of the neck and measuring the response in change of the pupil with the use of the pupillometer. Results: The change in the pupil was observed in the examined group of patients. Difference in pupil size ≥ 0.2 mm was observed in 14 cases (46%). In five cases (17%), pupil constriction was found (from 0.2 to 0.7 mm). Measurement error was +/− 0.1 mm. Conclusions: Both pupillary constriction and dilatation may occur due to a ciliospinal reflex in patients with brain death. This phenomenon needs further research in order to establish its pathophysiology.</p>

	<p>Recent studies have shown that motor recovery following spinal cord injury (SCI) is task-specific. However, most consequential conclusions about locomotor functional recovery from SCI have been derived from quadrupedal locomotion paradigms. In this study, two monkeys were trained to perform a bipedal walking task, mimicking human walking, before and after T8 spinal cord hemisection. Importantly, there is no pharmacological therapy with nerve growth factor for monkeys after SCI; thus, in this study, the changes that occurred in the brain were spontaneous. The impairment of locomotion on the ipsilateral side was more severe than that on the contralateral side. We used information theory to analyze single-cell activity from the left primary motor cortex (M1), and results show that neuronal populations in the unilateral primary motor cortex gradually conveyed more information about the bilateral hindlimb muscle activities during the training of bipedal walking after SCI. We further demonstrated that, after SCI, progressively expanded information from the neuronal population reconstructed more accurate control of muscle activity. These results suggest that, after SCI, the unilateral primary motor cortex could gradually regain control of bilateral coordination and motor recovery and in turn enhance the performance of brain–machine interfaces.</p>

	<p>This study evaluates the modulation of phasic pain and empathy for pain induced by placebo analgesia during pain and empathy for pain tasks. Because pain can be conceptualized as a dangerous stimulus that generates avoidance, we evaluated how approach and avoidance personality traits modulate pain and empathy for pain responses. We induced placebo analgesia to test whether this also reduces self-pain and other pain. Amplitude measures of the N1, P2, and P3 ERPs components, elicited by electric stimulations, were obtained during a painful control, as well as during a placebo treatment expected to induce placebo analgesia. The placebo treatment produced a reduction in pain and unpleasantness perceived, whereas we observed a decrease in the empathy unpleasantness alone during the empathy pain condition. The moderator effects of the fight-flight-freeze system (FFFS) in the relationships linking P2 and P3 amplitude changes with pain reduction were both significant among low to moderate FFFS values. These observations are consistent with the idea that lower FFFS (active avoidance) scores can predict placebo-induced pain reduction. Finally, in line with the revised Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory (r-RST), we can assume that phasic pain is an aversive stimulus activating the active-avoidance behavior to bring the system back to homeostasis.</p>

	<p>Preoperative language mapping with navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) is currently based on the disruption of performance during object naming. The resulting cortical language maps, however, lack accuracy when compared to intraoperative mapping. The question arises whether nTMS results can be improved, when another language task is considered, involving verb retrieval in sentence context. Twenty healthy German speakers were tested with object naming and a novel action naming task during nTMS language mapping. Error rates and categories in both hemispheres were compared. Action naming showed a significantly higher error rate than object naming in both hemispheres. Error category comparison revealed that this discrepancy stems from more lexico-semantic errors during action naming, indicating lexico-semantic retrieval of the verb being more affected than noun retrieval. In an area-wise comparison, higher error rates surfaced in multiple right-hemisphere areas, but only trends in the left ventral postcentral gyrus and middle superior temporal gyrus. Hesitation errors contributed significantly to the error count, but did not dull the mapping results. Inclusion of action naming coupled with a detailed error analysis may be favorable for nTMS mapping and ultimately improve accuracy in preoperative planning. Moreover, the results stress the recruitment of both left- and right-hemispheric areas during naming.</p>

	<p>We evaluated the outcome of a community-based early intervention and habilitation for children with cerebral palsy (CP) in Bangladesh. Children registered on the Bangladesh CP Register (BCPR) were recruited in two groups for this study: Group A received a comprehensive six-month long community-based caregiver-led intervention program at the “Shishu Shorgo” (Bengali title, which translates to ‘Children’s Heaven’) Early Intervention and Rehabilitation Centres developed to support participants from the BCPR. Group B received standard care. A quasi-experimental study was conducted. Data were obtained at baseline, at the end of the program (i.e., 6 months), and at a 12-month follow-up. Outcome measures for children included gross motor functional measure (GMFM-66), Communication Function Classification System (CFCS), and Viking Speech Scale (VSS) and, for adult caregivers, the depression, anxiety, and stress scale (DASS 21). Between October 2016 and March 2017, 156 children with CP were recruited (77 in Group A and 79 in Group B). The total score of GMFM-66, CFCS level, and VSS level significantly improved statistically in Group A (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05 for all) and deteriorated in Group B (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001, p = 0.095, p = 0.232). The intervention showed promising outcomes particularly for children with CP under five years of age. There is a need for caregiver-led community-based programs for children with CP in LMICs.</p>

                Ecologists are still puzzled by the diverse population dynamics of herbivorous small mammals that range from high-amplitude, multiannual cycles to stable dynamics. Theory predicts that this diversity results from combinations of climatic seasonality, weather stochasticity, and density-dependent food web interactions.

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Phase Gradients and Anisotropy of the Suprachiasmatic Network: Discovery of Phaseoids</a></h4>

              
                <p>Biological neural networks operate at several levels of granularity, from the individual neuron to local neural circuits to networks of thousands of cells. The daily oscillation of the brain&rsquo;s master clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) rests on a yet to be identified network of connectivity among its ~20,000 neurons. The SCN provides an accessible model to explore neural organization at several levels of organization. To relate cellular to local and global network behaviors, we explore network topology by examining SCN slices in three orientations using immunochemistry, light and confocal microscopy, real-time imaging, and mathematical modeling. Importantly, the results reveal small local groupings of neurons that form intermediate structures, here termed "phaseoids," which can be identified through stable local phase differences of varying magnitude among neighboring cells. These local differences in phase are distinct from the global phase relationship, namely that between individual cells and the mean oscillation of the overall SCN. The magnitude of the phaseoids&rsquo; local phase differences is associated with a global phase gradient observed in the SCN&rsquo;s rostral-caudal extent. Modeling results show that a gradient in connectivity strength can explain the observed gradient of phaseoid strength, an extremely parsimonious explanation for the heterogeneous oscillatory structure of the SCN.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Prenatal exposure to Zika virus (ZIKV) can result in microencephaly and congenital Zika syndrome, although some brain cells and structures are spared by the virus for unknown reasons. Here, a novel murine model of fetal ZIKV infection incorporating intraventricular infection and cell type-specific <I>in utero</I> electroporation (IUE) was used to identify the time course of ZIKV infection and to determine the identity of cells that are initially infected or spared during neocortical neurogenesis. <I>In vivo</I> time course studies revealed the presence of ZIKV in apical radial glial cells (aRGCs) at early time points following virus exposure, while basal intermediate progenitor cells (bIPCs) became maximally (ZIKV<sup>+</sup>) after 3 d of virus exposure. ZIKV-infected fetal brains exhibited microencephaly as early as 1 d following infection, regardless of developmental age. This change in brain size was caused in part by apoptosis and reduced proliferation that persisted until birth. While 60% of aRGC basal fibers were perturbed during infection, 40% retained normal morphology, indicating that aRGCs are not uniformly vulnerable to ZIKV infection. To investigate this heterogeneous vulnerability, we performed genetic fate mapping using cell type-specific probes derived from a mouse embryonic day (E)15.5 neocortical wall single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) dataset. The results indicate that one class of aRGCs preferentially express the putative ZIKV entry receptor <I>AXL</I> and that these cells are more vulnerable to ZIKV infection than other aRGC subtypes with low <I>AXL</I> expression. Together, these data uncover crucial temporal and cellular details of ZIKV fetal brain infection for prevention strategies and for management of congenital Zika syndrome.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Behavioral flexibility enables the ability to adaptively respond to changes in contingency requirements to maintain access to desired outcomes, and deficits in behavioral flexibility have been documented in many psychiatric disorders. Previous research has shown a correlation between behavioral flexibility measured in a reversal learning test and <I>Syn3</I>, the gene encoding synapsin III, which negatively regulates phasic dopamine release. <I>Syn3</I> expression in the hippocampus, striatum, and neocortex is reported to be negatively correlated with reversal learning performance, so here, we used a global knock-out line to investigate reversal learning in mice homozygous wild type, heterozygous null, and homozygous null for the <I>Syn3</I> gene. Compared with wild-type animals, we found a reversal-specific effect of genetic <I>Syn3</I> deficiency that resulted in a greater proportional increase in trials required to reach a preset performance criterion during contingency reversal, despite no observed genotype effects on the ability to acquire the initial discrimination. Behavioral flexibility scores, which quantified the likelihood of switching subsequent choice behavior following positive or negative feedback, became significantly more negative in reversal only for <I>Syn3</I> homozygous-null mice, suggesting a substantial increase in perseverative behavior in the reversal phase. <I>Syn3</I> ablation reduced the number of anticipatory responses made per trial, often interpreted as a measure of waiting impulsivity. Overall, <I>Syn3</I> expression negatively affected behavioral flexibility in a reversal-specific manner but may have reduced waiting impulsivity.</p>
