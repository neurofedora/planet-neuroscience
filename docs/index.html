	<p>The attentional response to eye-gaze stimuli is still largely unexplored in individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Here, we focused on an attentional phenomenon according to which a direct-gaze face can hold attention in a perceiver. Individuals with OCD and a group of matched healthy controls were asked to discriminate, through a speeded manual response, a peripheral target. Meanwhile, a task-irrelevant face displaying either direct gaze (in the eye-contact condition) or averted gaze (in the no-eye-contact condition) was also presented at the centre of the screen. Overall, the latencies were slower for faces with direct gaze than for faces with averted gaze; however, this difference was reliable in the healthy control group but not in the OCD group. This suggests the presence of an unusual attentional response to direct gaze in this clinical population.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) contains the largest population of serotonin (5-HT) neurons in the central nervous system. 5-HT, synthesized via tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (Tph2), is a widely functioning neuromodulator implicated in fear learning. Here, we sought to investigate whether DRN 5-HT is necessary to reduce fear via negative prediction error (&ndash;PE). Using male and female TPH2-cre rats, DRN<sup>tph2+</sup> cells were selectively deleted via cre-caspase (rAAV5-Flex-taCasp3-TEVp) in experiment 1. Rats then underwent fear discrimination during which three cues were associated with unique foot shock probabilities: safety <I>p</I> = 0.00, uncertainty <I>p</I> = 0.375, and danger <I>p</I> = 1.00. Rats then received selective extinction to the uncertainty cue, a behavioral manipulation designed to probe &ndash;PE. Deleting DRN<sup>tph2+</sup> cells had no impact on initial discrimination but slowed selective extinction. In experiment 2, we used a within-subjects optogenetic inhibition design to causally implicate DRN<sup>tph2+</sup> cells in prediction error signaling. Male and female TPH2-cre rats received intra-DRN infusions of cre-dependent halorhodopsin (rAAV5-Ef1a-DIO-eNpHR3.0-eYFP) or cre-YFP. DRN<sup>tph2+</sup> cells were inhibited specifically during the time of prediction error or a control period. Illumination during either positive prediction error (+PE) or control periods had no impact on fear to the uncertainty cue. Inhibition of DRN<sup>tph2+</sup> cells at the time of &ndash;PE did not impact immediate fear, but facilitated selective extinction in postillumination sessions. Together, these results demonstrate a role for DRN<sup>tph2+</sup> cells in using, but not generating, &ndash;PE to weaken cue-shock associations.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Kv3 Channels Contribute to the Excitability of Subpopulations of Spinal Cord Neurons in Lamina VII</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Autonomic parasympathetic preganglionic neurons (PGNs) drive contraction of the bladder during micturition but remain quiescent during bladder filling. This quiescence is postulated to be because of recurrent inhibition of PGN by fast-firing adjoining interneurons. Here, we defined four distinct neuronal types within Lamina VII, where PGN are situated, by combining whole cell patch clamp recordings with k-means clustering of a range of electrophysiological parameters. Additional morphologic analysis separated these neuronal classes into parasympathetic preganglionic populations (PGN) and a fast-firing interneuronal population. Kv3 channels are voltage-gated potassium channels (Kv) that allow fast and precise firing of neurons. We found that blockade of Kv3 channels by tetraethylammonium (TEA) reduced neuronal firing frequency and isolated high-voltage-activated Kv currents in the fast-firing population but had no effect in PGN populations. Furthermore, Kv3 blockade potentiated the local and descending inhibitory inputs to PGN indicating that Kv3-expressing inhibitory neurons are synaptically connected to PGN. Taken together, our data reveal that Kv3 channels are crucial for fast and regulated neuronal output of a defined population that may be involved in intrinsic spinal bladder circuits that underpin recurrent inhibition of PGN.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Characteristics of back pain in young adults and their relationship with dehydration: a cross sectional study [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Low back pain (LBP) is one of the major factors impairing the quality of life and is the most frequent cause of disability. Inadequate water intake is believed to be the predisposing factor for LBP particularly in the younger population. It is commonly seen that the incidence of LBP has been on the rise in people between 20-40 years of age. Thus, the basic aim of this study is to find a potential relationship between dehydration and LBP among young adults. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted from medical students and practicing doctors of 21-39 years from March-May 2019. Characteristics of pain along with the daily activities of patients were assessed. The severity was assessed by using the Graded Chronic pain scale (GCPS). Results: Out of a total of 426 participants, 84.74% had LBP. Of these, 44.3% complained of having it more than once a week, with a duration usually between 1-7 days. More than half of the patients had their routines disturbed because of this pain. Most of the participants complained of an episodic increase in summers. The majority (75.9%, n=274) drank 5-9 glasses of water a day, 64.5% of them were of opinion that their daily water consumption was enough, while 61.5% felt an association between dehydration and LBP. According to the GCPS, one-third of the population had chronic pain of grade I, and the other third had grade IV. Conclusions: It can be concluded that with the increase in the pace of life, many of the young adults have a reduced intake of water, and due to a probable relationship between LBP and dehydration, this might be a reason for the increasing propensity of LBP in them. There is a need for further work in this regard.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Impact of antiretroviral therapy regimens adherence on perceived health and wellbeing status among adults living with HIV in Ghana [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Introduction The efficacy of antiretroviral medicines to improve health outcomes and wellbeing depends largely on how soon they are prescribed and how PLHIV adhere to their prescribed regimens. The objectives of this cross-sectional study were to examine adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and to assess perceived health and wellbeing among people living with HIV(PLHIV) in two regions in Ghana.  Methods Quantitative data were collected from 301 PLHIV at three HIV clinics in Volta and Oti regions in Ghana using descriptive cross-sectional study design. Data collected included sociodemographic characteristics, ART initiation and adherence, and perception of health and wellbeing and analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20. Demographic and categorical variables were analyzed using descriptive statistics while Chi-squared analyses and binary logistics regression were used to determine variables that correlated with adherence to ART regimen. A Mann–Whitney U-test was used to measure differences in perception of health and wellbeing between male and female participants. Results 80% initiated ART within a month following diagnosis and 97.3% reported adhering to their ART regimens consistently. A Pearson χ2 revealed that the availability of alternatives to the current ART medications showed a significant association with ART adherence (χ2 =12.078, p= 0.002). 90% reported improvement in their health and personal wellbeing. High ART adherence and positive perceived health and wellbeing were found. Conclusion Regular supply of ART and investment in LA-ART to ensure more effective, efficient, and stress-free adherence to ART for PLHIV regardless of their residence in the country.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Phylogenetic inference of changes in amino acid propensities with single-position resolution</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Galya V. Klink, Olga V. Kalinina, Georgii A. Bazykin</p>

Fitness conferred by the same allele may differ between genotypes and environments, and these differences shape variation and evolution. Changes in amino acid propensities at protein sites over the course of evolution have been inferred from sequence alignments statistically, but the existing methods are data-intensive and aggregate multiple sites. Here, we develop an approach to detect individual amino acids that confer different fitness in different groups of species from combined sequence and phylogenetic data. Using the fact that the probability of a substitution to an amino acid depends on its fitness, our method looks for amino acids such that substitutions to them occur more frequently in one group of lineages than in another. We validate our method using simulated evolution of a protein site under different scenarios and show that it has high specificity for a wide range of assumptions regarding the underlying changes in selection, while its sensitivity differs between scenarios. We apply our method to the <i>env</i> gene of two HIV-1 subtypes, A and B, and to the HA gene of two influenza A subtypes, H1 and H3, and show that the inferred fitness changes are consistent with the fitness differences observed in deep mutational scanning experiments. We find that changes in relative fitness of different amino acid variants within a site do not always trigger episodes of positive selection and therefore may not result in an overall increase in the frequency of substitutions, but can still be detected from changes in relative frequencies of different substitutions.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Specificity of Loxosceles α clade phospholipase D enzymes for choline-containing lipids: Role of a conserved aromatic cage</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Emmanuel E. Moutoussamy, Qaiser Waheed, Greta J. Binford, Hanif M. Khan, Shane M. Moran, Anna R. Eitel, Matthew H. J. Cordes, Nathalie Reuter</p>

Spider venom GDPD-like phospholipases D (<i>SicTox</i>) have been identified to be one of the major toxins in recluse spider venom. They are divided into two major clades: the α clade and the β clade. Most α clade toxins present high activity against lipids with choline head groups such as sphingomyelin, while activities in β clade toxins vary and include preference for substrates containing ethanolamine headgroups (<i>Sicarius terrosus</i>, St_βIB1). A structural comparison of available structures of phospholipases D (PLDs) reveals a conserved aromatic cage in the α clade. To test the potential influence of the aromatic cage on membrane-lipid specificity we performed molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations of the binding of several PLDs onto lipid bilayers containing choline headgroups; two <i>SicTox</i> from the α clade, <i>Loxosceles intermedia</i> αIA1 (Li_αIA) and <i>Loxosceles laeta</i> αIII1 (Ll_αIII1), and one from the β clade, St_βIB1. The simulation results reveal that the aromatic cage captures a choline-headgroup and suggest that the cage plays a major role in lipid specificity. We also simulated an engineered St_βIB1, where we introduced the aromatic cage, and this led to binding with choline-containing lipids. Moreover, a multiple sequence alignment revealed the conservation of the aromatic cage among the α clade PLDs. Here, we confirmed that the i-face of α and β clade PLDs is involved in their binding to choline and ethanolamine-containing bilayers, respectively. Furthermore, our results suggest a major role in choline lipid recognition of the aromatic cage of the α clade PLDs. The MD simulation results are supported by <i>in vitro</i> liposome binding assay experiments.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Quantitative modeling identifies critical cell mechanics driving bile duct lumen formation</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Paul Van Liedekerke, Lila Gannoun, Axelle Loriot, Tim Johann, Frédéric P. Lemaigre, Dirk Drasdo</p>

Biliary ducts collect bile from liver lobules, the smallest functional and anatomical units of liver, and carry it to the gallbladder. Disruptions in this process caused by defective embryonic development, or through ductal reaction in liver disease have a major impact on life quality and survival of patients. A deep understanding of the processes underlying bile duct lumen formation is crucial to identify intervention points to avoid or treat the appearance of defective bile ducts. Several hypotheses have been proposed to characterize the biophysical mechanisms driving initial bile duct lumen formation during embryogenesis. Here, guided by the quantification of morphological features and expression of genes in bile ducts from embryonic mouse liver, we sharpened these hypotheses and collected data to develop a high resolution individual cell-based computational model that enables to test alternative hypotheses in silico. This model permits realistic simulations of tissue and cell mechanics at sub-cellular scale. Our simulations suggest that successful bile duct lumen formation requires a simultaneous contribution of directed cell division of cholangiocytes, local osmotic effects generated by salt excretion in the lumen, and temporally-controlled differentiation of hepatoblasts to cholangiocytes, with apical constriction of cholangiocytes only moderately affecting luminal size.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">The correlation between cell and nucleus size is explained by an eukaryotic cell growth model</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yufei Wu, Adrian F. Pegoraro, David A. Weitz, Paul Janmey, Sean X. Sun</p>

In eukaryotes, the cell volume is observed to be strongly correlated with the nuclear volume. The slope of this correlation depends on the cell type, growth condition, and the physical environment of the cell. We develop a computational model of cell growth and proteome increase, incorporating the kinetics of amino acid import, protein/ribosome synthesis and degradation, and active transport of proteins between the cytoplasm and the nucleoplasm. We also include a simple model of ribosome biogenesis and assembly. Results show that the cell volume is tightly correlated with the nuclear volume, and the cytoplasm-nucleoplasm transport rates strongly influence the cell growth rate as well as the cell/nucleus volume ratio (C/N ratio). Ribosome assembly and the ratio of ribosomal proteins to mature ribosomes also influence the cell volume and the cell growth rate. We find that in order to regulate the cell growth rate and the cell/nucleus volume ratio, the cell must optimally control groups of kinetic and transport parameters together, which could explain the quantitative roles of canonical growth pathways. Finally, although not explicitly demonstrated in this work, we point out that it is possible to construct a detailed proteome distribution using our model and RNAseq data, provided that a quantitative cell division mechanism is known.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Towards the prediction of non-peptidic epitopes</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Paul F. Zierep, Randi Vita, Nina Blazeska, Aurélien F. A. Moumbock, Jason A. Greenbaum, Bjoern Peters, Stefan Günther</p>

In-silico methods for the prediction of epitopes can support and improve workflows for vaccine design, antibody production, and disease therapy. So far, the scope of B cell and T cell epitope prediction has been directed exclusively towards peptidic antigens. Nevertheless, various non-peptidic molecular classes can be recognized by immune cells. These compounds have not been systematically studied yet, and prediction approaches are lacking. The ability to predict the epitope activity of non-peptidic compounds could have vast implications; for example, for immunogenic risk assessment of the vast number of drugs and other xenobiotics. Here we present the first general attempt to predict the epitope activity of non-peptidic compounds using the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) as a source for positive samples. The molecules stored in the Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (ChEBI) database were chosen as background samples. The molecules were clustered into eight homogeneous molecular groups, and classifiers were built for each cluster with the aim of separating the epitopes from the background. Different molecular feature encoding schemes and machine learning models were compared against each other. For those models where a high performance could be achieved based on simple decision rules, the molecular features were then further investigated. Additionally, the findings were used to build a web server that allows for the immunogenic investigation of non-peptidic molecules (http://tools-staging.iedb.org/np_epitope_predictor). The prediction quality was tested with samples from independent evaluation datasets, and the implemented method received noteworthy Receiver Operating Characteristic-Area Under Curve (ROC-AUC) values, ranging from 0.69–0.96 depending on the molecule cluster.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">The endoplasmic reticulum proteostasis network profoundly shapes the protein sequence space accessible to HIV envelope</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jimin Yoon, Emmanuel E. Nekongo, Jessica E. Patrick, Tiffani Hui, Angela M. Phillips, Anna I. Ponomarenko, Samuel J. Hendel, Rebecca M. Sebastian, Yu Meng Zhang, Vincent L. Butty, C. Brandon Ogbunugafor, Yu-Shan Lin, Matthew D. Shoulders</p>

The sequence space accessible to evolving proteins can be enhanced by cellular chaperones that assist biophysically defective clients in navigating complex folding landscapes. It is also possible, at least in theory, for proteostasis mechanisms that promote strict quality control to greatly constrain accessible protein sequence space. Unfortunately, most efforts to understand how proteostasis mechanisms influence evolution rely on artificial inhibition or genetic knockdown of specific chaperones. The few experiments that perturb quality control pathways also generally modulate the levels of only individual quality control factors. Here, we use chemical genetic strategies to tune proteostasis networks via natural stress response pathways that regulate the levels of entire suites of chaperones and quality control mechanisms. Specifically, we upregulate the unfolded protein response (UPR) to test the hypothesis that the host endoplasmic reticulum (ER) proteostasis network shapes the sequence space accessible to human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) envelope (Env) protein. Elucidating factors that enhance or constrain Env sequence space is critical because Env evolves extremely rapidly, yielding HIV strains with antibody- and drug-escape mutations. We find that UPR-mediated upregulation of ER proteostasis factors, particularly those controlled by the IRE1-XBP1s UPR arm, globally reduces Env mutational tolerance. Conserved, functionally important Env regions exhibit the largest decreases in mutational tolerance upon XBP1s induction. Our data indicate that this phenomenon likely reflects strict quality control endowed by XBP1s-mediated remodeling of the ER proteostasis environment. Intriguingly, and in contrast, specific regions of Env, including regions targeted by broadly neutralizing antibodies, display enhanced mutational tolerance when XBP1s is induced, hinting at a role for host proteostasis network hijacking in potentiating antibody escape. These observations reveal a key function for proteostasis networks in decreasing instead of expanding the sequence space accessible to client proteins, while also demonstrating that the host ER proteostasis network profoundly shapes the mutational tolerance of Env in ways that could have important consequences for HIV adaptation.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Analysis of 567,758 randomized controlled trials published over 30 years reveals trends in phrases used to discuss results that do not reach statistical significance</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Willem M. Otte, Christiaan H. Vinkers, Philippe C. Habets, David G. P. van IJzendoorn, Joeri K. Tijdink</p>

The power of language to modify the reader’s perception of interpreting biomedical results cannot be underestimated. Misreporting and misinterpretation are pressing problems in randomized controlled trials (RCT) output. This may be partially related to the statistical significance paradigm used in clinical trials centered around a <i>P</i> value below 0.05 cutoff. Strict use of this <i>P</i> value may lead to strategies of clinical researchers to describe their clinical results with <i>P</i> values approaching but not reaching the threshold to be “almost significant.” The question is how phrases expressing nonsignificant results have been reported in RCTs over the past 30 years. To this end, we conducted a quantitative analysis of English full texts containing 567,758 RCTs recorded in PubMed between 1990 and 2020 (81.5% of all published RCTs in PubMed). We determined the exact presence of 505 predefined phrases denoting results that approach but do not cross the line of formal statistical significance (<i>P</i> < 0.05). We modeled temporal trends in phrase data with Bayesian linear regression. Evidence for temporal change was obtained through Bayes factor (BF) analysis. In a randomly sampled subset, the associated <i>P</i> values were manually extracted. We identified 61,741 phrases in 49,134 RCTs indicating almost significant results (8.65%; 95% confidence interval (CI): 8.58% to 8.73%). The overall prevalence of these phrases remained stable over time, with the most prevalent phrases being “marginally significant” (in 7,735 RCTs), “all but significant” (7,015), “a nonsignificant trend” (3,442), “failed to reach statistical significance” (2,578), and “a strong trend” (1,700). The strongest evidence for an increased temporal prevalence was found for “a numerical trend,” “a positive trend,” “an increasing trend,” and “nominally significant.” In contrast, the phrases “all but significant,” “approaches statistical significance,” “did not quite reach statistical significance,” “difference was apparent,” “failed to reach statistical significance,” and “not quite significant” decreased over time. In a random sampled subset of 29,000 phrases, the manually identified and corresponding 11,926 <i>P</i> values, 68,1% ranged between 0.05 and 0.15 (CI: 67. to 69.0; median 0.06). Our results show that RCT reports regularly contain specific phrases describing marginally nonsignificant results to report <i>P</i> values close to but above the dominant 0.05 cutoff. The fact that the prevalence of the phrases remained stable over time indicates that this practice of broadly interpreting <i>P</i> values close to a predefined threshold remains prevalent. To enhance responsible and transparent interpretation of RCT results, researchers, clinicians, reviewers, and editors may reduce the focus on formal statistical significance thresholds and stimulate reporting of <i>P</i> values with corresponding effect sizes and CIs and focus on the clinical relevance of the statistical difference found in RCTs.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Identification of a novel cationic glycolipid in Streptococcus agalactiae that contributes to brain entry and meningitis</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Luke R. Joyce, Haider S. Manzer, Jéssica da C. Mendonça, Ricardo Villarreal, Prescilla E. Nagao, Kelly S. Doran, Kelli L. Palmer, Ziqiang Guan</p>

Bacterial membrane lipids are critical for membrane bilayer formation, cell division, protein localization, stress responses, and pathogenesis. Despite their critical roles, membrane lipids have not been fully elucidated for many pathogens. Here, we report the discovery of a novel cationic glycolipid, lysyl-glucosyl-diacylglycerol (Lys-Glc-DAG), which is synthesized in high abundance by the bacterium <i>Streptococcus agalactiae</i> (Group B <i>Streptococcus</i>, GBS). To our knowledge, Lys-Glc-DAG is more positively charged than any other known lipids. Lys-Glc-DAG carries 2 positive net charges per molecule, distinct from the widely described lysylated phospholipid lysyl-phosphatidylglycerol (Lys-PG) that carries one positive net charge due to the presence of a negatively charged phosphate moiety. We use normal phase liquid chromatography (NPLC) coupled with electrospray ionization (ESI) high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry (HRMS/MS) and genetic approaches to determine that Lys-Glc-DAG is synthesized by the enzyme MprF in GBS, which covalently modifies the neutral glycolipid Glc-DAG with the cationic amino acid lysine. GBS is a leading cause of neonatal meningitis, which requires traversal of the endothelial blood–brain barrier (BBB). We demonstrate that GBS strains lacking <i>mprF</i> exhibit a significant decrease in the ability to invade BBB endothelial cells. Further, mice challenged with a GBSoΔ<i>mprF</i> mutant developed bacteremia comparably to wild-type (WT) infected mice yet had less recovered bacteria from brain tissue and a lower incidence of meningitis. Thus, our data suggest that Lys-Glc-DAG may contribute to bacterial uptake into host cells and disease progression. Importantly, our discovery provides a platform for further study of cationic lipids at the host–pathogen interface.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">microRNA-142 guards against autoimmunity by controlling Treg cell homeostasis and function</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Wei-Le Wang, Ching Ouyang, Natalie M. Graham, Yuankun Zhang, Kaniel Cassady, Estefany Y. Reyes, Min Xiong, Alicia M. Davis, Kathie Tang, Defu Zeng, Mark P. Boldin</p>

Regulatory T (T<sub>reg</sub>) cells are critical in preventing aberrant immune responses. Posttranscriptional control of gene expression by microRNA (miRNA) has recently emerged as an essential genetic element for T<sub>reg</sub> cell function. Here, we report that mice with T<sub>reg</sub> cell–specific ablation of <i>miR-142</i> (hereafter <i>Foxp3</i><sup>Cre</sup><i>miR-142</i><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice) developed a fatal systemic autoimmune disorder due to a breakdown in peripheral T-cell tolerance. <i>Foxp3</i><sup>Cre</sup><i>miR-142</i><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice displayed a significant decrease in the abundance and suppressive capacity of T<sub>reg</sub> cells. Expression profiling of <i>miR-142</i>–deficient T<sub>reg</sub> cells revealed an up-regulation of multiple genes in the interferon gamma (IFNγ) signaling network. We identified several of these IFNγ-associated genes as direct miR-142-3p targets and observed excessive IFNγ production and signaling in <i>miR-142</i>–deficient T<sub>reg</sub> cells. <i>Ifng</i> ablation rescued the T<sub>reg</sub> cell homeostatic defect and alleviated development of autoimmunity in <i>Foxp3</i><sup>Cre</sup><i>miR-142</i><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice. Thus, our findings implicate <i>miR-142</i> as an indispensable regulator of T<sub>reg</sub> cell homeostasis that exerts its function by attenuating IFNγ responses.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Stacked deep analytic model for human activity recognition on a UCI HAR database [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Owing to low cost and ubiquity, human activity recognition using smartphones is emerging as a trendy mobile application in diverse appliances such as assisted living, healthcare monitoring, etc. Analysing this one-dimensional time-series signal is rather challenging due to its spatial and temporal variances. Numerous deep neural networks (DNNs) are conducted to unveil deep features of complex real-world data. However, the drawback of DNNs is the un-interpretation of the network's internal logic to achieve the output. Furthermore, a huge training sample size (i.e. millions of samples) is required to ensure great performance. Methods In this work, a simpler yet effective stacked deep network, known as Stacked Discriminant Feature Learning (SDFL), is proposed to analyse inertial motion data for activity recognition. Contrary to DNNs, this deep model extracts rich features without the prerequisite of a gigantic training sample set and tenuous hyper-parameter tuning. SDFL is a stacking deep network with multiple learning modules, appearing in a serialized layout for multi-level feature learning from shallow to deeper features. In each learning module, Rayleigh coefficient optimized learning is accomplished to extort discriminant features. A subject-independent protocol is implemented where the system model (trained by data from a group of users) is used to recognize data from another group of users. Results Empirical results demonstrate that SDFL surpasses state-of-the-art methods, including DNNs like Convolutional Neural Network, Deep Belief Network, etc., with ~97% accuracy from the UCI HAR database with thousands of training samples. Additionally, the model training time of SDFL is merely a few minutes, compared with DNNs, which require hours for model training. Conclusions The supremacy of SDFL is corroborated in analysing motion data for human activity recognition requiring no GPU but only a CPU with a fast- learning rate.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A novel method for measuring sublingual temperature using conventional non-contact forehead thermometer [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Sublingual temperature measurement is a quick and accurate representation of oral temperature and corresponds closely with core temperature. Sub-lingual temperature measurement using non-contact infrared thermometers has not been studied for this purpose and if accurate they would be a reliable and convenient way of recording temperature of a patient very quickly. The aim of the study was to evaluate the utility of recording sublingual temperature using an infrared non-contact thermometer and establish its accuracy by comparing the readings with tympanic thermometer recordings. Methods: This cross-sectional study was carried out in 29 patients (328 paired recordings from sublingual and tympanic sites simultaneously). Subjects were requested to keep their mouth closed for five minutes before recording the temperature. Sublingual recordings were performed for each patient at different times of the day using an infrared thermometer. The infrared thermometer was quickly brought 1cm away from the sublingual part of the tongue and the recordings were then done immediately. Readings were compared with the corresponding tympanic temperature. Results: The non-contact sublingual temperature correlated very closely with tympanic temperature (r=0.86, p<0.001). The mean difference between the infrared sublingual and tympanic temperature was 0.21°C (standard deviation [SD]:0.48°C, 95% confidence interval [CI] of 0.16-0.27). The intra-class correlation co-efficient (ICC) between core and sublingual temperatures was 0.830 (95% CI: 0.794 to 0.861) p<0.001. The sensitivity of sublingual IR (infrared) temperature of 37.65°C was 90% and specificity was 89% for core temperature >38°C. Conclusions: This innovative modification of using the forehead infrared thermometer to measure the sublingual temperature offers an accurate, rapid and non-contact estimation of core temperature.

                Background The aim of this study is to prospectively evaluate the new minimal invasive (MINE) browlift technique with possibly superior results and minimal visible scarring. Methods A prospective observational study will be performed on all available data from patients who will undergo a browlift procedure in the Haaglanden Medical Center from 1-6-2021 till 31-5-2022. Our goal is to include at least 50 patients (1 per week). Inclusion criteria are: patients with medical (i.e. brow-ptosis, facial paralysis) or cosmetic indication, patients with sufficient understanding of the Dutch or English language and willingness to participate in extra study specific follow-up moments and filling in of questionnaires. Exclusion criteria are: <18 years of age and patients with previous brow or eyelid surgery. Patients will be photographed pre- and postoperatively using the VECTRA camera. The database management software Castor will be used to store and collect the data from the questionnaire. The Medical Research Ethics Committee found this study not eligible to be submitted to the Dutch Medical Research Involving Human Subjects Acts (WMO). Written informed consent will be obtained from all patients. Results Outcomes measures to be evaluated include: scarring after procedure; functionality of eyebrow movement; amount of correction in brow ptosis, measured in VECTRA; longevity of procedure in months; aesthetic result as assessed by questionnaires; and adverse effects of the procedure.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Imaging net retrograde axonal transport in vivo: a physiological biomarker</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study is to develop a novel method for monitoring the integrity of motor neurons <i>in vivo</i> by quantifying net retrograde axonal transport.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The method uses single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) to quantify retrograde transport to spinal cord of tetanus toxin fragment C (<sup>125</sup>I-TTC) following intramuscular injection. We characterized the transport profiles in three transgenic mouse models carrying ALS-associated genes, aging mice, and SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> transgenic mice following CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing. Lastly, we studied the effect of prior immunization of tetanus toxoid on the transport profile of TTC.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>This technique defines a quantitative profile of net retrograde axonal transport of TTC in living mice. The profile is distinctly abnormal in transgenic SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice as young as 65 days (presymptomatic) and worsens with disease progression. Moreover, this method detects a distinct therapeutic benefit of gene editing in transgenic SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice well before other clinical parameters (e.g. grip strength) show improvement. Symptomatic transgenic PFN1<sup>C71G/C71G</sup> ALS mice display gross reductions in net retrograde axonal transport, which is also disturbed in asymptomatic mice harboring a human <i>C9ORF72</i> transgene with an expanded GGGGCC repeat motif. In wild-type mice, net retrograde axonal transport declines with aging. Lastly, prior immunization with tetanus toxoid does not preclude use of this assay.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This assay of net retrograde axonal transport has broad potential clinical applications and should be particularly valuable as a physiological biomarker that permits early detection of benefit from potential therapies for motor neuron diseases.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Genetic architecture of stroke of undetermined source: overlap with known stroke etiologies and associations with modifiable risk factors</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Ischemic stroke etiology remains undetermined in 30% of cases. We explored the genetic architecture of stroke classified as undetermined to test if mechanisms and risk factors underlying large-artery atherosclerotic (LAAS), cardioembolic (CES), and small-vessel stroke (SVS) contribute to its pathogenesis.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We analyzed genome-wide data from 16,851 ischemic stroke cases and 32,473 controls. Using polygenic risk scores for LAAS, CES, and SVS we assessed the genetic overlap with stroke of undetermined source and used pairwise GWAS to search for shared loci. We then applied Mendelian randomization (MR) to identify potentially causal risk factors of stroke of undetermined source.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Genetic risk for LAS, CES, and SVS was associated with stroke of undetermined source pointing to overlap in their genetic architecture. Pairwise analyses revealed 19 shared loci with LAAS, 2 with CES, and 5 with SVS that have been implicated in atherosclerosis-related phenotypes. Genetic liability to both carotid atherosclerosis and atrial fibrillation was associated with stroke of undetermined source, but the association with atrial fibrillation was attenuated after excluding cases with incomplete diagnostic workup. MR analyses showed effects of genetically determinants of blood pressure, diabetes, waist-to-hip ratio, inflammatory pathways (IL-6 signaling, MCP-1/CCL2 levels), and factor XI levels on stroke of undetermined source.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Stroke of undetermined source shares genetic and vascular risk factors with other stroke subtypes, especially LAAS, thus highlighting the diagnostic limitations of current subtyping approaches. The potentially causal associations with carotid atherosclerosis and atherosclerotic risk factors might have implications for prevention strategies targeting these mechanisms.</p>

<p>A total of 6,412 patients were enrolled from the CHANCE-2 (Clopidogrel with Aspirin in High-Risk Patients with Acute Non-disabling Cerebrovascular Events II) trial. The main outcome was any bleeding within 90 days defined by the criteria from GUSTO (Global Utilization of Streptokinase and Tissue Plasminogen Activator for Occluded Coronary Arteries).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 250 (3.9%) bleeding events were reported, which occurred mainly within the 21 days of dual antiplatelet therapy (200 cases, 3.1%). Minor bleeding of the skin bruises, epistaxis, and gum bleeding were most frequent. Multivariate analysis showed that treatment with ticagrelor-aspirin compared with clopidogrel-aspirin was associated with increased bleeding (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.21, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.68–2.89, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Current smoking was associated with a lower risk of bleeding (HR = 0.70, 95% CI = 0.52–0.95, <i>p</i> = 0.02). Additionally, ticagrelor-aspirin compared with clopidogrel-aspirin was associated with higher risk of bleeding in patients aged &lt;65 years (HR = 2.87, 95% CI = 1.95–4.22) and those without diabetes mellitus (HR = 2.65, 95% CI = 1.88–3.73; <i>p</i> for interaction = 0.04 and 0.03, respectively).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Bleeding events mostly occurred within the 21-day dual antiplatelet therapy stage and were generally mild. The risk of bleeding was greater in nonsmoking patients, and was associated with treatment with ticagrelor-aspirin compared with clopidogrel-aspirin, particularly in patients aged &lt;65 years and nondiabetic patients.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The purpose of this study was to describe cerebrovascular, neuropathic, and autonomic features of post-acute sequelae of coronavirus disease 2019 ((COVID-19) PASC).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This retrospective study evaluated consecutive patients with chronic fatigue, brain fog, and orthostatic intolerance consistent with PASC. Controls included patients with postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) and healthy participants. Analyzed data included surveys and autonomic (Valsalva maneuver, deep breathing, sudomotor, and tilt tests), cerebrovascular (cerebral blood flow velocity [CBFv] monitoring in middle cerebral artery), respiratory (capnography monitoring), and neuropathic (skin biopsies for assessment of small fiber neuropathy) testing and inflammatory/autoimmune markers.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Nine patients with PASC were evaluated 0.8 ± 0.3 years after a mild COVID-19 infection, and were treated as home observations. Autonomic, pain, brain fog, fatigue, and dyspnea surveys were abnormal in PASC and POTS (n = 10), compared with controls (n = 15). Tilt table test reproduced the majority of PASC symptoms. Orthostatic CBFv declined in PASC (−20.0 ± 13.4%) and POTS (−20.3 ± 15.1%), compared with controls (−3.0 ± 7.5%, <i>p</i> = 0.001) and was independent of end-tidal carbon dioxide in PASC, but caused by hyperventilation in POTS. Reduced orthostatic CBFv in PASC included both subjects without (n = 6) and with (n = 3) orthostatic tachycardia. Dysautonomia was frequent (100% in both PASC and POTS) but was milder in PASC (<i>p</i> = 0.002). PASC and POTS cohorts diverged in frequency of small fiber neuropathy (89% vs 60%) but not in inflammatory markers (67% vs 70%). Supine and orthostatic hypocapnia was observed in PASC.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>PASC following mild COVID-19 infection is associated with multisystem involvement including: (1) cerebrovascular dysregulation with persistent cerebral arteriolar vasoconstriction; (2) small fiber neuropathy and related dysautonomia; (3) respiratory dysregulation; and (4) chronic inflammation.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Reduction in Cognitive Processing Speed Surrounding Multiple Sclerosis Relapse</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The purpose of this study was to explore the longitudinal relationship between multiple sclerosis (MS) relapses and information processing efficiency among persons with relapsing–remitting MS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We conducted a Swedish nationwide cohort study of persons with incident relapsing–remitting MS (2001–2019). Relapse information and symbol digit modalities test (SDMT) scores were obtained from the Swedish MS Registry. Follow-up was categorized into 2 periods based on relapse status: “relapse” (90 days pre-relapse to 730 days post-relapse, subdivided into 10 periods) and “remission.” Linear mixed models compared SDMT scores during the relapse periods to SDMT scores recorded during remission (reference) with results reported as β-coefficients and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), adjusted for age, sex, SDMT type (written vs oral), time-varying, disease-modifying therapy exposure and sequence of SDMT.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Over a mean (SD) follow-up of 10.7 (4.3) years, 31,529 distinct SDMTs were recorded among 3,877 persons with MS. There was a significant decline in information processing efficiency that lasted from 30 days pre-relapse up to 550 days post-relapse, with the largest decline occurring 0 to 30 days post-relapse (β-coefficient: −4.00 (95% CI = −4.61 to −3.39), relative to the period of remission.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We found evidence of cognitive change up to 1 month prior to relapse onset. The reduction in SDMT lasted 1.5 years and was clinically significant up to 3 months post-relapse. These results suggest that the effects of a relapse on cognition are longer than previously thought and highlight the importance of reducing relapse rates as a potential means of preserving cognitive function.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study was undertaken to compare the rate of change in cognition between glucocerebrosidase (<i>GBA</i>) mutation carriers and noncarriers with and without subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) in Parkinson disease.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Clinical and genetic data from 12 datasets were examined. Global cognition was assessed using the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (MDRS). Subjects were examined for mutations in <i>GBA</i> and categorized as <i>GBA</i> carriers with or without DBS (<i>GBA</i>+DBS+, <i>GBA</i>+DBS-), and noncarriers with or without DBS (<i>GBA</i>-DBS+, <i>GBA</i>-DBS-). <i>GBA</i> mutation carriers were subcategorized according to mutation severity (risk variant, mild, severe). Linear mixed modeling was used to compare rate of change in MDRS scores over time among the groups according to <i>GBA</i> and DBS status and then according to <i>GBA</i> severity and DBS status.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Data were available for 366 subjects (58 <i>GBA</i>+DBS+, 82 <i>GBA</i>+DBS-, 98 <i>GBA</i>-DBS+, and 128 <i>GBA</i>-DBS- subjects), who were longitudinally followed (range = 36–60 months after surgery). Using the MDRS, <i>GBA</i>+DBS+ subjects declined on average 2.02 points/yr more than <i>GBA</i>-DBS- subjects (95% confidence interval [CI] = −2.35 to −1.69), 1.71 points/yr more than <i>GBA</i>+DBS- subjects (95% CI = −2.14 to −1.28), and 1.49 points/yr more than <i>GBA</i>-DBS+ subjects (95% CI = −1.80 to −1.18).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Although not randomized, this composite analysis suggests that the combined effects of <i>GBA</i> mutations and STN-DBS negatively impact cognition. We advise that DBS candidates be screened for <i>GBA</i> mutations as part of the presurgical decision-making process. We advise that <i>GBA</i> mutation carriers be counseled regarding potential risks associated with STN-DBS so that alternative options may be considered.

                <p>Since 2016, 3 innovative therapies for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) have changed the face of the disease. Although these therapies often result in remarkable improvements in infants and children, benefits in adults are modest and treatment is not curative. Concerns have been raised about the enormous costs of these medications, the ultimate burden to taxpayers, and the costs to society of withholding treatments and sacrificing or disadvantaging some individuals. Physicians are best positioned to serve our patients by carefully considering the costs, benefits, implications for quality of life (QOL), and the interplay of these factors within the framework of core ethical principles that guide clinical care.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study was undertaken to follow up predictive factors for α-synuclein–related neurodegenerative diseases in a multicenter cohort of idiopathic/isolated rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (iRBD).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Patients with iRBD from 12 centers underwent a detailed assessment for potential environmental and lifestyle risk factors via a standardized questionnaire at baseline. Patients were then prospectively followed and received assessments for parkinsonism or dementia during follow-up. The cumulative incidence of parkinsonism or dementia was estimated with competing risk analysis. Cox regression analyses were used to evaluate the predictive value of environmental/lifestyle factors over a follow-up period of 11 years, adjusting for age, sex, and center.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of 319 patients who were free of parkinsonism or dementia, 281 provided follow-up information. After a mean follow-up of 5.8 years, 130 (46.3%) patients developed neurodegenerative disease. The overall phenoconversion rate was 24.2% after 3 years, 44.8% after 6 years, and 67.5% after 10 years. Patients with older age (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 1.05) and nitrate derivative use (aHR = 2.18) were more likely to phenoconvert, whereas prior pesticide exposure (aHR = 0.21–0.64), rural living (aHR = 0.53), lipid-lowering medication use (aHR = 0.59), and respiratory medication use (aHR = 0.36) were associated with lower phenoconversion risk. Risk factors for those converting to primary dementia and parkinsonism were generally similar, with dementia-first converters having lower coffee intake and beta-blocker intake, and higher occurrence of family history of dementia.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings elucidate the predictive values of environmental factors and comorbid conditions in identifying RBD patients at higher risk of phenoconversion. ANN NEUROL 2022;91:404–416</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Cardiac arrest (CA) is a major health burden with brain damage being a significant contributor to mortality. We found lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), including a species containing docosahexaenoic acid (LPC-DHA), was significantly decreased in plasma post-CA, supplementation of which significantly improved neurological outcomes. The aim of this study is to understand the protective role of LPC-DHA supplementation on the brain post-CA.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We first evaluated associations between the plasma level of LPC-DHA and neurological injury and outcomes of human patients with CA. We then utilized a rat CA model and cell cultures to investigate therapeutic and mechanistic aspects of plasma LPC-DHA supplementation.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We found that decreased plasma LPC-DHA was strongly associated with neurological outcomes and disappearance of the difference between gray and white matter in the brain after CA in human patients. In rats, the decreased plasma LPC-DHA was associated with decreased levels of brain LPC-DHA after CA, and supplementing plasma LPC-DHA normalized brain levels of LPC-DHA and alleviated neuronal cell death, activation of astrocytes, and expression of various inflammatory and mitochondrial dynamics genes. We also observed deceased severity of metabolic alterations with LPC-DHA supplementation using untargeted metabolomics analysis. Furthermore, LPC treatment showed a similar protective effect for neurons and astrocytes in mixed primary brain cell cultures.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The observed neuroprotection accompanied with normalized brain LPC-DHA level by plasma supplementation implicate the importance of preventing the decrease of brain LPC-DHA post-CA for attenuating brain injury. Furthermore, the data supports the causative role of decreased plasma LPC-DHA for brain damage after CA. ANN NEUROL 2022;91:389–403</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Accumulating evidence from invasive cortical stimulation mapping and noninvasive neuroimaging studies indicates that brain function may be preserved within brain tumors. However, a noninvasive approach to accurately and comprehensively delineate individual-specific functional networks in the whole brain, especially in brain tissues within and surrounding tumors, is still lacking. The purpose of the study is to develop a clinically useful technique that can map functional regions within tumoral brains.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We developed an individual-specific functional network parcellation approach using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) that effectively captured functional networks within and nearby tumors in 20 patients. We examined the accuracy of the functional maps using invasive cortical stimulation and task response.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We found that approximately 33.2% of the tumoral mass appeared to be functionally active and demonstrated robust functional connectivity with non-tumoral brain regions. Functional networks nearby tumors were validated by invasive cortical stimulation mapping. Intratumoral sensorimotor networks mapped by our technique could be distinguished by their distinct cortico-cerebellar connectivity patterns and were consistent with hand movement evoked fMRI task activations. Furthermore, in some patients, cognitive networks that were detected in the tumor mass showed long-distance and distributed functional connectivity.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our noninvasive approach to mapping individual-specific functional networks using rsfMRI represents a promising new tool for identifying regions with preserved functional connectivity within and surrounding brain tumors, and could be used as a complement to presurgical planning for patients undergoing tumor resection surgery.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study aimed to elucidate the molecular features of inclusion body myositis (IBM).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed RNA sequencing analysis of muscle biopsy samples from 67 participants, consisting of 58 myositis patients with the pathological finding of CD8-positive T cells invading non-necrotic muscle fibers expressing major histocompatibility complex class I (43 IBM, 6 polymyositis, and 9 unclassifiable myositis), and 9 controls.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Cluster analysis, principal component analysis, and pathway analysis showed that differentially expressed genes and pathways identified in IBM and polymyositis were mostly comparable. However, pathways related to cell adhesion molecules were upregulated in IBM as compared with polymyositis and controls (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). Notably, <i>CDH1</i>, which encodes the epidermal cell junction protein cadherin 1, was overexpressed in the muscles of IBM, which was validated by another RNA sequencing dataset from previous publications. Western blotting confirmed the presence of mature cadherin 1 protein in the muscles of IBM. Immunohistochemical staining confirmed the positivity for anti-cadherin 1 antibody in the muscles of IBM, whereas there was no muscle fiber positive for anti-cadherin 1 antibody in immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy, antisynthetase syndrome, and controls. The fibers stained with anti-cadherin 1 antibody did not have rimmed vacuoles or abnormal protein accumulation. Experimental skeletal muscle regeneration and differentiation systems showed that <i>CDH1</i> is expressed during skeletal muscle regeneration and differentiation.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p><i>CDH1</i> was detected as a differentially expressed gene, and immunohistochemistry showed that cadherin 1 exists in the muscles of IBM, whereas it was rarely seen in those of other idiopathic inflammatory myopathies. Cadherin 1 upregulation in muscle could provide a valuable clue to the pathological mechanisms of IBM. ANN NEUROL 2022;91:317–328</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">B Cell Depletion and SARS‐CoV‐2 Vaccine Responses in Neuroimmunologic Patients</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The study was undertaken to assess the impact of B cell depletion on humoral and cellular immune responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccination in patients with various neuroimmunologic disorders on anti-CD20 therapy. This included an analysis of the T cell vaccine response to the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We investigated prospectively humoral and cellular responses to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination in 82 patients with neuroimmunologic disorders on anti-CD20 therapy and 82 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. For quantification of antibodies, the Elecsys anti-SARS-CoV-2 viral spike (S) immunoassay against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) was used. IFN-gamma enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assays were performed to assess T cell responses against the SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan strain and the Delta variant.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies were found less frequently in patients (70% [57/82]) compared with controls (82/82 [100%], <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). In patients without detectable B cells (&lt;1 B cell/mcl), seroconversion rates and antibody levels were lower compared to nondepleted (≥1 B cell/mcl) patients (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). B cell levels ≥1 cell/mcl were sufficient to induce seroconversion in our cohort of anti-CD20 treated patients. In contrast to the antibody response, the T-cell response against the Wuhan strain and the Delta variant was more pronounced in frequency (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) and magnitude (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01) in B-cell depleted compared to nondepleted patients.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccinnation can be attained in patients on anti-CD20 therapy by the onset of B cell repopulation. In the absence of B cells, a strong T cell response is generated which may help to protect against severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in this high-risk population.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Cortical Correlates of Gait Compensation Strategies in Parkinson Disease</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Gait impairment in persons with Parkinson disease is common and debilitating. Compensation strategies (eg, external cues) are an essential part of rehabilitation, but their underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Using electroencephalography (EEG), we explored the cortical correlates of 3 categories of strategies: external cueing, internal cueing, and action observation.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Eighteen participants with Parkinson disease and gait impairment were included. We recorded 126-channel EEG during both stance and gait on a treadmill under 4 conditions: (1) uncued, (2) external cueing (listening to a metronome), (3) internal cueing (silent rhythmic counting), and (4) action observation (observing another person walking). To control for the effects of sensory processing of the cues, we computed relative power changes as the difference in power spectral density between walking and standing for each condition.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Relative to uncued gait, the use of all 3 compensation strategies induced a decrease of beta band activity in sensorimotor areas, indicative of increased cortical activation. Parieto-occipital alpha band activity decreased with external and internal cueing, and increased with action observation. Only internal cueing induced a change in frontal cortical activation, showing a decrease of beta band activity compared to uncued gait.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The application of compensation strategies resulted in changed cortical activity compared to uncued gait, which could not be solely attributed to sensory processing of the cueing modality. Our findings suggest there are multiple routes to control gait, and different compensation strategies seem to rely on different cortical mechanisms to achieve enhanced central motor activation in persons with Parkinson disease.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">Dynamic coupling of oscillatory neural activity and its roles in visual attention</a></h4>

              
                Oscillatory neural activity is believed to have a central role in information processing in the mammalian brain. While early studies often focussed on the function of individual frequency bands, there is emerging appreciation for the role of simultaneous activity in many distinct frequency bands and the interactions between them in high-level cognitive functions. Here, we focus on the role of cross-frequency coupling (CFC) in visual attention. First, we propose a framework that reconciles previous contrasting findings, showing how CFC could have a functional role on both intra- and interareal scales.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cryo-EM structures reveal high-resolution mechanism of a DNA polymerase sliding clamp loader</a></h4>

              
                Sliding clamps are ring-shaped protein complexes that are integral to the DNA replication machinery of all life. Sliding clamps are opened and installed onto DNA by clamp loader AAA+ ATPase complexes. However, how a clamp loader opens and closes the sliding clamp around DNA is still unknown. Here, we describe structures of the <i>S. cerevisiae</i> clamp loader Replication Factor C (RFC) bound to its cognate sliding clamp Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) en route to successful loading. RFC first binds to PCNA in a dynamic, closed conformation that blocks both ATPase activity and DNA binding. RFC then opens the PCNA ring through a large-scale 'crab-claw' expansion of both RFC and PCNA that explains how RFC prefers initial binding of PCNA over DNA. Next, the open RFC:PCNA complex binds DNA and interrogates the primer-template junction using a surprising base-flipping mechanism. Our structures indicate that initial PCNA opening and subsequent closure around DNA do not require ATP hydrolysis, but are driven by binding energy. ATP hydrolysis, which is necessary for RFC release, is triggered by interactions with both PCNA and DNA, explaining RFC’s switch-like ATPase activity. Our work reveals how a AAA+ machine undergoes dramatic conformational changes for achieving binding preference and substrate remodeling.

                Hypertrophic chondrocytes give rise to osteoblasts during skeletal development; however, the process by which these non-mitotic cells make this transition is not well understood. Prior studies have also suggested that skeletal stem and progenitor cells (SSPCs) localize to the surrounding periosteum and serve as a major source of marrow associated SSPCs, osteoblasts, osteocytes, and adipocytes during skeletal development. To further understand the cell transition process by which hypertrophic chondrocytes contribute to osteoblasts or other marrow associated cells, we utilized inducible and constitutive hypertrophic chondrocyte lineage tracing and reporter mouse models (<i>Col10a1CreERT2; Rosa26<sup>fs-tdTomato</sup></i><sup> </sup>and <i>Col10a1Cre; Rosa26<sup>fs-tdTomato</sup></i>) in combination with a <i>PDGFRa<sup>H2B-GFP </sup></i>transgenic line, single cell RNA-sequencing, bulk RNA-sequencing, immunofluorescence staining, and cell transplantation assays. Our data demonstrate that hypertrophic chondrocytes undergo a process of dedifferentiation to generate marrow associated SSPCs that serve as a primary source of osteoblasts during skeletal development. These hypertrophic chondrocyte derived SSPCs commit to a CXCL12-abundant reticular (CAR) cell phenotype during skeletal development and demonstrate unique abilities to recruit vasculature and promote bone marrow establishment, while also contributing to the adipogenic lineage.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Mosaic cis-regulatory evolution drives transcriptional partitioning of HERVH endogenous retrovirus in the human embryo</a></h4>

              
                The human endogenous retrovirus type-H (HERVH) family is expressed in the preimplantation embryo. A subset of these elements are specifically transcribed in pluripotent stem cells where they appear to exert regulatory activities promoting self-renewal and pluripotency. How HERVH elements achieve such transcriptional specificity remains poorly understood. To uncover the sequence features underlying HERVH transcriptional activity, we performed a phyloregulatory analysis of the long terminal repeats (LTR7) of the HERVH family, which harbor its promoter, using a wealth of regulatory genomics data. We found that the family includes at least 8 previously unrecognized subfamilies that have been active at different timepoints in primate evolution and display distinct expression patterns during human embryonic development. Notably, nearly all HERVH elements transcribed in ESCs belong to one of the youngest subfamilies we dubbed LTR7up. LTR7 sequence evolution was driven by a mixture of mutational processes, including point mutations, duplications, and multiple recombination events between subfamilies, that led to transcription factor binding motif modules characteristic of each subfamily. Using a reporter assay, we show that one such motif, a predicted SOX2/3 binding site unique to LTR7up, is essential for robust promoter activity in induced pluripotent stem cells. Together these findings illuminate the mechanisms by which HERVH diversified its expression pattern during evolution to colonize distinct cellular niches within the human embryo.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Quantitative mapping of keratin networks in 3D</a></h4>

              
                Mechanobiology requires precise quantitative information on processes taking place in specific 3D microenvironments. Connecting the abundance of microscopical, molecular, biochemical and cell mechanical data with defined topologies has turned out to be extremely difficult. Establishing such structural and functional 3D maps needed for biophysical modeling is a particular challenge for the cytoskeleton, which consists of long and interwoven filamentous polymers coordinating subcellular processes and interactions of cells with their environment. To date, useful tools are available for the segmentation and modeling of actin filaments and microtubules but comprehensive tools for the mapping of intermediate filament organization are still lacking. In this work, we describe a workflow to model and examine the complete 3D arrangement of the keratin intermediate filament cytoskeleton in canine, murine and human epithelial cells both, in vitro and in vivo. Numerical models are derived from confocal Airyscan high resolution 3D imaging of fluorescence-tagged keratin filaments. They are interrogated and annotated at different length scales using different modes of visualization including immersive virtual reality. In this way, information is provided on network organization at the subcellular level including mesh arrangement, density and isotropic configuration as well as details on filament morphology such as bundling, curvature and orientation. We show that the comparison of these parameters helps to identify, in quantitative terms, similarities and differences of keratin network organization in epithelial cell types defining subcellular domains, notably basal, apical, lateral and perinuclear systems. The described approach and the presented data are pivotal for generating mechanobiological models that can be experimentally tested.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cannabidiol activates neuronal Kv7 channels</a></h4>

              
                Cannabidiol (CBD), a chemical found in the <i>Cannabis sativa</i> plant, is a clinically effective antiepileptic drug whose mechanism of action is unknown. Using a fluorescence-based thallium flux assay, we performed a large-scale screen and found enhancement of flux through heterologously expressed human Kv7.2/7.3 channels by CBD. Patch-clamp recordings showed that CBD acts at submicromolar concentrations to shift the voltage dependence of Kv7.2/7.3 channels in the hyperpolarizing direction, producing a dramatic enhancement of current at voltages near –50 mV. CBD enhanced native M-current in mouse superior cervical ganglion starting at concentrations of 30 nM and also enhanced M-current in rat hippocampal neurons. The potent enhancement of Kv2/7.3 channels by CBD may contribute to its effectiveness as an antiepileptic drug by reducing neuronal hyperexcitability.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The m6A reader YTHDF2 is a negative regulator for dendrite development and maintenance of retinal ganglion cells</a></h4>

              
                The precise control of growth and maintenance of the retinal ganglion cell (RGC) dendrite arborization is critical for normal visual functions in mammals. However, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here we find that the m<sup>6</sup>A reader YTHDF2 is highly expressed in the mouse RGCs. Conditional knockout (cKO) of <i>Ythdf2</i> in the retina leads to increased RGC dendrite branching, resulting in more synapses in the inner plexiform layer. Interestingly, the <i>Ythdf2</i> cKO mice show improved visual acuity compared with control mice. We further demonstrate that <i>Ythdf2</i> cKO in the retina protects RGCs from dendrite degeneration caused by the experimental acute glaucoma model. We identify the m<sup>6</sup>A-modified YTHDF2 target transcripts which mediate these effects. This study reveals mechanisms by which YTHDF2 restricts RGC dendrite development and maintenance. YTHDF2 and its target mRNAs might be valuable in developing new treatment approaches for glaucomatous eyes.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The transcription factor Xrp1 orchestrates both reduced translation and cell competition upon defective ribosome assembly or function</a></h4>

              
                Ribosomal Protein (<i>Rp</i>) gene haploinsufficiency affects translation rate, can lead to protein aggregation, and causes cell elimination by competition with wild type cells in mosaic tissues. We find that the modest changes in ribosomal subunit levels observed were insufficient for these effects, which all depended on the AT-hook, bZip domain protein Xrp1. Xrp1 reduced global translation through PERK-dependent phosphorylation of eIF2α. eIF2α phosphorylation was itself sufficient to enable cell competition of otherwise wild type cells, but through Xrp1 expression, not as the downstream effector of Xrp1. Unexpectedly, many other defects reducing ribosome biogenesis or function (depletion of TAF1B, eIF2, eIF4G, eIF6, eEF2, eEF1α1, or eIF5A), also increased eIF2α phosphorylation and enabled cell competition. This was also through the Xrp1 expression that was induced in these depletions. In the absence of Xrp1, translation differences between cells were not themselves sufficient to trigger cell competition. Xrp1 is shown here to be a sequence-specific transcription factor that regulates transposable elements as well as single-copy genes. Thus, Xrp1 is the master regulator that triggers multiple consequences of ribosomal stresses, and is the key instigator of cell competition.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Influence of sensory modality and control dynamics on human path integration</a></h4>

              
                Path integration is a sensorimotor computation that can be used to infer latent dynamical states by integrating self-motion cues. We studied the influence of sensory observation (visual/vestibular) and latent control dynamics (velocity/acceleration) on human path integration using a novel motion-cueing algorithm. Sensory modality and control dynamics were both varied randomly across trials, as participants controlled a joystick to steer to a memorized target location in virtual reality. Visual and vestibular steering cues allowed comparable accuracies only when participants controlled their acceleration, suggesting that vestibular signals, on their own, fail to support accurate path integration in the absence of sustained acceleration. Nevertheless, performance in all conditions reflected a failure to fully adapt to changes in the underlying control dynamics, a result that was well explained by a bias in the dynamics estimation. This work demonstrates how an incorrect internal model of control dynamics affects navigation in volatile environments in spite of continuous sensory feedback.

Here we review and discuss the impact of sex on human circadian and sleep physiology, and we uncover a data gap in the field investigating the non-visual effects of light in humans. A virtual workshop on the biomedical implications of sex differences in sleep and circadian physiology then led to the following imperatives for future research: (1) design research to be inclusive and accessible, (2) implement recruitment strategies that lead to a sex-balanced sample, (3) use data visualization to grasp the effect of sex, (4) implement statistical analyses that include sex as a factor and/or perform group analyses by sex, where possible, (5) make participant-level data open and available to facilitate future meta-analytic efforts.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A meta-analysis of the association between male dimorphism and fitness outcomes in humans</a></h4>

              
                Humans are sexually dimorphic: men and women differ in body build and composition, craniofacial structure, and voice pitch, likely mediated in part by developmental testosterone. Sexual selection hypotheses posit that, ancestrally, more 'masculine' men may have acquired more mates and/or sired more viable offspring. Thus far, however, evidence for either association is unclear. Here, we meta-analyze the relationships between six masculine traits and mating/reproductive outcomes (96 studies, 474 effects, <i>N</i> = 177,044). Voice pitch, height, and testosterone all predicted mating; however, strength/muscularity was the strongest and only consistent predictor of both mating and reproduction. Facial masculinity and digit ratios did not significantly predict either. There was no clear evidence for any effects of masculinity on offspring viability. Our findings support arguments that strength/muscularity may be sexually selected in humans, but cast doubt regarding selection for other forms of masculinity and highlight the need to increase tests of evolutionary hypotheses outside of industrialized populations.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Hematodinium sp. infection does not drive collateral disease contraction in a crustacean host</a></h4>

              
                Host, pathogen, and environment are determinants of the disease triangle, the latter being a key driver of disease outcomes and persistence within a community. The dinoflagellate genus <i>Hematodinium</i> is detrimental to crustaceans globally – considered to suppress the innate defences of hosts, making them more susceptible to co-infections. Evidence supporting immune suppression is largely anecdotal and sourced from diffuse accounts of compromised decapods. We used a population of shore crabs (<i>Carcinus maenas</i>), where <i>Hematodinium</i> sp. is endemic, to determine the extent of collateral infections across two distinct environments (open-water, semi-closed dock). Using a multi-resource approach (PCR, histology, haematology, population genetics, eDNA), we identified 162 <i>Hematodinium-</i>positive crabs and size/sex-matched these to 162 <i>Hematodinium-</i>free crabs out of 1191 analysed. Crabs were interrogated for known additional disease-causing agents; haplosporidians, microsporidians, mikrocytids, <i>Vibrio</i> spp., fungi, <i>Sacculina</i>, trematodes, and haemolymph bacterial loads. We found no significant differences in occurrence, severity, or composition of collateral infections between <i>Hematodinium</i>-positive and <i>Hematodinium</i>-free crabs at either site, but crucially, we recorded site-restricted blends of pathogens. We found no gross signs of host cell immune reactivity towards <i>Hematodinium</i> in the presence or absence of other pathogens. We contend <i>Hematodinium</i> sp. is not the proximal driver of co-infections in shore crabs, which suggests an evolutionary drive towards latency in this environmentally plastic host.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Visualizing cellular and tissue ultrastructure using Ten-fold Robust Expansion Microscopy (TREx)</a></h4>

              
                Expansion microscopy (ExM) is a powerful technique to overcome the diffraction limit of light microscopy that can be applied in both tissues and cells. In ExM, samples are embedded in a swellable polymer gel to physically expand the sample and isotropically increase resolution in x, y, and z. The maximum resolution increase is limited by the expansion factor of the gel, which is four-fold for the original ExM protocol. Variations on the original ExM method have been reported that allow for greater expansion factors but at the cost of ease of adoption or versatility. Here, we systematically explore the ExM recipe space and present a novel method termed Ten-fold Robust Expansion Microscopy (TREx) that, like the original ExM method, requires no specialized equipment or procedures. We demonstrate that TREx gels expand 10-fold, can be handled easily, and can be applied to both thick mouse brain tissue sections and cultured human cells enabling high-resolution subcellular imaging with a single expansion step. Furthermore, we show that TREx can provide ultrastructural context to subcellular protein localization by combining antibody-stained samples with off-the-shelf small-molecule stains for both total protein and membranes.

                Prefrontal cortical influence over the mesolimbic system - including the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and the ventral tegmental area (VTA) - is implicated in various cognitive processes and behavioral malfunctions. The functional versatility of this system could be explained by an underlying anatomical complexity; however, the detailed characterization of the medial prefrontal cortical (mPFC) innervation of the NAc and VTA is still lacking. Therefore, combining classical retrograde and conditional viral tracing techniques with multiple fluorescent immunohistochemistry, we sought to deliver a precise, cell- and layer-specific anatomical description of the cortico-mesolimbic pathways. We demonstrated that NAc- (mPFCNAc) and VTA-projecting mPFC (mPFCVTA) populations show different laminar distribution (layers 2/3-5a and 5b-6, respectively) and express different molecular markers. Specifically, calbindin and Ntsr1 are specific to mPFCNAc neurons, while mPFCVTA neurons express high levels of Ctip2 and FoxP2, indicating that these populations are mostly separated at the cellular level. We directly tested this with double retrograde tracing and Canine adenovirus type 2-mediated viral labelling and found that there is indeed minimal overlap between the two populations. Furthermore, whole-brain analysis revealed that the projection patter of these populations is also different throughout the brain. Taken together, we demonstrated that the NAc and the VTA are innervated by two, mostly non-overlapping mPFC populations with different laminar distribution and molecular profile. These results can contribute to the advancement in our understanding of mesocorticolimbic functions and its disorders in future studies.

                Behaviors emerge via a combination of experience and innate predispositions. As the brain matures, it undergoes major changes in cellular, network and functional properties that can be due to sensory experience as well as developmental processes. In normal birdsong learning, neural sequences emerge to control song syllables learned from a tutor. Here, we disambiguate the role of experience and development in neural sequence formation by delaying exposure to a tutor. Using functional calcium imaging, we observe neural sequences in the absence of tutoring, demonstrating that experience is not necessary for the formation of sequences. However, after exposure to a tutor, pre-existing sequences can become tightly associated with new song syllables. Since we delayed tutoring, only half our birds learned new syllables following tutor exposure. The birds that failed to learn were the birds in which pre-tutoring neural sequences were most 'crystallized', that is, already tightly associated with their (untutored) song.

                Working memories have long been thought to be maintained by persistent spiking. However, mounting evidence from multiple-electrode recording (and single-trial analyses) shows that the underlying spiking is better characterized by intermittent bursts of activity. A counterargument suggested this intermittent activity is at odds with observations that spike-time variability reduces during task performance. However, this counterargument rests on assumptions, such as randomness in the timing of the bursts, that may not be correct. Thus, we analyzed spiking and LFPs from the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of monkeys to determine if task-related reductions in variability can co-exist with intermittent spiking. We found that it does because both spiking and associated gamma bursts were task-modulated, not random. In fact, the task-related reduction in spike variability could be explained by a related reduction in gamma burst variability. Our results provide further support for the intermittent activity models of working memory as well as novel mechanistic insights into how spike variability is reduced during cognitive tasks.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Hyperactivity of indirect pathway-projecting spiny projection neurons drives compulsive behavior</a></h4>

              
                Compulsive behaviors are a hallmark symptom of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). Striatal hyperactivity has been linked to compulsive behavior generation in correlative studies in humans and causal studies in rodents. However, the contribution of the two distinct striatal output populations to the generation and treatment of compulsive behavior is unknown. These populations of direct and indirect pathway-projecting spiny projection neurons (SPNs) have classically been thought to promote or suppress actions, respectively, leading to a long-held hypothesis that increased output of direct relative to indirect pathway promotes compulsive behavior. Contrary to this hypothesis, here we find that indirect pathway hyperactivity drives compulsive grooming in the Sapap3-knockout mouse model of OCD-relevant behavior. Furthermore, we show that suppression of indirect pathway activity using optogenetics or treatment with the first-line OCD pharmacotherapy fluoxetine is associated with reduced compulsive behavior. Together, these findings highlight the striatal indirect pathway as a potential new treatment target for compulsive behavior.

	<p>Facial expression processing mainly depends on whether the facial features related to expressions can be fully acquired, and whether the appropriate processing strategies can be adopted according to different conditions. Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have difficulty accurately recognizing facial expressions and responding appropriately, which is regarded as an important cause of their social disorders. This study used eye tracking technology to explore the internal processing mechanism of facial expressions in children with ASD under the influence of spatial frequency and inversion effects for improving their social disorders. The facial expression recognition rate and eye tracking characteristics of children with ASD and typical developing (TD) children on the facial area of interest were recorded and analyzed. The multi-factor mixed experiment results showed that the facial expression recognition rate of children with ASD under various conditions was significantly lower than that of TD children. TD children had more visual attention to the eyes area. However, children with ASD preferred the features of the mouth area, and lacked visual attention and processing of the eyes area. When the face was inverted, TD children had the inversion effect under all three spatial frequency conditions, which was manifested as a significant decrease in expression recognition rate. However, children with ASD only had the inversion effect under the LSF condition, indicating that they mainly used a featural processing method and had the capacity of configural processing under the LSF condition. The eye tracking results showed that when the face was inverted or facial feature information was weakened, both children with ASD and TD children would adjust their facial expression processing strategies accordingly, to increase the visual attention and information processing of their preferred areas. The fixation counts and fixation duration of TD children on the eyes area increased significantly, while the fixation duration of children with ASD on the mouth area increased significantly. The results of this study provided theoretical and practical support for facial expression intervention in children with ASD.</p>

	<p>Background. Numerous neuropsychological studies have shown that cannabis use during adolescence and young adulthood led to deficits in sustained and selective attention. However, few studies have examined functional connectivity in attentional networks among young cannabis users, nor have characterized relationships with cannabis use patterns following abstinence. Methods. Differences in resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) within the dorsal (DAN) and ventral (VAN) attention networks were examined in 36 adolescent and young adult cannabis users and 39 non-substance using controls following two weeks of monitored abstinence. Observed connectivity differences were then correlated with past-year and lifetime cannabis use, length of abstinence, age of regular use onset, and Cannabis Use Disorder symptoms (CUD). Results. After controlling for alcohol and nicotine use, cannabis users had lower RSFC within the DAN network, specifically between right inferior parietal sulcus and right anterior insula, as well as white matter, relative to controls. This region was associated with more severe cannabis use measures, including increased lifetime cannabis use, shorter length of abstinence, and more severe CUD symptoms. Conclusions. Findings demonstrate that regular cannabis use by adolescents and young adults is associated with subtle differences in resting state connectivity within the DAN, even after two weeks of monitored abstinence. Notably, more severe cannabis use markers (greater lifetime use, CUD symptoms, and shorter abstinence) were linked with this reduced connectivity. Thus, findings support public policy aimed at reducing and delaying cannabis use and treatments to assist with sustained abstinence. Future longitudinal studies are needed to investigate causation.</p>

	<p>Research on attention in sport using eye-tracking methodology has highlighted that the highest levels of expertise and performance are characterized by a specific gaze behavior consisting of a perception&amp;amp;ndash;action variable named quiet eye. The present study aimed to understand the role of quiet eye during the three-point shot, especially in game conditions in which even a single point may determine victory or defeat. Twenty-one basketball players (twelve competitive elites and nine semi-elites) with a high-shooting style performed three-point shots in four game scenarios different from each other for the time available (time pressure) and the relevance of the score (performance pressure). The results showed that competitive elites performed a longer quiet eye online duration and a shorter QE preprogramming duration than semi-elites, especially in the highest-pressure condition. On the one hand, these results suggest that quiet eye during three-point shots could fulfill an online control function. On the other hand, the findings stressed the importance of implementing experimental conditions that can resemble as closely as possible actual sport situations. Finally, we suggest that sport professionals interested in administering to athletes a quiet eye training protocol in order to improve three-point shot performance consider the shooting style of the players.</p>

	<p>Body awareness (BA) has long been proposed as a working mechanism of mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs), yet research on the mediating role of BA is scarce. Hence, the present study assesses the impact of an 8-week MBI on self-reported and indirect measures of BA, investigates the potential mediating role of BA in the relationship between an MBI and symptomatology, evaluates the impact of an MBI on important psychological processes (i.e., experiential avoidance, rumination, self-efficacy, and self-discrepancy), and explores whether these variables act alongside BA in mediating the relationship between an MBI and symptomatology. A non-randomized controlled trial was conducted with 148 participants (n = 89 in the MBI group; n = 59 in the control group) who completed questionnaires assessing BA and the above-mentioned psychological processes before and after an MBI. A sub-sample of participants (n = 86) completed a task that evaluates BA indirectly. Results showed a significant effect of MBI on the self-reported BA but not on the indirect measure of BA. The MBI significantly reduced symptomatology, and this effect was mediated by regulatory and belief-related dimensions of BA. Multiple mediator models showed a significant mediation via various pathways involving improved BA and various transdiagnostic psychological processes.</p>

	<p>In contrast to mammals, adult zebrafish display an extraordinary capacity to heal injuries and repair damage in the central nervous system. Pivotal for the regenerative capacity of the zebrafish brain at adult stages is the precise control of neural stem cell (NSC) behavior and the maintenance of the stem cell pool. The gene mdka, a member of a small family of heparin binding growth factors, was previously shown to be involved in regeneration in the zebrafish retina, heart, and fin. Here, we investigated the expression pattern of the gene mdka and its paralogue mdkb in the zebrafish adult telencephalon under constitutive and regenerative conditions. Our findings show that only mdka expression is specifically restricted to the telencephalic ventricle, a stem cell niche of the zebrafish telencephalon. In this brain region, mdka is particularly expressed in the quiescent stem cells. Interestingly, after brain injury, mdka expression remains restricted to the resting stem cell, which might suggest a role of mdka in regulating stem cell quiescence.</p>

                Introduction: Social distancing and wearing a face mask are highly recommended to mitigate the transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, the success of these strategies relies on individuals’ adherence and public compliance. This study was conducted to assess the level of belief in social distancing and face mask practices in communities in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and to identify their possible determinants.   Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in ten LMICs countries in Asia, Africa, and South America from February to May 2021. A questionnaire was used to assess the belief, practice, and their plausible determinants. Identification of the associated determinants was performed using a logistic regression model.   Results: Our data revealed that only 62.6% and 66.9% of the participants had good beliefs in social distancing and good face mask practices, respectively. Residing in the Americas, having a healthcare-related job, knowing people in immediate social environment who are or have been infected and exposure to information of COVID-19 cases on social media or TV were factors significantly associated with good belief in social distancing. Residing country, gender, monthly household income, type of job and exposure to information of COVID-19 cases were significantly associated with face mask wearing practice.  Conclusion: The proportion of participants having good beliefs in social distancing and good face mask practices is relatively low (<75%). Hence, sustained health campaigns regarding social distancing benefits and face mask-wearing practices during COVID-19 are critical in LMICs.

                Background After the first cases of coronaviruses disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China in January 2020, we conducted an epidemiological surveillance of COVID-19 in Gabon. Methods We led molecular investigations on nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal samples from the 1161 first suspected cases of COVID-19. We diagnosed the first case of COVID-19 on March, 12 2020. Results Among those suspected cases, 83 were confirmed cases. There was no significant difference in prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 between age groups (p=0.14). 73% were asymptomatic. The viral loads were significantly higher in the nasopharyngeal samples than in the oropharyngeal samples (p=0.03). There was no significant difference in viral loads between age groups (p=0.9895) and no correlation between clinical symptoms and viral loads (p=0.06042). A phylogenetic analysis performed with five sequences of the spike S gene showed that two sequences had the D614G mutation. Conclusion In conclusion, this study provides the first molecular data from Gabon concerning the COVID-19 pandemic. The data showed that most of the infected people were asymptomatic. The viral load was higher in the nasopharyngeal samples. The S gene analyzed suggested both introduction of the D614 and G614 variant in Gabon.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Numerical model for enhancing stimulated Brillouin scattering in optical microfibers [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) is useful, among others for generating slow light, sensing and amplification. SBS was previously viewed as a poor method due to the limitation on optical power in high-powered photonic applications. However, considering the many possible applications using SBS, it is now of interest to enhance SBS in areas of Brillouin frequency shift together with Brillouin Gain. A numerical model, using a fully vectorial approach, by employing the finite element method, was developed to investigate methods for enhancing SBS in optical fiber. This paper describes the method related to the numerical model and discusses the analysis between the interactions of longitudinal, shear and hybrid acoustic modes; and optical modes in optical fiber. Two case studies were used to demonstrate this. Based on this numerical model, we report the influence of core radius, clad radius and effective refractive index on the Brillouin frequency shift and gain. We observe the difference of Brillouin shift frequency between a normal silica optical fiber and that of a microfiber - a uniformed silica fiber of a much smaller core and cladding dimensions where nonlinearities are higher. Also observed, the different core radii used and their respective Brillouin shift. For future work, the COMSOL model can also be used for the following areas of research, including simulating “surface Brillouin shift” and also to provide in-sights to the Brillouin shift frequency vB of various structures of waveguides, e.g circular, and triangular, and also to examine specialty fibers, e.g. Thulium and Chalcogenide doped fibers, and their effects on Brillouin shift frequency.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">High-frequency oscillations and sequence generation in two-population models of hippocampal region CA1</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Wilhelm Braun, Raoul-Martin Memmesheimer</p>

Hippocampal sharp wave/ripple oscillations are a prominent pattern of collective activity, which consists of a strong overall increase of activity with superimposed (140 − 200 Hz) ripple oscillations. Despite its prominence and its experimentally demonstrated importance for memory consolidation, the mechanisms underlying its generation are to date not understood. Several models assume that recurrent networks of inhibitory cells alone can explain the generation and main characteristics of the ripple oscillations. Recent experiments, however, indicate that in addition to inhibitory basket cells, the pattern requires <i>in vivo</i> the activity of the local population of excitatory pyramidal cells. Here, we study a model for networks in the hippocampal region CA1 incorporating such a local excitatory population of pyramidal neurons. We start by investigating its ability to generate ripple oscillations using extensive simulations. Using biologically plausible parameters, we find that short pulses of external excitation triggering excitatory cell spiking are required for sharp/wave ripple generation with oscillation patterns similar to <i>in vivo</i> observations. Our model has plausible values for single neuron, synapse and connectivity parameters, random connectivity and no strong feedforward drive to the inhibitory population. Specifically, whereas temporally broad excitation can lead to high-frequency oscillations in the ripple range, sparse pyramidal cell activity is only obtained with pulse-like external CA3 excitation. Further simulations indicate that such short pulses could originate from dendritic spikes in the apical or basal dendrites of CA1 pyramidal cells, which are triggered by coincident spike arrivals from hippocampal region CA3. Finally we show that replay of sequences by pyramidal neurons and ripple oscillations can arise intrinsically in CA1 due to structured connectivity that gives rise to alternating excitatory pulse and inhibitory gap coding; the latter denotes phases of silence in specific basket cell groups, which induce selective disinhibition of groups of pyramidal neurons. This general mechanism for sequence generation leads to sparse pyramidal cell and dense basket cell spiking, does not rely on synfire chain-like feedforward excitation and may be relevant for other brain regions as well.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Computational exploration of treadmilling and protrusion growth observed in fire ant rafts</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Robert J. Wagner, Franck J. Vernerey</p>

Collective living systems regularly achieve cooperative emergent functions that individual organisms could not accomplish alone. The rafts of fire ants (Solenopsis invicta) are often studied in this context for their ability to create aggregated structures comprised entirely of their own bodies, including tether-like protrusions that facilitate exploration of and escape from flooded environments. While similar protrusions are observed in cytoskeletons and cellular aggregates, they are generally dependent on morphogens or external gradients leaving the isolated role of local interactions poorly understood. Here we demonstrate through an ant-inspired, agent-based numerical model how protrusions in ant rafts may emerge spontaneously due to local interactions. The model is comprised of a condensed structural network of agents that represents the monolayer of interconnected worker ants, which floats on the water and gives ant rafts their form. Experimentally, this layer perpetually contracts, which we capture through the pairwise contraction of all neighboring structural agents at a strain rate of d˙. On top of the structural layer, we model a dispersed, on-lattice layer of motile agents that represents free ants, which walk on top of the floating network. Experimentally, these self-propelled free ants walk with some mean persistence length and speed that we capture through an ant-inspired phenomenological model. Local interactions occur between neighboring free ants within some radius of detection, <i>R</i>, and the persistence length of freely active agents is tuned through a noise parameter, <i>η</i> as introduced by the Vicsek model. Both <i>R</i> and <i>η</i> where fixed to match the experimental trajectories of free ants. Treadmilling of the raft occurs as agents transition between the structural and free layers in accordance with experimental observations. Ultimately, we demonstrate how phases of exploratory protrusion growth may be induced by increased ant activity as characterized by a dimensionless parameter, A. These results provide an example in which functional morphogenesis of a living system may emerge purely from local interactions at the constituent length scale, thereby providing a source of inspiration for the development of decentralized, autonomous active matter and swarm robotics.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">High fidelity epigenetic inheritance: Information theoretic model predicts threshold filling of histone modifications post replication</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Nithya Ramakrishnan, Sibi Raj B. Pillai, Ranjith Padinhateeri</p>

During cell devision, maintaining the epigenetic information encoded in histone modification patterns is crucial for survival and identity of cells. The faithful inheritance of the histone marks from the parental to the daughter strands is a puzzle, given that each strand gets only half of the parental nucleosomes. Mapping DNA replication and reconstruction of modifications to equivalent problems in communication of information, we ask how well enzymes can recover the parental modifications, if they were ideal computing machines. Studying a parameter regime where realistic enzymes can function, our analysis predicts that enzymes may implement a critical threshold filling algorithm which fills unmodified regions of length at most <i>k</i>. This algorithm, motivated from communication theory, is derived from the maximum à posteriori probability (MAP) decoding which identifies the most probable modification sequence based on available observations. Simulations using our method produce modification patterns similar to what has been observed in recent experiments. We also show that our results can be naturally extended to explain inheritance of spatially distinct antagonistic modifications.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Regulatory network-based imputation of dropouts in single-cell RNA sequencing data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ana Carolina Leote, Xiaohui Wu, Andreas Beyer</p>

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) methods are typically unable to quantify the expression levels of all genes in a cell, creating a need for the computational prediction of missing values (‘dropout imputation’). Most existing dropout imputation methods are limited in the sense that they exclusively use the scRNA-seq dataset at hand and do not exploit external gene-gene relationship information. Further, it is unknown if all genes equally benefit from imputation or which imputation method works best for a given gene. Here, we show that a transcriptional regulatory network learned from external, independent gene expression data improves dropout imputation. Using a variety of human scRNA-seq datasets we demonstrate that our network-based approach outperforms published state-of-the-art methods. The network-based approach performs particularly well for lowly expressed genes, including cell-type-specific transcriptional regulators. Further, the cell-to-cell variation of 11.3% to 48.8% of the genes could not be adequately imputed by any of the methods that we tested. In those cases gene expression levels were best predicted by the mean expression across all cells, i.e. assuming no measurable expression variation between cells. These findings suggest that different imputation methods are optimal for different genes. We thus implemented an R-package called ADImpute (available via Bioconductor https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ADImpute.html) that automatically determines the best imputation method for each gene in a dataset. Our work represents a paradigm shift by demonstrating that there is no single best imputation method. Instead, we propose that imputation should maximally exploit external information and be adapted to gene-specific features, such as expression level and expression variation across cells.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Blood and brain gene expression signatures of chronic intermittent ethanol consumption in mice</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Laura B. Ferguson, Amanda J. Roberts, R. Dayne Mayfield, Robert O. Messing</p>

Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) is a chronic, relapsing syndrome diagnosed by a heterogeneous set of behavioral signs and symptoms. There are no laboratory tests that provide direct objective evidence for diagnosis. Microarray and RNA-Seq technologies enable genome-wide transcriptome profiling at low costs and provide an opportunity to identify biomarkers to facilitate diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of patients. However, access to brain tissue in living patients is not possible. Blood contains cellular and extracellular RNAs that provide disease-relevant information for some brain diseases. We hypothesized that blood gene expression profiles can be used to diagnose AUD. We profiled brain (prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and hypothalamus) and blood gene expression levels in C57BL/6J mice using RNA-seq one week after chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) exposure, a mouse model of alcohol dependence. We found a high degree of preservation (rho range: [0.50, 0.67]) between blood and brain transcript levels. There was small overlap between blood and brain DEGs, and considerable overlap of gene networks perturbed after CIE related to cell-cell signaling (e.g., GABA and glutamate receptor signaling), immune responses (e.g., antigen presentation), and protein processing / mitochondrial functioning (e.g., ubiquitination, oxidative phosphorylation). Blood gene expression data were used to train classifiers (logistic regression, random forest, and partial least squares discriminant analysis), which were highly accurate at predicting alcohol dependence status (maximum AUC: 90.1%). These results suggest that gene expression profiles from peripheral blood samples contain a biological signature of alcohol dependence that can discriminate between CIE and Air subjects.

                <p>by Alessandra Løchen, James E. Truscott, Nicholas J. Croucher</p>

The disease burden attributable to opportunistic pathogens depends on their prevalence in asymptomatic colonisation and the rate at which they progress to cause symptomatic disease. Increases in infections caused by commensals can result from the emergence of “hyperinvasive” strains. Such pathogens can be identified through quantifying progression rates using matched samples of typed microbes from disease cases and healthy carriers. This study describes Bayesian models for analysing such datasets, implemented in an RStan package (https://github.com/nickjcroucher/progressionEstimation). The models converged on stable fits that accurately reproduced observations from meta-analyses of <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i> datasets. The estimates of invasiveness, the progression rate from carriage to invasive disease, in cases per carrier per year correlated strongly with the dimensionless values from meta-analysis of odds ratios when sample sizes were large. At smaller sample sizes, the Bayesian models produced more informative estimates. This identified historically rare but high-risk <i>S</i>. <i>pneumoniae</i> serotypes that could be problematic following vaccine-associated disruption of the bacterial population. The package allows for hypothesis testing through model comparisons with Bayes factors. Application to datasets in which strain and serotype information were available for <i>S</i>. <i>pneumoniae</i> found significant evidence for within-strain and within-serotype variation in invasiveness. The heterogeneous geographical distribution of these genotypes is therefore likely to contribute to differences in the impact of vaccination in between locations. Hence genomic surveillance of opportunistic pathogens is crucial for quantifying the effectiveness of public health interventions, and enabling ongoing meta-analyses that can identify new, highly invasive variants.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Tool evaluation for the detection of variably sized indels from next generation whole genome and targeted sequencing data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Ning Wang, Vladislav Lysenkov, Katri Orte, Veli Kairisto, Juhani Aakko, Sofia Khan, Laura L. Elo</p>

Insertions and deletions (indels) in human genomes are associated with a wide range of phenotypes, including various clinical disorders. High-throughput, next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies enable the detection of short genetic variants, such as single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and indels. However, the variant calling accuracy for indels remains considerably lower than for SNVs. Here we present a comparative study of the performance of variant calling tools for indel calling, evaluated with a wide repertoire of NGS datasets. While there is no single optimal tool to suit all circumstances, our results demonstrate that the choice of variant calling tool greatly impacts the precision and recall of indel calling. Furthermore, to reliably detect indels, it is essential to choose NGS technologies that offer a long read length and high coverage coupled with specific variant calling tools.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Further evidence for the capacity of mirror self-recognition in cleaner fish and the significance of ecologically relevant marks</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Masanori Kohda, Shumpei Sogawa, Alex L. Jordan, Naoki Kubo, Satoshi Awata, Shun Satoh, Taiga Kobayashi, Akane Fujita, Redouan Bshary</p>

An animal that tries to remove a mark from its body that is only visible when looking into a mirror displays the capacity for mirror self-recognition (MSR), which has been interpreted as evidence for self-awareness. Conservative interpretations of existing data conclude that convincing evidence for MSR is currently restricted to great apes. Here, we address proposed shortcomings of a previous study on MSR in the cleaner wrasse <i>Labroides dimidiatus</i>, by varying preexposure to mirrors and by marking individuals with different colors. We found that (1) 14/14 new individuals scraped their throat when a brown mark had been provisioned, but only in the presence of a mirror; (2) blue and green color marks did not elicit scraping; (3) intentionally injecting the mark deeper beneath the skin reliably elicited spontaneous scraping in the absence of a mirror; (4) mirror-naive individuals injected with a brown mark scraped their throat with lower probability and/or lower frequency compared to mirror-experienced individuals; (5) in contrast to the mirror images, seeing another fish with the same marking did not induce throat scraping; and (6) moving the mirror to another location did not elicit renewed aggression in mirror-experienced individuals. Taken together, these results increase our confidence that cleaner fish indeed pass the mark test, although only if it is presented in ecologically relevant contexts. Therefore, we reiterate the conclusion of the previous study that either self-awareness in animals or the validity of the mirror test needs to be revised.

                Objective: The objective of the present study was to develop the Thai version of the Impact and Burden of Care Scale for Caregivers of Persons with Schizophrenia and Co-occurring Methamphetamine Use (TIBSCSM) and test its psychometric properties. Methods: This instrument development research subjects were 142 caregivers of persons with schizophrenia and co-occurring methamphetamine use. Sample size adequacy was tested by Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin (KMO), and Bartlett's test of sphericity tested the adequacy of the item correlation matrix. The second-order confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to test the theoretical model. Results The 32-item TIBSCSM showed convergent validity correlations with two quality-of-life measures. Additionally, KMO=0.9, Bartlett’s Test of Sphericity χ2=5248.5, df=496, p<0.001, CVI =1, and internal consistency reliability was high (α=0.9). The CFA has shown that the findings are supported by the theoretical models (χ2=325.2, df=287, p<0.001, RMSEA=0.0, CFI =0.9). Conclusion: The TIBSCSM scale has potential benefits for psychiatric nurses and psychiatric care teams to measure the impact and care burden of caregivers of persons with schizophrenia and methamphetamine use in the areas of nursing, research, education, and clinical determination. The test results suggested that The TIBSCSM scale has potential benefits for psychiatric and mental health care team to assess the impact and burden care of schizophrenic caregiver for both research and clinical purposes, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic for providing care to relieve the impact and burden of care. Implication for nursing and research: The TIBSCSM is a new tool developed in the Thai context, and it may replicate the studies to evaluate variations in TIBSCSM across settings.

                The following dataset focuses on the educational well-being of adopted girls of Chinese origin in Spanish schools. Due to its characteristics, the presence of this group may generate complex interaction dynamics in school; particularly regarding bullying in school linked to factors such as the acceptance of others. These are dynamics, which may indeed condition the educational experience of this social group. Therefore, the aim of creating this dataset is to measure the educational well-being of children of Chinese origin adopted into transracial families in Spain. Although this research was justified by the lack of studies on this social group, we aimed to go one-step further, we also studied the correlation between this social group’s educational experience, and to what extent they show an interest in Chinese culture. As we have written before, we incorporated the concept of Well-Being and we worked with the following indicators: Satisfaction with Life, Social Life, and Bullying in School, Racial Bullying, Personal Identity and Interest in Chinese Culture. To achieve the objective set forth, we conducted a questionnaire. The final sample consisted of 268 individuals. The creation of this dataset provided us with information that can shed light on the relationship between adoption, race/ethnicity and the educational experience of adopted children of Chinese origin.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Cross-sectional assessment of cardiovascular risk factors in patients with knee osteoarthritis [version 3; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Osteoarthritis (OA) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) are prevalent in India. However, there is dearth of literature among Indians studying the relationship between the two. This study was carried out to assess various cardiovascular (CV) risk factors in patients with knee OA with an objective to investigate their association, screening and management.  Methods: In total, 225 patients were included in this cross-sectional study. Participants were diagnosed with knee OA on the basis of the Kellgren and Lawrence (K-L) classification of their radiograph. Participants were also assessed for CV risk factors; age, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, diabetes mellitus, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, smoking. Joint British Society QRisk3 calculator (JBS3) a comprehensive risk score calculator as well as a screening tool, which produces three more variables, namely 10-years risk of developing CVD, physiological heart age and life expectancy, was used. Chi Square, Fishers exact test and one-way ANOVA tests were used to compare the categorical and quantitative variables, respectively.. Multiple regression analysis was done to adjust the multiple con-founders and determine their significance. Results: Patients with severe knee OA had a statistically significantly higher prevalence of CV risk factors (p<0.05). Grade 4 knee OA patients were found to have a mean JBS3 risk of 38%, heart age of 82 years and life expectancy of 77 years as compared to grade 2 patients who had a mean JBS3 risk of 11%, heart age of 63 years and life expectancy of 82 years.  Conclusions: Our study concluded that there is a strong relation between knee OA and CVD, with CV risk score being positively correlated to the severity of OA.

                Background: Patient satisfaction is an important measure of health service and a key indicator of the quality of health service. Studies focus on how to improve quality rather than patient satisfaction. This study was conducted to identify patients’ satisfaction with the pharmaceutical service package of Health Insurance Corporation of Khartoum State in Jabal-Awliya locality, Khartoum, Sudan.  Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted between January and August 2020. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire. Satisfaction was estimated using the Likert Scale. The association between patient’s satisfaction and patient care indicators, namely: average dispensing time, percentage of medicine dispensed and labelled, and patient correct dose knowledge were assessed using Chi- square test, where a p-value < 0.05 was considered significant.   Results: Out of 378 participants, the mean age was 47 with a comparable frequency of male and female participants (49.3% and 50.7% respectively). The mean satisfaction was 62.2% (3.11 ± 0.68). Most of the participants were satisfied with the way the pharmacist dealt with them (3.7, ± 0.778), while a low mean of satisfaction was reported regarding the availability of medicine within the pharmaceutical benefit package (2.06, ± 1.17). Average dispensing time was 5.78 minutes (p = 0.002), a low percentage of medicine actually dispensed and labelled was observed at 67% and 58% respectively (p = 0.00). A higher patient knowledge was reported 96.6% (p = 0.00), and the majority of the patients were able to pay 65% (p = 0.00).  Conclusion: The current study demonstrates a comparable satisfaction score. However, medication unavailability is the main factor that affects patient satisfaction.

                Background: Major depression (MD) is a prevalent and disabling condition in Chile. Most MD cases are treated at the primary care level. In Chilean primary care, the authors have gathered evidence of a prevalent complex depression subtype associated with a worse prognosis and characterized by interpersonal difficulties, suicidality and trauma history. This MD presentation suggests the need for a multidimensional, trauma-informed and interprofessional approach. The present study protocol describes the context, hypotheses and methods for a cluster randomized control trial (RCT) comparing a collaborative multidimensional approach and usual care in treatment outcomes of MD in primary care in Chile. Methods: This is a two-arm, single-blinded, cluster RCT to compare the efficacy of a collaborative multidimensional approach for depression (CMAD) versus usual care to treat MD in primary care clinics in Chile. In total, 394 depressed adults from 18 to 65 years of age in twelve clinics located in Chile’s Maule Region will be consented to participate in the study. Patients and care teams from each clinic will be randomized to the intervention or to the control arm. Interprofessional teams in the intervention arm will attend 27 hours of didactic and active learning sessions focused on clinical competences to effectively engage, treat and follow up patients with complex presentation of MD. Team in the control arm will receive 27 didactic sessions on current clinical guidelines for MD, professionals in both arms will receive 27 hours of continued education. Discussion: To improve treatment outcomes of MD in Chile, primary care teams should develop clinical competencies relevant to complex, difficult-to-treat types of MD within collaborative and trauma-informed approaches.

                The retrosplenial cortex (RC) is a brain structure crucial for spatial navigation and memory. It contains neurons such as head direction cells, border cells, as well as other cells supporting spatial and contextual encoding. How such complex and diverse neuronal properties are generated by RC microcircuitry and how they jointly orchestrate subsequent behavior remains enigmatic. Here, we consider recent findings that extend current knowledge about how the RC modulates spatial navigation and spatial cognition.

                De novo protein synthesis is required for long-term memory consolidation. Dynamic regulation of protein synthesis occurs via a complex interplay of translation factors and modulators. Many components of the protein synthesis machinery have been targeted either pharmacologically or genetically to establish its requirement for memory. The combination of ligand/light-gating and genetic strategies, that is, chemogenetics and optogenetics, has begun to reveal the spatiotemporal resolution of protein synthesis in specific cell types during memory consolidation.

                Cholesterol homeostasis is vital for brain function. Brain cholesterol is locally synthesized, with varying synthesis capacities across different cell types. Moreover, brain cholesterol horizontally transfers across various cell types not only to accommodate distinct cholesterol needs, but also to fulfill regulatory functions in target cells. Cholesterol metabolism within individual cell types is essential for brain functioning, and the role of cholesterol-related communication between different cell types is gaining growing recognition.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/inpress.rss">Flexible rerouting of hippocampal replay sequences around changing barriers in the absence of global place field remapping</a></h4>

              
                Widloski and Foster show that place cells in rat hippocampus learn replay sequences around barriers, even after a large (>90) number of barrier reconfigurations. By contrast, cells’ place fields are largely stable, dissociating the stable representation of space from a powerful mechanism for the acquisition and recall of flexible memory.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/inpress.rss">Beyond the neuron: Role of non-neuronal cells in stress disorders</a></h4>

              
                Stress disorders are leading causes of disease burden in the U.S. and worldwide, yet available therapies are fully effective in less than half of all individuals with these disorders. Although to date, much of the focus has been on neuron-intrinsic mechanisms, emerging evidence suggests that chronic stress can affect a wide range of cell types in the brain and periphery, which are linked to maladaptive behavioral outcomes. Here, we synthesize emerging literature and discuss mechanisms of how non-neuronal cells in limbic regions of brain interface at synapses, the neurovascular unit, and other sites of intercellular communication to mediate the deleterious, or adaptive (i.e., pro-resilient), effects of chronic stress in rodent models and in human stress-related disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/neuron/inpress.rss">A direct lateral entorhinal cortex to hippocampal CA2 circuit conveys social information required for social memory</a></h4>

              
                Although the CA2 hippocampal region is essential for social memory and detection of social novelty, the inputs that provide social information to CA2 are unknown. We found that social memory depends on the direct inputs CA2 receives from the lateral entorhinal cortex. As this input is activated similarly by novel and familiar individuals, CA2 itself may compute novelty.

                Lafourcade et al. reveal that apical oblique dendrites of retrosplenial cortical L5 neurons exhibit unexpectedly linear integration compared with basal and tuft branches via increased synaptic AMPA:NMDA. Long-range inputs are targeted to these distinct dendritic domains, supporting the idea that single neurons perform a diverse range of subcellular processing.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Discovery of coordinately regulated pathways that provide innate protection against interbacterial antagonism</a></h4>

              
                Bacterial survival is fraught with antagonism, including that deriving from viruses and competing bacterial cells. It is now appreciated that bacteria mount complex antiviral responses; however, whether a coordinated defense against bacterial threats is undertaken is not well understood. Previously we showed that <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> possess a danger sensing pathway that is a critical fitness determinant during competition against other bacteria. Here, we conducted genome-wide screens in <i>P. aeruginosa</i> that reveal three conserved and widespread interbacterial antagonism resistance clusters (<i>arc1-3</i>). We find that although <i>arc1-3</i> are coordinately activated by the Gac/Rsm danger sensing system, they function independently and provide idiosyncratic defense capabilities, distinguishing them from general stress response pathways. Our findings demonstrate that Arc3 family proteins provide specific protection against phospholipase toxins by preventing the accumulation of lysophospholipids in a manner distinct from previously characterized membrane repair systems. These findings liken the response of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> to bacterial threats to that of eukaryotic innate immunity, wherein threat detection leads to the activation of specialized defense systems.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Allele-specific gene expression can underlie altered transcript abundance in zebrafish mutants</a></h4>

              
                In model organisms, RNA sequencing is frequently used to assess the effect of genetic mutations on cellular and developmental processes. Typically, animals heterozygous for a mutation are crossed to produce offspring with different genotypes. Resultant embryos are grouped by genotype to compare homozygous mutant embryos to heterozygous and wild-type siblings. Genes that are differentially expressed between the groups are assumed to reveal insights into the pathways affected by the mutation. Here we show that in zebrafish, differentially expressed genes are often overrepresented on the same chromosome as the mutation due to different levels of expression of alleles from different genetic backgrounds. Using an incross of haplotype-resolved wild-type fish, we found evidence of widespread allele-specific expression, which appears as differential expression when comparing embryos homozygous for a region of the genome to their siblings. When analysing mutant transcriptomes, this means that the differential expression of genes on the same chromosome as a mutation of interest may not be caused by that mutation. Typically, the genomic location of a differentially expressed gene is not considered when interpreting its importance with respect to the phenotype. This could lead to pathways being erroneously implicated or overlooked due to the noise of spurious differentially expressed genes on the same chromosome as the mutation. These observations have implications for the interpretation of RNA-seq experiments involving outbred animals and non-inbred model organisms.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Mapping the functional connectivity of ecosystem services supply across a regional landscape</a></h4>

              
                Sustainably managing multifunctional landscapes for production of multiple ecosystem services (ES) requires thorough understanding of the interactions between ES and the ecological processes that drive them. We build upon landscape connectivity theory to present a spatial approach for assessing functional connections between multiple ES at the landscape scale, and take a closer look at the concept of ES interactions by explicitly representing the mechanisms behind the relationships between ES. We demonstrate application of the approach using existing ES supply mapping data for plant agriculture, waterflow regulation, and landscape aesthetics and map the functional connectivity between them. We find that, when weights of all linkages were amalgamated, areas of high-value connectivity are revealed that are not present on any individual ES supply area or pairwise link maps, which suggests that the spatial focus of planning for optimal service provisioning may shift when functional relationships between several ES are considered. From water flow supply areas, our modeling maps several functional connections that operate over both short and long distances, which highlights the importance of managing ES flows both locally and across jurisdictions. We also found that different land use and land cover types than those associated with ES supply areas may be serving as critical corridors connecting interdependent ES. By providing spatial information on ES connectivity, our approach enables local and regional environmental planning and management to take full consideration of the complex, multi-scale interactions between ecological processes, land use and land cover, and ecosystem service supply on a landscape.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Constructing the hierarchy of predictive auditory sequences in the marmoset brain</a></h4>

              
                Our brains constantly generate predictions of sensory input that are compared with actual inputs, propagate the prediction-errors through a hierarchy of brain regions, and subsequently update the internal predictions of the world. However, the essential feature of predictive coding, the notion of hierarchical depth and its neural mechanisms, remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigated the hierarchical depth of predictive auditory processing by combining functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and high-density whole-brain electrocorticography (ECoG) in marmoset monkeys during an auditory local-global paradigm in which the temporal regularities of the stimuli were designed at two hierarchical levels. The prediction-errors and prediction updates were examined as neural responses to auditory mismatches and omissions. Using fMRI, we identified a hierarchical gradient along the auditory pathway: midbrain and sensory regions represented local, shorter-time-scale predictive processing followed by associative auditory regions, whereas anterior temporal and prefrontal areas represented global, longer-time-scale sequence processing. The complementary ECoG recordings confirmed the activations at cortical surface areas and further differentiated the signals of prediction-error and update, which were transmitted via putative bottom-up g and top-down b oscillations, respectively. Furthermore, omission responses caused by absence of input, reflecting solely the two levels of prediction signals that are unique to the hierarchical predictive coding framework, demonstrated the hierarchical top-down process of predictions in the auditory, temporal, and prefrontal areas. Thus, our findings support the hierarchical predictive coding framework, and outline how neural networks and spatiotemporal dynamics are used to represent and arrange a hierarchical structure of auditory sequences in the marmoset brain.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Transcriptional heterogeneity of ventricular zone cells in the ganglionic eminences of the mouse forebrain</a></h4>

              
                The ventricular zone (VZ) of the nervous system contains radial glia cells that were originally considered relatively homogenous in their gene expression, but a detailed characterization of transcriptional diversity in these VZ cells has not been reported. Here, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing to characterize transcriptional heterogeneity of neural progenitors within the VZ and subventricular zone (SVZ) of the ganglionic eminences (GEs), the source of all forebrain GABAergic neurons. By using a transgenic mouse line to enrich for VZ cells, we characterize significant transcriptional heterogeneity, both between GEs and within spatial subdomains of specific GEs. Additionally, we observe differential gene expression between E12.5 and E14.5 VZ cells, which could provide insights into temporal changes in cell fate. Together, our results reveal a previously unknown spatial and temporal genetic diversity of VZ cells in the ventral forebrain that will aid our understanding of initial fate decisions in the forebrain.

                The cytoskeleton network of eukaryotic cells is essential for diverse cellular processes, including vesicle trafficking, cell motility and immunity, thus is a common target for bacterial virulence factors. A number of effectors from the bacterial pathogen <i>Legionella pneumophila</i> have been shown to modulate the function of host actin cytoskeleton to construct the Legionella-containing vacuole (LCV) permissive for its intracellular replication. In this study, we found that the Dot/Icm effector Lem8 (Lpg1290) is a protease whose activity is catalyzed by a Cys-His-Asp motif known to be associated with diverse biochemical activities. Intriguingly, we found that Lem8 interacts with the host regulatory protein 14-3-3ζ, which activates its protease activity. Furthermore, Lem8 undergoes self-cleavage in a process that requires 14-3-3ζ. We identified the Pleckstrin homology-like domain-containing protein Phldb2 involved in cytoskeleton organization as a target of Lem8 and demonstrated that Lem8 plays a role in the inhibition of host cell migration by attacking Phldb2.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Different computations over the same inputs produce selective behavior in algorithmic brain networks</a></h4>

              
                A key challenge in neuroimaging remains to understand where, when, and now particularly <i>how</i> human brain networks compute over sensory inputs to achieve behavior. To study such dynamic algorithms from mass neural signals, we recorded the magnetoencephalographic (MEG) activity of participants who resolved the classic XOR, OR, and AND functions as overt behavioral tasks (N = 10 participants/task, N-of-1 replications). Each function requires a different computation over the same inputs to produce the task-specific behavioral outputs. In each task, we found that source-localized MEG activity progresses through four computational stages identified within individual participants: (1) initial contralateral representation of each visual input in occipital cortex, (2) a joint linearly combined representation of both inputs in midline occipital cortex and right fusiform gyrus, followed by (3) nonlinear task-dependent input integration in temporal-parietal cortex, and finally (4) behavioral response representation in postcentral gyrus. We demonstrate the specific dynamics of each computation at the level of individual sources. The spatiotemporal patterns of the first two computations are similar across the three tasks; the last two computations are task specific. Our results therefore reveal where, when, and how dynamic network algorithms perform different computations over the same inputs to produce different behaviors.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Glycan processing in the Golgi: optimal information coding and constraints on cisternal number and enzyme specificity</a></h4>

              
                Many proteins that undergo sequential enzymatic modification in the Golgi cisternae are displayed at the plasma membrane as cell identity markers. The modified proteins, called glycans, represent a molecular code. The fidelity of this glycan code is measured by how accurately the glycan synthesis machinery realises the desired target glycan distribution for a particular cell type and niche. In this paper, we construct a simplified chemical synthesis model to quantitatively analyse the tradeoffs between the number of cisternae, and the number and specificity of enzymes, required to synthesize a prescribed target glycan distribution of a certain complexity to within a given fidelity. We find that to synthesize complex distributions, such as those observed in real cells, one needs to have multiple cisternae and precise enzyme partitioning in the Golgi. Additionally, for fixed number of enzymes and cisternae, there is an optimal level of specificity (promiscuity) of enzymes that achieves the target distribution with high fidelity. The geometry of the fidelity landscape in the multidimensional space of the number and specificity of enzymes, inter-cisternal transfer rates, and number of cisternae, provides a measure for robustness and identifies stiff and sloppy directions. Our results show how the complexity of the target glycan distribution and number of glycosylation enzymes places functional constraints on the Golgi cisternal number and enzyme specificity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sex differences in insular gyri responses to the cold pressor challenge</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Sex differences in autonomic control may contribute to physiological sex differences in cardiovascular disease, thermoregulation, and the experience of pain. We previously showed sex differences in functional mapping of autonomic responses across the insula, a central autonomic control region. Anterior insula response patterns to sympathetic activation (Valsalva) and parasympathetic withdrawal (handgrip) differed between men and women. We here assessed sex differences in autonomic insula gyrus responses to a cold pressor challenge, which involves temperature and pain regulation. Methods: Functional MRI (fMRI) involved a 1-minute right-foot cold pressor challenge in 22 women (age; mean{+/-}std: 50{+/-}4 yrs), and 39 men (45{+/-}3 yrs). Regions of interest (ROI) comprised left and right anterior short gyrus (ASG), middle short gyrus (MSG), posterior short gyrus (PSG), anterior long gyrus (ALG), and posterior long gyrus (PLG). Two-second time intervals of fMRI signal responses per ROI and concurrently recorded heart rate and blood oxygen saturation (SaO 2 ) were tested for within- and between-group effects over time (repeated measures ANOVA P [&le;]0.05). We tested sex differences in 1) each ROI; 2) lateralization effects; and 3) posterior-to-anterior gradients in responses. Results: No sex differences emerged in heart rate or SaO 2 . Women showed larger signal changes in several gyri than men after cold pressor onset and offset. Most consistently, women showed a greater right-over-left hemisphere dominance in cold pressor response compared to men in the MSG, PSG and ALG. Greater right-over-left hemisphere anterior-to-posterior dominance was more pronounced in men. Conclusions: The findings confirm anterior and right-hemispheric dominance of insular responses during sympathetic activation that includes pain and cold. Although distinct transient male-female differences in fMRI responses appeared during the cold pressor, unlike the Valsalva and handgrip, no sex differences in ASG lateralization emerged, suggesting that the previously found sex differences may not solely relate to regulating blood pressure responses.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Multisensory integration of social signals by a pathway from the basal amygdala to the auditory cortex in maternal mice</a></h4>

              
                Social encounters are inherently multimodal events, yet how and where social cues of distinct modalities merge and interact in the brain is poorly understood. For example, when their pups wander away from the nest, mother mice use a combination of vocal and olfactory signals emitted by the pups to locate and retrieve them. Previous work revealed the emergence of multisensory interactions in the auditory cortex (AC) of both dams and virgins who co-habitate with pups ('surrogates'). Here we identify a neural pathway that integrates information about odors with responses to sound. We found that a scattered population of glutamatergic neurons in the basal amygdala (BA) projects to the AC and responds to odors, including the smell of pups. These neurons also exhibit increased activity when the surrogate female is searching for pups. Finally, we show that selective optogenetic activation of BA-AC neurons modulates responses to pup calls, and that this modulation switches from predominantly suppressive to predominantly excitatory after maternal experience. This supports an underappreciated role for the amygdala in directly shaping sensory representations in an experience-dependent manner. We propose that the BA-AC pathway integrates olfaction and audition to facilitate maternal care, and speculate that it may carry valence information to the AC.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Functional connectivity of the inferior frontal gyrus: A meta-analytic connectivity modeling study</a></h4>

              
                Background: Neurocognitive models of language processing highlight the role of the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) in the functional network underlying language. Furthermore, neuroscience research has shown that IFG is not a uniform region anatomically, cytoarchitectonically or functionally. However, no previous study explored the language-related functional connectivity patterns of different IFG subdivisions using a meta-analytic connectivity approach. Purpose: The present meta-analytic connectivity modeling (MACM) study aimed to identify language-related coactivation patterns of the left and right IFG subdivisions. Method: Six regions of interest (ROIs) were defined using a probabilistic brain atlas corresponding to pars opercularis (BA44), pars triangularis (BA45) and pars orbitalis (Fo6&7) of IFG in both hemispheres. The ROIs were used to search the BrainMap functional database to identify neuroimaging experiments with healthy, right-handed participants reporting language-related activations in each ROI. Activation likelihood estimation analyses were then performed on the foci extracted from the identified studies to compute functional convergence for each ROI, which was also contrasted with the other ROIs within the same hemisphere. In addition, a behavioral analysis was conducted to determine functional specificity for language subdomains within each ROI. Results: A primarily left-lateralized functional network was revealed for the left and right IFG subdivisions. The left IFG ROIs exhibited a more robust coactivation pattern than the right IFG ROIs. In particular, the left posterior-dorsal IFG (BA44) was associated with the most extensive coactivation pattern involving bilateral frontal, bilateral parietal, left temporal, left subcortical (thalamus and putamen), and right cerebellar regions, while the left anterior-ventral IFG (BA45 and Fo6&7) revealed a predominantly left-lateralized involvement of frontotemporal regions. Conclusion: The findings align with the neurocognitive models of language processing that propose a division of labor among the left IFG subdivisions and their respective functional networks. Also, the opercular part of left IFG (BA44) stands out as a major hub in the language network with connections to diverse cortical, subcortical and cerebellar structures.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A call to rethink the cognitive benefits of physical exercise: An umbrella review of randomized controlled trials</a></h4>

              
                Many meta-analytic reviews have examined the cognitive benefits of regular physical exercise across the lifespan, with a wide range of inclusion criteria and disparate analytic approaches. In fact, most global health organizations incorporate the purported cognitive benefits as part of their policies to promote regular physical exercise. We assess whether those claims are well supported by scientific evidence. We conducted a pre-registered (PROSPERO: CRD42020191357) umbrella review of meta-analyses limited to randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on exercise-cognition. Outcomes of each meta-analysis were reanalyzed following a multilevel model approach. Publication bias was also analyzed to correct final effect sizes. Most of the 12 reviewed meta-analyses reported a positive small effect (d = 0.21, [0.07 0.40]) of physical exercise across all cognitive domains in all life stages. However, a critical assessment of the primary studies included in these reviews and the meta-analytic approaches used indicates that the evidence might not be reliable and therefore no strong conclusions should be drawn based on the existing evidence. We found that the literature has undergone an unusually rapid growth upon underpowered RCTs and potentially biased meta-analytic reviews. The exponential accumulation of low-quality evidence on the exercise-cognition topic has led to stagnation in the field, hindering the discernment of the potential impact of exercise on cognition. We urge worldwide organizations committed to public health to reconsider their recommendations on the promotion of regular physical exercise to boost cognitive functions in the healthy population until high-quality empirical evidence confirms these exercise-induced cognitive benefits.

                Traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) where neuroinflammation underlies disease progression and pathogenesis. Unresolved inflammation in AD is known to be exacerbated by brain deficits in unesterified pro-resolving lipid mediators enzymatically synthesized from polyunsaturated fatty acids. Recently, we reported that in the brain, unesterified pro-resolving lipid mediators which are bioactive, can also be supplied from less bioactive esterified lipid pools such as neutral lipids (NLs) and phospholipids (PLs). It is not known whether esterified pro-resolving lipid mediators are affected by AD pathology and exacerbated by TRAP exposure. In the present study we addressed this data gap using TgF344-AD male and female rats that express human AD risk genes and their wildtype littermates exposed to filtered air (FA) or TRAP from 1 to 15 months of age. Esterified lipid mediators within NLs and PLs were quantified by mass-spectrometry. We observed a significant reduction in pro-resolving lipid mediators in both NLs and PLs of female TgF344-AD rats compared to wildtype controls. TRAP exposure also reduced pro-resolving lipids in the female brain, mainly in PL pools, but did not exacerbate changes observed in TgF344-AD rats. Minimal changes were observed in males. Our findings indicate that AD genotype and chronic TRAP exposure result in sex-specific deficits in brain esterified pro-resolving lipid mediators, the pool that supplies free and bioactive lipid mediators. These data provide new information on lipid-mediated mechanisms regulating impaired inflammation resolution in AD, and show for the first time that chronic TRAP exposure targets the same lipid network implicated in AD.

                Ataxin-2 (ATXN2) is a gene implicated in spinocerebellar ataxia type II (SCA2), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Parkinsonism. The encoded protein is a therapeutic target for ALS and related conditions. ATXN2 (or Atx2 in insects) can function in translational activation, translational repression, mRNA stability and in the assembly of mRNP-granules, a process mediated by intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). Previous work has shown that the LSm (Like-Sm) domain of Atx2, which can help stimulate mRNA translation, antagonizes mRNP-granule assembly. Here we advance these findings through a series of experiments on Drosophila and human Ataxin-2 proteins. Results of Targets of RNA-Binding Proteins Identified by Editing (TRIBE), co-localization and immunoprecipitation experiments indicate that a polyA-binding protein (PABP) interacting, PAM2 motif of Ataxin-2 may be a major determinant of the mRNA and protein content of Ataxin-2 mRNP granules. Transgenic experiments in Drosophila indicate that while the Atx2-LSm domain may protect against neurodegeneration, structured PAM2- and unstructured IDR- interactions both support Atx2-induced cytotoxicity. Taken together, the data lead to a proposal for how Ataxin-2 interactions are remodelled during translational control and how structured and non-structured interactions contribute differently to the specificity and efficiency of RNP granule condensation as well as to neurodegeneration.

                Electrophysiological signatures of ischemic stroke might help to develop a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of recovery. Here, analyses of multichannel electrocorticography (ECoG) in awake mice demonstrated that the shape of power spectral density (PSD) is modulated in the vicinity of sensory cortical stroke. PSD consists of both rhythmic oscillatory and non-rhythmic, aperiodic components. The alteration of spectrum shape was reflected in a transient increase of aperiodic exponents, while the relative power and frequency of slow oscillations remained unchanged in the peri-infarct cortex. Exponents derived from motor areas significantly correlated with recovery of fine motor deficits of the contralateral forepaw thus indicating functional modifications of neuronal activity. In conclusion, aperiodic spectral exponents exhibited a unique spatiotemporal profile in the mouse cortex after stroke and might complement future studies providing a dynamic link from pathophysiology to behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">An electrophysiological and behavioral model of Paramecium, the "swimming neuron"</a></h4>

              
                Paramecium is a large unicellular organism that swims in fresh water using cilia. When stimulated by various means (mechanically, chemically, optically, thermally), it often swims backward then turns and swims forward again in a new direction: this is called the avoiding reaction. This reaction is triggered by a calcium-based action potential. For this reason, several authors have called Paramecium the "swimming neuron". Here we present an empirically constrained model of its action potential based on electrophysiology experiments on live immobilized paramecia, together with simultaneous measurement of ciliary beating using particle image velocimetry. Using these measurements and additional behavioral measurements of free swimming, we extend the electrophysiological model by coupling calcium concentration to kinematic parameters, turning it into a swimming model. In this way, we obtain a model of autonomously behaving Paramecium. Finally, we demonstrate how the modeled organism interacts with an environment, can follow gradients and display collective behavior. This work provides a modeling basis for investigating the physiological basis of autonomous behavior of Paramecium in ecological environments.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Decision formation in parietal cortex transcends a fixed frame of reference</a></h4>

              
                Neurons in the lateral intraparietal cortex (area LIP) represent the formation of a decision when it is linked to a specific action, such as an eye movement to a choice target. However, these neurons should be unable to represent a decision that transpires across actions that would disrupt this linkage. We investigated this limitation by recording simultaneously from many neurons. While intervening actions disrupt the representation by single neurons, the ensemble achieves continuity of the decision process by passing information from currently active neurons to neurons that will become active after the action. In this way, the representation of an evolving decision can be generalized across actions and transcends the frame of reference that specifies the neural response fields. The finding extends previous observations of receptive field remapping, thought to support the stability of perception across eye movements, to the continuity of a thought process, such as a decision.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Perceptual consequences of interocular imbalances in the duration of temporal integration</a></h4>

              
                Temporal differences in visual information processing between the eyes can cause dramatic misperceptions of motion and depth. Processing delays between the eyes cause the Pulfrich effect: oscillating targets in the frontal plane are misperceived as moving along near-elliptical motion trajectories in depth (Pulfrich, 1922). Here, we explain a previously reported but poorly understood variant: the anomalous Pulfrich effect. When this variant is perceived, the illusory motion trajectory appears oriented left- or right-side back in depth, rather than aligned with the true direction of motion. Our data indicate that this perceived misalignment is due to interocular differences in neural temporal integration periods, as opposed to interocular differences in delay. For oscillating motion, differences in the duration of temporal integration dampen the effective motion amplitude in one eye relative to the other. In a dynamic analog of the Geometric effect in stereo-surface-orientation perception (Ogle, 1950), the different motion amplitudes cause the perceived misorientation of the motion trajectories. Forced-choice psychophysical experiments, conducted with either different spatial frequencies and/or different onscreen motion damping in the two eyes, show that the perceived misorientation in depth is associated with the eye having greater motion damping. A target-tracking experiment provided more direct evidence that the anomalous Pulfrich effect is caused by interocular differences in temporal integration and delay. These findings highlight the computational hurdles posed to the visual system by temporal differences in sensory processing. Future work will explore how the visual system overcomes these challenges to achieve accurate perception.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sleep duration and brain structure - phenotypic associations and genotypic covariance</a></h4>

              
                The question of how much sleep is best for the brain attracts scientific and public interest, and there is concern that insuficient sleep leads to poorer brain health. However, it is unknown how much sleep is sufficient and how much is too much. We analyzed 51,295 brain magnetic resonnance images from 47,039 participants, and calculated the self-reported sleep duration associated with the largest regional volumes and smallest ventricles relative to intracranial volume (ICV) and thickest cortex. 6.8 hours of sleep was associated with the most favorable brain outcome overall. Critical values, defined by 95% confidence intervals, were 5.7 and 7.9 hours. There was regional variation, with for instance the hippocampus showing largest volume at 6.3 hours. Moderately long sleep (> 8 hours) was more strongly associated with smaller relative volumes, thinner cortex and larger ventricles than even very short sleep (< 5 hours), but effect sizes were modest. People with larger ICV reported longer sleep (7.5 hours), so not correcting for ICV yielded longer durations associated with maximal volume. Controlling for socioeconomic status, body mass index and depression symptoms did not alter the associations. Genetic analyses showed that genes related to longer sleep in short sleepers were related to shorter sleep in long sleepers. This may indicate a genetically controlled homeostatic regulation of sleep duration. Mendelian randomization analyses did not suggest sleep duration to have a causal impact on brain structure in the analyzed datasets. The findings challenge the notion that habitual short sleep is negatively related to brain structure.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">2-Arachodonoylglycerol-mediated endocannabinoid signaling modulates mechanical hypersensitivity associated with alcohol withdrawal in mice</a></h4>

              
                Alcohol use disorder (AUDs) commonly co-occurs in patients with chronic pain, and a major barrier to achieving abstinence and preventing relapse is the emergence of hyperalgesia during alcohol withdrawal. Elucidating novel therapeutic approaches to target hyperalgesia associated with alcohol withdrawal could have important implications for the treatment of AUD. Here we examined the role of 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG)-mediated endocannabinoid (eCB) signaling in the regulation of hyperalgesia associated with alcohol withdrawal in mice and tested the hypothesis that pharmacological augmentation of 2-AG signaling could reduce hyperalgesia during withdrawal. After 72 hours of withdrawal from a continuous access two-bottle choice drinking paradigm, male and female mice exhibited increased mechanical but not thermal hypersensitivity, which normalized by 7 days. This effect was reversed by pretreatment with the monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) inhibitor JZL184, which elevates levels of 2-AG. The effects of JZL184 were prevented by coadministration of either a CB1 or CB2 antagonist. Inhibition of the 2-AG synthetic enzyme diacylglycerol lipase (DAGL) with DO34 exacerbated mechanical hypersensitivity during alcohol withdrawal, causing an earlier onset and persistent hypersensitivity even one week into withdrawal. Our findings demonstrate the critical role of 2-AG signaling in the bidirectional regulation of mechanical sensitivity during alcohol withdrawal, with enhancement of 2-AG levels reducing sensitivity, and inhibition of 2-AG synthesis exacerbating sensitivity. These data suggest 2-AG augmentation could represent a novel approach to the treatment of alcohol withdrawal-associated hyperalgesia and AUD in patients with comorbid pain disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Contribution of individual excitatory synapses on dendritic spines to electrical signaling</a></h4>

              
                Even though dendritic spines are widely considered the elementary computational units of the brain, the current understanding of the exact contribution of individual synapses on spines to the electrical signaling in neurons is incomplete. We combined the techniques of whole-cell recording and voltage imaging to monitor directly unitary excitatory postsynaptic potentials evoked by two-photon glutamate uncaging (uEPSPs) on individual dendritic spines. We analyzed the initiation, temporal summation, and propagation of uEPSPs from the spine head to the parent dendrite and to the cell body in neocortical pyramidal neurons. Our measurements show no significant attenuation of uEPSPs across the spine neck in different types of pyramidal neurons. This result implies that spine synapses are not electrically isolated from parent dendrites and that spines do not serve a meaningful electrical role. Using the same techniques, we next characterized temporal summation of uEPSPs induced at individual spine synapses by repetitive glutamate uncaging mimicking burst activity of presynaptic neurons. We found that pharmacological block of desensitization of AMPA receptors increased the amplitude of cumulative uEPSP response in the spines head and, consequently, in parent dendrite and soma. Thus, responses to high frequency repetitive quantal EPSPs are strictly limited in amplitude and waveform by AMPA receptor desensitization at the site of origin thereby preventing synaptic saturation.

                Techniques to identify monosynaptic connections between neurons have been vital for neuroscience research, facilitating important advancements concerning network topology, synaptic plasticity, and synaptic integration, among others. Here, we introduce a novel approach to identify and monitor monosynaptic connections using high-resolution dendritic spine Ca2+ imaging combined with simultaneous large-scale recording of extracellular electrical activity by means of high-density microelectrode arrays (HD-MEAs). We introduce an easily adoptable analysis pipeline that associates the imaged spine with its presynaptic unit and test it on in vitro recordings. The method is further validated and optimized by simulating synaptically-evoked spine Ca2+ transients based on measured spike trains in order to obtain simulated ground-truth connections. The proposed approach offers unique advantages as i) it can be used to identify monosynaptic connections with an accurate localization of the synapse within the dendritic tree, ii) it provides precise information of presynaptic spiking, and iii) postsynaptic spine Ca2+ signals and, finally, iv) the non-invasive nature of the proposed method allows for long-term measurements. The analysis toolkit together with the rich data sets that were acquired are made publicly available for further exploration by the research community.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Effects of auditory sleep modulation approaches on brain oscillatory and cardiovascular dynamics</a></h4>

              
                Sleep modulation techniques to elucidate the functional role of sleep brain oscillations in brain and body functions have gained large interest. Slow waves, the hallmark feature of deep non-rapid eye movement sleep, do potentially drive restorative effects on brain and cardiovascular functions. Auditory stimulation to modulate slow waves is a promising tool, however, directly comparing different auditory stimulation approaches within a night and analyzing induced dynamic brain and cardiovascular effects are yet missing. Here, we tested various auditory stimulation approaches in a windowed, 10 s ON (stimulations) followed by 10 s OFF (no stimulations), within-night stimulation design and compared them to a SHAM control condition. We report the results of three studies and a total of 51 included stimulation nights. We found a large and global increase in slow wave activity (SWA) in the stimulation window compared to SHAM. Furthermore, slow wave dynamics were most pronouncedly increased at the start of the stimulation and declined across the stimulation window. Beyond the changes in brain oscillations, we observed, for some conditions, a significant increase in the mean interval between two heartbeats within a stimulation window, indicating a slowing of the heart rate, and increased heart rate variability derived parasympathetic activity. Those cardiovascular changes were positively correlated with the change in SWA and thus, our findings provide mechanistic insight into the potential of auditory slow wave enhancement to modulate cardiovascular restorative conditions during sleep. However, future studies need to investigate whether the potentially increased restorative capacity through slow wave enhancements translates into a more rested cardiovascular system on the subsequent day.

                In vitro models of corticogenesis using mouse and human pluripotent stem cells (PSC) have greatly improved our understanding of human brain development and disease. Among these, 3D cortical organoid systems are able to recapitulate some aspects of in vivo cytoarchitecture of the developing cortex. Here, we tested three cortical organoid protocols for brain regional identity, cell type-specificity and neuronal maturation. Overall all protocols gave rise to organoids that displayed a time-dependent expression of neuronal maturation genes such as those involved in the establishment of synapses and neuronal function. We showed that three months old cortical organoids showed a pattern of gene expression that resembled late human embryonic cortex. Comparatively, directed differentiation methods without WNT activation gave rise to the highest degree of cortical regional identity in brain organoids. Whereas, default intrinsic brain organoid differentiation produced the broadest range of cell types such as neurons, astrocytes and hematopoietic-lineage derived microglia cells of the brain. These results suggest that cortical organoid models produce diverse outcomes in terms of brain regional identity and cell type specificity and emphasize the importance of selecting the correct model for the right application.

                Glial cells play a crucial role in regulating physiological and pathological functions, such as sensation, infections, acute injuries, and chronic neurodegenerative disorders. Glial cells include astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system (CNS) and satellite glial cells (SGCs) in the peripheral nervous system (PNS). Despite the understanding of glial subtypes and functional heterogeneity in animal models achieved by single-cell or single-nucleus RNA sequencing, no research has investigated the transcriptomic profiles of glial cells in the human PNS and spinal cord. Here, we used high-throughput single-nucleus RNA sequencing to map the cellular and molecular heterogeneity of SGCs in the human dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes in the human spinal cord. To explore the conservation and divergence across species, we compared these human findings with those from mice. Additionally, the expression profiles of risk genes of common DRG and spinal cord diseases in glial cells were compared between humans and mice. As a result, little SGCs heterogeneity was found in both human and mouse DRG. In the human spinal cord, astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes were respectively divided into six distinct transcriptomic subclusters. In the mouse spinal cord, astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes were divided into six, five, and six distinct transcriptomic subclusters, respectively. The comparative results revealed substantial heterogeneity in all glial cells between humans and mice. Notably, we also identified transcriptomic heterogeneity in several classical genes and risk genes for neurological disorders across humans and mice. Together, the present data comprehensively profiled glial cell heterogeneity and provides a powerful resource for investigating the cellular basis of glial-related physiological and pathological conditions in peripheral somatosensory system.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Structural insight into the individual variability architecture of the functional brain connectome</a></h4>

              
                Human cognition and behaviors depend upon the brain's functional connectomes, which vary remarkably across individuals. However, whether and how the functional connectome individual variability architecture is structurally constrained remains largely unknown. Using tractography- and morphometry-based network models, we observed the spatial convergence of structural and functional connectome individual variability, with higher variability in heteromodal association regions and lower variability in primary regions. We demonstrated that functional variability is significantly predicted by a unifying structural variability pattern and that this prediction follows a primary-to-heteromodal hierarchical axis, with higher prediction accuracy in primary regions and lower accuracy in heteromodal regions. We also decomposed group-level connectome variability patterns into individual unique contributions and uncovered the structural-functional correspondence that is associated with individual cognitive traits. These results advance our understanding of the structural basis of individual functional variability and suggest the importance of integrating multimodal connectome signatures for individual differences in cognition and behaviors.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Targeting the fronto-parietal network using multifocal personalized transcranial alternating current stimulation to enhance motor sequence learning in healthy older adults</a></h4>

              
                Abstract Background Healthy older adults show a decrease in motor learning capacity as well as in working memory (WM) performance. WM has been suggested to be involved in motor learning processes, such as sequence learning. Correlational evidence has shown the involvement of the fronto-parietal network (FPN), a network underlying WM processes, in motor sequence learning. However, causal evidence is currently lacking. Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) studies have focused so far predominantly on motor related areas to enhance motor sequence learning while areas associated with more cognitive aspects of motor learning have not yet been addressed. Hypothesis In this study, we aim to provide causal evidence for the involvement of WM processes and the underlying FPN in successful motor sequence learning by using a theta transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) paradigm targeting the FPN during motor sequence learning. Methods In a cohort of 20 healthy older adults, we applied bifocal tACS in the theta range to the FPN during a sequence learning task. With the use of a double-blind, cross-over design, we tested the efficacy of active compared with sham stimulation. Two versions of the motor task were used: one with high and one with low WM load, to explore the efficacy of stimulation on tasks differing in WM demand. Additionally, the effects of stimulation on WM performance were addressed using an N-back task. The tACS frequency was personalized by means of EEG measuring the individual theta peak frequency during the N-back task. Results The application of personalized theta tACS to the FPN improved performance on the motor sequence learning task with high WM load (p <.001), but not with low WM load. Active stimulation significantly improved both speed (p <.001), and accuracy (p =.03) during the task with high WM load. In addition, the stimulation paradigm improved performance on the N-back task for the 2-back task (p = .013), but not for 1-back and 3-back. Conclusion Motor sequence learning can be enhanced with the use of personalized bifocal theta tACS to the FPN when WM load is high. This indicates that the efficacy of this stimulation paradigm is dependent on the cognitive demand during the learning task and provides further causal evidence for the critical involvement of WM processes and the FPN in motor sequence learning in healthy older adults. These findings open new exciting possibilities to counteract the age-related decline in motor learning capacity and WM performance.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Predator odor (TMT) exposure potentiates interoceptive sensitivity to alcohol and increases GABAergic gene expression in the anterior insular cortex and nucleus accumbens in male rats</a></h4>

              
                Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) confers enhanced vulnerability to develop comorbid alcohol use disorder (AUD). Exposure to the scent of a predator, such as the fox odor TMT, has been used to model a traumatic stressor with relevance to PTSD symptomatology. Alcohol produces distinct interoceptive (subjective) effects that may influence vulnerability to problem drinking and AUD. As such, understanding the lasting impact of stressor on sensitivity to the interoceptive effects of alcohol is clinically relevant. The present study used a 2-lever, operant drug discrimination procedure to train male, Long-Evans rats to discriminate the interoceptive effects of alcohol (2 g/kg, IG) from water. Upon stable performance, rats underwent a 15-min exposure to TMT. Two weeks later, an alcohol dose-response curve was conducted to evaluate the lasting effects of the TMT stressor on the interoceptive effects of alcohol. The TMT group showed a leftward shift in ED50 of the dose response curve compared to controls, reflecting potentiated interoceptive sensitivity to alcohol. TMT exposure did not affect response rate. GABAergic signaling in both the anterior insular cortex (aIC) and the nucleus accumbens (Acb) is involved in the interoceptive effects of alcohol and stressor-induced adaptations. As such, follow-up experiments in alcohol-naive rats examined neuronal activation (as measured by c-Fos immunoreactivity) following TMT and showed that TMT exposure increased c-Fos expression in the aIC and the nucleus accumbens core (AcbC). 2 weeks after TMT exposure, Gad-1 gene expression was elevated in the aIC and Gat-1 was increased in the Acb compared to controls. Lastly, the alcohol discrimination and alcohol-naive groups displayed dramatic differences in stress reactive behaviors during the TMT exposure, suggesting that alcohol exposure may alter the behavioral response to predator odor. Together, these data suggest that predator odor stressor results in potentiated sensitivity to alcohol possibly through GABAergic adaptations in the aIC and Acb, which may be relevant to understanding PTSD-AUD comorbidity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Botulinum neurotoxin accurately separates tonic vs phasic transmission and reveals heterosynaptic plasticity rules in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                In developing and mature nervous systems, diverse neuronal subtypes innervate common targets to establish and maintain functional neural circuits. A major challenge towards understanding the structural and functional architecture of neural circuits is to separate these inputs and determine their intrinsic and heterosynaptic relationships. The Drosophila larval neuromuscular junction is a powerful model system to study these questions, where two glutamatergic motor neurons, the strong phasic-like Is and weak tonic-like Ib, co-innervate individual muscle targets to coordinate locomotor behavior. However, complete neurotransmission from each input has never been electrophysiologically separated. We have developed a botulinum neurotoxin, BoNT-C, that eliminates both spontaneous and evoked neurotransmission without perturbing synaptic growth or structure, enabling the first approach that accurately isolates input-specific neurotransmission. Selective expression of BoNT-C in Is or Ib motor inputs disambiguates functional properties of each input. Importantly, the composite values of Is and Ib neurotransmission can be fully recapitulated by isolated physiology from each input. Finally, selective silencing by BoNT-C does not induce heterosynaptic structural or functional plasticity at the convergent input. Thus, BoNT-C establishes the first approach to cleanly separate neurotransmission between tonic vs phasic neurons and defines heterosynaptic plasticity rules in a powerful model glutamatergic circuit.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dissociable misconfigurations of striatal functional connectivity profiles in smokers</a></h4>

              
                Corticostriatal circuits are central to reward processing and reinforcement learning functions that often become dysregulated in substance use disorder (SUD) and drive compulsive drug use. Human neuroimaging research seeking to identify how corticostriatal circuits become altered in SUD has primarily focused on evaluating connectivity between cortex-striatum node-pairs. Yet, striatal nodes receive appreciable input from many cortical nodes, and the morphological and electrophysiological properties of striatal nodes dictate that combinational features of their multivariate "connectivity profiles" shape their activity more so than any individual cortical node. Here, we introduce an approach for quantifying and statistically evaluating different types of multivariate connectivity profile configuration differences (i.e., aggregate divergence, rank order arrangement, and entropy shift) that may reflect different forms of circuit plasticity, and apply it to nicotine dependent smokers (n=46) as an exemplar SUD. Foremost, we find evidence of significant connectivity profile misconfiguration throughout much of the striatum, suggesting that prior findings of abnormal connections between individual striatal-cortical node-pairs may only represent the "tip of the iceberg" of corticostriatal circuit alteration in nicotine dependence. Moreover, we find that dorsolateral and ventromedial striatum display distinct types of connectivity profile misconfiguration. Whereas dorsolateral striatum almost exclusively displays abnormal rank order arrangement that is present in both the nicotine sated and acutely abstinent states - indicative of a "trait" misconfiguration - ventromedial striatum almost exclusively displays abnormal aggregate divergence that only manifests during acute abstinence - indicative of a "state" misconfiguration. Further, we identify a unique striatal site in the right caudal ventral putamen that displays multiple forms of connectivity profile misconfiguration, where connections with cognitive processing cortical areas overtake those with motor/premotor control cortical areas as the strongest in the connectivity profile, and acute abstinence significantly strengthens this abnormal arrangement. Moreover, the interactive magnitude of these misconfigurations during acute abstinence is significantly linked to dependence severity. Collectively, the present findings underscore the need for increased examination of connectivity profile misconfigurations as a mechanism of SUD etiology and as a potential guide for identifying therapeutic intervention targets.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Oligodendrocytes form paranodal bridges that generate chains of myelin sheaths vulnerable to degeneration with age</a></h4>

              
                Myelin sheaths in the CNS are generated by the tips of oligodendrocyte processes, which wrap axons to accelerate action potential conduction, provide metabolic support and control excitability. Here we identify a distinct mode of myelination, conserved between zebrafish, mouse and human, in which oligodendrocytes extend myelin along individual axons by linking myelin sheaths across nodes of Ranvier (NoR). By forming thin extensions that cross NoR, which we term paranodal bridges, multiple sheaths can be connected to the soma by a single cytoplasmic process. Extensive in vivo live imaging-based analyses, complemented by serial electron microscopic reconstruction of paranodal bridges, revealed that many oligodendrocytes use this strategy to generate longer stretches of myelin along individual axons. In the mouse somatosensory cortex, paranodal bridges were particularly prevalent along the highly branched axons of parvalbumin expressing (PV) interneurons, which enabled oligodendrocytes to extend myelin sheaths around axon bifurcations. Sheaths at the distal ends of these chains of myelin degenerated more frequently in aged mice, suggesting that they may be more vulnerable to the aging brain environment. This previously undescribed and evolutionarily conserved feature of oligodendrocytes extends myelin coverage of individual axons without new oligodendrogenesis, which may reduce metabolic demand and preserve the fidelity of action potential propagation at axon branch points.

                We report consistent increases in phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) expression in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) (3xTg-AD) and related tauopathy (PS19), particularly in hippocampal astrocytes. Human single-cell RNA- sequencing data reveal a sequential increase of PHGDH expression in people with no, early, and late AD pathology, which is corroborated by protein mass spectrometry and immunohistochemical analyses of three independent cohorts. A sequential increase of PHGDH expression also correlates with increasing clinical AD symptoms and worsening cognitive decline in patients. The consistent increase of PHGDH expression in six AD cohorts (Mayo, ROSMAP, Mount Sinai, Baltimore, Amsterdam, and UCSD/UCI) corroborates with the recent report of PHGDH extracellular RNA in blood plasma as a candidate biomarker for early diagnosis of AD and offers a caution to the suggested use of L-serine as a potential therapy of AD.

                Memory, one of the hallmarks of human cognition, can be modified when humans voluntarily modulate single neuron or neural population activity using neurofeedback. However, it is currently unknown whether memory is facilitated or impaired after such neural perturbation. In this study, participants memorized objects while we trained them with abstract neurofeedback to modulate their brain activity patterns in the ventral visual stream to represent either faces or houses. The neurofeedback created an implicit face or house context in the brain while memorizing the objects. The results revealed that participants created associations between each memorized object and its implicit context solely due to the neurofeedback manipulation. Our findings shed light onto how memory formation can be influenced by synthetic memory tags with neurofeedback and advance our understanding of mnemonic processing.

                Many patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) experience impairments in cognition and memory with few therapeutic options currently available to mitigate them. This has fueled interest in determining how factors including biological sex and sex hormones might modulate higher order function in PD. Previous studies have investigated this in female rats and in gonadally intact and gonadectomized males, with and without hormone replacement, that received bilateral neostriatal 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesions to model PD. Barnes maze and What Where When Episodic-like memory testing showed that 6-OHDA lesions disrupted spatial working and episodic memory functions in both sexes, and that in males, androgen-sensitive behaviors could be rescued in subjects where circulating androgen levels were diminished. Here we tested similar animal groups using the Novel Object Preference (NOP) and Object-in-Place (OiP) tasks. This revealed two entirely different patterns of sex and sex hormone influence. First, for both tasks, 6-ODHA lesions impaired object discrimination in males but not females. Further, for the NOP task, 6-OHDA lesions disrupted discrimination in males rats independently of hormone status. And finally, 6-OHDA lesions impaired OiP performance in males regardless of whether androgen levels were high or low but had no effect on discrimination in gonadectomized rats given 17{beta}-estradiol. Together with previous findings, these data identify the impacts of sex and sex hormones on cognition and memory in PD as behavioral task/behavioral domain specific. This specificity could explain why a cohesive clinical picture of endocrine impacts on higher order function in PD has remained elusive.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Conflict- and error-related theta activities are coupled to BOLD signals in different brain regions</a></h4>

              
                Both conflict and error processing have been linked to the midfrontal theta power (4-8 Hz) increase as indicated by EEG studies and greater hemodynamic activity in the anterior midcingulate cortex (aMCC) as indicated by fMRI studies. Conveniently, the source of the midfrontal theta power was estimated in or nearby aMCC. However, previous studies using concurrent EEG and fMRI recordings in resting-state or other cognitive tasks observed only a negative relationship between theta power and BOLD signal in the brain regions typically showing task-related deactivations. In this study, we used a simultaneous EEG-fMRI technique to investigate a trial-by-trial coupling between theta power and hemodynamic activity during the performance of two conflict tasks. Independent component analysis (ICA) was applied to denoise the EEG signal and select individual midfrontal EEG components, whereas group ICA was applied to fMRI data to obtain a functional parcellation of the frontal cortex. Using a linear mixed-effect model, theta power was coupled with the peak of hemodynamic responses from various frontal, cingulate, and insular cortical sites to unravel the potential brain sources that contribute to conflict- and error-related theta variability. Although several brain regions exhibited conflict-related increases in hemodynamic activity, the conflict pre-response theta showed only a negative correlation to BOLD signal in the midline area 9 (MA9), a region exhibiting conflict-sensitive deactivation. Conversely, and more expectedly, error-related theta showed a positive relationship to activity in the aMCC. Our results provide novel evidence suggesting that the amplitude of pre-response theta reflects the process of active inhibition that suppresses the MA9 activity. This process is affected independently by the stimulus congruency, reaction times variance, and is susceptible to the time-on-task effect. Finally, it predicts the commitment of an omission error. Together, our findings highlight that conflict- and error-related theta oscillations represent fundamentally different processes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Synaptic basis of a sub-second representation of time</a></h4>

              
                Temporal sequences of neural activity are essential for driving well-timed behaviors, but the underlying cellular and circuit mechanisms remain elusive. We leveraged the well-defined architecture of the cerebellum, a brain region known to support temporally precise actions, to explore theoretically whether the experimentally observed diversity of short-term synaptic plasticity (STP) at the input layer could generate neural dynamics sufficient for subsecond temporal learning. Simulated synaptic input generated a diverse set of transient, firing patterns in granule cells (GCs) that provided a temporal basis set for learning precisely timed pauses of Purkinje cell activity associated with delayed eyelid conditioning and Bayesian interval estimation. The learning performance across time intervals was influenced by the temporal bandwidth of the GC basis, which was determined by the input layer synaptic properties. The ubiquity of STP throughout the brain positions it as a general, tunable cellular mechanism for sculpting neural dynamics and fine-tuning behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Awake responses suggest inefficient dense coding in the mouse retina</a></h4>

              
                The structure and function of the vertebrate retina have been extensively studied across species with an isolated, ex vivo preparation. Retinal function in vivo, however, remains elusive, especially in awake animals. Here we performed single-unit extracellular recordings in the optic tract of head-fixed mice to compare the output of awake, anesthetized, and ex vivo retinas. While the visual response properties were overall similar, we found that awake retinal output had 1) faster kinetics with less variability in the response latencies across different cell types; and 2) higher firing activity, by ~20 Hz on average, for both baseline and visually evoked responses. Notably, unlike the other conditions, many awake ON cells did not increase firing in response to light increments due to high baseline activity near saturation. Instead, they encoded light intensity fluctuations primarily by decreasing firing upon light decrements. In either condition, the visual message remains the same: the more spikes, the higher light intensity. The awake response patterns, however, violate efficient coding principles, predicting that sensory systems should favor firing patterns minimizing energy consumption. Our findings suggest that the retina employs dense coding in vivo, rather than sparse efficient coding as suggested from previous ex vivo studies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Perinatal Oxycodone Exposure Causes Long Term Sex-Dependent Changes in Sensory and Reward Processing in Adult Mice</a></h4>

              
                In utero opioid exposure is associated with lower weight and a Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome (NOWS) at birth, along with longer-term adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes and mood disorders. While NOWS is sometimes treated with continued opioids, clinical studies have not addressed if long-term neurobehavioral outcomes are worsened with continued postnatal exposure to opioids. In addition, pre-clinical studies comparing in utero only opioid exposure to continued post-natal opioid administration for withdrawal mitigation are lacking. Therefore, we implemented a rodent perinatal opioid exposure model of Oxycodone (Oxy) exposure for comparison of long-term consequences of Oxy exposure until birth (Short Oxy) to the impact of continued postnatal opioid exposure (Long Oxy) spanning gestation through birth and lactation. Short Oxy exposure was associated with a sex-specific increase in weight gain trajectory in adult male mice. Long Oxy exposure caused an increased weight gain trajectory in adult males, sex-dependent changes in morphine conditioned place preference, and alterations in nociceptive processing in females. Importantly, there was no evidence of long-term social behavioral deficits, anxiety, hyperactivity, or memory deficits following Short or Long Oxy exposure. Our findings suggest that offspring with prolonged opioid exposure experienced some long-term sequelae compared to pups with opioid cessation at birth. These results highlight the potential long-term consequences of opioid administration as a mitigation strategy for clinical NOWS symptomology and suggest alternatives should be explored.

	<p>Altered interoception, or the processing of bodily signals, has been argued to play a role in the development and maintenance of substance use disorders (SUD). Therefore, interoceptive interventions focusing on bodily awareness, such as mindfulness meditation, may improve treatment outcomes for individuals with SUD. Here we review: (1) subjective, behavioral and brain evidence for altered interoceptive processing in SUD, focusing on insular and anterior cingulate cortices (INS, ACC), key regions for interoceptive processing; (2) research highlighting links between mindfulness and brain function; and (3) extant brain research investigating mindfulness-based interventions in SUD. SUD tend to be characterized by heightened INS and ACC responses to drug cues but blunted interoceptive awareness and attenuated INS and ACC responses during tasks involving bodily attention and/or perturbations. In contrast, mindfulness interventions in healthy individuals are linked to enhanced INS and ACC responses and heightened interoceptive awareness. It is crucial for future research to identify: (1) whether mindfulness-based treatments are efficacious across substance classes; (2) what particular approaches and dosages show the largest effect sizes in enhancing INS and ACC function to non-drug stimuli and reducing responsivity to substance cues, thereby improving SUD treatment outcomes (reducing drug craving and relapse).</p>

	<p>It has been shown that learned temporal information can be exploited to help facilitate the target identification in the attentional blink task. Here, we tested whether similar exploitation also worked on short-term temporal information, even when it did not reliably predict the target onset. In two experiments, we randomly manipulated either the interval between targets (T1 and T2; Experiment 1) or the temporal regularity of stimulus presentation (Experiment 2) in each trial. The results revealed evidence of effects of immediate temporal experience mainly on T2 performances but also occasionally on T1 performances. In general, the accuracy of T2 was enhanced when a longer inter-target interval was explicitly processed in the preceding trial (Experiment 1) or the temporal regularity, regardless of being explicitly or implicitly processed, was present in the stimulus stream, especially after T1 (Experiment 2). These results suggest that, under high temporal uncertainty, both interval and rhythmic cues can still be exploited to regulate the allocation of processing resources, thus, modulating the target identification in the attentional blink task, consistent with the view of flexible attentional allocation, and further highlighting the importance of the interplay between temporal processing and attentional control in the conscious visual perception.</p>

	<p>p27 and p57 are tumor suppressors that are dysregulated in many cancers. We investigated the immunohistochemical expression of p27 and p57 in ependymoma, with a secondary emphasis on cyclin D1, nestin, and Ki-67. Sixty-five patients diagnosed with ependymoma were included. Clinical and tumoral data were retrieved, and the expression of p27, p57, cyclin D1, nestin, and Ki-67 was measured. Pearson&amp;amp;rsquo;s &amp;amp;chi;2 test was used to measure associations and the Kaplan&amp;amp;ndash;Meier method was used for survival analysis. p27 underexpression was significantly associated with pseudopalisading necrosis in tumors with foci of necrosis (p = 0.004). Cyclin D1 overexpression was associated with intracranial (p = 0.044), recurrent (p = 0.022) and grade 3 tumors (p = 0.016); nestin overexpression was associated with supratentorial (p = 0.025), mitotically active (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), and grade 3 tumors (p = 0.004); Ki-67 overexpression was associated with supratentorial (p = 0.044) and grade 3 tumors (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) and the 3 main features of anaplasia. None of the markers were intercorrelated or predictive of overall survival. In conclusion, p27 underexpression in tumors with foci of necrosis signals a pseudopalisading pattern. Cyclin D1, nestin, and Ki-67 are useful markers in ependymoma, but evidence-based cutoff values are required to standardize this interpretation.</p>

	<p>This research integrates key concepts of Computational Neuroscience, including the Bienestock-CooperMunro (BCM) rule, Spike Timing-Dependent Plasticity Rules (STDP), and the Temporal Difference Learning algorithm, with an important structure of Deep Learning (Convolutional Networks) to create an architecture with the potential of replicating observations of some cognitive experiments (particularly, those that provided some basis for sequential reasoning) while sharing the advantages already achieved by the previous proposals. In particular, we present Ring Model B, which is capable of associating visual with auditory stimulus, performing sequential predictions, and predicting reward from experience. Despite its simplicity, we considered such abilities to be a first step towards the formulation of more general models of prelinguistic reasoning.</p>

	<p>Repetitive peripheral magnetic stimulation (rPMS) is a non-invasive neuromodulation technique. Magnetic fields induced by rPMS pass through almost all materials, and it has clinical applications for neurorehabilitation. However, the effects of rPMS through clothing and orthosis on induced movement and corticospinal excitability remain unclear. The aim of this study was to determine whether rPMS induces movement and enhances corticospinal excitability through hand splint materials. rPMS was applied directly to the skin (L0) and through one (L1) or two (L2) layers of splint material in 14 healthy participants at 25-Hz, 2-s train per 6 s for a total of 20 min. rPMS was delivered to the forearm with the stimulus intensity set to 1.5-times the train intensity-induced muscle contractions under the L0 condition. We recorded induced wrist movements during rPMS and motor-evoked potentials of the extensor carpi radialis pre- and post-application. The results showed that rPMS induced wrist movements in L0 and L1, and it facilitated corticospinal excitability in L0 but not in L1 and L2. This suggests that rPMS can make electromagnetic induction on periphery even when applied over clothing and orthosis and demonstrates the potential clinical applications of this technique for neurorehabilitation.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Following traumatic brain injury (TBI), cognitive impairments manifest through interactions between microscopic and macroscopic changes. On the microscale, a neurometabolic cascade alters neurotransmission, while on the macroscale diffuse axonal injury impacts the integrity of long-range connections. Large-scale brain network modeling allows us to make predictions across these spatial scales by integrating neuroimaging data with biophysically based models to investigate how microscale changes invisible to conventional neuroimaging influence large-scale brain dynamics. To this end, we analyzed structural and functional neuroimaging data from a well characterized sample of 44 adult TBI patients recruited from a regional trauma center, scanned at 1&ndash;2 weeks postinjury, and with follow-up behavioral outcome assessed 6 months later. Thirty-six age-matched healthy adults served as comparison participants. Using The Virtual Brain, we fit simulations of whole-brain resting-state functional MRI to the empirical static and dynamic functional connectivity of each participant. Multivariate partial least squares (PLS) analysis showed that patients with acute traumatic intracranial lesions had lower cortical regional inhibitory connection strengths than comparison participants, while patients without acute lesions did not differ from the comparison group. Further multivariate PLS analyses found correlations between lower semiacute regional inhibitory connection strengths and more symptoms and lower cognitive performance at a 6 month follow-up. Critically, patients without acute lesions drove this relationship, suggesting clinical relevance of regional inhibitory connection strengths even when traumatic intracranial lesions were not present. Our results suggest that large-scale connectome-based models may be sensitive to pathophysiological changes in semi-acute phase TBI patients and predictive of their chronic outcomes.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Parvalbumin-positive (Pvalb<sup>+</sup>) and somatostatin-positive (Sst<sup>+</sup>) cells are the two largest subgroups of inhibitory interneurons. Studies in visual cortex indicate that synaptic connections between Pvalb<sup>+</sup> cells are common while connections between Sst<sup>+</sup> interneurons have not been observed. The inhibitory connectivity and kinetics of these two interneuron subpopulations, however, have not been characterized in medial entorhinal cortex (mEC). Using fluorescence-guided paired recordings in mouse brain slices from interneurons and excitatory cells in layer 2/3 mEC, we found that, unlike neocortical measures, Sst<sup>+</sup> cells inhibit each other, albeit with a lower probability than Pvalb<sup>+</sup> cells (18% vs 36% for unidirectional connections). Gap junction connections were also more frequent between Pvalb<sup>+</sup> cells than between Sst<sup>+</sup> cells. Pvalb<sup>+</sup> cells inhibited each other with larger conductances, smaller decay time constants, and shorter delays. Similarly, synaptic connections between Pvalb<sup>+</sup> and excitatory cells were more likely and expressed faster decay times and shorter delays than those between Sst<sup>+</sup> and excitatory cells. Inhibitory cells exhibited smaller synaptic decay time constants between interneurons than on their excitatory targets. Inhibition between interneurons also depressed faster, and to a greater extent. Finally, inhibition onto layer 2 pyramidal and stellate cells originating from Pvalb<sup>+</sup> interneurons were very similar, with no significant differences in connection likelihood, inhibitory amplitude, and decay time. A model of short-term depression fitted to the data indicates that recovery time constants for refilling the available pool are in the range of 50&ndash;150 ms and that the fraction of the available pool released on each spike is in the range 0.2&ndash;0.5.</p>

                <p>The physical interaction and functional cross talk among the different subtypes of neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) expressed in the various tissues is unknown. Here, we have investigated this issue between the only two nAChRs subtypes expressed, the &alpha;7 and &alpha;3&beta;4 subtypes, in a human native neuroendocrine cell (the chromaffin cell) using electrophysiological patch-clamp, fluorescence, and Fo&#x0308;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) techniques. Our data show that &alpha;7 and &alpha;3&beta;4 receptor subtypes require their mutual and maximal efficacy of activation to increase their expression, to avoid their desensitization, and therefore, to increase their activity. In this way, after repetitive stimulation with acetylcholine (ACh), &alpha;7 and &alpha;3&beta;4 receptor subtypes do not desensitize, but they do with choline. The nicotinic current increase associated with the &alpha;3&beta;4 subtype is dependent on Ca<sup>2+</sup>. In addition, both receptor subtypes physically interact. Interaction and expression of both subtypes are reversibly reduced by tyrosine and serine/threonine phosphatases inhibition, not by Ca<sup>2+</sup>. In addition, expression is greater in human chromaffin cells from men compared to women, but FRET efficiency is not affected. Together, our findings indicate that human &alpha;7 and &alpha;3&beta;4 subtypes mutually modulate their expression and activity, providing a promising line of research to pharmacologically regulate their activity.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Desensitization of nicotinic receptors is accepted to occur with repetitive agonist stimulation. However, here we show that human native &alpha;3&beta;4 and &alpha;7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subtypes do not desensitize, and instead, increase their activity when they are activated by the physiological agonist acetylcholine (ACh). An indispensable requirement is the activation of the other receptor subtype with maximal efficacy, and the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> to cooperate in the case of the &alpha;3&beta;4 current increase. Because choline is an &alpha;3&beta;4 partial agonist, it will act as a limiting factor of nicotinic currents enhancement in the absence of ACh, but in its presence, it will further potentiate &alpha;7 currents.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Synaptic Input and ACh Modulation Regulate Dendritic Ca2+ Spike Duration in Pyramidal Neurons, Directly Affecting Their Somatic Output</a></h4>

              
                <p>Nonlinear synaptic integration in dendrites is a fundamental aspect of neural computation. One such key mechanism is the Ca<sup>2+</sup> spike at the apical tuft of pyramidal neurons. Characterized by a plateau potential sustained for tens of milliseconds, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> spike amplifies excitatory input, facilitates somatic action potentials (APs), and promotes synaptic plasticity. Despite its essential role, the mechanisms regulating it are largely unknown. Using a compartmental model of a layer 5 pyramidal cell (L5PC), we explored the plateau and termination phases of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> spike under input current perturbations, long-step current-injections, and variations in the dendritic high-voltage-activated Ca<sup>2+</sup> conductance (that occur during cholinergic modulation). We found that, surprisingly, timed excitatory input can shorten the Ca<sup>2+</sup> spike duration while inhibitory input can either elongate or terminate it. A significant elongation also occurs when the high-voltage-activated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (Ca<SUB>HVA</SUB>) conductance is increased. To mechanistically understand these phenomena, we analyzed the currents involved in the spike. The plateau and termination phases are almost exclusively controlled by the Ca<SUB>HVA</SUB> inward current and the I<SUB>m</SUB> outward K<sup>+</sup> current. We reduced the full model to a single-compartment model that faithfully preserved the responses of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> spike to interventions and consisted of two dynamic variables: the membrane potential and the K<sup>+</sup>-channel activation level. A phase-plane analysis of the reduced model provides testable predictions for modulating the Ca<sup>2+</sup> spike and reveals various dynamical regimes that explain the robust nature of the spike. Regulating the duration of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> spike significantly impacts the cell synaptic-plasticity window and, as we show, its input-output relationship.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Pyramidal neurons are the cortex's principal projection neurons. In their apical tuft, dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes significantly impact information processing, synaptic plasticity, and the cell's input-output relationship. Therefore, it is essential to understand the mechanisms regulating them. Using a compartmental model of a layer 5 pyramidal cell (L5PC), we explored the Ca<sup>2+</sup> spike responses to synaptic perturbations and cholinergic modulation. We showed a counterintuitive phenomenon: early excitatory input shortens the spike, whereas weak inhibition elongates it. Also, we demonstrated that acetylcholine (ACh) extends the spike. Through a reduced model containing only the membrane potential and the K<sup>+</sup>-channel activation level, we explained these phenomena using a phase-plane analysis. Our work provides new information about the robustness of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> spike and its controlling mechanisms.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Contribution of G-Protein {alpha}-Subunits to Analgesia, Hyperalgesia, and Hyperalgesic Priming Induced by Subanalgesic and Analgesic Doses of Fentanyl and Morphine</a></h4>

              
                <p>While opioids produce both analgesia and side effects by action at &mu;-opioid receptors (MORs), at spinal and supraspinal sites, the potency of different opioids to produce these effects varies. While it has been suggested that these differences might be because of bias for signaling via &beta;-arrestin versus G-protein &alpha;-subunits (G&alpha;), recent studies suggest that G-protein-biased MOR agonists still produce clinically important side effects. Since bias also exists in the role of G&alpha; subunits, we evaluated the role of G&alpha;<SUB>i/o</SUB> subunits in analgesia, hyperalgesia, and hyperalgesic priming produced by fentanyl and morphine, in male rats. We found that intrathecal treatment with oligodeoxynucleotides antisense (AS-ODN) for G&alpha;<SUB>i</SUB>2, G&alpha;<SUB>i</SUB>3, and G&alpha;<SUB>o</SUB> markedly attenuated hyperalgesia induced by subanalgesic dose (sub-AD) fentanyl, while AS-ODN for G&alpha;<SUB>i</SUB>1, as well as G&alpha;<SUB>i</SUB>2 and G&alpha;<SUB>i</SUB>3, but not G&alpha;<SUB>o</SUB>, prevented hyperalgesia induced by sub-AD morphine. AS-ODN for G&alpha;<SUB>i</SUB>1 and G&alpha;<SUB>i</SUB>2 unexpectedly enhanced analgesia induced by analgesic dose (AD) fentanyl, while G&alpha;<SUB>i</SUB>1 AS-ODN markedly reduced AD morphine analgesia. Hyperalgesic priming, assessed by prolongation of prostaglandin E<SUB>2</SUB>-induced hyperalgesia, was not produced by systemic sub-AD and AD fentanyl in G&alpha;<SUB>i</SUB>3 and G&alpha;<SUB>o</SUB> AS-ODN-treated rats, respectively. In contrast, none of the G&alpha;<SUB>i/o</SUB> AS-ODNs tested affected priming induced by systemic sub-AD and AD morphine. We conclude that signaling by different G&alpha;<SUB>i/o</SUB> subunits is necessary for the analgesia and side effects of two of the most clinically used opioid analgesics. The design of opioid analgesics that demonstrate selectivity for individual G&alpha;<SUB>i/o</SUB> may produce a more limited range of side effects and enhanced analgesia.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Biased &mu;-opioid receptor (MOR) agonists that preferentially signal through G-protein &alpha;-subunits over &beta;-arrestins have been developed as an approach to mitigate opioid side effects. However, we recently demonstrated that biased MOR agonists also produce hyperalgesia and priming. We show that oligodeoxynucleotide antisense to different G&alpha;<SUB>i/o</SUB> subunits play a role in hyperalgesia and analgesia induced by subanalgesic and analgesic dose (respectively), of fentanyl and morphine, as well as in priming. Our findings have the potential to advance our understanding of the mechanisms involved in adverse effects of opioid analgesics that could assist in the development of novel analgesics, preferentially targeting specific G-protein &alpha;-subunits.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Specific Plasticity Loci and Their Synergism Mediate Operant Conditioning</a></h4>

              
                <p>Despite numerous studies examining the mechanisms of operant conditioning (OC), the diversity of OC plasticity loci and their synergism have not been examined sufficiently. In the well-characterized feeding neural circuit of <I>Aplysia</I>, <I>in vivo</I> and <I>in vitro</I> appetitive OC increases neuronal excitability and electrical coupling among several neurons leading to an increase in expression of ingestive behavior. Here, we used the <I>in vitro</I> analog of OC to investigate whether OC reduces the excitability of a neuron, B4, whose inhibitory connections decrease expression of ingestive behavior. We found OC decreased the excitability of B4. This change appeared intrinsic to B4 because it could be replicated with an analog of OC in isolated cultures of B4 neurons. In addition to changes in B4 excitability, OC decreased the strength of B4's inhibitory connection to a key decision-making neuron, B51. The OC-induced changes were specific without affecting the excitability of another neuron critical for feeding behavior, B8, or the B4-to-B8 inhibitory connection. A conductance-based circuit model indicated that reducing the B4-to-B51 synapse, or increasing B51 excitability, mediated the OC phenotype more effectively than did decreasing B4 excitability. We combined these modifications to examine whether they could act synergistically. Combinations including B51 synergistically enhanced feeding. Taken together, these results suggest modifications of diverse loci work synergistically to mediate OC and that some neurons are well suited to work synergistically with plasticity in other loci.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The ways in which synergism of diverse plasticity loci mediate the change in motor patterns in operant conditioning (OC) are poorly understood. Here, we found that OC was in part mediated by decreasing the intrinsic excitability of a critical neuron of <I>Aplysia</I> feeding behavior, and specifically reducing the strength of one of its inhibitory connections that targets a key decision-making neuron. A conductance-based computational model indicated that the known plasticity loci showed a surprising level of synergism to mediate the behavioral changes associated with OC. These results highlight the importance of understanding the diversity, specificity and synergy among different types of plasticity that encode memory. Also, because OC in <I>Aplysia</I> is mediated by dopamine (DA), the present study provides insights into specific and synergistic mechanisms of DA-mediated reinforcement of behaviors.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">The Uniform and Nonuniform Nature of Slow and Rapid Scaling in Embryonic Motoneurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>Neurons regulate the strength of their synapses in response to a perturbation to stabilize neuronal signaling through a form of homeostatic plasticity known as synaptic scaling. The process of scaling has the potential to alter all of a cell's miniature postsynaptic current (mPSC) amplitudes by a single multiplicative factor (uniform scaling), and in doing so could change action potential-dependent or evoked synaptic strength by that factor. However, recent studies suggest that individual synapses scale with different scaling factors (nonuniform). This could complicate the simple multiplicative transform from mPSC scaling to the evoked response. We have previously identified a slow AMPAergic and GABAergic synaptic scaling in chick embryo motoneurons following 2 d <I>in vivo</I> perturbations inhibiting neuronal activity or GABA<SUB>A</SUB>R function, and now show a rapid form of scaling following NMDAR blockade <I>in vitro</I>. Slow GABAergic scaling appeared to be of a classical uniform pattern. Alternatively, other forms of rapid and slow scaling demonstrated a uniform and nonuniform component in their mPSC amplitude distributions. Slow and rapid AMPAergic scaling was mediated by insertion of GluA2-lacking AMPA receptors. The nonuniform pattern of scaling may contribute to the observed complexity of the changes in evoked responses. Scaling-induced changes in mPSC amplitudes were not associated with changes in probability of release (<I>Pr</I>). Together, our results demonstrate a new rapid form of scaling in embryonic motoneurons, that slow and rapid scaling is not purely uniform, and that upscaling does not translate to an increase in evoked responses in a simple manner.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Different forms of homeostatic plasticity are thought to play a critical role in maintaining neural function. For example, altering the amplitudes of spontaneous currents through a form of homeostatic plasticity known as synaptic scaling could affect evoked transmission; however, this is rarely tested. Here we demonstrate two forms of scaling and show that in many cases synaptic strength scales differently for distinct synapses within an embryonic motoneuron. These results have functional consequences for evoked synaptic strength and suggest that, like Hebbian plasticity, scaling can change relative synaptic strengths within a cell. Furthermore, our results demonstrate how different forms of homeostatic plasticity influence neuronal communication as the nascent spinal network is first established in the embryonic period.</p>
