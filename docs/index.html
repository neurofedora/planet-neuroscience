                Background Pulmonary infections caused by Aspergillus fumigatus are a global health concern. In the lungs, A. fumigatus employs a variety of virulence and adaptation mechanisms that allows it to survive and evade local immune responses. A. fumigatus protein kinases co-ordinately regulate adaptation to the lung environment and antifungal agents. However, to improve our understanding of the role of these fungal protein kinases in subverting the antifungal responses exhibited by specific host cells, in vitro infection models should be developed. Here, we describe a functional genomics approach to evaluate the role of A. fumigatus protein kinases upon infection of airway epithelial cells, leveraging the use of our existing library of A. fumigatus deletion mutants for kinase functions and bar-seq. Methods We infected A549 alveolar epithelial cells with a pool of 111 A. fumigatus barcoded null mutant strains in genes encoding protein kinases and used bar-seq to identify which of these are involved in fungal survival upon A549 infection. To assess the optimal method for understanding host-pathogen interactions, three approaches aimed at removing extracellular conidia were evaluated: pharmacological treatment with the antifungal nystatin, washes of unbound conidia, and differential fluorescent staining of extracellular and intracellular conidia followed by cell sorting. The identified candidates were further validated using targeted approaches. Results Our data revealed new roles for A. fumigatus protein kinases during infection of airway epithelial cells. Modification of the experimental setup allowed us to differentiate between the genes associated with uptake and those required to withstand other stresses imposed by exposure to mammalian cells. Conclusions This protocol provides a new platform to ascribe pathogenicity-associated functions to A. fumigatus genes and allows prioritization for downstream experiments in mice, potentially reducing the number of studies needed in live animals. This is particularly pertinent, as genome-wide barcoded collections with thousands of strains have become available.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-794/v2?src=rss">Identification of Viral Variants from Functional Genomics Data [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Virus mutants are commonly used for studying the role of individual viral proteins in infections and are increasingly investigated with functional genomics experiments of infected cells that use sequencing-based assays such as RNA-seq or ATAC-seq. However, existing mutant virus strains are often poorly documented, in particular if they have been created decades ago. Identifying viral variants directly in the functional genomics experiments avoids additional genome sequencing and allows confirming the presence of specific mutations directly in the experiment of interest. Methods We present a pipeline to directly identify mutations in viral genomes from sequencing-based functional genomics data. The pipeline combines existing SNP callers with novel methods for identifying deletions, insertions, and corresponding inserted sequences. These novel methods address the problem that existing structural variant callers performed poorly on functional genomics data with large variations in read coverage. Results We evaluated the pipeline on RNA-seq data for infection with knockout mutants for important proteins of Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1). Comparison of the variants identified by our pipeline with the descriptions of the original publications showed that we could correctly recover the introduced mutations. Conclusions Our pipeline offers researchers a fast and easy way to identify variants in the viral genome without additional genome sequencing. The pipeline is implemented as a workflow for the workflow management system Watchdog and is available at https://github.com/watchdog-wms/watchdog-wms-workflows/ (workflow VariantCallerPipeline).

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1301/v2?src=rss">Spectrum and Antifungal Drug Resistance among Fungal Pathogens Isolated from Prison Inmates in Nairobi, Kenya [version 2; peer review: 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background The emergence of antifungal resistance in fungal pathogens highlights the need for local epidemiological data to guide empirical therapy in clinical settings. Fungal research and anti-fungal drug resistance studies are limited in developing countries; hence, there is a need for burden estimation in low- and middle-income countries. This study aimed to determine the spectrum of fungal pathogens and the anti-fungal resistance profile of fungal pathogens isolated from the respiratory and urinary tracts of prison inmates in Nairobi, Kenya. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in which sputum and urine samples were obtained from inmates presenting with symptoms of respiratory and urogenital infections at a prison outpatient clinic. One hundred and sixty-two samples were collected and subjected to fungal investigation using standard protocols. Susceptibility to fluconazole, itraconazole, and voriconazole was assessed using standard broth microdilution. Clinical and sociodemographic data were obtained using a structured questionnaire. Results From the 162, 94 samples were positive for fungal pathogens, with an overall prevalence of 58%. Seventeen (11%) of the isolated fungi were Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus flavus and Histoplasma. There was a statistically significant difference between fungal pathogens isolated from the respiratory and urogenital tracts in both sexes (p<0.05). Antifungal susceptibility testing against itraconazole showed 2 of Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus fumigatus were resistant. Two isolates (16.7%) one each of A.flavus and A. fumigatus, respectively , tested positive for the resistance gene cyp51a. Conclusion Mycological agents are significant causes of respiratory and UTI infections among prison inmates, which could be attributed to prison conditions and misdiagnosis as bacterial infections. This highlights the need for specific control measures to reduce exposure to fungal infections in prisons and in the general population.

                Background Abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) in premenopausal women is frequent, yet distinguishing benign from malignant causes remains clinically challenging. Endometrial thickness (ET) measured by transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) is well established in postmenopausal bleeding but less validated in premenopausal women due to cyclical variations. This study aimed to assess the diagnostic accuracy and prognostic value of ET, supplemented by Kaplan–Meier survival analysis, in predicting endometrial malignancy among premenopausal women with AUB. Methods We conducted a retrospective analytical study including premenopausal women presenting with AUB at Charles Nicolle Hospital, Tunis, Tunisia (2016–2024). All underwent TVUS followed by endometrial sampling (hysteroscopy or curettage) and definitive histological confirmation on hysterectomy specimens. Sonographic features were described using International Endometrial Tumor Analysis (IETA) criteria. Diagnostic performance of ET was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Kaplan-Meir survival analysis was applied to time-to-consultation and time-to-diagnosis, not survival outcomes. Results ROC analysis identified ET as the strongest predictor of endometrial malignancy (AUC = 0.842, p < 0.001). An optimal cutoff of >9 mm achieved 69.2% sensitivity, 87.1% specificity, and a negative predictive value of 97.7%, effectively ruling out malignancy in patients with ET ≤9 mm. Although the positive predictive value was modest (26.5%), ET reliably stratified risk for further invasive evaluation. Kaplan–Meier analysis demonstrated that ET >9 mm was associated with earlier consultation (mean 27.7 vs. 70.3 months, p < 0.0001) and shorter time-to-diagnosis (median 12 months vs. not reached, p < 0.0001), reflecting a more aggressive clinical course. Conclusions ET >9 mm is a robust, non-invasive potential prognostic marker in premenopausal AUB, identifying high-risk women requiring urgent evaluation while safely excluding malignancy in low-risk patients.

                Background People need critical thinking skills to make well-informed health choices and avoid waste and unnecessary suffering. However, educational interventions can have adverse effects, which is often overlooked. We created a framework of potential harms of interventions to improve critical thinking about health choices. The objective was to identify potential effects and articulate potential mechanisms. We intended to use the framework to inform the development and evaluation of an intervention in Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda. Methods We created an initial framework drawing on two earlier frameworks. We surveyed external experts using Likert-scale and open-ended items, including researchers, educators, and others, in a variety of relevant fields. We emailed the survey to an international advisory network, and all other experts recommended by respondents. We analyzed the quantitative data using descriptive statistics. We conducted a thematic analysis of the qualitative data. We revised the framework based on those results. To identify any effects missing from the revised framework, we individually interviewed a convenience sample of one teacher from each of Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda. Results We received responses from 38 of 70 external experts (54%). The quantitative survey data suggested respondents agreed with the initial framework overall. However, the qualitative data led to substantial revisions. The revised framework consists of categories of adverse outcomes; outcomes within each category; sub-outcomes; individuals, groups, and populations that might experience each adverse outcome; beneficial outcomes corresponding with adverse outcomes; and potential mechanisms of adverse effects. There are six categories: decision-making harms, psychological harms, equity harms, group and social harms, waste, and other harms. In the interviews with teachers, we did not identify any effects missing from the revised framework. Conclusions As far as we know, the framework is the first tool of its kind for education research. It can be improved upon and adapted.

">Tbx1 heterozygosity in the oligodendrocyte lineage has distinct effects on myelinated axons in the fimbria and on behaviors related to neurodevelopmental disorders in mice.</a></h4>

              
                The hemizygous deletion of human chromosome 22q11.2 leads to cognitive and social deficits, as well as psychiatric disorders. Constitutive deletion of Tbx1, a T-box transcription factor gene encoded within this chromosomal region, results in deficits in various cognitive and social behaviors and altered formation of oligodendrocytes, myelin, and myelinated axons in the fimbria of adult mice. Given that Tbx1 is present in neonatal stem cells and oligodendrocytes, the present study was designed to test the hypothesis that Tbx1 heterozygosity in the oligodendrocyte lineage contributes to behavioral phenotypes relevant to neurodevelopmental disorders and ultrastructural changes in myelinated axons in the fimbria. To this end, we conditionally induced Tbx1 heterozygosity in the oligodendrocyte lineage in PdgfrCre;Tbx1+/flox mice. This mouse line showed recombination in brain regions known to express Pdgfra. Male Pdgfra;Cre;Tbx1+/flox mice performed better in spontaneous alternation in a T-maze than wild-type littermates at 1, but not 2 months of age; otherwise, mutant and wild-type littermates were indistinguishable in neonatal ultrasonic vocalization, peripubertal and postpubertal social interaction, novel object approach, anxiety-related behaviors in an elevated plus maze, and motor activity and thigmotaxis in an inescapable open field. The fimbria of male Pdgfra;Cre;Tbx1+/flox mice showed an increase in the number of myelinated axons in a range between 300 nm and 800 nm diameter and a decrease in the myelinated axons around 1,200 nm and 1,400 nm; the thickness of myelin was unchanged across all diameters. Our findings show that Tbx1 heterozygosity in oligodendrocyte precursor cells or their progeny selectively improves spontaneous alternation and shifts the proportion of myelinated axons toward small- to medium-sized axons, suggesting that the compositional shift in axons in the fimbria induced by Tbx1 heterozygosity in the oligodendrocyte lineage might underlie improved cognition relevant to neurodevelopmental disorders.

                <p>Recent work showed unexpectedly large, daily modulation of intracellular chloride concentration ([Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup>]<SUB>in</SUB>) in cortical pyramidal cells, with consequences for GABAergic function and network excitability (  <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B5">Alfonsa et al., 2023</cross-ref>;   <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B42">Pracucci et al., 2023</cross-ref>). One explanation for this [Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup>]<SUB>in</SUB> modulation is that it arises from variation in presynaptic drive. In that case, neuronal classes with similar synaptic inputs should show correlated changes in activity-dependent ionic redistribution. To examine this prediction, we performed in vivo, LSSm-ClopHensor imaging to measure [Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup>]<SUB>in</SUB> and pH<SUB>in</SUB> in populations of parvalbumin- (PV) and somatostatin (SST)-expressing interneurons in neocortical Layer 2/3 of male and female adult mice. Imaging was performed at zeitgeber time (ZT)5 and ZT17, when pyramidal cell [Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup>]<SUB>in</SUB> shows maximal divergence (  <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B42">Pracucci et al., 2023</cross-ref>). Interestingly, PV interneurons also showed large physiological [Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup>]<SUB>in</SUB> modulation between these times but out-of-phase with that in pyramidal cells, being raised at ZT5 and lower at ZT17, and with a far higher mean [Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup>]<SUB>in</SUB>. SST interneurons showed less modulation, with higher variance, and with a temporal dynamic resembling the pyramidal cell pattern. Notably, in vitro experimental assays of inhibition, involving these two classes of interneuron, differed markedly at ZT5 and ZT17. The persistence of these time-of-day effects in vitro and the difference in [Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup>]<SUB>in</SUB> dynamics between pyramidal cells and PV interneurons in vivo both point toward cell-intrinsic regulation being more important than activity-dependent effects in setting these slow, daily, physiological, ionic redistribution patterns. We discuss what other possible factors may influence variations in brain state through the day.</p>

                Background The convergence of highly effective prophylactic HPV vaccination and sensitive HPV-based screening technologies presents a historic opportunity to eliminate cervical cancer and reduce other HPV-related malignancies. Despite the availability of these tools, systemic inequities in access and implementation remain the principal barrier to achieving global elimination targets. Objective This policy brief synthesizes the latest evidence to provide an evidence-based, context-sensitive roadmap for policymakers to overcome health systems, economic, and political barriers, guiding the equitable elimination of HPV-related cancers by 2035. Key Recommendations Robust evidence confirms the high efficacy of HPV vaccination, including the transformative potential of single-dose schedules for improving equity and scalability. Primary HPV screening, particularly when coupled with self-sampling, offers superior protection and increases uptake. Success hinges on addressing critical implementation challenges. The brief outlines a comprehensive framework emphasizing: the adoption of gender-neutral and single-dose vaccination; integration of self-sampling and digital health tools; proactive interventions for marginalized groups; development of national investment cases; and the use of multi-sectoral task forces and community engagement to mitigate socio-cultural barriers. A phased three-year operational roadmap is proposed. Conclusion The elimination of HPV-related cancers is an achievable goal. This brief provides a strategic, evidence-informed pathway for policymakers to translate scientific progress into lasting population health impact through deliberate political commitment, financial investment, and health system reforms focused on equity.

                <p>by Kabir V. Dabholkar, Omri Barak</p>

Latent variable models serve as powerful tools to infer underlying dynamics from observed neural activity. Ideally, the inferred dynamics should align with true ones. However, due to the absence of ground truth data, prediction benchmarks are often employed as proxies. One widely-used method, <i>co-smoothing</i>, involves jointly estimating latent variables and predicting observations along held-out channels to assess model performance. In this study, we reveal the limitations of the co-smoothing prediction framework and propose a remedy. Using a student-teacher setup, we demonstrate that models with high co-smoothing can have arbitrary extraneous dynamics in their latent representations. To address this, we introduce a secondary metric—<i>few-shot co-smoothing</i>, performing regression from the latent variables to held-out neurons in the data using fewer trials. Our results indicate that among models with near-optimal co-smoothing, those with extraneous dynamics underperform in the few-shot co-smoothing compared to ‘minimal’ models that are devoid of such dynamics. We provide analytical insights into the origin of this phenomenon and further validate our findings on four standard neural datasets using a state-of-the-art method: STNDT. In the absence of ground truth, we suggest a novel measure to validate our approach. By cross-decoding the latent variables of all model pairs with high co-smoothing, we identify models with minimal extraneous dynamics. We find a correlation between few-shot co-smoothing performance and this new measure. In summary, we present a novel prediction metric designed to yield latent variables that more accurately reflect the ground truth, offering a significant improvement for latent dynamics inference.

                Background The gallbladder plays an essential role in lipid homeostasis through bile storage and regulated release. Gallstone disease is frequently associated with dyslipidemia, and cholecystectomy is one of the most common abdominal surgeries worldwide. However, its influence on serum lipid metabolism remains incompletely understood. Objective To evaluate changes in serum lipid profiles six months after cholecystectomy and assess whether the procedure contributes to improvement of dyslipidemia. Methods A prospective cohort study was conducted on 40 adult patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy for symptomatic gallstone disease between August 2024 and March 2025. Fasting lipid profiles—including LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, total cholesterol, and VLDL—were measured preoperatively and at 6-month follow-up. The Atherogenic Index of Plasma (AIP) and total cholesterol/HDL ratio were calculated. Statistical analysis was performed using paired tests with significance set at p < 0.05. Results Significant reductions were observed in total cholesterol (206.0 ± 37.1 to 194.8 ± 33.7 mg/dL, p = 0.003), LDL-cholesterol (128.7 ± 34.3 to 122.9 ± 31.6 mg/dL, p = 0.002), VLDL (25.2 ± 7.7 to 23.6 ± 7.8 mg/dL, p = 0.031), and the total cholesterol/HDL ratio (p = 0.004). HDL and triglyceride levels showed no significant change. AIP remained stable. Improvements were statistically significant but modest in magnitude. Conclusions Cholecystectomy was associated with small but significant reductions in total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol six months postoperatively. Although the procedure is not a treatment for dyslipidemia, these findings suggest no adverse impact on lipid metabolism, and possibly a slight beneficial effect.

                Background Digital transformation has emerged as a key driver of competitiveness across industries, yet its adoption in the upcycling craft sector remains insufficiently explored. Existing studies often focus on large enterprises, leaving a research gap in understanding how micro-scale, resource-constrained upcycling businesses integrate digital technologies, specifically in creative industry. This study addresses this gap by developing the Behavioral-Based Digital Transformation (BBDT) model to investigate behavioral determinants of digital adoption, implementation, and innovation outcomes in Indonesia’s sustainability-oriented creative sector. Method This study employed a sequential exploratory mixed-methods approach. The qualitative phase involved field observations and in-depth interviews with three upcycling craft enterprises, while the quantitative phase surveyed 30 micro-scale upcycling businesses across multiple Indonesian regions. Data were analyzed using thematic coding, NVivo software, and Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) to test the proposed Behavioral-Based Digital Transformation (BBDT) model. Results and Conclusion Findings indicate that internal and external factors, including leadership commitment, financial capability, and market demand, significantly shape attitudes and behavioral intentions toward digital adoption. Behavioral intentions, in turn, drive digital technology implementation, enhancing operational efficiency, material optimization, and product innovation. Digital adoption acts as both an outcome and enabler of sustainable transformation, with innovation reinforcing continued engagement with technology. The study confirms the mediating role of behavioral intention and underscores the critical importance of human and organizational readiness. These insights offer theoretical contributions to TAM, TPB, and IDT integration and practical guidance for policymakers, creative communities, and micro-enterprise owners.

                Financial networks, and neural architectures—generate nonstationary, heavy-tailed, and highly irregular time series that are poorly captured by classical statistical summaries. Conventional performance metrics like mean latency and throughput often fail to reveal early-warning signatures of systemic stress or impending failure. There is a growing need for scale-aware analytical tools that can capture hidden structure in consensus dynamics and network perturbations. We develop an end-to-end statistical framework that treats consensus protocols as high-dimensional discrete-time dynamical systems subject to stochastic latency and failure processes. Using a Python-based discrete-event simulator implementing the Raft consensus algorithm, we generate time series of consensus latency, message complexity, and network latency under multiple operational regimes (normal load, high load, denial-of-service–type attacks, and partial node failures). We then apply Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (MF-DFA) to these time series, deriving generalized Hurst exponents, singularity spectra f(α), and spectrum width Δα as multifractal descriptors. Synthetic results are complemented with an analysis of block chain-style data based on block inter-arrival and propagation times. Across all simulated regimes, consensus latency exhibits nontrivial multifractal structure with finite spectrum width Δα. Stress scenarios driven by heavy-tailed latency and node failures produce substantially broader and more left-skewed spectra than baseline conditions, indicating richer intermittency and clustered extremes. We find a strong positive association between Δα and mean consensus latency, and a moderate association between Δα and failure incidence. Comparative analysis of Raft-like traces and proof-of-work–style traces shows that multifractal spectra retain algorithm-specific signatures while sharing common stress-induced broadening. The findings support the view that multifractal descriptors offer a sensitive, scale-aware complement to traditional performance metrics for distributed consensus systems. Spectrum width Δα acts as a quantitative indicator of systemic complexity and can serve as an early-warning marker for performance degradation and partial instability. The proposed framework bridges chaos theory, multifractal analysis, and consensus protocols and suggests practical pathways for integrating multifractal monitoring into the design, diagnosis, and control of big-data, block chain, and cyber-physical infrastructures.

                Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are critical regulators of chromatin and gene expression, yet their precise molecular mechanisms are often undefined. CHASERR exemplifies this challenge: haploinsufficiency of this locus causes a severe neurodevelopmental syndrome, positioning it as a master epigenetic regulator, but its physical interactors and modes of action remain unknown. Here, we define the CHASERR interactome to uncover its core mechanism. By combining RNA pull-down sequencing with promoter-binding analysis, we demonstrate that CHASERR operates as a dual-function hub. It scaffolds a specific network of non-coding RNAs, including the catalytic RMRP, the responsive lncRNA CRNDE, and multiple microRNA host genes, supporting a role in post-transcriptional regulatory circuits. Simultaneously, CHASERR binds directly to gene promoters, and this binding is functionally linked to transcriptional changes upon its depletion. This integrated mechanism, coordinating direct DNA engagement with RNA-based regulatory networks, establishes CHASERR as a central node that bridges transcriptional and post-transcriptional control. Our work provides the missing physical and mechanistic foundation for its essential role in epigenetic regulation and human disease.

                Background Large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 are increasingly used in scientific writing, yet little is known about how AI-generated scientific titles are perceived by researchers in terms of quality. Objective To compare the perceived accuracy, appeal, and overall preference for AI-generated versus human-written scientific titles. Methods We conducted a blinded comparative study with 21 researchers from diverse academic backgrounds. A random sample of 50 original titles was selected from 10 high-impact general internal medicine journals. For each title, an alternative version was generated using GPT-4.0. Each rater evaluated 50 pairs of titles, each pair consisting of one original and one AI-generated version, without knowing the source of the titles or the purpose of the study. For each pair, raters independently assessed both titles on perceived accuracy and appeal, and indicated their overall preference. We analyzed accuracy/appeal using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests and negative binomial models, preferences using McNemar’s test and mixed-effects logistic regression, and inter-rater agreement with Gwet’s AC. Results AI-generated titles received significantly higher ratings for both perceived accuracy (mean=7.9 vs. 6.7, p-value <0.001) and appeal (mean=7.1 vs. 6.7, p-value <0.001) than human-written titles. The odds of preferring an AI-generated title were 1.7 times higher (p-value =0.001), with 61.8% of 1,049 paired judgments favoring the AI version. Inter-rater agreement was moderate to substantial (Gwet’s AC: 0.54–0.70). Conclusions AI-generated titles can surpass human-written titles in perceived accuracy, appeal, and preference, suggesting that LLMs may enhance the effectiveness of scientific communication. These findings support the responsible integration of AI tools in research.

                This paper introduces a novel non-classical probability distribution, termed the Logistic Map distribution, which is constructed by transforming a polynomial function derived from the second iteration of the logistic map. The logistic map a well-known discrete-time dynamical system has been extensively employed in diverse scientific domains, including population dynamics (to model bounded growth under environmental constraints), physics (to study nonlinear dynamics and deterministic chaos), and economics (to represent complex, nonlinear patterns in financial and economic time series). The proposed distribution is fully characterized by two parameters: a scale parameter and a shape parameter, with the constraint ensuring the non-negativity and integrability of the density. Within this valid parameter space, we rigorously derive and establish a comprehensive suite of statistical properties. These include the probability density function, cumulative distribution function, reliability (survival) function, and hazard (failure rate) function. Furthermore, we obtain analytical expressions for key descriptive measures such as the mode and median, as well as for higher-order characteristics including the moment generating function, factorial moment generating function, and characteristic function. The proposed distribution most closely application field in materials science specifically, the statistical modeling of particle or grain size distributions in industrial powder processing, metallurgy, and pharmaceutical manufacturing. The primary objective of this study is to formalize a new family of probability distributions grounded in the mathematical framework of dynamical systems, specifically leveraging the logistic function commonly encountered in differential and difference equations. By doing so, we bridge concepts from nonlinear dynamics and classical statistical theory. The secondary aim is to conduct a thorough investigation of the distribution’s mathematical structure and statistical behavior, thereby establishing its potential utility for modeling bounded, non-negative random phenomena in applied fields such as reliability engineering, survival analysis, and environmental statistics.

However, a periodically modulated electronic fluid — known as a liquid charge density wave — is thought to form when electrons interact strongly with the vibrations of the crystalline host. This state is now observed using ultrafast electron diffraction.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/107096">Epidermal resident memory T cell fitness requires antigen encounter in the skin</a></h4>

              
                CD8<sup>+</sup> tissue-resident memory T cells (T<sub>RM</sub>) develop from effectors that seed peripheral tissues where they persist providing defense against subsequent challenges. T<sub>RM</sub> persistence requires autocrine TGFβ transactivated by integrins expressed on keratinocytes. T<sub>RM</sub> precursors that encounter antigen in the epidermis during development outcompete bystander T<sub>RM</sub> for TGFβ resulting in enhanced persistence. ScRNA-seq analysis of epidermal T<sub>RM</sub> revealed that local antigen experience in the skin resulted in an enhanced differentiation signature in comparison with bystanders. Upon recall, T<sub>RM</sub> displayed greater proliferation dictated by affinity of antigen experienced during epidermal development. Finally, local antigen experienced T<sub>RM</sub> differentially expressed TGFβRIII, which increases avidity of the TGFβRI/II receptor complex for TGFβ. Selective ablation of <i>Tgfbr3</i> reduced local antigen experienced T<sub>RM</sub> capacity to persist, rendering them phenotypically like bystander T<sub>RM</sub>. Thus, antigen-driven TCR signaling in the epidermis during T<sub>RM</sub> differentiation results in a lower TGFβ requirement for persistence and increased proliferative capacity that together enhance epidermal T<sub>RM</sub> fitness.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/108922">Evolution of a fuzzy ribonucleoprotein complex in viral assembly</a></h4>

              
                Previously, we showed that the genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein explores a wide range of biophysical properties facilitated by non-local impact of point mutations to its intrinsically disordered regions (Nguyen et al., 2024). This includes modulation of self-association, such as the creation of a de novo binding interface through the P13L mutation characteristic of Omicron variants. In the present work, we focus on the key function of N condensing viral RNA into ribonucleoprotein particles (RNPs) for viral assembly. Lacking high-resolution structural information, biochemical and biophysical approaches have revealed architectural principles of RNPs, which involve cooperative interactions of several protein-protein and protein-RNA interfaces, initiated through oligomerization of conserved transient helices in the central disordered linker of N. Here, we study the impact of defining N-protein mutations in variants of concern on RNP formation, using biophysical tools, a virus-like particle assay, and reverse genetics experiments. We find convergent evolution in repeated, independent introduction of amino acid substitutions strengthening existing binding interfaces, compensating for other substitutions that promote viral replication but decrease RNP stability. Furthermore, we show that the P13L mutation of Omicron variants enhances RNP assembly and increases viral fitness. Overall, our data reveal RNP complexes to be highly variable not only in sequence and conformations but also in thermodynamic and kinetic stability, with its pleomorphism affecting basic architectural principles. We hypothesize that the formation of polydisperse, fuzzy N-RNA clusters with multiple distributed weak binding interfaces optimizes reversible RNA condensation, while supporting host adaptation and allowing for a large sequence space to be explored.

">Retinal Origins of Circadian Photoregulation's Specialized Dynamic Range and Temporal Integration</a></h4>

              
                The circadian clock allows organisms to anticipate environmental changes that are driven by the earth's rotation, and synchronizes with this cycle using ligh1. The clock extracts relevant parameters of illumination, responding selectively to intensities at twilight and above, and to the number of photons counted over an extended time window2-8. These hallmark properties are thought to manifest in the brain9. Here, we report that they emerge within specific neurons of the eye. These M1 intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) detect light directly, using a receptor called melanopsin, and indirectly, through circuits driven by rod and cone photoreceptors10. We find that the balance of intrinsic and extrinsic drives varies widely across M1s, and the population accounts for the dynamic range of circadian photoregulation. Both singly and collectively, M1s approach the level of temporal integration observed behaviorally. The cellular and behavioral levels match when the pupillary light reflex--another M1-driven function--shapes the light that M1s receive. This work reveals how the first steps of sensory processing are precisely formatted for specific tasks. It also introduces bioluminescence-based methods for identifying photosensitive neurons without desensitization, allowing their mechanistic study under physiological conditions.

">Drinking microstructure analysis of direct controls of water intake in male and female rats.</a></h4>

              
                Measures of rodent drinking (lick) patterns are used to test how various manipulations affect fluid intake. Decades of research indicate that manipulating the satiating potency of a stimulus affects the number of licking bursts whereas manipulating the hedonic value of the solution affects the size of the licking bursts or rate of licking. This type of analysis has been largely applied to manipulations that modulate drinking that is already occurring (i.e., indirect controls or modulators of intake), but there is a dearth of studies with detailed measures of licking in response to stimuli that are primary drivers of intake (i.e., direct controls). A better understanding of licking behavior in response to direct controls of fluid intake could provide insight into how drinking is stimulated. Accordingly, we analyzed lick patterns after varying doses of primary drivers (direct controls) of intake, angiotensin II, hypertonic saline, or carbochol, in male and female rats. As expected, all treatments dose-dependently increased licks for water. Analysis of licking patterns revealed dose-related increases in burst number after treatment with all stimuli, but dose did not predict burst size or lick rate. Together with previous work on licking patterns these data suggest that direct controls of water intake are more related to processes associated with satiety than to changes in hedonic value of the consumed substance.

">Inducible CreERT2 mouse lines for characterization of retinal bipolar cell subtypes</a></h4>

              
                Bipolar cells relay visual signals from photoreceptor cells to ganglion cells in the retina. Fifteen bipolar cell subtypes have been identified in the mouse retina. These subtypes are classified as ON and OFF bipolar cells based on their response to light stimulus or rod and cone bipolar cells based on their connection to photoreceptor cells. However, the unique structural and functional role of these subtypes in the processing of visual information is not fully known due to the inadequate tools and models available for their characterization. In this study, to trace the lineage and characterize Vsx1, Lhx3, and Lhx4-expressing bipolar cell subtypes in developing and adult mouse retina, we developed inducible Cre lines under the promoter of Vsx1, Lhx3, and Lhx4 and crossed them with ChR2EYFP reporter mice. Lineages of cells expressing Vsx1, Lhx3, and Lhx4 after Cre induction in the adult and postnatal mouse retina were then characterized. ChR2EYFP expression driven by Vsx1-CreERT2 was detected in type 2, 6, and 7 bipolar cells, Lhx3-CreERT2 in type 1b, 2, and 6 bipolar cells, and Lhx4-CreERT2 in type 2, 3, 4, and 5 bipolar cells as well as cone photoreceptor cells in the adult mouse retina. These bipolar cell subtype-specific inducible Cre mouse lines serve as efficient tools for elucidation of the mechanisms that control bipolar cell subtype development and function in the retina.

">Real-time Bayesian optimization of deep brain stimulation for personalized cognitive control enhancement</a></h4>

              
                Background: Identifying effective deep brain stimulation (DBS) parameters for psychiatric disorders has historically been a time-consuming and error prone process due to a lack of an objective and rapid readout of target circuit engagement. Cognitive control may have use as a biomarker of treatment efficacy but it has yet to be shown that DBS parameters can be reliably optimized to produce cognitive control improvements in individual subjects. Objective: We sought to leverage a rat model of DBS-driven cognitive control improvements to determine whether state of the art optimization algorithms could consistently identify effective stimulation amplitudes to enhance cognition. Methods: We delivered periods of active and inactive DBS-like stimulation at variable parameters while rats performed a Set-Shifting task that we previously showed to be stimulation-sensitive. We tested both predefined settings of interest and settings that were personalized to individual animals using Bayesian Optimization. Measurements of task performance including reaction time and accuracy were compared between acute, optimized, and traditional settings to evaluate effects on cognitive control. Results: Acute stimulation reduced reaction times without hindering accuracy (N=15), replicating the effects previously observed with chronic stimulation. In a second cohort (N=6), optimization of stimulation amplitude successfully reduced reaction times in all animals with comparable effect size to historically best settings. Conclusion: These findings confirm that optimization techniques can be effective for improving symptomatically-relevant cognitive markers supporting the feasibility of personalized, quantitatively-informed approaches to neuromodulation and target engagement for psychiatric and/or cognitive disorders.

">Lateralized foraging induces asymmetric corticostriatal plasticity in mice</a></h4>

              
                With practice, animals perform reward-oriented actions faster and with less variability. The dorsal striatum (DS) plays a key role in this process, potentially through opposing changes in cortical input strength to the two main striatal projection neurons (D1- and D2-SPNs). To test this hypothesis, we trained mice in a foraging task requiring them to perform quarter-turns (QTs) in a single direction (counterclockwise, CCW) along the walls of square towers to collect drops of water. As training progressed, the number and speed of CCW QTs increased while the variability of their trajectory decreased. Whisker trimming in well-trained mice altered QTs kinematics, highlighting the role of tactile inputs in guiding these actions. Combining ex vivo patch-clamp recordings in the DS with glutamate uncaging in the barrel cortex, we mapped the cortical neurons monosynaptically connected to D1- or D2-SPNs and measured the strength of these connections in the contralateral hemispheres, relative to the turn direction. In well-trained mice, compared to naive controls, the contralateral hemisphere showed no major changes in D1- or D2-SPNs connectivity, despite increased excitation of cortical pyramidal neurons. In contrast, the ipsiversive hemisphere exhibited no change in cortical excitability but showed increased cortical connectivity and input strength to SPNs. These findings reveal an unexpected hemispheric asymmetry in corticostriatal connectivity during lateralized foraging, which may reflect a homeostatic process normalizing striatal activity across hemispheres despite unbalanced cortical input.

">Implications of recursive Bayesian Sensory Inference</a></h4>

              
                In this article, we examine how the balance between velocity-based and position-based proprioceptive feedback influences state estimation during motor control. We introduce a computational model of arm state inference grounded in Bayesian sensory integration and compare its behaviour to findings from three classical sensorimotor studies. The model allows us to contrast the predicted behaviour of two proprioceptive configurations: one relying primarily on position signals and another relying primarily on velocity signals, reflecting the distinct contributions of type II and type Ia muscle spindle afferents. Our simulations show that a system with strong reliance on velocity-based feedback tends to represent movement relative to previously estimated positions. In a simulated reaching task with briefly presented offset visual feedback, such an Agent produces systematic endpoint errors even after visual feedback is removed. In contrast, an Agent relying mainly on positional feedback is able to correctly update its inferred hand position after visual feedback is removed, thereby limiting this type of biased endpoint errors. When biased visual feedback remains continuously available, or when muscle vibration is simulated, the two configurations produce very similar behaviour. These results indicate that markedly different assumptions about the weighting of positional and velocity proprioceptive cues can yield similar observable behaviour in some of the often-used experimental setups designed to probe state inference processes. This underscores the importance of carefully considering the composition of proprioceptive signals when building computational models and interpreting human sensorimotor experiments. We highlight the task conditions under which our model predicts clear behavioural differences arising from the relative contribution of velocity versus positional feedback.

">Integration of Audiovisual Danger Stimuli in the Zebrafish Tectum is Linked with Premotor and Behavioral Enhancements</a></h4>

              
                Multisensory integration allows animals to combine cues from different sensory modalities to improve threat detection and drive evasive behaviors. While the zebrafish Tectum is classically viewed as a visual processing center, its role in integrating auditory and visual danger signals remains unclear. Using in vivo calcium imaging in larval zebrafish, we find that brief, high-amplitude auditory stimuli recruit a significant population of tectal neurons, predominantly in deep tectal layers. In addition, combined auditory and visual stimulation robustly increases both neural activity in the zebrafish Tectum and the probability of executing rapid escape maneuvers, especially for low salient stimuli. Interestingly, simultaneous auditory and visual cues engage more tectal neurons than either modality alone. Single neuron analysis reveal a population of neurons that respond to both auditory and visual cues, and importantly, shows that a proportion of those neurons only responds to multisensory stimulation. These results firmly establish the zebrafish Tectum as a multisensory processing area. Notably, the heightened tectal response during multisensory stimulation is strongly correlated with increased activity in hindbrain neurons implicated in escape-like motion events. These results link tectal multisensory integration to premotor circuits that drive behavioral output. Overall, our findings reveal the zebrafish Tectum as a hub for integration os audiovisual threat signals, and suggest a role of tectal multisensory processing in enhancing behavioral escape responses.

">The osm-9 mutant strain is defective in the recovery phase of long-term memory dynamics</a></h4>

              
                Memory by definition is the storage of learned information from experiences where it can be recalled in the future. Memory is essential for organisms of any level, from single celled bacteria to complex mammals like whales in order for them to adapt and survive. The storage of long term memory is known to start in the hippocampus but long-term memory is not simply contained in this one region in the brain but across multiple regions including the cortex, amygdala and nucleus accumbens. This diversity of locations that memory can be located in prompts the question of what molecular components within the nervous system are required to establish and maintain long term memory. To dive into this, we utilize the simple neuroanatomy of C. elegans with only 302 neurons to examine the effects of mutations of specific genes on the success of forming long term memories. Previous work established that C. elegans with defective OSM-9 proteins are unable to sustain an aversion to butanone (an odor that they are innately attracted to) after it is paired once with a negative stimulus. This helped established the importance of OSM-9 proteins for short term memory but how can the OSM-9 protein, a homolog to human TRPV5 and TRPV6 commonly associated with recognizing pain and thermoregulation rather than memory, play a part within the dynamics of space training induced long term memory? Here we show that the loss of the OSM-9 protein affects the dynamics of memory consolidation, which is the process by which short term memory is converted to long term memory. Previously, OSM-9 protein was implicated in the formation of short term memory which was termed adaptation. Here, we examine spaced training induced memory that is resistant to re-feeding and depends on sleep. This study indicates that after spaced training, the OSM-9 protein is required for the conversion of short term memory to long term memory and not acquisition. Furthermore, we confirmed that 30 minutes on food after spaced training, Wild type C. elegans seem to lose their memory but gain it back 120 minutes after, emphasizing the dynamics of memory and revealing that it is not a smoothly continuous process. Our results demonstrate that TRPV containing channels plays a role in stabilizing memory for long term use. Analyzing the specific point in which the OSM-9 protein plays a part in reactivating memory may help pave the way to a more detailed understanding of memory dynamics and the processes involved in recovering memory. Future work includes: identifying where the loss of memory goes, whether its masked or truly disappears can further explain what the OSM-9 protein supports when long term memory is formed; understanding if OSM-9 is directly involved with the process of reviving the memory or is it involved in the development of the C. elegans circuit which allows for this process to occur.

">Subthalamic nucleus controls cautious action timing under threat</a></h4>

              
                Adaptive goal-directed actions performed under the threat of punishment introduce a demand for caution, often expressed as delayed response timing that balances urgency against error risk by allowing more time for cognitive evaluation. Although this form of temporal regulation is essential for survival, its underlying neural mechanisms remain poorly understood. We show that glutamatergic neurons in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) regulate the timing of cued actions to avoid harm. Optogenetic activation of the STN, or its projections to the midbrain but not the globus pallidus, modulates action timing in a frequency-dependent manner, accelerating initiation to the extent that animals can no longer respond cautiously, defer actions, or stop initiated actions. These results show that the STN shapes goal-directed behavior by gating action-initiation timing, establishing its midbrain projections as a key circuit for balancing urgency and caution under threat.

">The development of an asymmetric accessory olfactory bulb in Octodon degus and the influence of social behavior in its establishment</a></h4>

              
                The vomeronasal system (VNS) has been extensively associated with the regulation of sexual and social behaviors in mammals. This system comprises two types of vomeronasal neurons sending parallel projections from the vomeronasal organ (VNO) to the anterior and posterior portions of the accessory olfactory bulb (aAOB and pAOB, respectively). Members of caviomorph rodents develop either a larger aAOB or pAOB bias, which has been associated with ecological traits related to the pheromonal communication displayed by these species. However, it is still unknown how and when such AOB asymmetries emerge and whether experience may influence their establishment. To explore these factors, we studied the development of the VNS in Octodon degus, a caviomorph that exhibits an asymmetric AOB, in which the aAOB is larger and has more glomeruli than the pAOB. We found that both VNO and AOB are present at birth, but exhibiting substantial immature traits. Both VNS structures develop postnatally, showing mature patterns by the end of the first postnatal month. By the second postnatal week, aAOB becomes larger in size than pAOB, however, in the glomerular layer such bias appears later, by the end of the first postnatal month. The AOB asymmetry increases in extent until adulthood, as in this period the pAOB shows a minor growing rate than the aAOB. Additionally, we found that animals raised in restricted social contexts displayed a reduced AOB asymmetry in comparison to wild degus. Overall, we suggest that social experiences contribute to the development of the AOB asymmetry in degus.

">Effect of Biceps Brachii Muscle Stimulation on Respiration before and after Cervical Spinal Cord Injury.</a></h4>

              
                Cervical spinal cord injuries (SCI) often lead to respiratory impairments, significantly increasing morbidity and mortality in affected individuals. Limb muscle/afferent stimulation has been suggested as a potential approach to enhance breathing when supraspinal control over spinal respiratory circuits is compromised due to cervical SCI. Using a combination of intact, C2 Hemisected (C2Hx), and complete C1 Transected (C1Tx) rat models, we systematically evaluated the influence of forelimb muscle afferent input on phrenic motor output and respiratory patterns. Computational modeling was employed to replicate our experimental data and generate predictions. The developed computational model incorporates bilaterally located spinal and supraspinal respiratory circuits, allowing us to simulate their specific contributions to phrenic motor output under different conditions. In this study, we hypothesize that, in addition to supraspinal control, spinal circuits integrate limb sensory input to modulate the activity of phrenic motor neurons through local excitatory and inhibitory interneurons. These intraspinal pathways, normally suppressed by inhibition, can be recruited during movement to adapt breathing to motor demands. Our experimental and computational modeling results following biceps stimulation after C2Hx and C1Tx support this hypothesis, demonstrating that activation of limb afferent pathways can enhance phrenic motor output even after partial or complete loss of supraspinal drive. In the fully transected preparation, this effect required pharmacological disinhibition, confirming the presence of latent spinal pathways. This study provides the first evidence for functionally relevant intraspinal interactions between limb muscles and respiratory circuits and identifies a potential spinal mechanism that could be leveraged to promote breathing recovery after cervical SCI.

">Ensemble Coding of Hidden Objects in Visual Cortex</a></h4>

              
                Many species exhibit the understanding that visual objects that become hidden by others nonetheless still exist, a property known as object permanence. Previous studies in human and nonhuman primates have provided evidence that neurons within visual cortex encode objects that are remembered but not seen. However, past neurophysiological studies have generally failed to find evidence of visual cortical representations of hidden objects. We measured the activity of large populations of neurons within dorsal extrastriate cortex of macaques trained to monitor the identity of visual objects that moved behind an irrelevant occluder. We found that although the firing rates of neuronal populations signaled the trajectory of hidden objects throughout the occlusion period, coding of object identity in the same activity decayed to chance before the behavioral trial ended. Nevertheless, information about the hidden object was present in the coordinated activity of neuronal populations. Specifically, the strength and presence of pairwise cross-correlations reliably depended on the identity of the hidden object. These results demonstrate that ensembles of visual cortical neurons preserve information about hidden objects independent of single neuron firing rates.

                Understanding how neural circuits compute requires capturing voltage dynamics across large neuronal populations with millisecond resolution in vivo. However, two-photon voltage imaging remains fundamentally limited by a trade-off among imaging speed, field of view, and excitation efficiency. We introduce HS2PM, a hybrid scanning two-photon microscope that overcomes this bottleneck, enabling kilohertz-rate imaging over a 650x524 m2 field of view at single-cell resolution while preserving the photon efficiency of single-point excitation. HS2PM stably records deep-layer membrane potentials from over 160 neurons simultaneously, with minimal photobleaching and phototoxicity. It resolves both spikes and subthreshold voltage dynamics in vivo, revealing how these jointly shape sensory adaptation and population coding. Beyond voltage imaging, HS2PM supports high-speed fluorescence lifetime and vascular flow imaging, establishing a multimodal platform for dissecting fast circuit dynamics with precision previously inaccessible to optical methods.

">Type 2 diabetes Reprograms Bone Marrow Hematopoiesis and Dysregulates Immune Signaling in Response to Stroke</a></h4>

              
                Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) worsens stroke outcomes, but the underlying mechanisms linking T2DM to systemic immune dysfunction remain unclear. We investigated whether T2DM alters bone marrow (BM) hematopoiesis and dysregulate immune signaling following ischemic stroke in mice. Single-cell RNA sequencing, GeoMx digital spatial profiling (DSP), nCounter, and flow cytometry were used to analyze BM cells from control (db/+, Ctrl) and diabetic (db/db, T2DM) mice underwent experimental stroke or sham surgery. Diabetes caused marked structural remodeling of BM, with reduced cellularity and imbalance of hematopoietic lineages. Pseudotime trajectory analysis revealed impaired differentiation and maturation signatures of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC1) and granulocytes, and overactivation toward monocytes in diabetes after stroke. CellChat analysis demonstrated reorganization of intercellular communication, with hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC1) and monocytes emerging as dominant signaling hubs through upregulated MIF, SIRP, and THBS pathways. AUCell enrichment indicated increased glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation but reduced interferon-{gamma} (IFN-{gamma}) signaling, reflecting metabolic activation coupled with immune dysregulation. DSP and nCounter further confirmed upregulation of genes in the MIF, SIRP and THBS pathways in CD115 monocytes and Ly6G neutrophils, indicating proinflammatory and migratory activation in diabetic bone marrow. Our data suggest that T2DM reprograms hematopoiesis and signaling networks, leading to maladaptive myeloid responses and impaired immune regulation after stroke. This maladaptive BM environment amplifies inflammation and limits repair, linking diabetic metabolic stress to worsened ischemic outcomes. Targeting bone marrow immune dysfunction may offer a therapeutic strategy to improve stroke recovery in diabetic patients.

">From movement to cognitive maps: recurrent neural networks reveal how locomotor development shapes hippocampal spatial coding</a></h4>

              
                The hippocampus contains neurons whose firing correlates with an animal's location and orientation in space. Collectively, these neurons are held to support a cognitive map of the environment, enabling the recall of and navigation to specific locations. Although recent studies have characterised the timelines of spatial neuron development, no unifying mechanistic model has yet been proposed. Moreover, the processes driving the emergence of spatial representations in the hippocampus remain unclear (Tan et al., 2017). Here, we combine computational analysis of postnatal locomotor development with a recurrent neural network (RNN) model of hippocampal function to demonstrate how changes in movement statistics -- and the resulting sensory experiences -- shape the formation of spatial tuning. First, we identify distinct developmental stages in rat locomotion during open-field exploration using published experimental data. Then, we train shallow RNNs to predict upcoming visual stimuli from concurrent visual and vestibular inputs, exposing them to trajectories that reflect progressively maturing locomotor patterns. Our findings reveal that these changing movement statistics drive the sequential emergence of spatially tuned units, mirroring the developmental timeline observed in rats. The models generate testable predictions about how spatial tuning properties mature -- predictions we confirm through analysis of hippocampal recordings. Critically, we demonstrate that replicating the specific statistics of developmental locomotion -- rather than merely accelerating sensory change -- is essential for the emergence of an allocentric spatial representation. These results establish a mechanistic link between embodied sensorimotor experience and the ontogeny of hippocampal spatial neurons, with significant implications for neurodevelopmental research and predictive models of navigational brain circuits.

">Decoding medial entorhinal cortical dynamics produces planning-like alternations in hippocampal theta sequences</a></h4>

              
                The hippocampus plays a central role in memory and spatial planning. In rodents, theta oscillations (7-12Hz) are associated with active navigation and appear necessary for planning and spatial memory. A key neural mechanism held to support navigational decision making are theta sequences - brief (~120ms) sequential activations of hippocampal place cells representing trajectories ahead of the animal. Evidence for their role in planning includes their tendency to sample potential future paths at decision points, particularly the left-right sequences observed along the T-maze arms during alternation tasks. However, a recent study challenges this interpretation, proposing that the natural tendency of medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) theta sequences to alternate between leftward and rightward directions might account for the apparent sampling of arms on the T-maze. Given that MEC inputs drive hippocampal activity, this raises the possibility that hippocampal alternations in T-mazes simply reflect intrinsic MEC dynamics rather than active planning. Here, we test this hypothesis by modelling MEC theta sequences in a T-shaped maze and demonstrate that standard Bayesian decoding produces hippocampal theta sequences alternating between maze arms, consistent with experimental observations. Analysis of simultaneous MEC-hippocampal recordings reveals that MEC alternation consistently precedes hippocampus by ~50ms, suggesting a feedforward, state-independent mechanism. This coordinated MEC-hippocampal left-right alternation occurs not only at choice points but also during inbound trials (where no deliberate choice is required) and at forced-turn corners (where only one path exists). These findings suggest that left-right alternation in hippocampal theta sequences is a ubiquitous phenomenon driven by MEC dynamics, challenging the interpretation that these specifically reflect intentional decision-making or planning processes.

Collective cell migration is fundamental to tissue homeostasis and underlies biological processes such as wound healing and cancer invasion. Previous work has proposed governing equations to describe how chemical and mechanical inputs regulate these movements, but the quantitative validity of such models remains to be thoroughly assessed. Here, we developed a machine-learning framework that infers the governing equation from live-cell imaging data. Applied to epithelial sheet migration driven by MAPK/ERK, our approach quantitatively predicted single-cell movement from local chemical and mechanical cues. Examination of the learned equations further indicated that cells process environmental signals by computing their spatiotemporal derivatives. Moreover, when applied to individual cells, our framework revealed cell-cell heterogeneity in the underlying migratory rules. Our framework offers a powerful tool for predictive modeling of multicellular dynamics in both physiological and pathological settings.

Epidemiological models that aim for a high degree of biological realism by simulating every individual in a population are unavoidably complex, with many free parameters, which makes systematic explorations of their dynamics computationally challenging. In this study, we demonstrate how Gaussian Process emulation can overcome this challenge. To simulate disease dynamics, we developed an abstract individual-based model that is loosely inspired by dengue, incorporating some key features shaping dengue epidemics such as social structure, human movement, and seasonality. We focused on three epidemiological metrics derived from the individual-based model outcomes — outbreak probability, maximum incidence, and epidemic duration — and trained three Gaussian Process surrogate models to approximate these metrics. The GP surrogate models enabled the rapid prediction of these epidemiological metrics at any point in the eight-dimensional parameter space of the original model. Our analysis revealed that average infectivity and average human mobility are key drivers of these epidemiological metrics, while the seasonal timing of the first infection can influence the course of the epidemic outbreak. We used a dataset comprising more than 1,000 dengue epidemics observed over 12 years in Colombia to calibrate our Gaussian Process model and evaluated its predictive power. The calibrated Gaussian Process model identified a subset of municipalities with consistently higher average infectivity estimates; the notable overlap between these municipalities and previously reported dengue disease clusters suggests that statistical emulation can facilitate empirical data analysis. Overall, this work underscores the potential of Gaussian Process emulation to enable the use of more complex individual-based models in epidemiology, allowing a higher degree of realism and accuracy that should increase our ability to control diseases of public health concern.

The biological mechanisms underlying the spontaneous and recurrent transition to seizures in the epileptic brain are still poorly understood. As a result, seizures remain uncontrolled in a substantial proportion of patients. Brain stimulation is an emerging and promising method to treat various brain disorders, including drug-refractory epilepsy. Selected stimulation protocols previously demonstrated therapeutic efficacy in reducing the seizure rate. The stimulation efficacy critically depends on chosen stimulation parameters, such as the time point, amplitude, and frequency of stimulation. This study aims to explore the neurobiological impact of 1Hz stimulation and provide the mechanistic explanation behind its seizure-delaying effects. We study this effect using a computational model, a modified version of the Epileptor-2 model, in close comparison with such stimulation effects on spontaneous seizures recorded <i>in vitro</i> in a high-potassium model of ictogenesis in rat hippocampal slices. In particular, we investigate the mechanisms and dynamics of spontaneous seizure emergence, the seizure-delaying effect of the stimulation, and the optimal stimulation parameters to achieve the maximal anti-seizure effect. We show that the modified Epileptor-2 model replicates key experimental observations, and captures seizure dynamics and the anti-seizure effects of low-frequency electrical stimulation (LFES) observed in hippocampal slices. We identify the critical thresholds in the model for seizure onset and determine the optimal stimulation parameters—timing, amplitude, and duration—that exceed specific thresholds to delay seizures without triggering premature seizures. Our study highlights the central role of sodium-potassium pump dynamics in terminating seizures and mediating the LFES effect.

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are crucial in addressing the global crisis of bacterial resistance. However, there are still significant limitations in existing methods on de novo AMPs design, especially in designing AMPs with desirable physicochemical properties for specific bacterial pathogens. In this study, we propose a novel generative framework for designing pathogen-targeted antimicrobial peptides with programmable physicochemical properties. More specifically, a conditional Variational Autoencoder is first pretrained for generating AMPs with editable physicochemical properties. We then develop a conditional diffusion model to learn hidden representations of AMPs for targeting pathogens of interest, and construct corresponding MIC predictors for specific bacterial strains. Through comprehensive simulation experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms most existing models in terms of antimicrobial efficacy against specific bacterial targets. Moreover, through systematic screening and analysis, we have identified two star AMPs for each of the two target bacterial species (i.e., <i>E. coli</i> or <i>S. aureus</i>), both of which exhibit excellent performance in antibacterial activity, hemolytic properties, toxicity profiles, etc. Overall, this study provides the key technological support for developing next-generation intelligent platforms for antimicrobial agents design.

Accurately quantifying cellular morphology at scale could substantially empower existing single-cell approaches. However, measuring cell morphology remains an active field of research, which has inspired multiple computer vision algorithms over the years. Here, we show that DINOv2, a vision-transformer based, self-supervised algorithm, has a remarkable ability for learning rich representations of cellular morphology without manual annotations or any other type of supervision. We apply DINOv2 to cell phenotyping problems, and compare the performance of resulting models, called Cell-DINO models, on a wide variety of tasks across two publicly available imaging datasets of diverse specifications and biological focus. Compared to supervised and other self-supervised baselines, Cell-DINO models demonstrate improved performance, especially in low annotation regimes. For instance, to classify protein localization using only 1% of annotations on a challenging single-cell dataset, Cell-DINO performs 70% better than a supervised strategy, and 24% better than another self-supervised alternative. The results show that Cell-DINO can support the study of unknown biological variation, including single-cell heterogeneity and relationships between experimental conditions, making it an excellent tool for image-based biological discovery.

                <p>by Medha Shekhar, Herrick Fung, Krish Saxena, Farshad Rafiei, Dobromir Rahnev</p>

Humans can evaluate the accuracy of their decisions by providing confidence judgements. Traditional cognitive models have tried to capture the mechanisms underlying this process but remain mostly limited to two-choice tasks with simple stimuli. How confidence is given for naturalistic stimuli with multiple choice alternatives is not well understood. We recently developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) model – RTNet – that exhibits several important signatures of human decision making and outperforms existing alternatives in predicting human responses. Here, we use RTNet’s image computability to test seven different confidence strategies on a task involving digit discrimination with eight alternatives (N = 60). Specifically, we compared confidence strategies that consider the entire evidence distribution across choices against strategies that only consider a specific subset of the available evidence. We also compared strategies based on whether they compute confidence from posterior probabilities or from raw evidence. A model which derives confidence from the difference in raw evidence between the top-two choices (Top2Diff model) consistently provided the best quantitative and qualitative fits to the data and the best predictions of human confidence. These results support the notion that human confidence is based on a specific subset of available evidence, challenge prominent theories such as the Bayesian confidence hypothesis and the positive evidence heuristic, and establish CNNs as promising models for inferring the mechanisms underlying human confidence in naturalistic settings.

                <p>by Megan Morrison, Lai-Sang Young</p>

<i>C. elegans</i> locomotion is composed of switches between forward and reversal states punctuated by turns. This locomotory capability is necessary for the nematode to move towards attractive stimuli, escape noxious chemicals, and explore its environment. Although experimentalists have identified a number of premotor neurons as drivers of forward and reverse motion, how these neurons work together to produce the behaviors observed remains to be understood. Towards a better understanding of <i>C. elegans</i> neurodynamics, we present in this paper a minimally parameterized, biology-based dynamical systems model of the premotor network. Our model consists of a recurrently connected collection of premotor neurons (the core group) driven by over a hundred sensory and interneurons that provide diverse feedforward inputs to the core group. It is data-driven in the sense that the choice of neurons in the core group follows experimental guidance, anatomical structures are dictated by the connectome, and physiological parameters are deduced from whole-brain imaging and voltage clamps data. When simulated with realistic input signals, our model produces premotor activity that closely resembles experimental data: from the seemingly random switching between forward and reversal behaviors to the synchronization of subnetworks to various higher-order statistics. We posit that different roles are played by gap junctions and synaptic connections in switching dynamics. Using the model we identify signal neurons that strongly influence switches between behavioral states and core neurons that play an important role in integrating signal information. The model produces switching statistics that underlie behaviors such as dwelling versus roaming as a result of the synaptic inputs received.

In today’s research landscape, the dissemination and utilisation of results are not only an obligation but essential components of impactful research. Funding agencies are increasingly emphasising the translation of academic findings into practical applications that meet societal needs. However, researchers often lack training or incentives to focus on this task, leading to a disconnect between scientific enquiry and impact in practice. Innovation Boot Camps (IBCs) offer a dynamic solution to bridge this gap. IBCs provide a collaborative platform where researchers can familiarise themselves with attitudes and mindsets of end users, including industry professionals, policymakers and community members. This interaction ensures that scientific findings are aligned with real needs and challenges, increasing their relevance and applicability. These workshops foster creativity by encouraging researchers to think beyond the traditional academic framework and explore interdisciplinary approaches. This promotes not only innovative solutions, but also the effective tackling of complex societal problems.

Forming organs requires the appropriate distribution of spatiotemporal signals leading to tissue patterning and morphogenesis. Advances in genetic tools contributed to our understanding of cell signaling and their associated genes. Yet, due to technical challenges, the contribution of dynamic morphological transformations of tissues during organ formation remains widely unexplored. Here, we develop a new mathematical approach to understand the variables that shape the dynamic distribution of ligand and signaling. We use the TGF-α-like ligand Gurken (GRK) and the activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) during <i>Drosophila</i> oogenesis to build the model. Our model accounts for GRK secretion from a moving source, its diffusion in the perivitelline space, and the activation of EGFR in the overlaying follicle cells. Furthermore, we also capture the rapid growth of the oocyte, which was a major challenge to integrate into a model. We modeled the dynamic distribution of GRK and EGFR activation by a series of mathematical equations. We used this model to study how perturbations of the egg chamber’s morphological evolution impact cell signaling, which could not be achieved via genetic perturbation. We found that the relative movement of the follicle cells and the oocyte contributes to the distribution of EGFR signaling activation.

                <p>by Ling Xu, Pejman Senaei, Yi Jiang</p>

Mucociliary clearance is the primary defense mechanism in our respiratory system against aerosol pathogens and allergens. The rhythmic movement of cilia on airway-lining cells propels mucus flow, driving the movement of trapped particles. However, the impact of cilia density and distribution on mucociliary mixing and transport at the tissue scale remains poorly understood. In the present work, we present three-dimensional (3D) simulations of ciliary-driven mixing and transport of a Newtonian fluid as an approximation of mucus at the tissue scale. We investigate the influence of ciliary density, cilia cluster spacing, and metachrony on fluid mixing and transport. Our findings reveal that: (i) cilia clusters generate flow swirls whose size scales with ciliary density, (ii) a single cilia cluster generates horizontal and upward transport with horizontal mixing, (iii) optimal spacing between ciliary clusters enhances horizontal transport, and (iv) metachronic waves enhances mixing but reduces net transport. These findings provide useful insight into generic principles of cilia-driven transport in viscous fluids and may inform bio-inspired system design, while further work is needed to extend this work to physiologically realistic mucus transport.

                <p>We report the first human use of intranasal seletracetam (SEL) to prevent reflex seizures. A patient with epilepsy with reading-induced seizures on levetiracetam (3,000 mg/day) continued to experience reading-induced focal seizures with preserved consciousness. Detectable in serum within 2 minutes of intranasal administration, 30 mg seletracetam delayed seizure onset from 1:56 (placebo) to 4:17 minutes post-stimulus onset. A second 30 mg dose fully prevented seizures during 25 minutes of reading. Electroencephalogram (EEG) spike-frequency declined dose-dependently (3.1/min at placebo to 1.6/min after second dose), with reduced spike-propagation on magnetoencephalography (MEG). Our findings support SEL as a promising non-benzodiazepine acute seizure prevention and provide insight into reflex seizure dynamics. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                Zhang et al. demonstrate that NOL6 is a crucial player in colorectal cancer (CRC) progression via the NOL6-STAMBP-YY1-c-Myc loop. Moreover, lactylation at lysine 54 (K54) of NOL6 stabilizes NOL6 by inhibiting its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Targeting NOL6 lactylation site with a peptide inhibitor (K54-pe4) holds promise for CRC treatment.

                Yin et al. demonstrate that extracellular proteins internalized via macropinocytosis serve as an amino acid reservoir in activated T cells, supporting mTORC1 activity and sustaining cytokine production after T cell activation. Notably, this metabolic pathway is impaired in tumor-infiltrating T cells from older patients with lung cancer.

                Berhin et al. show that in Arabidopsis seedlings, GPAT2 plays a specific role in root cap cuticle formation. GPAT2 is required for the incorporation of ester-bound unsubstituted C26/C28 fatty acids and C16/C18 oxygenated fatty acids into the cuticle, thereby influencing mucilage presence and modifying diffusion barrier properties.

                Mercadal et al. show that rhizoid patterning in Marchantia gemmae is consistent with RSL1 local activation and FRH1 diffusion-mediated lateral inhibition. They describe a nonlinear mechanism involving randomness and naturally operating at criticality. The research uncovers a mode of cellular pattern formation with potential relevance across biological systems.

                Currently, there are limited means to transduce muscle stem/satellite cells in vivo. Mochida et al. show that CRISPR-Cas9 RNA can be introduced effectively into satellite cells by lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). Genome editing was maintained even after inducing muscle injury, suggesting a therapeutic advantage of genetically repairing satellite cells.

This process prevents adenosylcobalamin accumulation, hyperactive catabolism, and oxidative stress, which are shown to be detrimental to stem cell maintenance and function.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103542">A system for functional studies of the major virulence factor of malaria parasites</a></h4>

              
                PfEMP1 is a variable antigen displayed on erythrocytes infected with the malaria parasite <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i>. PfEMP1 mediates binding of the infected cell to the endothelium of blood vessels, a cause of severe malaria. Each parasite encodes ~60 different PfEMP1 variants but only one is expressed at a time. Switching between variants underlies immune evasion in the host and variant-specific severity of disease. PfEMP1 is difficult to study due to expression heterogeneity between parasites which also renders genetic modification approaches ineffective. Here, we used selection-linked integration (SLI) to generate parasites all expressing the same PfEMP1 variant and genome edit the expressed locus. Moving this system from the reference strain 3D7 to IT4 resulted in PfEMP1 expressor parasites with effective receptor binding capacities. We also introduce a second version of SLI (SLI2) to introduce additional genome edits. Using these systems, we study PfEMP1 trafficking, generate cell lines binding to the most common endothelial receptors, survey the protein environment from functional PfEMP1 in the host cell, and identify new proteins needed for PfEMP1-mediated sequestration. These findings show the usefulness of the system to study the key virulence factor of malaria parasites.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105465">DANCE provides an open-source and low-cost approach to quantify aggression and courtship in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Quantifying animal behavior is pivotal for identifying the neuronal and genetic mechanisms involved. Computational approaches have enabled automated analysis of complex behaviors such as aggression and courtship in <i>Drosophila</i>. However, existing approaches rely on rule-based algorithms and expensive hardware, limiting sensitivity to behavioral variations and accessibility. Here, we present the <i><span class="underline">D</span>rosophila</i> <span class="underline">A</span>ggression a<span class="underline">n</span>d <span class="underline">C</span>ourtship <span class="underline">E</span>valuator (DANCE), a low-cost, open-source platform that combines machine learning-based classifiers and inexpensive hardware to quantify aggression and courtship. DANCE consists of six novel behavioral classifiers trained using a supervised machine learning algorithm. DANCE classifiers address key limitations of rule-based algorithms, capturing dynamic behavioral variations more effectively. DANCE hardware is constructed using medicine blister packs and acrylic sheets, with recordings acquired using smartphones, making it affordable and accessible. Benchmarking demonstrated that DANCE hardware performs comparably to high-cost setups. We validated DANCE in diverse contexts, including social isolation vs. enrichment, which modulates aggression and courtship; RNAi-mediated downregulation of the neuropeptide Dsk; and optogenetic silencing of dopaminergic neurons, which promotes aggression. DANCE provides a cost-effective and portable solution for studying behaviors in resource-limited settings or near natural habitats. Its accessibility and robust performance democratize behavioral neuroscience, enabling rapid screening of genes and neuronal circuits underlying complex social behaviors.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106989">Glycosylated IgG antibodies contribute to the recovery of haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome patients</a></h4>

              
                Haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is a fatal disease caused by Hantaan virus (HTNV) infection. Humoral immunity is essential for effective viral clearance; however, the glycosylation characteristics of immunoglobulin G (IgG) in HFRS patients are not well known. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from HFRS patients were obtained for B subset analysis using scRNA-seq and flow cytometry. HTNV-specific IgG antibody titers were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and IgG glycosylation was analyzed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography. The proportions of the antibody-secreting memory (ASM) B cells and plasmablasts (PB) were significantly expanded among acute HFRS patients. We discovered significantly increased fucosylated IgG and decreased bisecting N-acetylglucosamine during the convalescent phase of HTNV infection. Meanwhile, positive correlations were observed between ASM subsets and galactosylation/sialylation in the IgG Fc region, and between PB subsets and sialylation. Notably, the glycosylation-related genes, such as <i>RPN1 and RPN2</i>, were primarily expressed differentially in the ASM and PB subclusters, which were enriched in the N-glycosylation modifications of proteins through asparagine. Our findings indicated that IgG N-glycosylation may play a crucial role in combating HTNV infection and contributing to clinical recovery, which provided new insights for optimizing glycoengineered therapeutic antibodies.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96783">Sex differences in bile acid homeostasis and excretion underlie the disparity in liver cancer incidence between males and females</a></h4>

              
                Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the common liver cancer, exhibits higher incidence in males. Here, we report that mice lacking bile acid (BA) regulators, Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR also termed NR1H4) and Small Heterodimer Partner (SHP also termed NR0B2), recapitulate the sex difference in liver cancer risk. Since few therapeutic options are available, we focused on understanding the intrinsic protection afforded to female livers. Transcriptomic analysis in control and NR1H4 and NR0B2 double knockout livers identified female-specific changes in metabolism, including amino acids, lipids, and steroids. To assess translational relevance, we examined if transcriptomic signatures obtained from this murine HCC model correlate with survival outcomes for HCC patients. Gene signatures unique to the knockout females correspond with low-grade tumors and better survival. Ovariectomy blunts the metabolic changes and promotes liver tumorigenesis in females that, intriguingly, coincides with increased serum bile acid (BA) levels. Despite similar genetics, knockout male mice displayed higher serum BA concentrations, while female knockouts excreted more BAs. Decreasing enterohepatic BA recirculation using cholestyramine, an FDA-approved resin, dramatically reduced the liver cancer burden in male mice. Overall, we reveal that sex-specific BA metabolism leading to lower circulating BA concentration protects female livers from developing cancer. Thus, targeting BA excretion may be a promising therapeutic strategy against HCC.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100129">Dual-modal metabolic analysis reveals hypothermia-reversible uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation in neonatal brain hypoxia-ischemia</a></h4>

              
                Hypoxia-ischemia (HI), which disrupts the oxygen supply-demand balance in the brain by impairing blood oxygen supply and the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO<sub>2</sub>), is a leading cause of neonatal brain injury. However, it is unclear how post-HI hypothermia helps to restore the balance, as cooling reduces CMRO<sub>2</sub>. Also, how transient HI leads to secondary energy failure (SEF) in neonatal brains remains elusive. Using photoacoustic microscopy, we examined the effects of HI on CMRO<sub>2</sub> in awake 10-day-old mice, supplemented by bioenergetic analysis of purified cortical mitochondria. Our results show that while HI suppresses ipsilateral CMRO<sub>2</sub>, it sparks a prolonged CMRO<sub>2</sub>-surge post-HI, associated with increased mitochondrial oxygen consumption, superoxide emission, and reduced mitochondrial membrane potential necessary for ATP synthesis—indicating oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) uncoupling. Post-HI hypothermia prevents the CMRO<sub>2</sub>-surge by constraining oxygen extraction fraction, reduces mitochondrial oxidative stress, and maintains ATP and N-acetylaspartate levels, resulting in attenuated infarction at 24 hr post-HI. Our findings suggest that OXPHOS-uncoupling induced by the post-HI CMRO<sub>2</sub>-surge underlies SEF and blocking the surge is a key mechanism of hypothermia protection. Also, our study highlights the potential of optical CMRO<sub>2</sub> measurements for detecting neonatal HI brain injury and guiding the titration of therapeutic hypothermia at the bedside.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105321">ANKEF1 is a key axonemal component essential for murine sperm motility and male fertility</a></h4>

              
                Sperm motility is essential for male fertility and depends on the structural integrity of the sperm axoneme, which features a canonical ‘9 + 2’ microtubule arrangement. This structure comprises nine outer doublet microtubules (DMTs) that are associated with various macromolecular complexes. Among them, the nexin–dynein regulatory complex (N-DRC) forms crossbridges between adjacent DMTs, contributing to their stabilization and enabling flagellar bending. In this study, we investigated Ankyrin repeat and EF-hand domain containing 1 (ANKEF1, also known as ANKRD5), a protein highly expressed in the sperm axoneme. We found that ANKEF1 interacts with DRC5/TCTE1 and DRC4/GAS8, two key components of the N-DRC, and these interactions occur independently of calcium regulation. Male <i>Ankef1</i><sup>−/−</sup> mice exhibited impaired sperm motility and infertility. Cryo-electron tomography revealed a typical ‘9 + 2’ axoneme structure with intact DMTs in <i>Ankef1</i> null sperm; however, the DMTs showed pronounced morphological variability and increased structural heterogeneity. Notably, ANKEF1 deficiency did not alter ATP levels, reactive oxygen species levels, or mitochondrial membrane potential. These findings suggest that ANKEF1 may attenuate the N-DRC’s mechanical buffering—akin to a ‘car bumper’—between adjacent DMTs, thereby compromising axonemal stability under high mechanical stress during vigorous flagellar beating.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104545">Therapeutic benefits of maintaining CDK4/6 inhibitors and incorporating CDK2 inhibitors beyond progression in breast cancer</a></h4>

              
                CDK4/6 inhibitors (CDK4/6i) with endocrine therapy are standard for hormone receptor-positive (HR<sup>+</sup>) metastatic breast cancer. However, most patients eventually develop resistance and discontinue treatment, and there is currently no consensus on effective second-line strategies. Using preclinical HR<sup>+</sup> human breast cancer models with acquired resistance to CDK4/6i, we demonstrate that maintaining CDK4/6i therapy, either alone or combined with CDK2 inhibitors (CDK2i), slows the growth of resistant tumors by prolonging G1 progression. Mechanistically, sustained CDK4/6 blockade in drug-resistant cells reduces E2F transcription and delays G1/S via a noncanonical, posttranslational regulation of retinoblastoma protein (Rb). Durable suppression of both CDK2 activity and growth of drug-resistant cells requires co-administration of CDK2i with CDK4/6i. Moreover, cyclin E overexpression drives resistance to the combination of CDK4/6i and CDK2i. These findings elucidate how continued CDK4/6 blockade constrains resistant tumors and support clinical strategies that maintain CDK4/6i while selectively incorporating CDK2i to overcome resistance.

                A mechanistic understanding of neurodevelopment requires us to follow the multiscale processes that connect molecular genetic processes to macroscopic cerebral cortical formations and thence to neurological function. Using MRI of the brain of the ferret, a model organism for studying cortical morphogenesis, we create in vitro physical gel models and in silico numerical simulations of normal brain gyrification. Using observations of genetically manipulated animal models, we identify cerebral cortical thickness and cortical expansion rate as the primary drivers of dysmorphogenesis and demonstrate that in silico models allow us to examine the causes of aberrations in morphology and developmental processes at various stages of cortical ontogenesis. Finally, we explain analogous cortical malformations in human brains, with comparisons with human phenotypes induced by the same genetic defects, providing a unified perspective on brain morphogenesis that is driven proximally by genetic causes and affected mechanically via variations in the geometry of the brain and differential growth of the cortex.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/107138">Morphogenesis and morphometry of brain folding patterns across species</a></h4>

              
                Evolutionary adaptations associated with the formation of a folded cortex in many mammalian brains are thought to be a critical specialization associated with higher cognitive function. The dramatic surface expansion and highly convoluted folding of the cortex during early development is a theme with variations that suggest the need for a comparative study of cortical gyrification. Here, we use a combination of physical experiments using gels, computational morphogenesis, and geometric morphometrics to study the folding of brains across different species. Starting with magnetic resonance images of brains of a newborn ferret, a fetal macaque, and a fetal human, we construct two-layer physical gel brain models that swell superficially in a solvent, leading to folding patterns similar to those seen in vivo. We then adopt a three-dimensional continuum model based on differential growth to simulate cortical folding in silico. Finally, we deploy a comparative morphometric analysis of the in vivo, in vitro, and in silico surface buckling patterns across species. Our study shows that a simple mechanical instability driven by differential growth suffices to explain cortical folding and suggests that variations in the tangential growth and different initial geometries are sufficient to explain the differences in cortical folding across species.

">DISTINCT LYSOSOMAL DYSFUNCTION PATTERNS OF PROGRANULIN DEFICIENCY IN THE CNS IMPLICATE PROGRANULIN IN CELL TYPE-SPECIFIC PROTEIN SORTING</a></h4>

              
                Loss-of-function mutations in Progranulin (GRN) cause neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL) and hereditary frontotemporal dementia, presumably through lysosomal dysfunction. The effect of progranulin deficiency on cell type-specific lysosomal composition in the mammalian brain has not been examined. We used cell type-specific LysoIP to perform tandem-mass-tag mass-spectrometry and detected distinct aberrant proteomic signatures in progranulin-deficient astrocytes, neurons, and microglia, indicating cell type-specific dysregulation of key lysosomal proteins with crucial functions in sphingolipid metabolism and lysosome organization. These proteins markedly differed from progranulin-deficient RNAseq data sets, suggesting progranulin regulates lysosomal composition through post-translational mechanisms including the sorting of nascent proteins to the lysosome. Validation experiments confirmed that Mfsd8 and Ppt1, proteins whose mutation on their own cause NCL, were essentially absent from progranulin-deficient neuronal and microglial lysosomes, respectively. Our findings suggest that progranulin may function as an essential hub protein during endolysosomal sorting and highlight the necessity of restoring stoichiometric levels of progranulin expression in the secretory pathway for the development of effective therapeutic strategies.

">Prefrontal 5-HT2A receptors directly contribute to tic ontogeny: translational evidence</a></h4>

              
                Tourette syndrome (TS) is a neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by motor and vocal tics and frequently accompanied by comorbidities such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and pathological aggression. Although approved pharmacotherapies often reduce tic severity, they frequently cause adverse effects and are insufficient for managing comorbid symptoms, underscoring the need for improved treatments. Recent evidence indicates that the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor (5-HT2AR) antagonist pimavanserin reduces tic severity and improves quality of life, yet its mechanism of action in TS remains unclear. Here, we combine postmortem human and preclinical approaches to gain insight into the role of 5-HT2ARs in TS. Western-blot analyses of postmortem prefrontal cortex (PFC) samples obtained from individuals with TS revealed a pronounced, male-specific elevation of 5-HT2AR protein levels in Brodmann Area (BA) 10. We then tested pimavanserin and the selective 5-HT2AR antagonist volinanserin in two mouse models of TS: D1CT-7 transgenic mice and mice with early-life depletion of striatal cholinergic interneurons. Systemic administration of pimavanserin (1-2 mg/kg, IP) or volinanserin (0.1-0.3 mg/kg, IP) robustly reduced tic-like movements and stereotypies in both models. Local infusion of pimavanserin into the medial PFC, but not the dorsal striatum, recapitulated these effects, indicating a cortical locus of action. Pimavanserin also reduced resident-intruder aggression, but not locomotion or anxiety-like behavior. Together, these findings identify elevated prefrontal 5-HT2ARs as a key mechanistic contributor to TS and a promising therapeutic target for individuals with TS and pathological aggression.

">Chemogenetic activation of hippocampal area CA2 promotes acute and chronic seizures in a mouse model of epilepsy</a></h4>

              
                Pyramidal cells (PCs) of hippocampal area CA2 exhibit increased excitability in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and in mouse models of TLE. In epileptic mice, selective inhibition of CA2 PCs reduces chronic seizures. Here we asked if activating CA2 PCs increases seizures. Mice expressing Cre recombinase in CA2 PCs (Amigo2-Cre mice) were injected with the convulsant pilocarpine to induce a period of severe seizures (status epilepticus, SE), which leads to chronic seizures after 3-4 weeks (epilepsy). Epileptic mice were injected with a Cre-dependent adeno-associated virus (AAV) to express an excitatory designer receptor exclusively activated by designer drug (eDREADD; hM3Dq) in dorsal CA2 bilaterally and implanted with subdural EEG electrodes. After recovery, mice were recorded continuously using video and EEG for 6 weeks, 3 weeks with drinking water containing the eDREADD activator clozapine-N-oxide (CNO) and 3 weeks without CNO. CA2 activation with CNO caused a significant increase in seizure frequency and duration. Seizures occurred in clusters (many seizures per day over several consecutive days) and mice given water with CNO had a greater maximum number of seizures per day during a cluster compared to water without CNO. CNO had no significant effect in control mice. In naive Amigo2-Cre mice expressing hM3Dq, pre-treatment with CNO before pilocarpine administration shortened the latency to SE and increased EEG power at the start of SE. Taken together with prior findings, the results suggest that CA2 is a control point for regulating seizures in the pilocarpine mouse model of TLE.

">Altered aperiodic EEG spectral power during speech perception task is associated with verbal communication in youths with Autism Spectrum Disorder</a></h4>

              
                Most children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) have co-occurring language impairment, but its neural mechanisms are not well known. Excitation (E) / inhibition (I) imbalance is considered as a key neurobiological mechanism of ASD, and several electroencephalography (EEG)-based E/I balance metrics have been proposed in the previous studies. The goal of the present research was to focus on these metrics abstracted from the speech perception task to investigate their relation to language/communication in autistic youths. We used a high-density 128-channel EEG to register neural responses during speech perception task in the sex- and age-matched groups of youths with ASD (N = 162) and typically developing (TD) controls (N = 144), aged 7-18 years old. The results revealed alterations in the E/I measures in the ASD group, pointing to a higher level of excitation or neural "noise" in the cortex as well as broadband reduction of spectral power during speech perception. A greater neural "noise" reflected in the reduction of aperiodic exponent and offset was associated with lower verbal communication skills in youths with ASD. The findings suggested that the higher "noisiness" in the cortical systems may be a relevant marker to monitor in relation to language/communication in ASD.

">Single-cell atlas of the developing Down syndrome brain cortex</a></h4>

              
                Down syndrome (DS), caused by trisomy of chromosome 21, is the leading genetic cause of intellectual disability, yet the mechanisms disrupting fetal brain development remain unclear. We performed single cell transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility profiling of approximately 250,000 cells from 15 DS and 15 control human fetal cortices (10 to 20 weeks post-conception). Our analysis revealed a subtype-specific reduction in RORB/FOXP1 expressing excitatory neurons and widespread disruption of neurodevelopmental transcriptional programs. Chromosome 21 transcription factors BACH1, PKNOX1, and GABPA emerged as dosage-sensitive hubs regulating genes linked to intellectual disability. Antisense oligonucleotide mediated normalization of these factors in human neural progenitors in vitro partially rescued target gene expression. Benchmarking a humanized in vivo model captured additional molecular and cellular signatures of DS, complementing the in vitro model. Together, this resource defines the gene regulatory landscape underlying cortical development in DS and highlights candidate molecular targets and preclinical models for further investigation.

">A mouse model of CHCHD10 p.R15L familial ALS presents mild, age-related motor neuron degeneration without protein instability or mitochondrial dysfunction</a></h4>

              
                Mutations in the mitochondrial protein CHCHD10 (D10) cause a spectrum of hereditary neurodegenerative disorders. Among these, the p.R15L variant is linked to a slowly progressive, late-onset familial form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) with unclear pathogenic mechanisms. To better understand this, we investigated a knock-in (KI) mouse model carrying the p.R15L mutation in the endogenous protein. Unlike previously described mutant D10 KI models, p.R15L KI mice exhibited normal D10 protein levels, with no evidence of large protein aggregates. Mitochondrial respiration and hydrogen peroxide emission in mitochondria isolated from muscle and brain were unaltered. Similarly, fibroblasts from human p.R15L carriers exhibited normal D10 levels and unchanged oxidative phosphorylation function. Histochemical analyses of p.R15L KI muscle revealed mild increases in mitochondrial enzymatic activity in a subset of muscle fibers and muscle transcriptomics showed elevated expression of PGC-1, suggesting enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis. p.R15L KI mice developed subtle, late-onset phenotypes, including reduced body weight and motor activity and increased anxiety-like behavior. Importantly, in aged mice electrophysiological studies demonstrated decreased amplitude of the compound muscle action potential, commensurate with a moderate loss of spinal cord motor neurons and elevated serum neurofilament light levels, indicative of neurodegeneration. Together, these results indicate that the p.R15L mutation produces a mild, late-onset motor neuron phenotype in mice, partially recapitulating the human disease, without mitochondrial functional or morphological alterations. The findings indicate that p.R15L D10 selectively impairs mouse motor neurons through a gain-of-function mechanism, providing a genetically accurate yet mild in vivo model of familial ALS.

">GM1-oligosaccharide rescues rotenone-impaired neuronal polarization through RhoA/ROCK modulation and mitochondrial protection</a></h4>

              
                Neuronal polarization is a fundamental process in the formation of functional neural circuits, relying on the precise coordination between cytoskeletal regulatory signals and mechanisms that sustain cellular integrity. Disruption of these processes compromises neuronal differentiation and survival, and various neurotoxic compounds, including certain pesticides, have been associated with such dysfunctions. In this context, identifying molecules that counteract these detrimental effects is of significant therapeutic interest. Neuronal polarization is essential for the establishment of functional neural circuits and relies on coordinated regulation of actin cytoskeleton dynamics, RhoA/ROCK signaling, and mitochondrial function. Here, we investigated the neuroprotective and neurorestorative potential of the ganglioside GM1 and its oligosaccharide derivative, osGM1, in primary hippocampal pyramidal neurons exposed to the mitochondrial neurotoxin rotenone. Rotenone induced a marked arrest of neuronal development, impaired axonal elongation, and disrupted mitochondrial organization and membrane potential. Both GM1 and osGM1 promoted recovery of neuronal polarity and axonal growth, exerting protective and restorative effects even under continuous toxin exposure, with osGM1 showing superior efficacy. Notably, osGM1 also reversed axonal growth deficits caused by pathological actin stabilization. Mechanistically, osGM1 normalized rotenone-induced hyperactivation of the RhoA/ROCK pathway without altering basal signaling and partially restored mitochondrial network integrity and function. Collectively, these findings identify osGM1 as a multi-target modulator of cytoskeletal and mitochondrial dysfunction and support its translational potential as a therapeutic strategy to counteract neurotoxin-induced neuronal damage.

">Categorical rhythmic priors in macaques</a></h4>

              
                Rhythmic ability is a universal aspect of human cultures and sets the basis for musical rhythm perception and synchronization. While humans can synchronize movements to complex rhythms, it is unclear whether this capability extends to our primate ancestors. In this study, we explore whether primates can synchronize to complex rhythms and acquire rhythmic representations with generalizability akin to humans. Using controlled behavioral experiments, we provide evidence that monkeys not only can synchronize to short-long or long-short rhythms but also learn representations that generalize across a wide range of rhythm ratios and total durations. These results indicate ability to flexibly represent ratios within a relative timing framework is not exclusive to humans, but it is also present in monkeys. In addition, the produced intervals show a bias towards rhythmic categories. Notably, in an iterative tapping task, macaques and humans showed large priors for isochrony and integer ratios (2:1, 3:1). These results demonstrate a common biological foundation for rhythm synchronization in primates, extending our understanding of the shared cognitive mechanisms between primates and humans, and highlight the enormous potential of using monkeys to study the neurophysiological basis of complex rhythm perception.

">Investigating the mechanisms underlying saccade generation in the frontal eye fields using multi-site microstimulation</a></h4>

              
                The frontal eye field (FEF), a region of frontal cortex, has long been associated with the cortical control of eye movements. Classically, saccades can be reliably evoked by delivering low-intensity electrical microstimulation to the FEF. Although this makes clear the importance of FEF in the descending control of eye movements, the way in which population activity in the FEF is integrated by downstream regions to generate a motor command remains a mystery. To probe these mechanisms, we used a 16-channel microelectrode array to deliver microstimulation to the FEF of two awake, behaving monkeys. First, we found that larger current intensities were required to evoke changes in saccade direction relative to saccade amplitude when single-site saccades were evoked by stimulating a single contact on the array. Second, when stimulating two contacts simultaneously to investigate how population activity in the FEF is read out, a new polar average model more accurately predicted the amplitude and direction of dual-site saccades than traditional vector sum and vector average models. Using preexisting data from the superior colliculus (SC), we found that although the polar average model was more accurate at predicting saccade amplitude in the SC, it was no more accurate than traditional models at predicting saccade direction. Finally, when stimulating two contacts in FEF simultaneously with unequal current intensities, model accuracy depended on the amplitude of the saccades evoked by stimulating each individual site alone, suggesting that the brain may flexibly combine amplitude and direction information from the FEF to generate saccadic plans.

">Intensity-dependent corticospinal facilitation by repetitive peripheral magnetic stimulation: Evidence for a major contribution of group I afferents</a></h4>

              
                Background: Repetitive peripheral magnetic stimulation (PMS) is increasingly used in neurorehabilitation, yet the optimal stimulation intensity for inducing corticospinal facilitation and the underlying afferent mechanisms remain unclear. We investigated the intensity-dependent effects of repetitive PMS on corticospinal excitability and single motor unit responses, and tested group I afferent contribution. Methods: Healthy participants received repetitive PMS (25 Hz; 2-s ON/2-s OFF) over the extensor carpi radialis (ECR) in a crossover design at 0.9x motor threshold (MT), 1.2xMT, and high intensity sufficient to induce maximal wrist dorsiflexion (mean 1.8xMT). Motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation were recorded from the ECR and flexor carpi radialis (FCR) before and during the intervention (total 15 min). The lasting effects were assessed after 9 min of high-intensity PMS for 50 min. To examine group I afferent contribution, the same high-intensity protocol was applied during upper-arm ischemia after reducing the ECR H-reflex to <10% of baseline. Sensory-motor input characteristics across stimulation intensities were compared using post-stimulus time histograms of ECR single motor unit firings during weak voluntary contraction. Results: High-intensity PMS significantly increased ECR MEPs after 9 min of intervention, whereas 1.2xMT of PMS required 15 min to induce a marked effect. PMS at 0.9xMT did not induce significant MEP changes. Across all intensities, the FCR MEPs remained unaltered. ECR MEPs remained markedly elevated for up to 30 min after 9 min of high-intensity PMS. In contrast, PMS delivered during ischemia produced no MEP enhancement. The motor unit analysis revealed that suprathreshold PMS elicited an early peak in firing probability--consistent with monosynaptic Ia excitation--whose amplitude increased with stimulation intensity, whereas PMS at 0.9xMT produced no discernible peak. Conclusions: Repetitive PMS above MT facilitates corticospinal excitability in an intensity-dependent manner. Facilitation was abolished during ischemia. Together with the presence of a short-latency peak in motor unit firing via a monosynaptic pathway, this finding supports a major contribution of large-diameter muscle afferents, with a substantial Ia component, to PMS-induced corticospinal facilitation.

">Transcriptional Changes Fade Prior to Long-Term Memory for Sensitization of the Aplysia Siphon-Withdrawal Reflex</a></h4>

              
                Forming a long-term memory requires changes in neuronal transcription. What happens, though, as the memory is forgotten? And how does the transcriptional state relate to the maintenance and recall of the long-term memory? To answer these questions we have been systematically tracing the time-course of transcriptional changes evoked by long-term sensitization in the marine mollusk Aplysia californica. Our approach captures transcriptional changes in neurons of known behavioral relevance using a within-subjects design, delineating patterns of transcriptional change that are comprehensive and reproducible. We have previously reported that within 1 day of long-term sensitization training there is a widespread transcriptional response involving robust changes in over 5% of tested transcripts (1,252 of ~22k; Conte, 2017). Within 1 week, however, memory strength fades and nearly all transcriptional changes relapse to baseline (Perez, 2018). Here we report microarray analysis (N = 16) of transcriptional changes 5 days post-learning, a time-point when memory strength has weakened but is still robust. Remarkably, we find that at this intermediate behavioral stage nearly all transcriptional changes have fully decayed, even in subsets of animals that have shown very little forgetting. Thus, most transcriptional changes seem to decay more rapidly than memory expression. We discuss several possible ways that memory expression could become decoupled from detectable transcriptional regulation.

                Visualizing active neurons and circuits in vivo is critical for investigating the neural activity that underlies behavior. While several established methodologies are available to achieve this end in larval zebrafish, they are limited by the scale of tissue visualization, temporal resolution, need to restrain larvae, and/or accessibility of necessary instruments. Here, we establish a pipeline for the visualization and quantification of spatiotemporally precise whole-brain neural activity in larval zebrafish using CaMPARI2, a genetically encoded calcium indicator. Using temporally specific photoconverting UV light exposures, we capture whole-brain "snapshots" of neural activity time-locked to stimuli during unrestrained larval behavior. We optimize experimental conditions for establishing sub-second neuronal activity changes across acoustically-evoked behavioral paradigms spanning minutes to hours. We then leverage this system to pinpoint brain-wide neural activity changes during nonassociative habituation learning, observing distinct activity signatures in the subpallium, preoptic area, and habenulae that are altered through pharmacological disruption of habituation learning. This approach effectively complements the temporal precision achievable through post hoc activity detection methods and expands the accessibility of large-scale behavioral circuit dissection beyond highly specialized real-time volumetric imaging equipment.

">Slow Spindle Trains During Daytime Naps are Associated with Improved Declarative Memory Consolidation</a></h4>

              
                Memory consolidation refers to the process by which newly encoded memories are strengthened and retained over time, and ample evidence indicates that sleep supports this process for both procedural and declarative memories. Although sleep spindles during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep have been associated to consolidation, it remains unclear whether all spindle types contribute equally. Spindles vary in frequency and topography - slow spindles (<=12.5Hz) predominating over frontal regions, whereas fast spindles (>12.5Hz) peak parietally - and recent work suggests that procedural memory consolidation during overnight sleep is related to the temporal organization of spindles in trains (i.e., events occurring <6s apart). Here we investigated whether a similar mechanism operates for declarative memory during daytime naps. Participants were assigned to a Nap (N=23) or No-Nap (N=15) group, and completed an object-spatial location task involving 36 item-location associations. Memory was assessed immediately after learning and again following a 90-minute nap or an equivalent wake period. Results showed that the Nap group exhibited significantly better delayed memory, as measured by combined recall-recognition score, and a greater proportion of participants maintained or improved their performance. In the Nap group, memory performance correlated with local spindle density at frontal and parietal sites, and, critically, with the proportion of slow spindles clustered in trains during NREM2. These findings suggest the temporal organization of slow spindles into clusters support declarative memory consolidation, pointing to a shared spindle-based mechanism across domains.

                Background Identity politics is one of political terminology which is subjected to continuous and increasingly contested conceptualization and use. Moreover, identity exists in all social level starting for individual to international level, which makes identity a multi-layer concept. There has been a great deal of identity-based terminological distortion and misconception in Ethiopian political discourses and practice since its formation in the modern form. One of the primary challenges in Ethiopian present political discourse is misconception, complexity, and contradiction between ethnic identity (የብሄር ማንነት) and civic identity or citizenship (የዜግነት ማንነት), which must be addressed in Ethiopian political discourse. Methods In this paper, critical post-modernism research philosophy and Dialectical Method is used to analyze the rotation of contradiction between Pan-Ethiopianism and Pan-ethnic nationalism. The narrative analysis is used to make a critical investigation of the vicious cycle unending dialectics of identity politics in Ethiopia. Discussion The current political situation is an indication of unending dialectics of Ethiopian politics. The existing politics of ethnic identity and citizenship indicate unending dialectic of political friction with the rotation of thesis and anti-thesis which left the state building projection of country incomplete and weak dialectical process. Wrong policy and political responses of successive regime to the nationality questions (quests for power sharing and autonomous self-government) resulted in the sustained and vicious circle of conflict. Conclusion Generally, it is argued that prescription of one side of nationalism at the expense of the other will never resolve the political crisis of the country. Therefore, it is recommended that both integrationist and accommodationist institutional design and multinational democratic federalism should be implemented effectively to cope with the salience of identity politics in the country.

                Background This bibliometric analysis evaluates health-related research in Public Health, Environmental Health, and Occupational Health (PHEOH) journals indexed in Scopus, categorized by Scimago quartiles (Q1–Q4) from 2016 to 2024. The study aims to identify trends, research productivity, and thematic priorities across these journals. Methods From 654 eligible journals, 100 (25 per quartile) were randomly selected. A total of 70,580 documents were retrieved from Scopus and analysed using Microsoft Excel and VOSviewer (v.1.6.20). Co-occurrence analysis of author and indexed keywords was performed separately for each quartile to identify research hotspots, thematic clusters, and trends over time. Results Q1 journals contributed the highest proportion of publications (37.7%), followed by Q2 (25.4%), Q4 (22.1%), and Q3 (14.8%). The United States dominated output in Q1–Q3 journals, whereas Pakistan led in Q4. Across all quartiles, “COVID-19” was the most frequent and highly connected author keyword, followed by mental health, SARS-CoV-2, and child-related research. Indexed keyword analysis ranked “humans” highest in every quartile. Topics related to SARS-CoV-2 and mental health received the highest average citations. Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic significantly influenced the research agenda of Public, Environmental, and Occupational Health journals between 2016 and 2024, particularly in higher-quartile outlets. The findings reveal persistent disparities in productivity across journal tiers and geographic regions.

                The increasing need for natural and safe food preservatives has triggered interest in bacteriocins (antimicrobial peptides) produced by lactic acid bacteria (LAB) as viable alternatives to chemical preservatives. This study aimed to optimize bacteriocin production from LAB isolated from Nigerian fermented foods and to evaluate its effectiveness in extending the shelf life of selected fruit juices. A total of 33 LAB strains were isolated from Nigerian local fermented foods (iru, fufu, and ogi) using MRS agar, screened for antibacterial activity against selected foodborne pathogens, and characterized using 16S rRNA sequencing. Five LAB strains were identified: Lactobacillus plantarum (PV937062, PV937063, PV937065), Lactobacillus paracasei (PV937064), and Lactobacillus acidophilus (PV937061). The agar well diffusion method was used to optimize the effects of culture age, pH, temperature, organic solvents, ultraviolet radiation, protease treatment, and storage conditions on the bacteriocin activity. This study demonstrated that optimized bacteriocins by LAB from Nigerian fermented food has the potential to be an effective food preservative by extending the shelf life of fruit juices as a safe and environmentally friendly alternative to synthetic preservatives to enhance food safety and quality.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>I recount the personal and professional circumstances that contributed to recognizing overdispersion in the discharge of hippocampal place cells. Place cell overdispersion describes the general fact that when a rodent passes through the cell's place field, action potential discharge is often surprisingly excessive or inadequate relative to expectations from the cell's firing rate map. These large deviations from place tuning are far beyond what random noise can explain. Instead, overdispersion indicates that there are additional extrapositional signals in place cell discharge, not merely place. I discuss that the finding might have been initially ignored because we did not identify a specific source of extrapositional information, and that today many have been identified. The narrative focuses on the overall importance of recognizing that there must be extrapositional signals (i.e., mixed selectivity) to the intellectual evolution of my research program.</p>

                Background High-need, high-cost inpatient cases represent a small proportion of hospital admissions yet account for a disproportionately large share of hospital expenditures. Understanding the factors that influence hospitals’ ability to recover costs from these cases is essential for improving financial performance and supporting sustainable healthcare financing. This study investigates how patient profile, patient care characteristics, and treatment-related factors shape the cost recovery rate of high-need, high-cost inpatient cases in Indonesian hospitals. Methods The study analyzed 121,482 inpatient cases from two public and two private hospitals between 2017 and 2020. All cases were covered under the National Health Insurance scheme. The analysis focused on the highest twenty-five percent of inpatient cases based on cost, representing approximately sixty percent of total inpatient expenditure. Cost recovery rate was defined as the ratio of reimbursement fee to hospital claim for each inpatient case. Multiple regression and decision tree analyses were used to identify factors associated with variations in cost recovery. Results Patient characteristics such as age and sex showed limited influence on cost recovery. In contrast, several patient care characteristics and treatment-related factors demonstrated substantial effects. Discharge type, severity level, and medical intervention category emerged as the most influential determinants of cost recovery among high-need, high-cost patients. Length of stay, care class, and use of intensive care also contributed to explaining variation but to a lesser extent. Conclusions The findings indicate that cost recovery is driven primarily by treatment complexity and patient care characteristics rather than patient demographic factors. Hospitals may enhance cost recovery for high-need, high-cost cases by strengthening discharge management, improving claim documentation for complex interventions, and standardizing care processes through structured clinical pathways. These measures can help improve financial performance while supporting more efficient resource allocation for patients requiring intensive services.

                Abstract* Background Cardiorespiratory fitness in young adults is an early marker of cardiometabolic risk, yet the contribution of diet and vitamin status to physical capacity in this group remains insufficiently defined. Methods In a cross-sectional study, 22 healthy adults (median age 28 years) were classified into normal (VO2max ≥84% predicted; n=9) and reduced endurance (VO2max <84% predicted; n=13) groups based on cardiopulmonary exercise testing on a cycle ergometer. All participants underwent anthropometry and bioimpedance analysis of body composition. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) was used to assess rest HR, peak HR, VO2 max, and VO2 max (% predicted). 72-hour food diaries were analyzed with specialized software, and serum concentrations of vitamins B₁, B2, B₆, B₁2, C, A, E, and D were measured using immunoassay and related techniques. Results The reduced endurance group reported higher total daily energy intake (2635.0 kcal/day vs. 1750.5 kcal/day; p=0.047) and carbohydrate intake (229.2 g/day vs. 163.9 g/day; p=0.007), whereas the normal endurance group consumed more vegetables (219.1 g/day vs. 110.0 g/day; p=0.025) and had higher serum vitamin D concentrations (34.6 ng/mL vs. 16.1 ng/mL; p=0.009). Physical capacity showed a positive correlation with serum vitamin D (r=0.606; p=0.003) and vegetable intake (r=0.576; p=0.008), while other measured vitamins and major food groups were not significantly associated with aerobic performance. Conclusions Among healthy young adults, better physical capacity was linked to higher vitamin D serum levels and vegetable consumption, independent of anthropometric differences. These findings suggest that optimizing vitamin D and plant-rich dietary patterns may support cardiorespiratory endurance in this population, although larger longitudinal studies are needed to confirm causality.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1464/v1?src=rss">Social Innovation in Entrepreneurship: A Strategic Pathway to Poverty Reduction for Sustainable Development: A systematic Literature Review [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                In this review, we examine how social innovation plays a role in entrepreneurship as a way to fight poverty and encourage sustainable development. While entrepreneurship has long been seen as a key driver of economic growth, our review establishes that there has been little focus on its link with social innovation. Specifically, more attention is needed on how it can address economic, social, and environmental challenges in a comprehensive way. This gap in the literature shows the need to better understand how entrepreneurial practices, when paired with social innovation, can create value beyond just financial success. The study is anchored on Diffusion of Innovations Theory, which provides a framework for understanding how novel entrepreneurial solutions are adopted and scaled within communities. To address this, the review applies a systematic literature review approach guided by PRISMA protocols. Empirical studies, reports, and peer-reviewed journal articles published between 2019 and 2025 were identified and thematically analysed to capture how social innovation is integrated into entrepreneurial strategies and practices. Findings indicate that interventions such as microfinance, digital platforms, vocational training, renewable energy projects, and community-driven models have demonstrated substantial potential in improving livelihoods and reducing vulnerability among marginalised populations. However, we observe that persistent challenges remain regarding long-term sustainability, scalability, and context-specific adaptation. What makes our review unique is its interdisciplinary approach, linking business strategy to social results. Our review offers a well-rounded view of how entrepreneurship can be used to tackle deep-rooted societal issues. This work adds to the existing knowledge by providing a thorough analysis of how social innovation in entrepreneurship can drive significant change, encourage inclusivity, and support sustainable development. It also offers insights that can guide future research, policy, and practice seeking to leverage entrepreneurial innovation for inclusive and sustainable development.

                <p>We used targeted immunopurification-mass spectrometry (IP-MS) to characterize human neurofilament light chain (NfL) proteoforms across various compartments to assess their alterations in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). NfL is truncated in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood in patients with sporadic ALS (sALS) and these proteoforms differ between compartments. Mid-domain species were elevated in CSF whereas plasma NfL proteoforms were mostly comprised of the tail subdomain region. Our results suggest NfL isoforms are proteolyzed and differentially distributed between ALS biofluid compartments and that analyzing by these specific regions or in ratios between regions can provide improvements in biomarker utility. These insights enhance the understanding of NfL and its potential for disease monitoring and therapeutic targeting in ALS. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                Background The integration of digital technologies into project-based language learning has attracted growing scholarly attention; however, research in this area remains conceptually fragmented. A systematic synthesis of theoretical foundations, projects typologies, language skills and knowledge addressed, and pedagogical implications of technology-enhanced project-based language learning (TEPBLL) is still limited. Methods Restricted to SSCI-indexed publications and guided by PRISMA 2020 protocols, this systematic review examined 31 empirical studies published between 2015 and 2024. The analysis focused on the nature of publications, underlying theoretical frameworks, types of technology-supported projects, reported language-learning outcomes, and implications for research and instructional practice. Results The reviewed studies indicate that TEPBLL research is predominantly grounded in five theoretical frameworks and encompasses seven diverse technology-supported projects types. Across studies, TEPBLL is frequently reported improvements in eight major skills and knowledge areas. The review also identifies recurring three dimensions of implications for instructional practice and future research. Conclusions This review systematically synthesizes prevailing patterns in the TEPBLL literature. The study offers a coherent and comprehensive overview that can guide future research design and support more theory-informed, methodologically rigorous, and context-sensitive application of TEPBLL.
