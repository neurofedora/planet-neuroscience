                <h4><a href="https://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(18)30315-1?rss=yes">Lateral Habenular Burst Firing as a Target of the Rapid Antidepressant Effects of Ketamine</a></h4>

The revolutionary discovery of the rapid antidepressant ketamine has been a milestone in psychiatry field in the last half century. Unlike conventional antidepressants that often take weeks to months to show efficacy, ketamine causes rapid antidepressant effects, emerging as early as within 1h after administration. However, how ketamine improves mood symptoms so quickly has remained elusive. Here, we first introduce the historical background of ketamine as a rapid antidepressant. We then discuss current hypotheses underlying ketamine’s rapid antidepressant effects, with a focus on our latest discovery that ketamine silences NMDAR-dependent burst firing in the ‘anti-reward center’, the lateral habenula.

<p>Analogous to the mirror neuron system repeatedly described in monkeys as a
possible substrate for imitation learning and/or action understanding, a
neuronal execution/observation matching system (OEMS) is assumed in humans, but
little is known to what extent this system is activated in non-experimental,
real-life conditions. In the present case study, we investigated brain activity
of this system during natural, non-experimental motor behavior as it occurred
during playing of the board game "Malefiz". We compared spectral modulations of
the high-gamma band related to ipsilateral reaching movement execution and
observation of the same kind of movement using electrocorticography (ECoG) in
one participant. Spatially coincident activity during both conditions execution
and observation was recorded at electrode contacts over the premotor/primary
motor cortex. The topography and amplitude of the high-gamma modulations
related to both, movement observation and execution were clearly spatially
correlated over several fronto-parietal brain areas. Thus, our findings
indicate that a network of cortical areas contributes to the human OEMS, beyond
primary/premotor cortex including Brocas area and the temporo-parieto-occipital
junction area, in real-life conditions.

<p>Background: Building visual encoding models to accurately predict visual
responses is a central challenge for current vision-based brain-machine
interface techniques. To achieve high prediction accuracy on neural signals,
visual encoding models should include precise visual features and appropriate
prediction algorithms. Most existing visual encoding models employ hand-craft
visual features (e.g., Gabor wavelets or semantic labels) or data-driven
features (e.g., features extracted from deep neural networks (DNN)). They also
assume a linear mapping between feature representation to brain activity.
However, it remains unknown whether such linear mapping is sufficient for
maximizing prediction accuracy. New Method: We construct a new visual encoding
framework to predict cortical responses in a benchmark functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI) dataset. In this framework, we employ the transfer
learning technique to incorporate a pre-trained DNN (i.e., AlexNet) and train a
nonlinear mapping from visual features to brain activity. This nonlinear
mapping replaces the conventional linear mapping and is supposed to improve
prediction accuracy on brain activity. Results: The proposed framework can
significantly predict responses of over 20% voxels in early visual areas (i.e.,
V1-lateral occipital region, LO) and achieve unprecedented prediction accuracy.
Comparison with Existing Methods: Comparing to two conventional visual encoding
models, we find that the proposed encoding model shows consistent higher
prediction accuracy in all early visual areas, especially in relatively
anterior visual areas (i.e., V4 and LO). Conclusions: Our work proposes a new
framework to utilize pre-trained visual features and train non-linear mappings
from visual features to brain activity.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/44341">Synergy and remarkable specificity of antimicrobial peptides <i>in vivo</i> using a systematic knockout approach</a></h4>

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are host-encoded antibiotics that combat invading microorganisms. These short, cationic peptides have been implicated in many biological processes, primarily involving innate immunity. <i>In vitro</i> studies have shown AMPs kill bacteria and fungi at physiological concentrations, but little validation has been done <i>in vivo</i>. We utilised CRISPR gene editing to delete all known immune inducible AMPs of <i>Drosophila,</i> namely: 4 Attacins, 4 Cecropins, 2 Diptericins, Drosocin, Drosomycin, Metchnikowin and Defensin. Using individual and multiple knockouts, including flies lacking all 14 AMP genes, we characterize the <i>in vivo</i> function of individual and groups of AMPs against diverse bacterial and fungal pathogens. We found that <i>Drosophila</i> AMPs act primarily against Gram-negative bacteria and fungi, contributing either additively or synergistically. We also describe remarkable specificity wherein certain AMPs contribute the bulk of microbicidal activity against specific pathogens, providing functional demonstrations of highly specific AMP-pathogen interactions in an <i>in vivo</i> setting.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/43606">Long-term balancing selection drives evolution of immunity genes in <i>Capsella</i></a></h4>

Genetic drift is expected to remove polymorphism from populations over long periods of time, with the rate of polymorphism loss being accelerated when species experience strong reductions in population size. Adaptive forces that maintain genetic variation in populations, or balancing selection, might counteract this process. To understand the extent to which natural selection can drive the retention of genetic diversity, we document genomic variability after two parallel species-wide bottlenecks in the genus <i>Capsella</i>. We find that ancestral variation preferentially persists at immunity related loci, and that the same collection of alleles has been maintained in different lineages that have been separated for several million years. By reconstructing the evolution of the disease related locus <i>MLO2b</i>, we find that divergence between ancient haplotypes can be obscured by referenced based re-sequencing methods, and that trans-specific alleles can encode substantially diverged protein sequences. Our data point to long term balancing selection as an important factor shaping the genetics of immune systems in plants and as the predominant driver of genomic variability after a population bottleneck.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/42182">Kinesin-6 regulates cell-size-dependent spindle elongation velocity to keep mitosis duration constant in fission yeast</a></h4>

The length of the mitotic spindle scales with cell size in a wide range of organisms during embryonic development. Interestingly, in <i>C. elegans</i> embryos, this goes along with temporal regulation: larger cells speed up spindle assembly and elongation. We demonstrate that, similarly in fission yeast, spindle length and spindle dynamics adjust to cell size, which allows to keep mitosis duration constant. Since prolongation of mitosis was shown to affect cell viability, this may resemble a mechanism to regulate mitosis duration. We further reveal how the velocity of spindle elongation is regulated: coupled to cell size, the amount of kinesin-6 Klp9 molecules increases, resulting in an acceleration of spindle elongation in anaphase B. In addition, the number of Klp9 binding sites to microtubules increases overproportionally to Klp9 molecules, suggesting that molecular crowding inversely correlates to cell size and might have an impact on spindle elongation velocity control.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/40947">Somatic mutations in early metazoan genes disrupt regulatory links between unicellular and multicellular genes in cancer</a></h4>

Extensive transcriptional alterations are observed in cancer, many of which activate core biological processes established in unicellular organisms or suppress differentiation pathways formed in metazoans. Through rigorous, integrative analysis of genomics data from a range of solid tumours, we show many transcriptional changes in tumours are tied to mutations disrupting regulatory interactions between unicellular and multicellular genes within human gene regulatory networks (GRNs). Recurrent point mutations were enriched in regulator genes linking unicellular and multicellular subnetworks, while copy-number alterations affected downstream target genes in distinctly unicellular and multicellular regions of the GRN. Our results depict drivers of tumourigenesis as genes that created key regulatory links during the evolution of early multicellular life, whose dysfunction creates widespread dysregulation of primitive elements of the GRN. Several genes we identified as important in this process were associated with drug response, demonstrating the potential clinical value of our approach.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/40613">Bumblebee visual allometry results in locally improved resolution and globally improved sensitivity</a></h4>

The quality of visual information that is available to an animal is limited by the size of its eyes. Differences in eye size can be observed even between closely related individuals, yet we understand little about how this affects vision. Insects are good models for exploring the effects of size on visual systems because many insect species exhibit size polymorphism. Previous work has been limited by difficulties in determining the 3D structure of eyes. We have developed a novel method based on x-ray microtomography to measure the 3D structure of insect eyes and to calculate predictions of their visual capabilities. We used our method to investigate visual allometry in the bumblebee <i>Bombus terrestris</i> and found that size affects specific aspects of vision, including binocular overlap, optical sensitivity, and dorsofrontal visual resolution. This reveals that differential scaling between eye areas provides flexibility that improves the visual capabilities of larger bumblebees.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/40162">Motion sensing superpixels (MOSES) is a systematic computational framework to quantify and discover cellular motion phenotypes</a></h4>

Correct cell/cell interactions and motion dynamics are fundamental in tissue homeostasis, and defects in these cellular processes cause diseases. Therefore, there is strong interest in identifying factors, including drug candidates that affect cell/cell interactions and motion dynamics. However, existing quantitative tools for systematically interrogating complex motion phenotypes in timelapse datasets are limited. We present Motion Sensing Superpixels (MOSES), a computational framework that measures and characterises biological motion with a unique superpixel ‘mesh’ formulation. Using published datasets, MOSES demonstrates single-cell tracking capability and more advanced population quantification than Particle Image Velocimetry approaches. From &gt; 190 co-culture videos, MOSES motion-mapped the interactions between human esophageal squamous epithelial and columnar cells mimicking the esophageal squamous-columnar junction, a site where Barrett’s esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma often arise clinically. MOSES is a powerful tool that will facilitate unbiased, systematic analysis of cellular dynamics from high-content time-lapse imaging screens with little prior knowledge and few assumptions.

Engaging with vocal sounds is critical for children’s social-emotional learning, and children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) often ‘tune out’ voices in their environment. Little is known regarding the neurobiological basis of voice processing and its link to social impairments in ASD. Here, we perform the first comprehensive brain network analysis of voice processing in children with ASD. We examined neural responses elicited by unfamiliar voices and mother’s voice, a biologically salient voice for social learning, and identified a striking relationship between social communication abilities in children with ASD and activation in key structures of reward and salience processing regions. Functional connectivity between voice-selective and reward regions during voice processing predicted social communication in children with ASD and distinguished them from typically developing children. Results support the Social Motivation Theory of ASD by showing reward system deficits associated with the processing of a critical social stimulus, mother’s voice, in children with ASD.

Two-pore-domain potassium (K<sub>2P</sub>) channels are key regulators of many physiological and pathophysiological processes and thus emerged as promising drug targets. As for other potassium channels, there is a lack of selective blockers, since drugs preferentially bind to a conserved binding site located in the central cavity. Thus, there is a high medical need to identify novel drug-binding sites outside the conserved lipophilic central cavity and to identify new allosteric mechanisms of channel inhibition. Here, we identified a novel binding site and allosteric inhibition mechanism, disrupting the recently proposed K<sup>+</sup>-flux gating mechanism of K<sub>2P</sub> channels, which results in an unusual voltage-dependent block of leak channels belonging to the TASK subfamily. The new binding site and allosteric mechanism of inhibition provide structural and mechanistic insights into the gating of TASK channels and the basis for the drug design of a new class of potent blockers targeting specific types of K<sub>2P</sub> channels.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/39279">Adaptation of olfactory receptor abundances for efficient coding</a></h4>

Olfactory receptor usage is highly heterogeneous, with some receptor types being orders of magnitude more abundant than others. We propose an explanation for this striking fact: the receptor distribution is tuned to maximally represent information about the olfactory environment in a regime of efficient coding that is sensitive to the global context of correlated sensor responses. This model predicts that in mammals, where olfactory sensory neurons are replaced regularly, receptor abundances should continuously adapt to odor statistics. Experimentally, increased exposure to odorants leads variously, but reproducibly, to increased, decreased, or unchanged abundances of different activated receptors. We demonstrate that this diversity of effects is required for efficient coding when sensors are broadly correlated, and provide an algorithm for predicting which olfactory receptors should increase or decrease in abundance following specific environmental changes. Finally, we give simple dynamical rules for neural birth and death processes that might underlie this adaptation.

Spina bifida aperta (SBA), one of the most common congenital malformations, causes various neurological disorders. Pain is a common complaint of patients with SBA. However, little is known about the neuropathology of SBA-related pain. Because loss of {gamma}-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic neurons in the spinal cord dorsal horn is associated with pain, we hypothesized the existence of cross-talk between SBA-related pain and alterations in GABAergic transmission in the spinal cord. Therefore, we investigated the kinetics of GABAergic transmission in the spinal cord dorsal horn in a chicken model of SBA. Neonatal chicks with SBA exhibited various pain-like behaviors, such as an increased number of vocalizations with elevated intensity (loudness) and frequency (pitch), reduced mobility, difficulty with locomotion, and escape reactions. Furthermore, the chicks with SBA did not respond to standard toe-pinching, indicating disruption of the spinal cord sensorimotor networks. These behavioral observations were concomitant with loss of GABAergic transmission in the spinal cord dorsal horn. We also found apoptosis of GABAergic neurons in the superficial dorsal horn in the early neonatal period, although cellular abnormalization and propagation of neurodegenerative signals were evident at middle to advanced gestational stages. In conclusion, ablation of GABAergic neurons induced alterations in spinal cord neuronal networks, providing novel insights into the pathophysiology of SBA-related pain-like complications.

Both visual and proprioceptive information contribute to accurate limb movement, but the mechanism of integration of these different modality signals for movement control and learning remains controversial. Here, we aimed to elucidate the mechanism of integration by examining motor adaptation when various combinations of visual and proprioceptive perturbations were applied during reaching movements. We found that the movement corrections by adaptation were explained by a mechanism known as a divisive normalization, which was previously reported to be the mechanism underlying the integration of multisensory signals in neurons. Furthermore, we found evidence that the motor memory for each sensory modality was formed separately and the outputs from these memories were integrated. These results provide a novel view of the utilization of different sensory modality signals in motor control and adaptation.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/560672v1?rss=1">Single cell q-PCR derived expression profiles of identified sensory neurons</a></h4>

Sensory neurons are chemically and functionally heterogeneous and this heterogeneity has been examined extensively over the last several decades. These studies have employed a variety of different methodologies, including anatomical, electrophysiological and molecular approaches. Recent studies using next generation sequencing techniques have examined the transcriptome of single sensory neurons. Although, these reports have provided a wealth of exciting new information on the heterogeneity of sensory neurons, correlation with functional types is lacking. Here, we employed retrograde tracing of cutaneous and muscle afferents to examine the variety of mRNA expression profiles of individual, target-specific sensory neurons. In addition, we used an ex vivo skin/nerve/DRG/ spinal cord preparation to record and characterize the functional response properties of individual cutaneous sensory neurons that were then intracellularly labeled with fluorescent dyes, recovered from dissociated cultures and analyzed for gene expression. We found that by using single cell qPCR techniques and a limited set of genes, we can identify transcriptionally distinct groups. We have also used calcium imaging and single cell qPCR to determine the correlation between levels of mRNA expression and functional protein expression and how functional properties correlated with the different transcriptional groups. These studies show that although transcriptomics does map to functional types, within any one functional subgroup, there are highly variable patterns of gene expression. Thus, studies that rely on the expression pattern of one or a few genes as a stand in for physiological experiments, runs a high risk of data misinterpretation with respect to function.

Background: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with an increased risk of brain atrophy, aging-related diseases, and mortality. We examined potential advanced brain aging in MDD patients, and whether this process is associated with clinical characteristics in a large multi-center international dataset. Methods: We performed a mega-analysis by pooling brain measures derived from T1-weighted MRI scans from 29 samples worldwide. Normative brain aging was estimated by predicting chronological age (10-75 years) from 7 subcortical volumes, 34 cortical thickness and 34 surface area, lateral ventricles and total intracranial volume measures separately in 1,147 male and 1,386 female controls from the ENIGMA MDD working group. The learned model parameters were applied to 1,089 male controls and 1,167 depressed males, and 1,326 female controls and 2,044 depressed females to obtain independent unbiased brain-based age predictions. The difference between predicted brain age and chronological age was calculated to indicate brain predicted age difference (brain-PAD). Findings: On average, MDD patients showed a higher brain-PAD of +0.90 (SE 0.21) years (Cohen's d=0.12, 95% CI 0.06-0.17) compared to controls. Relative to controls, first-episode and currently depressed patients showed higher brain-PAD (+1.2 [0.3] years), and the largest effect was observed in those with late-onset depression (+1.7 [0.7] years). In addition, higher brain-PAD was associated with higher self-reported depressive symptomatology (b=0.05, p=0.004). Interpretation: This highly powered collaborative effort showed subtle patterns of abnormal structural brain aging in MDD. Substantial within-group variance and overlap between groups were observed. Longitudinal studies of MDD and somatic health outcomes are needed to further assess the predictive value of these brain-PAD estimates.

Background: Tau cleavage by different proteolytic enzymes generates short, aggregation-prone fragments that have been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Asparagine endopeptidase (AEP) activity in particular has been associated with tau dysfunction and aggregation, and the activity of the protease is increased in both aging and AD. Methods and Results: Using a mass spectrometry approach we identified a novel tau cleavage site at N167 and confirmed its processing by AEP. In combination with the previously known site at N368, we show that AEP cleavage yields a tau fragment that is present in both control and AD brains at similar levels. AEP is a lysosomal enzyme, and our data suggest that it is expressed in microglia rather than in neurons. Accordingly, we observe tau cleavage at N167 and N368 after endocytotic uptake into microglia, but not neurons. However, tau168-368 does not accumulate in microglia and we thus conclude that the fragment is part of a proteolytic cascade leading to tau degradation. Conclusions: While we confirm previous studies showing increased overall AEP activity in AD brains, our data suggests that AEP-mediated cleavage of tau is a physiological event occurring during microglial degradation of the secreted neuronal protein. The disease-associated increase in active AEP may thus be related to pro-inflammatory conditions in AD brains, and our findings argue against AEP inhibition as a therapeutic approach in AD.

Although plasma proteins may serve as important markers of disease risk in neurological conditions, the molecular mechanisms responsible for inter-individual variation in plasma protein levels are poorly understood. In this study, we conducted genome- and epigenome-wide association studies on the levels of 92 neurological proteins to identify genetic and epigenetic loci associated with their plasma concentrations (n = 750). We identified 62 independent genome-wide significant loci for 37 proteins (P &lt; 5.4 x 10-10) and 68 epigenome-wide significant sites associated with the levels of 7 proteins (P &lt; 3.9 x 10-10). Using this information, we identified biological pathways in which putative neurological biomarkers are implicated as well as molecular mechanisms through which genetic variation may perturb plasma protein levels. Additionally, we found evidence that poliovirus receptor is causally associated with Alzheimers disease. In conclusion, we identified many novel genetic and epigenetic factors that are associated with neurological protein levels which may inform disease biology and establish causal relationships between biomarkers and neurological diseases.

<p>by Simona Olmi, Spase Petkoski, Maxime Guye, Fabrice Bartolomei, Viktor Jirsa</p>

Information transmission in the human brain is a fundamentally dynamic network process. In partial epilepsy, this process is perturbed and highly synchronous seizures originate in a local network, the so-called epileptogenic zone (EZ), before recruiting other close or distant brain regions. We studied patient-specific brain network models of 15 drug-resistant epilepsy patients with implanted stereotactic electroencephalography (SEEG) electrodes. Each personalized brain model was derived from structural data of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion tensor weighted imaging (DTI), comprising 88 nodes equipped with region specific neural mass models capable of demonstrating a range of epileptiform discharges. Each patient’s virtual brain was further personalized through the integration of the clinically hypothesized EZ. Subsequent simulations and connectivity modulations were performed and uncovered a finite repertoire of seizure propagation patterns. Across patients, we found that (i) patient-specific network connectivity is predictive for the subsequent seizure propagation pattern; (ii) seizure propagation is characterized by a systematic sequence of brain states; (iii) propagation can be controlled by an optimal intervention on the connectivity matrix; (iv) the degree of invasiveness can be significantly reduced via the proposed seizure control as compared to traditional resective surgery. To stop seizures, neurosurgeons typically resect the EZ completely. We showed that stability analysis of the network dynamics, employing structural and dynamical information, estimates reliably the spatiotemporal properties of seizure propagation. This suggests novel less invasive paradigms of surgical interventions to treat and manage partial epilepsy.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6Abc4T-wF5M" width="1" />

<p>by Tuan Pham, Julie S. Haas</p>

As information about the world traverses the brain, the signals exchanged between neurons are passed and modulated by synapses, or specialized contacts between neurons. While neurotransmitter-based synapses tend to exert either excitatory or inhibitory pulses of influence on the postsynaptic neuron, electrical synapses, composed of plaques of gap junction channels, continuously transmit signals that can either excite or inhibit a coupled neighbor. A growing body of evidence indicates that electrical synapses, similar to their chemical counterparts, are modified in strength during physiological neuronal activity. The synchronizing role of electrical synapses in neuronal oscillations has been well established, but their impact on transient signal processing in the brain is much less understood. Here we constructed computational models based on the canonical feedforward neuronal circuit, and included electrical synapses between inhibitory interneurons. We provided discrete closely-timed inputs to the circuits, and characterize the influence of electrical synapse strength on both subthreshold summation and spike trains in the output neuron. Our simulations highlight the diverse and powerful roles that electrical synapses play even in simple circuits. Because these canonical circuits are represented widely throughout the brain, we expect that these are general principles for the influence of electrical synapses on transient signal processing across the brain.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/zdK2qO6vsyc" width="1" />

<p>by Anita T. Layton, Harold E. Layton</p>

We have developed the first computational model of solute and water transport from Bowman space to the papillary tip of the nephron of a human kidney. The nephron is represented as a tubule lined by a layer of epithelial cells, with apical and basolateral transporters that vary according to cell type. The model is formulated for steady state, and consists of a large system of coupled ordinary differential equations and algebraic equations. Model solution describes luminal fluid flow, hydrostatic pressure, luminal fluid solute concentrations, cytosolic solute concentrations, epithelial membrane potential, and transcellular and paracellular fluxes. We found that if we assume that the transporter density and permeabilities are taken to be the same between the human and rat nephrons (with the exception of a glucose transporter along the proximal tubule and the H<sup>+</sup>-pump along the collecting duct), the model yields segmental deliveries and urinary excretion of volume and key solutes that are consistent with human data. The model predicted that the human nephron exhibits glomerulotubular balance, such that proximal tubular Na<sup>+</sup> reabsorption varies proportionally to the single-nephron glomerular filtration rate. To simulate the action of a novel diabetic treatment, we inhibited the Na<sup>+</sup>-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) along the proximal convoluted tubule. Simulation results predicted that the segment’s Na<sup>+</sup> reabsorption decreased significantly, resulting in natriuresis and osmotic diuresis.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9-J5UiBBRPs" width="1" />

Abstract<p>CRISPR-based technology has provided new avenues to interrogate gene function, but difficulties in transgene expression in post-mitotic neurons has delayed incorporation of these tools in the central nervous system. Here, we demonstrate a highly efficient, neuron-optimized dual lentiviral CRISPR-based transcriptional activation (CRISPRa) system capable of robust, modular, and tunable gene induction and multiplexed gene regulation across several primary rodent neuron culture systems. CRISPRa targeting unique promoters in the complex multi-transcript gene <i>Brain-derived neurotrophic factor</i> (<i>Bdnf</i>) revealed both transcript- and genome-level selectivity of this approach, in addition to highlighting downstream transcriptional and physiological consequences of <i>Bdnf</i> regulation. Finally, we illustrate that CRISPRa is highly efficient <i>in vivo</i>, resulting in increased protein levels of a target gene in diverse brain structures. Taken together, these results demonstrate that CRISPRa is an efficient and selective method to study gene expression programs in brain health and disease.</p><p><b>Significance</b> We report a neuron-optimized CRISPR/dCas9 activation (CRISPRa) system that produces robust and specific upregulation of targeted genes in neurons both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. This system effectively drives expression at many gene targets, provides titratable gene expression, is capable of simultaneously targeting multiple genes at once, and successfully targets individual transcript variants arising from a complex, multi-promoter gene. This molecular tool enables advances in our ability to control gene expression profiles in the brain and will enable expansion of gene regulatory investigations to model systems that have not typically been used to explore genetic control of neuronal function.</p>

Abstract<p>Methylphenidate (MPH), commonly known as Ritalin, is the most widely prescribed drug worldwide to treat patients with attention deficit disorders. Although MPH is thought to modulate catecholamine neurotransmission in the brain, it remains unclear how these neurochemical effects influence neuronal activity and lead to attentional enhancements. Studies in rodents overwhelmingly point to the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) as a main site of action of MPH. To understand the mechanism of action of MPH in a primate brain, we recorded the responses of neuronal populations using chronic multielectrode arrays implanted in the caudal LPFC of two macaque monkeys while the animals performed an attention task (N = 2811 neuronal recordings). Over different recording sessions (N=55), we orally administered either various doses of MPH or a placebo to the animals. Behavioral analyses revealed positive effects of MPH on task performance at specific doses. However, analyses of individual neurons activity, noise correlations, and neuronal ensemble activity using machine learning algorithms revealed no effects of MPH. Our results suggest that the positive behavioral effects of MPH observed in primates (including humans) may not be mediated by changes in the activity of caudal LPFC neurons. MPH may enhance cognitive performance by modulating neuronal activity in other regions of the attentional network in the primate brain.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Methylphenidate (MPH), widely known as Ritalin, is the most prescribed drug to treat patients with attention deficits. Nonetheless, it is still unclear how and why the drug improves attention in humans. Studies in rodents point to the prefrontal cortex (PFC) as the main target of MPH. To validate these findings in primates, we trained macaque monkeys to perform an attention task while under various doses of MPH. We also chronically implanted multielectrode arrays in the posterior PFC of these monkeys to record neuronal ensemble activity during the task. Surprisingly, we found no effect of the drug on neuronal activity, even at cognitive-enhancing doses of MPH. The caudal prefrontal cortex might not be the site of action of MPH in the primate brain.</p>

Abstract<p>Automatic mimicry is a critical element of social interaction. A salient type of automatic mimicry is eye contact characterized by sharing of affective and mental states among individuals. We conducted a hyperscanning functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study involving online (LIVE) and delayed off-line (REPLAY) conditions to test our hypothesis that recurrent interaction through eye contact activates the limbic mirror system, including the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and anterior insula (AIC), both of which are critical for self-awareness. Sixteen pairs of human adults participated in the experiment. Given that an eye-blink represents an individual’s attentional window toward the partner, we analyzed pairwise time-series data for eye-blinks. We used multivariate autoregression analysis to calculate the noise contribution ratio (NCR) as an index of how a participant’s directional attention was influenced by that of their partner. NCR was greater in the LIVE than in the REPLAY condition, indicating mutual perceptual–motor interaction during real-time eye contact. Relative to the REPLAY condition, the LIVE condition was associated with greater activation in the left cerebellar hemisphere, vermis, and ACC, accompanied by enhanced functional connectivity between ACC and right AIC. Given the roles of the cerebellum in sensorimotor prediction and ACC in movement initiation, ACC–cerebellar activation may represent their involvement in modulating visual input related to the partner’s movement, which may, in turn, involve the limbic mirror system. Our findings indicate that mutual interaction during eye contact is mediated by the cerebellum and limbic mirror system.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Eye contact is a key element that connects humans during social communication. We focused on a previously unaddressed characteristic of eye contact: real-time mutual interaction as a form of automatic mimicry. Our results indicate that real-time interaction during eye contact is mediated by the cerebellum and limbic mirror system. These findings underscore the importance of the mirror system and cerebellum in real-time unconscious social interaction.</p>

Abstract<p>Seizures are characterized by hypersynchronization of neuronal networks. Understanding these networks could provide a critical window for therapeutic control of recurrent seizure activity i.e., epilepsy. However, imaging seizure networks has largely been limited to microcircuits <i>in vitro</i> or small "windows" <i>in vivo</i>. Here we combine fast confocal imaging of GCaMP-expressing larval zebrafish with local field potential (LFP) recordings to study epileptiform events at whole-brain and single-neuron levels <i>in vivo</i>. Using an acute seizure model (pentylenetetrazole, PTZ), we reliably observed recurrent electrographic ictal-like events associated with generalized activation of all major brain regions and uncovered a well-preserved anterior-to-posterior seizure propagation pattern. We also examined brain-wide network synchronization and spatiotemporal patterns of neuronal activity in the optic tectum microcircuit. Brain-wide and single-neuronal level analysis of PTZ- and 4-aminopyridine (4-AP)-exposed zebrafish revealed distinct network dynamics associated with seizure and non-seizure hyperexcitable states, respectively. Neuronal ensembles, comprised of coactive neurons, were also uncovered during interictal-like periods. Taken together, these results demonstrate that macro- and micro-network calcium motifs in zebrafish may provide a greater understanding of epilepsy.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Monitoring the dynamic activities in large-scale neuronal networks is critical to understanding seizure initiation and propagation. Here, we utilized well-established larval zebrafish seizure protocols and fast confocal imaging of GCaMP-expressing fish to investigate the epileptic network properties at brain-wide and single-cell levels. We revealed the rapid propagation of seizure activity from anterior-to-posterior brain regions in zebrafish central nervous system. We also showed that micro-ensembles of neuronal subpopulations are active during interictal-like periods in a manner similar to that seen in human electrophysiology data sets. Our findings demonstrate that these non-invasive optical imaging approaches will advance our understanding of the network basis underlying seizures and facilitate the development of methods to suppress these events.</p>

Abstract
<p>The hippocampus and entorhinal cortex (EC) are areas affected early and severely in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and this is associated with deficits in episodic memory. Amyloid-β (Aβ), the main protein found in amyloid plaques, can affect neuronal physiology and excitability, and several AD mouse models with memory impairments display aberrant network activity, including hyperexcitability and seizures. In this study, we investigated single cell physiology in EC and network activity in EC and dentate gyrus (DG) in the McGill-R-Thy1-APP transgenic rat model, using whole-cell patch clamp recordings and voltage-sensitive dye imaging (VSDI) in acute slices. In slices from transgenic animals up to 4 months of age, the majority of the principal neurons in Layer II of EC, fan cells and stellate cells, expressed intracellular Aβ (iAβ). Whereas the electrophysiological properties of fan cells were unaltered, stellate cells were more excitable in transgenic than in control rats. Stimulation in the DG resulted in comparable patterns in both groups at three and nine months, but at 12 months, the elicited responses in the transgenic group showed a significant preference for the enclosed blade, without any change in overall excitability. Only transient changes in the local network activity were seen in the medial EC (MEC). Although the observed changes in the McGill rat model are subtle, they are specific, pointing to a differential and selective involvement of specific parts of the hippocampal circuitry in Aβ pathology.</p>

Abstract
<p>The consolidation of newly formed memories and their retrieval are energetically demanding processes. Aerobic glycolysis (AG), also known as the Warburg effect, consists of the production of lactate from glucose in the presence of oxygen. The astrocyte neuron lactate shuttle hypothesis posits that astrocytes process glucose by AG to generate lactate, which is used as a fuel source within neurons to maintain synaptic activity. Studies in mice have demonstrated that lactate transport between astrocytes and neurons is required for long-term memory formation, yet the role of lactate production in memory acquisition and retrieval has not previously been explored. Here, we examined the effect of dichloroacetate (DCA), a chemical inhibitor of lactate production, on spatial learning and memory in mice using the Morris water maze (MWM). <i>In vivo</i> hyperpolarized <sup>13</sup>C-pyruvate magnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed decreased conversion of pyruvate to lactate in the mouse brain following DCA administration, concomitant with a reduction in the phosphorylation of pyruvate dehydrogenase. DCA exposure before each training session in the MWM impaired learning, which subsequently resulted in impaired memory during the probe trial. In contrast, mice that underwent training without DCA exposure, but received a single DCA injection before the probe trial exhibited normal memory. Our findings indicate that AG plays a key role during memory acquisition but is less important for the retrieval of established memories. Thus, the activation of AG may be important for learning-dependent synaptic plasticity rather than the activation of signaling cascades required for memory retrieval.</p>

Abstract
<p>Prematurity is associated with significantly increased risk of neurobehavioral pathologies, including autism and schizophrenia. A common feature of these psychiatric disorders is prefrontal cortex (PFC) inhibitory circuit disruption due to GABAergic interneuron alteration. Cortical interneurons are generated and migrate throughout late gestation and early infancy, making them highly susceptible to perinatal insults such as preterm birth. Term and preterm PFC pathology specimens were assessed using immunohistochemical markers for interneurons. Based on the changes seen, a new preterm encephalopathy mouse model was developed to produce similar PFC interneuron loss. Maternal immune activation (MIA; modeling chorioamnionitis, associated with 85% of extremely preterm births) was combined with chronic sublethal hypoxia (CSH; modeling preterm respiratory failure), with offspring of both sexes assessed anatomically, molecularly and neurobehaviorally. In the PFC examined from the human preterm samples compared to matched term samples at corrected age, a decrease in somatostatin (SST) and calbindin (CLB) interneurons was seen in upper cortical layers. This pattern of interneuron loss in upper cortical layers was mimicked in the mouse PFC following the combination of MIA and CSH, but not after either insult alone. This persistent interneuron loss is associated with postnatal microglial activation that occurs during CSH only after MIA. The combined insults lead to long-term neurobehavioral deficits which parallel human psychopathologies that may be seen after extremely preterm birth. This new preclinical model supports a paradigm in which specific cellular alterations seen in preterm encephalopathy can be linked with a risk of neuropsychiatric sequela. Specific interneuron subtypes may provide therapeutic targets to prevent or ameliorate these neurodevelopmental risks.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To identify brain regions whose metabolic impairment contributes to DLB clinical core features expression and to assess the influence of severity of global cognitive impairment on the DLB‐hypometabolic‐pattern.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Brain FDG‐PET and information on core features were available in 171 patients belonging to the imaging repository of the European DLB‐consortium. Principal component analysis was applied to identify brain regions relevant to the local data variance. A linear regression model was applied to generate core feature<span>‐</span>specific patterns controlling for the main confounding variables (MMSE, Age, Education, Gender, and Center). Regression analysis to the locally‐normalized intensities was performed to generate a MMSE score‐sensitive map.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Parkinsonism negatively covaried with bilateral parietal, precuneus and anterior cingulate metabolism, visual‐hallucinations with bilateral dorsolateral‐frontal cortex, posterior cingulate and parietal metabolism and RBD with bilateral parieto‐occipital cortex, precuneus and ventrolateral‐frontal metabolism. VH and RBD shared a positive covariance with metabolism in medial temporal lobe, cerebellum, brainstem, basal ganglia, thalami, orbitofrontal and sensorimotor cortex. Cognitive fluctuations negatively covaried with occipital metabolism and positively with parietal lobes metabolism. MMSE positively covaried with metabolism in left superior frontal gyrus, bilateral‐parietal cortex, and left precuneus, and negatively with metabolism in insula, medial frontal gyrus, hippocampus in the left hemisphere and in right cerebellum.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Regions of more preserved metabolism are relatively consistent across the variegate DLB spectrum. By contrast, core features were associated to more prominent hypometabolism in specific regions thus suggesting a close clinical‐imaging correlation, reflecting the interplay between topography of neurodegeneration and clinical presentation in DLB patients.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>OBJECTIVES</h2>
<p>Currently, the exact reasons why different α‐synucleinopathies exhibit variable pathologies and phenotypes are still unknown. A potential explanation may be the existence of distinctive α‐synuclein conformers or strains. Here, we intend to analyse the seeding activity of Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's disease (PD) brain derived α‐synuclein seeds via real‐time quaking‐induced conversion (RT‐QuIC) and to investigate the structure and morphology of the α‐synuclein aggregates generated via RT‐QuIC.</p>


<h2>METHODS</h2>
<p>A misfolded α‐synuclein‐enriched brain fraction from frontal cortex and substantia nigra pars compacta tissue, isolated by several filtration and centrifugation steps, was subjected to α‐synuclein‐RT‐QuIC‐analysis. Our study included neuropathologically well‐characterised cases with DLB, PD and controls (Ctrl). Biochemical and morphological analyses of RT‐QuIC products were conducted by western blot, dot blot analysis, Raman spectroscopy, Atomic Force Microscopy and Transmission Electron Microscopy.</p>


<h2>RESULTS</h2>
<p>Independently from the brain region, we observed different seeding kinetics of α‐synuclein in the RT‐QuIC in patients with DLB compared to PD and Ctrl. Biochemical characterization of the RT‐QuIC product indicated the generation of a PK‐resistant and fibrillary α‐synuclein species in DLB seeded reactions, while PD and control seeds failed in the conversion of wild type α‐synuclein substrate.</p>


<h2>INTERPRETATION</h2>
<p>Structural variances of α‐synuclein seeding kinetics and products in DLB and PD indicated for the first time the existence of different α‐synuclein strains in these groups. Therefore, our study contributes to a better understanding of the clinical heterogeneity among α‐synucleinopathies, offers an opportunity for a specific diagnosis and opens new avenues for the future development of strain‐specific therapies.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>OBJECTIVE</h2>
<p>Patients with chronic stroke have been shown to have failure to release interhemispheric inhibition from the intact to the damaged hemisphere prior to movement execution (<i>pre‐movement‐IHI</i>). This inhibitory imbalance was found to correlate with poor motor performance in the chronic stage after stroke, and has since become a target for therapeutic interventions. The logic of this approach, however, implies that abnormal pre‐movement‐IHI is causal to poor behavioral outcome, and should therefore be present early after stroke when motor impairment is at its worst. In a longitudinal study, we investigated interhemispheric interactions by tracking patients’ pre‐movement‐IHI for one year following stroke.</p>


<h2>METHODS</h2>
<p>We assessed pre‐movement‐IHI and motor behavior five times over a one‐year period after ischemic stroke in 22 patients, and in 11 healthy participants.</p>


<h2>RESULTS</h2>
<p>We found that pre‐movement‐IHI was normal during the acute/subacute period, and only became abnormal at the chronic stage; specifically, release of IHI in movement preparation worsened as motor behavior improved. In addition, pre‐movement‐IHI did not correlate with behavioral measures cross‐sectionally, while the longitudinal emergence of abnormal pre‐movement‐IHI from the acute to the chronic stage was inversely correlated with recovery of finger individuation.</p>


<h2>INTERPRETATION</h2>
<p>These results suggest that interhemispheric imbalance is not a cause of poor motor recovery but instead might be the consequence of underlying recovery processes. These findings call into question the rehabilitation strategy of attempting to rebalance interhemispheric interactions in order to improve motor recovery after stroke.</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To understand the safety, putaminal coverage, and enzyme expression of adeno‐associated viral vector serotype‐2 encoding the cDNA for the enzyme aromatic L‐amino acid decarboxylase (VY‐AADC01) delivered using novel intraoperative monitoring to optimize delivery.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Fifteen subjects (3 cohorts of 5) with moderately‐advanced Parkinson's disease and medically‐refractory motor fluctuations received VY‐AADC01 bilaterally co‐administered with gadoteridol to the putamen using intra‐operative MRI‐guidance to visualize the anatomic spread of the infusate and calculate coverage. Cohort 1 received 8.3×10<sup>11</sup> vg/mL and ≤450 μL per putamen (total dose ≤7.5×10<sup>11</sup> vg); cohort 2 received the same concentration (8.3×10<sup>11</sup> vg/mL) and ≤900 μL per putamen (total dose ≤1.5×10<sup>12</sup> vg); cohort 3 received 2.6×10<sup>12</sup> vg/mL and ≤900 μL per putamen (total dose ≤4.7×10<sup>12</sup> vg). (18)F‐fluoro‐L‐dihydroxyphenylalanine positron emission tomography at baseline and 6 months post‐procedure assessed enzyme activity; standard assessments measured clinical outcomes.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>MRI‐guided administration of ascending VY‐AADC01 doses resulted in putaminal coverage of 21% (cohort 1), 34% (cohort 2) and 42% (cohort 3). Cohorts 1, 2 and 3 showed corresponding increases in enzyme activity assessed by positron emission tomography of 13%, 56%, and 79%, and reductions in anti‐parkinsonian medication of ‐15%, ‐33%, and ‐42%, respectively at 6 months. At 12 months, there were dose‐related improvements in clinical outcomes including increases in patient‐reported ON‐time without troublesome dyskinesia (1.6, 3.3, and 1.5 hours, respectively), and quality of life.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Novel intraoperative monitoring of administration facilitated targeted delivery of VY‐AADC01 in this phase 1 study, which was well tolerated. Increases in enzyme expression and clinical improvements were dose dependent.</p>

<p>Cortical slow oscillations are an emergent property of the cortical network,
hallmark of low complexity brain states like sleep, and representing a default
activity pattern. Here, we present a methodological approach for quantifying
the spatial and temporal properties of this emergent activity. We improved and
enriched a robust analysis procedure that has already been successfully applied
to both in vitro and in vivo data acquisitions. We tested the new tools of the
methodology by analyzing the electrocorticography (ECoG) traces recorded from a
custom 32-channel multi-electrode array in wild-type isoflurane-anesthetized
mice. The enhanced analysis pipeline, named SWAP (Slow Waves Analysis
Pipeline), detects Up and Down states, enables the characterization of the
spatial dependency of their statistical properties, and supports the comparison
of different subjects. The SWAP is implemented in a data-independent way,
allowing its application to other data sets (acquired from different subjects,
or with different recording tools), as well as to the outcome of numerical
simulations. By using SWAP, we report statistically significant differences in
the observed slow oscillations (SO) across cortical areas and cortical sites.
Computing cortical maps by interpolating the features of SO acquired at the
electrode positions, we give evidence of gradients at the global scale along an
oblique axis directed from fronto-lateral towards occipito-medial regions,
further highlighting some heterogeneity within cortical areas. The results
obtained on spatial characterization of slow oscillations will be essential for
producing data-driven brain simulations and for triggering a discussion on the
role of, and the interplay between, the different regions in the cortex,
improving our understanding of the mechanisms of generation and propagation of
delta rhythms and, more generally, of cortical properties.

<p>Standard neuroimaging techniques provide non-invasive access not only to
human brain anatomy but also to its physiology. The activity recorded with
these techniques is generally called functional imaging, but what is observed
per se is an instance of dynamics, from which functional brain activity should
be extracted. Distinguishing between bare dynamics and genuine function is a
highly non-trivial task, but a crucially important one when comparing
experimental observations and interpreting their significance. Here we
illustrate how the ability of neuroimaging to extract genuine functional brain
activity is bounded by the structure of functional representations. To do so,
we first provide a simple definition of functional brain activity from a
system-level brain imaging perspective. We then review how the properties of
the space on which brain activity is represented allow defining relations
ranging from distinguishability to accessibility of observed imaging data. We
show how these properties result from the structure defined on dynamical data
and dynamics-to-function projections, and consider some implications that the
way and extent to which these are defined have for the interpretation of
experimental data from standard system-level brain recording techniques.

<p>Recent studies have suggested that the cognitive process of the human brain
is realized as probabilistic inference and can be further modeled by
probabilistic graphical models like Markov random fields. Nevertheless, it
remains unclear how probabilistic inference can be implemented by a network of
spiking neurons in the brain. Previous studies tried to relate the inference
equation of binary Markov random fields to the dynamic equation of spiking
neural networks through belief propagation algorithm and reparameterization,
but they are valid only for Markov random fields with limited network
structure. In this paper, we propose a spiking neural network model that can
implement inference of arbitrary binary Markov random fields. Specifically, we
design a spiking recurrent neural network and prove that its neuronal dynamics
are mathematically equivalent to the inference process of Markov random fields
by adopting mean-field theory. Theoretical analysis and experimental results,

<p>Cortical synapse organization supports a range of dynamic states on multiple
spatial and temporal scales, from synchronous slow wave activity (SWA),
characteristic of deep sleep or anesthesia, to fluctuating, asynchronous
activity during wakefulness (AW). Such dynamic diversity poses a challenge for
producing efficient large-scale simulations that embody realistic metaphors of
short- and long-range synaptic connectivity. In fact, during SWA and AW
different spatial extents of the cortical tissue are active in a given timespan
and at different levels, which implies a wide variety of loads of local
computation and communication. A balanced evaluation of simulation performance
and robustness should therefore include tests of a variety of cortical dynamic
states. Here, we demonstrate performance scaling of our proprietary Distributed
and Plastic Spiking Neural Networks (DPSNN) simulation engine in both SWA and
AW for bidimensional grids of neural populations, which reflects the modular
organization of the cortex. We explored networks up to 192x192 modules, each
composed of 1250 integrate-and-fire neurons with spike-frequency adaptation,
and exponentially decaying inter-modular synaptic connectivity with varying
spatial decay constant. For the largest networks the total number of synapses
was over 70 billion. The execution platform included up to 64 dual-socket
nodes, each socket mounting 8 Intel Xeon Haswell processor cores @ 2.40GHz
clock. Network initialization time, memory usage, and execution time showed
good scaling performances from 1 to 1024 processes, implemented using the
standard Message Passing Interface (MPI) protocol. We achieved simulation
speeds of between 2.3x10^9 and 4.1x10^9 synaptic events per second for both
cortical states in the explored range of inter-modular interconnections.

<p>Here we summarize abundant excuses that support the eye detection can be as a
noninvasive approach to early diagnose some brain disorders, including
Alzheimer disease (AD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), schizophrenia (SZ) and
major depressive disorder (MDD). Real-time ocular responses in everyone are
tightly associated with emotional state and cognitive processing in the brain.
At the eyeball areas, at least changes involved saccades, pupil response,
blinking, microvascular network morphology and thickness of retinal nerve fiber
layer (RNFL) are potentially to be candidates of biomarker to screen and
evaluate brain disorders. These days medical big data will be more accessible
especially with the help of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) to analyze
precisely. Computer vision combined with machine-learning based AI particularly
deep-learning neural networks sheds a new light on cognitive neuroscience, and
many patients with psychotic disorders will primarily benefit from this
interdisciplinary advance to induce self-evaluation and real-time intervention
on brain disorders. Finally, we call for more AI applications going to approach
brain disorder issues, meanwhile, AI technology used in brain healthcare should
be working together with biological intelligence as we are running an AI
manifestation for major depression.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/44552">Aurora A depletion reveals centrosome-independent polarization mechanism in <i>C. elegans</i></a></h4>

How living systems break symmetry in an organized manner is a fundamental question in biology. In wild type <i>Caenorhabditis elegans </i>zygotes, symmetry breaking during anterior-posterior axis specification is guided by centrosomes, resulting in anterior-directed cortical flows and a single posterior PAR-2 domain. We uncover that <i>C. elegans</i> zygotes depleted of the Aurora A kinase AIR-1 or lacking centrosomes entirely usually establish two posterior PAR-2 domains, one at each pole. We demonstrate that AIR-1 prevents symmetry breaking early in the cell cycle, whereas centrosomal AIR-1 instructs polarity initiation thereafter. Using triangular microfabricated chambers, we establish that bipolarity of <i>air-1</i>(<i>RNAi</i>) embryos occurs effectively in a cell-shape and curvature-dependent manner. Furthermore, we develop an integrated physical description of symmetry breaking, wherein local PAR-2-dependent weakening of the actin cortex, together with mutual inhibition of anterior and posterior PAR proteins, provides a mechanism for spontaneous symmetry breaking without centrosomes.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/44427">Discriminative stimuli are sufficient for incubation of cocaine craving</a></h4>

In abstinent drug addicts, cues formerly associated with drug-taking experiences gain relapse-inducing potency ('<i>incubate</i>') over time. Animal models of incubation may help develop treatments to prevent relapse, but these models have ubiquitously focused on the role of conditioned stimuli (CSs) signaling drug delivery. Discriminative stimuli (DSs) are unique in that they exert stimulus-control over both drug taking and drug seeking behavior and are difficult to extinguish. For this reason, incubation of the excitatory effects of DSs that signal drug availability, not yet examined in preclinical studies, could be relevant to relapse prevention. We trained rats to self-administer cocaine (or palatable food) under DS control, then investigated DS-controlled incubation of craving, in the absence of drug-paired CSs. DS-controlled cocaine (but not palatable food) seeking incubated over 60 days of abstinence and persisted up to 300 days. Understanding the neural mechanisms of this DS-controlled incubation holds promise for drug relapse treatments.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/44179">Upper bound on the biological effects of 50/60 Hz magnetic fields mediated by radical pairs</a></h4>

Prolonged exposure to weak (~1 µT) extremely-low-frequency (ELF, 50/60 Hz) magnetic fields has been associated with an increased risk of childhood leukaemia. One of the few biophysical mechanisms that might account for this link involves short-lived chemical reaction intermediates known as radical pairs. In this report, we use spin dynamics simulations to derive an upper bound of 10 parts per million on the effect of a 1 µT ELF magnetic field on the yield of a radical pair reaction. By comparing this figure with the corresponding effects of changes in the strength of the Earth's magnetic field, we conclude that if exposure to such weak 50/60 Hz magnetic fields has any effect on human biology, and results from a radical pair mechanism, then the risk should be no greater than travelling a few kilometres towards or away from the geomagnetic north or south pole.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/43983">Cellular entry and uncoating of naked and quasi-enveloped human hepatoviruses</a></h4>

Many 'non-enveloped' viruses, including hepatitis A virus (HAV), are released non-lytically from infected cells as infectious, quasi-enveloped virions cloaked in host membranes. Quasi-enveloped HAV (eHAV) mediates stealthy cell-to-cell spread within the liver, whereas stable naked virions shed in feces are optimized for environmental transmission. eHAV lacks virus-encoded surface proteins, and how it enters cells is unknown. We show both virion types enter by clathrin- and dynamin-dependent endocytosis, facilitated by integrin β<sub>1</sub>, and traffic through early and late endosomes. Uncoating of naked virions occurs in late endosomes, whereas eHAV undergoes ALIX-dependent trafficking to lysosomes where the quasi-envelope is enzymatically degraded and uncoating ensues coincident with breaching of endolysosomal membranes. Neither virion requires PLA2G16, a phospholipase essential for entry of other picornaviruses. Thus naked and quasi-enveloped virions enter via similar endocytic pathways, but uncoat in different compartments and release their genomes to the cytosol in a manner mechanistically distinct from other <i>Picornaviridae</i>.

Animals consolidate some, but not all, learning experiences into long-term memory. Across the animal kingdom, sleep has been found to have a beneficial effect on the consolidation of recently formed memories into long-term storage. However, the underlying mechanisms of sleep dependent memory consolidation are poorly understood. Here, we show that consolidation of courtship long-term memory in <i>Drosophila</i> is mediated by reactivation during sleep of dopaminergic neurons that were earlier involved in memory acquisition. We identify specific fan-shaped body neurons that induce sleep after the learning experience and activate dopaminergic neurons for memory consolidation. Thus, we provide a direct link between sleep, neuronal reactivation of dopaminergic neurons, and memory consolidation.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/42135">Chronology-based architecture of descending circuits that underlie the development of locomotor repertoire after birth</a></h4>

The emergence of new and increasingly sophisticated behaviors after birth is accompanied by dramatic increase of newly established synaptic connections in the nervous system. Little is known, however, of how nascent connections are organized to support such new behaviors alongside existing ones. To understand this, in the larval zebrafish we examined the development of spinal pathways from hindbrain V2a neurons and the role of these pathways in the development of locomotion. We found that new projections are continually layered laterally to existing neuropil, and give rise to distinct pathways that function in parallel to existing pathways. Across these chronologically layered pathways, the connectivity patterns and biophysical properties vary systematically to support a behavioral repertoire with a wide range of kinematics and dynamics. Such layering of new parallel circuits equipped with systematically changing properties may be central to the postnatal diversification and increasing sophistication of an animal's behavioral repertoire.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/40585">Heterodimerization of UNC-13/RIM regulates synaptic vesicle release probability but not priming in <i>C. elegans</i></a></h4>

UNC-13 proteins play an essential role in synaptic transmission by recruiting synaptic vesicles (SVs) to become available for release, which is termed SV priming. Here we show that the C2A domain of UNC-13L, like the corresponding domain in mammalian Munc13-1, displays two conserved binding modes: forming C2A/C2A homodimers, or forming a heterodimer with the zinc finger domain of UNC-10/RIM (C2A/RIM). Functional analysis revealed that UNC-13L’s C2A promotes synaptic transmission by regulating a post-priming process. Stimulus-evoked release but not SV priming, was impaired in <i>unc-10</i> mutants deficient for C2A/RIM heterodimerization, leading to decreased release probability. Disrupting C2A/C2A homodimerization in UNC-13L-rescued animals had no effect on synaptic transmission, but fully restored the evoked release and the release probability of <i>unc-10</i>/RIM mutants deficient for C2A/RIM heterodimerization. Thus, our results support the model that RIM binding C2A releases UNC-13L from an autoinhibitory homodimeric complex to become fusion-competent by functioning as a switch only.

Mitochondria have long been implicated in Parkinson's disease, ever since the discovery that inhibitors of the mitochondrial complex I can lead to dopaminergic neuron death. We report here that intra-mitochondrial protein degradation alleviates (PFF)-induced alpha-synuclein seeding, highly relevant for the spreading of alpha-synuclein pathology. We find that interference with mitochondrial protein import as well as intra-mitochondrial proteases aggravates the aggregation profile and indeed, alpha-synuclein shows themselves as intra-mitochondrial protein. We further demonstrate that mitochondrial protein degradation is relevant for the aggregation of Abeta 42, suggesting that mitochondria are directly linked to disturbances in cytosolic protein homeostasis of aggregation prone proteins. Taken together, this draws a new picture of how mitochondrial dysfunction is involved in neurodegenerative diseases and provokes new therapeutical approaches.

There is a major debate in the theory of mind (ToM) field, concerning whether spontaneous and explicit ToM are based on the same or two distinct cognitive systems. While there is extensive research on the neural correlates of explicit ToM, revealing consistent activation of the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), few studies investigated spontaneous ToM, with conflicting results, probably due to having small samples of participants. Here, we implemented a mega-analytic approach by pooling data from three fMRI studies, to achieve enough statistical power to better define the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying spontaneous ToM. Participants watched videos in which an agent acquires a true or false belief about the location of a ball. By analysing the blood-oxygen level dependent signal during the belief formation phase for false versus true beliefs, we found a cluster of activation in the right, and to a lesser extent, left posterior parietal cortex spanning the TPJ, but no mPFC activation. Region of interest (ROI) analysis on bilateral TPJ and mPFC confirmed these results and added evidence to the content-selectivity for false beliefs with positive content and asymmetry in laterality of the spontaneous ToM system. Interestingly, the whole brain analysis, supported by an overlap with brain maps, revealed maximum activation in areas involved in visuospatial working memory and attention switching functions, such as the supramarginal gyrus, the middle temporal gyrus, and the inferior frontal gyrus. Taken together, these findings suggest that spontaneous and explicit ToM rely on partially overlapping brain systems. However, spontaneous ToM tasks also show clear differences with explicit ToM tasks.

In vertebrates and invertebrates, neurotransmitter release relies on a highly conserved molecular machinery. A surprisingly small number of presynaptic proteins evolved specifically in vertebrates. How they expand the power or versatility of the conserved core machinery is unclear. One of these vertebrate-specific proteins, called Mover / TPRGL / SVAP30, is heterogeneously expressed throughout the brain, suggesting that it adds special functions to subtypes of presynaptic terminals. In this study we generated Mover knockout mice to investigate the role of Mover from synaptic transmission to behavior. Deletion of Mover did not affect synaptic transmission at CA3 to CA1 synapses. In contrast, Mover deficient mice had strongly increased short-term facilitation at mossy fiber to CA3 synapses. This increase included frequency facilitation, a hallmark of mossy fiber terminal function. The effect was age- and Ca2+-dependent, and relied on the Kainate receptor/cAMP pathway in the mossy fiber terminals. Despite this change in presynaptic plasticity, the absence of Mover did not affect long-term spatial reference memory or working memory, but led to reduced anxiety. These discoveries suggest that Mover has distinct roles at different synapses. At mossy-fiber terminals, it acts to constrain the extent of presynaptic facilitation. Its role in activity-dependent neurotransmission could be necessary for normal anxiety responses.

Many studies of large-scale neural systems have emphasized the importance of communication through increased inter-region correlations ("functional connectivity") during task states relative to resting state. In contrast, local circuit studies have demonstrated that task states reduce correlations among local neural populations, likely enhancing their information coding. Here we sought to adjudicate between these conflicting perspectives, assessing whether large-scale system correlations tend to increase or decrease during task states. To establish a mechanistic framework for interpreting changes in neural correlations, we conceptualized neural populations as having a sigmoidal neural transfer function. In a computational model we found that this straightforward assumption predicts reductions in neural populations' dynamic output range as task-evoked activity levels increase, reducing responsiveness to inputs from other regions (i.e., reduced correlations). We demonstrated this empirically in large-scale neural populations across two highly distinct data sets: human functional magnetic resonance imaging data and non-human primate spiking data. We found that task states increased global neural activity, while globally quenching neural variability and correlations. Further, this global reduction of neural correlations led to an overall increase in dimensionality (reflecting less information redundancy) during task states, providing an information-theoretic explanation for task-induced correlation reductions. Together, our results provide an integrative mechanistic account that encompasses measures of large-scale neural activity, variability, and correlations during resting and task states.

A major goal in neuroscience is to understand how populations of neurons code for stimuli or actions. While the number of neurons that can be recorded simultaneously is increasing at a fast pace, in most cases these recordings cannot access a complete population: some neurons that carry relevant information remain unrecorded. In particular, it is hard to simultaneously record all the neurons of the same type in a given area. Recent progress has made possible to determine the type of each recorded neuron in a given area thanks to genetic and physiological tools. However, it is unclear how to infer the activity of a full population of neurons of the same type from sequential recordings across different experiments. Neural networks exhibit collective behaviour, e.g. noise correlations and synchronous activity, that are not directly captured by a conditionally-independent model that would just pool together the spike trains from sequential recordings. Here we present a method to build population activity from single cell responses taken from sequential recordings, which only requires pairwise recordings to train the model. Our method combines copula distributions and maximum entropy modeling. After training, the model allows us to predict the activity of large populations using only sequential recordings of single cells. We applied this method to a population of ganglion cells, the retinal output, all belonging to the same type. From just the spiking response of each cell to a repeated stimulus, we could predict the full activity of the population. We could then generalize to predict the population responses to different stimuli and even to different experiments. As a result, we were able to use our approach to construct a synthetic model of a very large neuronal population, which uses data combined from multiple experiments. We then predicted the extent of synchronous activity and showed it grew with the number of neurons. This approach is a promising way to infer population activity from sequential recordings in sensory areas.

The rare syndrome of Anosognosia for Hemiplegia (AHP) can provide unique insights into the neurocognitive processes of motor awareness. Yet, prior studies have only explored predominately discreet lesions. Using advanced structural neuroimaging methods in 174 patients with a right-hemisphere stroke, we were able to identify three neural networks that contribute to AHP, when disconnected: the (1) premotor loop (2) limbic system, and (3) ventral attention network. Our results suggest that human motor awareness is contingent on the joint contribution of these three systems.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/560318v1?rss=1">Partial coherence and frustration in self-organizing spherical grids</a></h4>

Nearby grid cells have been observed to express a remarkable degree of long-range order, which is often idealized as extending potentially to infinity. Yet their strict periodic firing and ensemble coherence are theoretically possible only in flat environments, much unlike the burrows which rodents usually live in. Are the symmetrical, coherent grid maps inferred in the lab relevant to chart their way in their natural habitat? We consider spheres as simple models of curved environments and, waiting for the appropriate experiments to be performed, we use our adaptation model to predict what grid maps would emerge in a network with the same recurrent connections, which on the plane produce coherence among the units. We find that on the sphere such connections distort the maps that single grid units would express on their own, and aggregate them into clusters. When remapping to a different spherical environment, units in each cluster maintain only partial coherence, similar to what is observed in disordered materials, such as spin glasses.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/560235v1?rss=1">Emergence of β and γ networks following multisensory training</a></h4>

Our perceptual reality relies on inferences about the causal structure of the world given by multiple sensory inputs. In ecological settings, multisensory events that cohere in time and space benefit inferential processes: hearing and seeing a speaker enhances speech comprehension, and the acoustic changes of flapping wings naturally pace the motion of a flock of birds. Here, we asked how a few minutes of (multi)sensory training could shape cortical interactions in a subsequent perceptual task, and investigated oscillatory activity and functional connectivity as a function of sensory history in training. Human participants performed a visual motion coherence discrimination task while being recorded with magnetoencephalography (MEG). Three groups of participants performed the same task with visual stimuli only, while listening to acoustic textures temporally comodulated with the strength of visual motion coherence, or with auditory noise uncorrelated with visual motion. The functional connectivity patterns before and after training were contrasted to resting-state networks to assess the variability of common task-relevant networks, and the emergence of new functional interactions following training. One main finding is the emergence of a large-scale synchronization in the high {gamma} (gamma: 60-120 Hz) and {beta} (beta: 15 - 30 Hz) bands for individuals who underwent comodulated multisensory training. The post-training network involved prefrontal, parietal, and visual cortices. Our results suggest that the integration of evidence and decision-making strategies become more efficient following congruent multisensory training through plasticity in network routing and oscillatory regimes.

It is of increasing interest to study "brain age" - the apparent age of a subject, as inferred from brain imaging data. The difference between brain age and actual age (the "delta") is typically computed, reflecting deviation from the population norm. This therefore may reflect accelerated aging (positive delta) or resilience (negative delta) and has been found to be a useful correlate with factors such as disease and cognitive decline. However, although there has been a range of methods proposed for estimating brain age, there has been little study of the optimal ways of computing the delta. In this technical note we describe problems with the most common current approach, and present potential improvements. We evaluate different estimation methods on simulated and real data. We also find the strongest correlations of corrected brain age delta with 5,792 non-imaging variables (non-brain physical measures, life-factor measures, cognitive test scores, etc.), and also with 2,641 multimodal brain imaging-derived phenotypes, with data from 19,000 participants in UK Biobank.

Regret-an emotion comprised of both a counterfactual, cognitive component and a negative, affective component-is one of the most commonly experienced emotions involved in decision making. For example, people often behave such that their decisions minimize potential regret and therefore maximize subjective pleasure. Importantly, functional accounts of emotion suggest that the experience and future expectation of regret should promote goal-oriented behavioral change. While many studies have confirmed the functional role of regret, the cognitive-emotional mechanisms through which regret facilitates behavioral change remain unclear. We hypothesize that a greater negative affective state accompanying the counterfactual component of regret will potentiate learning, value, and/or exploration of potential options-all of which could lead to behavioral change. Because prior studies on regret-driven decision making have focused almost exclusively on description-based paradigms, the potential role of learning from regret through experience is underexplored. Here, we leverage computational, emotion-driven models of decision making to determine the role of regret in risky decision making. Further, we use computer-vision to detect positive and negative affect (valence) intensity from subjects' faces in response to feedback, which was entered as direct input into each model to determine whether valence affects learning, valuation, or exploration/exploitation. Using multiple model comparison methods, we found that: (1) people weight regret by its expectedness when making experience-based decisions, and (2) people learn more rapidly as they experience increasingly intense negative affect. Our findings support functional accounts of regret and demonstrate the potential for model-based facial expression analysis to enhance our understanding of cognition-emotion interactions.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain combined with voxel-based morphometry (VBM) has revealed structural changes of grey and white matter in a range of neurological and psychiatric disorders. However, the cellular basis of volume changes observed with VBM has remained unclear. We devised an approach to systematically correlate changes in grey matter volume (GMV) with cellular composition. Mice were alternately examined with structural MRI and two-photon in vivo microscopy at three time points, taking advantage of age-dependent changes in brain structure. We chose to image fluorescently labelled cell nuclei, because these can be readily imaged in large tissue volumes and allow inferences on several structural parameters: (1) the physical volume as determined from a subset of nuclei used to generate a geometrically defined space, (2) the number of cells, (3) the nearest neighbour distance measured between all nuclei as an indicator of cell clustering, and (4) the volume of the cell nuclei. Using this approach, we found that physical volume did not significantly correlate with GMV change, whereas mean nuclear volume was inversely correlated. When focusing on layers within the imaging volume, positive correlations of GMV were found with cell number near the cortical surface and nearest neighbour distance in deeper layers. Thus, the novel approach introduced here provided new insights into the factors underlying grey matter volume changes.

Various diffusion MRI measures have been proposed for characterising tissue microstructure over the last 15 years. Despite the growing number of experiments using different diffusion measures in assessments of white matter, there has been limited work on: 1) examining their covariance along specific pathways; and on 2) combining these different measures to study tissue microstructure. In this work, we first demonstrate redundancies in the amount of information captured by 10 diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) measures. Using a data-reduction approach, we identified two biologically-interpretable components that capture 80% of the variance in commonly-used DTI and HARDI measures profiled along 22 brain pathways extracted from typically developing children aged 8 - 18 years (n = 36). The first derived component captures properties related to hindrance and restriction in tissue microstructure, while the second component reflects characteristics related to tissue complexity and orientational dispersion. We demonstrate that the components generated by this approach preserve the biological relevance of the original measurements by showing age-related effects across developmentally sensitive pathways. Our results also suggest that HARDI measures are more sensitive at detecting age-related changes in tissue microstructure than DTI measures.

Connectomics is a sub-field of Neuroscience aimed at determining connectomes -- exact structures of neurons and their synaptic connections in nervous systems. A number of ongoing initiatives at the present time are working towards the goal of ascertaining the connectomes or parts thereof of various organisms. Determining the detailed physiological response properties of all the neurons in these connectomes is out of reach of current experimental technology. It is therefore unclear, to what extent knowledge of the connectome alone will advance a mechanistic understanding of computation occurring in these neuronal circuits, especially when the high-level function(s) of the said circuit is unknown. We are pursuing a research program to build theory in order to investigate these issues. In previously published work, towards this end, we have developed a theory of connectomic constraints for feedforward networks of neurons. Specifically, for feedforward networks equipped with neurons that obey a deterministic spiking neuron model, we asked if just by knowing the structure of a network, we could rule out spike-timed computations that it could be doing, no matter what response properties each of its neurons may have. Our neurons were abstract mathematical objects that satisfied a small number of axioms that correspond to certain broadly-obeyed properties of neurons. Here, we develop additional theoretical tools and notions to address these questions. The idea is to study the space of all possible spike-train to spike-train transformations. We are interested in asking how the subset of transformations spanned by networks of specific architectures can be related to hierarchical subsets of the space that are characterized by particular mathematical properties of transformations. In particular, given such a hierarchy of subsets, what is the "smallest" subset that contains the set of transformations spanned by networks of a specific class of architectures? Even if one cannot establish such a subset exactly, proving bounds on it (according to the hierarchy) might offer insight. After setting up the mathematical framework to make these notions precise, we construct explicit classes of hierarchies and prove a number of such lower bounds.

Spinal interneurons coordinate adjustments in the rhythm and pattern of locomotor movements. Two prevailing models predict that interneurons either share or hierarchically distribute control of these key parameters. Here, we have tested each model in the coordination of swimming in larval zebrafish by circumferential excitatory V2a and commissural inhibitory V0d interneurons. We define two types of V2a neuron based on morphology, electrophysiology and connectivity. Type I V2as primarily propagate and amplify rhythmic signals biased to interneurons, while type II V2as primarily segregate and expedite patterning signals biased to motor neurons. Distributed control arises by differences in the likelihood of connections within types and the relative weights of connections between them, but not by a strict anatomical hierarchy. Heterogeneity among V0d neurons supports a similar functional distinction. Our findings provide a hybrid conceptual framework to better understand the origins of rhythm and pattern control in the spinal cord.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Disease‐associated proteins are thought to propagate along neuronal processes in neurodegenerative diseases. To detect disease‐associated prion protein (PrP<sup>Sc</sup>) in the vagus nerve in different forms and molecular subtypes of Creutzfeldt‐Jakob disease (CJD) we applied three different anti‐PrP antibodies. We screened the vagus nerve in 162 sporadic and 30 genetic CJD cases. 4/31 VV‐2 type sporadic CJD and 7/30 genetic CJD cases showed vagal PrP<sup>Sc</sup> immunodeposits with distinct morphology. Thus PrP<sup>Sc</sup> in CJD affects the vagus nerve analogously to α‐synuclein in Parkinson's disease. The morphologically diverse deposition of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> in genetic and sporadic CJD argues against uniform mechanisms of propagation of PrP<sup>Sc</sup>.</p>

</h2>
<p>A reliable biomarker is needed for accurate and early differentiation between Parkinson's disease (PD) and the various forms of atypical parkinsonism (AP). We used a novel real‐time quaking‐induced conversion (RT‐QuIC) assay to detect alpha‐synuclein (α‐syn) aggregates in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 118 patients with parkinsonism of uncertain clinical etiology and 52 controls. Diagnostic accuracy to distinguish α‐synucleinopathies from non‐α‐synucleinopathies and controls was 84% (sensitivity 75%, specificity 94% (AUC 0.84, 95% CI 0.78‐0.91, p&lt;0.0001), PPV 93%). CSF α‐syn RT‐QuIC could be a useful diagnostic tool to help clinicians differentiate α‐synucleinopathies from other forms of parkinsonism when the clinical picture is uncertain.</p>

These advances were often buttressed by probing single variables to make circumscribed discoveries, typically through null hypothesis significance testing. New ways for generating massive data fueled tension between the traditional methodology that is used to infer statistically relevant effects in carefully chosen variables, and pattern-learning algorithms that are used to identify predictive signatures by searching through abundant information.

<p>by Nir Even-Chen, Blue Sheffer, Saurabh Vyas, Stephen I. Ryu, Krishna V. Shenoy</p>

Voluntary movements are widely considered to be planned before they are executed. Recent studies have hypothesized that neural activity in motor cortex during preparation acts as an ‘initial condition’ which seeds the proceeding neural dynamics. Here, we studied these initial conditions in detail by investigating 1) the organization of neural states for different reaches and 2) the variance of these neural states from trial to trial. We examined population-level responses in macaque premotor cortex (PMd) during the preparatory stage of an instructed-delay center-out reaching task with dense target configurations. We found that after target onset the neural activity on single trials converges to neural states that have a clear low-dimensional structure which is organized by both the reach endpoint and maximum speed of the following reach. Further, we found that variability of the neural states during preparation resembles the spatial variability of reaches made in the absence of visual feedback: there is less variability in direction than distance in neural state space. We also used offline decoding to understand the implications of this neural population structure for brain-machine interfaces (BMIs). We found that decoding of angle between reaches is dependent on reach distance, while decoding of arc-length is independent. Thus, it might be more appropriate to quantify decoding performance for discrete BMIs by using arc-length between reach end-points rather than the angle between them. Lastly, we show that in contrast to the common notion that direction can better be decoded than distance, their decoding capabilities are comparable. These results provide new insights into the dynamical neural processes that underline motor control and can inform the design of BMIs.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/N3F6MvYWZS4" width="1" />

Mutation signatures in cancer genomes reflect endogenous and exogenous mutational processes, offering insights into tumour etiology, features for prognostic and biologic stratification and vulnerabilities to be exploited therapeutically. We present a novel machine learning formalism for improved signature inference, based on multi-modal correlated topic models (MMCTM) which can at once infer signatures from both single nucleotide and structural variation counts derived from cancer genome sequencing data. We exemplify the utility of our approach on two hormone driven, DNA repair deficient cancers: breast and ovary (n = 755 samples total). We show how introducing correlated structure both within and between modes of mutation can increase accuracy of signature discovery, particularly in the context of sparse data. Our study emphasizes the importance of integrating multiple mutation modes for signature discovery and patient stratification, and provides a statistical modeling framework to incorporate additional features of interest for future studies.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9-7X5eaEu-c" width="1" />

Abstract
<p>Increasing evidence suggests that necroptosis, a form of programmed cell death (PCD), contributes to neurodegeneration in several disorders, including ALS. Supporting this view, investigations in both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> models of ALS have implicated key molecular determinants of necroptosis in the death of spinal motor neurons (MNs). Consistent with a pathogenic role of necroptosis in ALS, we showed increased mRNA levels for the three main necroptosis effectors <i>Ripk1</i>, <i>Ripk3</i>, and <i>Mlkl</i> in the spinal cord of mutant superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1<sup>G93A</sup>) transgenic mice (Tg), an established model of ALS. In addition, protein levels of receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1; but not of RIPK3, MLKL or activated MLKL) were elevated in spinal cord extracts from these Tg SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice. In postmortem motor cortex samples from sporadic and familial ALS patients, no change in protein levels of RIPK1 were detected. Silencing of <i>Ripk3</i> in cultured MNs protected them from toxicity associated with SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> astrocytes. However, constitutive deletion of <i>Ripk3</i> in Tg SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice failed to provide behavioral or neuropathological improvement, demonstrating no similar benefit of <i>Ripk3</i> silencing <i>in vivo</i>. Lastly, we detected no genotype-specific myelin decompaction, proposed to be a proxy of necroptosis in ALS, in either Tg SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> or <i>Optineurin</i> knock-out mice, another ALS mouse model. These findings argue against a role for RIPK3 in Tg SOD1<sup>G93A</sup>-induced neurodegeneration and call for further preclinical investigations to determine if necroptosis plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of ALS.</p>

<p>We develop a method for the automated detection and segmentation of speech
balloons in comic books, including their carrier and tails. Our method is based
on a deep convolutional neural network that was trained on annotated pages of
the Graphic Narrative Corpus. More precisely, we are using a fully
convolutional network approach inspired by the U-Net architecture, combined
with a VGG-16 based encoder. The trained model delivers state-of-the-art
performance with an F1-score of over 0.94. Qualitative results suggest that
wiggly tails, curved corners, and even illusory contours do not pose a major
problem. Furthermore, the model has learned to distinguish speech balloons from
captions. We compare our model to earlier results and discuss some possible
applications.

<p>Olfaction is the first sensory modality to develop during fetal life in
mammals, and plays a key role in the various behaviors of neonates such as
feeding and social interaction. Odorant cues (i.e., mother or predator scents)
can trigger potentiation or inhibition of ultrasonic vocalizations (USV)
emitted by pups following their isolation. Here, we report how USV are
inhibited by olfactory cues using a sono-olfactometer that has been designed to
quantify precisely olfaction in pups congenitally infected by cytomegalovirus.
This olfactory-driven behavioral test assesses the USV emitted in presence of
unfamiliar odorants such as citral scent or adult male mouse scent. We measure
the number of USV emitted as an index of odorant detection during the three
periods of the 5-min isolation time of the pup into the sono-olfactometer:
first period without any odorant, second period with odorant exposure and last
period with exhaust odorant. This protocol can be easily used to reveal
olfactory deficits in pups with altered olfactory system due to toxic lesions
or infectious diseases.

<p>Whole-brain computational modeling based on structural connectivity measures
has shown great promise in successfully simulating fMRI BOLD signals that
includes temporal co-activation patterns that are highly similar to empirical
functional connectivity patterns during resting state. Importantly, previous
studies have shown that spontaneous fluctuations in co-activation patterns of
distributed brain regions have an inherent dynamic nature with regard to the
frequency spectrum of intrinsic brain oscillations. In this modeling study, we
introduce frequency dynamics into a system of coupled oscillators, where each
oscillator represents the local mean-field model of a brain region. We first
show that the collective behavior of interacting oscillators reproduces
previously shown features of brain dynamics. Our analysis of static and dynamic
measures of simulated BOLD fMRI signals support the notion that the frequency
of each oscillator is modulated by flow of activity in its neighborhood.
Second, we examine the effects of simulated lesions in gray brain matter by
applying a new perturbation protocol to our model. We present a new approach to
map the effects of vulnerability in brain networks and introducing a measure of
regional hazardousness based on mapping of the degree of divergence in a
feature space consisting of graph theoretical measures.

<p>We studied the interactions between different temporal scales of diffusion
processes on complex networks and found them to be stronger in scale-free (SF)
than in Erdos-Renyi (ER) networks, especially for the case of phase-amplitude
coupling (PAC)-the phenomenon where the phase of an oscillatory mode modulates
the amplitude of another oscillation. We found that SF networks facilitate PAC
between slow and fast frequency components of the diffusion process, whereas ER
networks enable PAC between slow-frequency components. Nodes contributing the
most to the generation of PAC in SF networks were non-hubs that connected with
high probability to hubs. Additionally, brain networks from healthy controls
(HC) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients presented a weaker PAC between slow
and fast frequencies than SF, but higher than ER. We found that PAC decreased
in AD compared to HC and was more strongly correlated to the scores of two
different cognitive tests than what the strength of functional connectivity
was, suggesting a link between cognitive impairment and multi-scale information
flow in the brain.

<p>Introduction: Individuals with chronic musculoskeletal pain show impairments
in their pain-modulatory capacity. Stress-induced analgesia (SIA) is a paradigm
of endogenous pain inhibition mainly tested in animals. It has not been tested
in patients with chronic pain despite the important role of stress in pain
modulation and the chronicity process. Methods: SIA was tested in 22 patients
with chronic musculoskeletal pain and 18 healthy participants matched for age
and gender. Pain thresholds, pain tolerance and suprathreshold pain sensitivity
were examined before and after a cognitive stressor. Additionally, chronic
stress levels, pain catastrophizing and pain characteristics were assessed as
potential modulating factors. Results: Patients with chronic musculoskeletal
pain compared to healthy controls showed significantly impaired SIA
(F(1,37)=5.63, p=.02) for pain thresholds, but not pain tolerance
(F(1,37)=0.05, p=.83) and stress-induced hyperalgesia (SIH) to suprathreshold
pain ratings (F(1,37)=7.76, p=.008). Patients (r(22)=-0.50, p=.05) but not
controls (r(18)=-0.39, p=.13) with high catastrophizing had low SIA as assessed
by pain thresholds. In controls suprathreshold pain ratings were significantly
positively correlated with catastrophizing (r(18)=0.57, p=.03) and life-time
stress exposure (r(18)=0.54, p=.03). In patients neither catastrophizing
(r(22)=0.21, p=.34) nor stress exposure (r(22)=0.34, p=.34) were associated
with suprathreshold SIH. Discussion: Our data suggest impairments of SIA and
SIH in patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain. Catastrophizing was
associated with deficient SIA in the patients and higher pain ratings in
controls. High life time stress also increased pain ratings in the controls.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/42633">The cellular basis of mechanosensory Merkel-cell innervation during development</a></h4>

Touch sensation is initiated by mechanosensory neurons that innervate distinct skin structures; however, little is known about how these neurons are patterned during mammalian skin development. We explored the cellular basis of touch-receptor patterning in mouse touch domes, which contain mechanosensory Merkel cell-neurite complexes and abut primary hair follicles. At embryonic stage 16.5 (E16.5), touch domes emerge as patches of Merkel cells and keratinocytes clustered with a previously unsuspected population of <i>Bmp4</i>-expressing dermal cells. Epidermal Noggin overexpression at E14.5 disrupted touch-dome formation but not hair-follicle specification, demonstrating a temporally distinct requirement for BMP signaling in placode-derived structures. Surprisingly, two neuronal populations preferentially targeted touch domes during development but only one persisted in mature touch domes. Finally, Keratin-17-expressing keratinocytes but not Merkel cells were necessary to establish innervation patterns during development. These findings identify key cell types and signaling pathways required for targeting Merkel-cell afferents to discrete mechanosensory compartments.

Pyomyositis is a severe bacterial infection of skeletal muscle, commonly affecting children in tropical regions, predominantly caused by <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>. To understand the contribution of bacterial genomic factors to pyomyositis, we conducted a genome-wide association study of <i>S. aureus</i> cultured from 101 children with pyomyositis and 417 children with asymptomatic nasal carriage attending the Angkor Hospital for Children, Cambodia. We found a strong relationship between bacterial genetic variation and pyomyositis, with estimated heritability 63.8% (95% CI 49.2-78.4%). The presence of the Panton-Valentine leucocidin (PVL) locus increased the odds of pyomyositis 130-fold (<i>p</i>=10<sup>-17.9</sup>). The signal of association mapped both to the PVL-coding sequence and the sequence immediately upstream. Together these regions explained over 99.9% of heritability (95% CI 93.5-100%). Our results establish staphylococcal pyomyositis, like tetanus and diphtheria, as critically dependent on a single toxin and demonstrate the potential for association studies to identify specific bacterial genes promoting severe human disease.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/42148">The impact of pathological high-frequency oscillations on hippocampal network activity in rats with chronic epilepsy</a></h4>

In epilepsy, brain networks generate pathological high-frequency oscillations (pHFOs) during interictal periods. To understand how pHFOs differ from normal oscillations in overlapping frequency bands and potentially perturb hippocampal processing, we performed high-density single unit and local field potential recordings from hippocampi of behaving rats with and without chronic epilepsy. In epileptic animals, we observed two types of co-occurring fast oscillations, which by comparison to control animals we could classify as ‘ripple-like’ or ‘pHFO’. We compared their spectral characteristics, brain state dependence, and cellular participants. Strikingly, pHFO occurred irrespective of brain state, were associated with interictal spikes, engaged distinct subnetworks of principal neurons compared to ripple-like events, increased the sparsity of network activity, and initiated both general and immediate disruptions in spatial information coding. Taken together, our findings suggest that events that result in pHFOs have an immediate impact on memory processes, corroborating the need for proper classification of pHFOs to facilitate therapeutic interventions that selectively target pathological activity.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/40919">The proneural wave in the <i>Drosophila</i> optic lobe is driven by an excitable reaction-diffusion mechanism</a></h4>

In living organisms, self-organised waves of signalling activity propagate spatiotemporal information within tissues. During the development of the largest component of the visual processing centre of the <i>Drosophila</i> brain, a travelling wave of proneural gene expression initiates neurogenesis in the larval optic lobe primordium and drives the sequential transition of neuroepithelial cells into neuroblasts. Here, we propose that this ‘proneural wave’ is driven by an excitable reaction-diffusion system involving epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signalling interacting with the proneural gene <i>l’sc</i>. Within this framework, a propagating transition zone emerges from molecular feedback and diffusion. Ectopic activation of EGFR signalling in clones within the neuroepithelium demonstrates that a transition wave can be excited anywhere in the tissue by inducing signalling activity, consistent with a key prediction of the model. Our model illuminates the physical and molecular underpinnings of proneural wave progression and suggests a generic mechanism for regulating the sequential differentiation of tissues.

<p>by David Aagten-Murphy, Paul M. Bays</p>

Visuospatial working memory enables us to maintain access to visual information for processing even when a stimulus is no longer present, due to occlusion, our own movements, or transience of the stimulus. Here we show that, when localizing remembered stimuli, the precision of spatial recall does not rely solely on memory for individual stimuli, but additionally depends on the relative distances between stimuli and visual landmarks in the surroundings. Across three separate experiments, we consistently observed a spatially selective improvement in the precision of recall for items located near a persistent landmark. While the results did not require that the landmark be visible throughout the memory delay period, it was essential that it was visible both during encoding and response. We present a simple model that can accurately capture human performance by considering relative (allocentric) spatial information as an independent localization estimate which degrades with distance and is optimally integrated with egocentric spatial information. Critically, allocentric information was encoded without cost to egocentric estimation, demonstrating independent storage of the two sources of information. Finally, when egocentric and allocentric estimates were put in conflict, the model successfully predicted the resulting localization errors. We suggest that the relative distance between stimuli represents an additional, independent spatial cue for memory recall. This cue information is likely to be critical for spatial localization in natural settings which contain an abundance of visual landmarks.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/zTQCOc-GLrU" width="1" />

This simple concept underlies rapid electrical signaling in the brain as well as several important aspects of neural plasticity. Although the soma accounts for less than 1% of many neurons by membrane area, it has been the major site of measuring ion channel function. However, the axon is one of the longest processes found in cellular biology and hosts a multitude of critical signaling functions in the brain. Not only does the axon initiate and rapidly propagate action potentials (APs) across the brain but it also forms the presynaptic terminals that convert these electrical inputs into chemical outputs. Here, we review recent advances in the physiological role of ion channels within the diverse landscape of the axon and presynaptic terminals.</p></div>

<p>Whether animal or speech communication, environmental sounds, or music -- all
sounds carry some information. Sound sources are embedded in acoustic
environments that contain any number of additional sources that emit sounds
that reach the listener's ears concurrently. It is up to the listener to decode
the acoustic informational mix, determine which sources are of interest, decide
whether extra resources should be allocated to extracting more information from
them, or act upon them. While decision making is a high-level process that is
accomplished by the listener's cognition, selection and elimination of acoustic
information is manifest along the entire auditory system, from periphery to
cortex. This review examines latent informational paradigms in hearing research
and demonstrates how several hearing mechanisms conspire to gradually eliminate
information from the auditory sensory channel. It is motivated through the
computational need of the brain to decomplexify unpredictable real-world
signals in real time. Decomplexification through information loss is suggested
to constitute a unifying principle of the mammalian hearing system, which is
specifically demonstrated in human hearing. This perspective can be readily
generalised to other sensory modalities.

<p>The human brain cortical layer has a convoluted morphology that is unique to
each individual. Characterization of the cortical morphology is necessary in
longitudinal studies of structural brain change, as well as in discriminating
individuals in health and disease. A method for encoding the cortical
morphology in the form of a graph is presented. The design of graphs that
encode the global cerebral hemisphere cortices as well as localized cortical
regions is proposed. Spectral metrics derived from these graphs are then
studied and proposed as descriptors of cortical morphology. As proof-of-concept
of their applicability in characterizing cortical morphology, the metrics are
studied in the context of hemispheric asymmetry as well as gender dependent
discrimination of cortical morphology.

<p>Phantom limb pain (PLP) has been associated with both the reorganization of
the somatotopic map in primary somatosensory cortex (S1) and preserved S1
function. Here we assessed the nature of the information (sensory, motor) that
reaches S1 and methodological differences in the assessment of cortical
representations that might explain these findings. We used functional magnetic
resonance imaging during a virtual hand motor task, analogous to the classical
mirror box task, in amputees with and without PLP and in matched controls. We
assessed the relationship between task-related activation maxima and PLP
intensity in S1 versus motor (M1) maps. We also measured cortical distances
between the location of activation maxima using region of interest (ROI),
defined from individual or group analyses. Amputees showed significantly
increased activity in M1 and S1 compared to controls, which was not
significantly related to PLP intensity. The location of activation maxima
differed between groups depending on M1 and S1 maps. Neural activity was
positively related to PLP only in amputees with pain and only if a
group-defined ROI was chosen. These findings show that the analysis of changes
in S1 versus M1 yields different results, possibly indicating different
pain-related processes.

<p>We develop a theoretical framework for defining and identifying flows of
information in computational systems. Here, a computational system is assumed
to be a directed graph, with "clocked" nodes that send transmissions to each
other along the edges of the graph at discrete points in time. A few measures
of information flow have been proposed previously in the literature, and
measures of directed causal influence are currently being used as a heuristic
proxy for information flow. However, there is as yet no rigorous treatment of
the problem with formal definitions and clearly stated assumptions, and the
process of defining information flow is often conflated with the problem of
estimating it. In this work, we provide a new information-theoretic definition
for information flow in a computational system, which we motivate using a
series of examples. We then show that this definition satisfies intuitively
desirable properties, including the existence of "information paths", along
which information flows from the input of the computational system to its
output. Finally, we describe how information flow might be estimated in a
noiseless setting, and provide an algorithm to identify information paths on
the time-unrolled graph of a computational system.

Based on morphology it is often challenging to distinguish between the many different soft tissue sarcoma subtypes. Moreover, outcome of disease is highly variable even between patients with the same disease. Machine learning on transcriptome sequencing data could be a valuable new tool to understand differences between and within entities. Here we used machine learning analysis to identify novel diagnostic and prognostic markers and therapeutic targets for soft tissue sarcomas. Gene expression data was used from the Cancer Genome Atlas, the Genotype-Tissue Expression data and the French Sarcoma Group. We identified three groups of tumors that overlap in their molecular profile as seen with unsupervised t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding clustering and a deep neural network. The three groups corresponded to subtypes that are morphologically overlapping. Using a random forest algorithm, we identified novel diagnostic markers for soft tissue sarcoma that distinguished between synovial sarcoma and MPNST, and that we validated using qRT-PCR in an independent series. Next, we identified prognostic genes that are strong predictors of disease outcome when used in a k-nearest neighbor algorithm. The prognostic genes were further validated in expression data from the French Sarcoma Group. One of these, <i>HMMR</i>, was validated in an independent series of leiomyosarcomas using immunohistochemistry on tissue micro array as a prognostic gene for disease-free interval. Furthermore, reconstruction of regulatory networks combined with data from the Connectivity Map showed, amongst others, that HDAC inhibitors could be a potential effective therapy for multiple soft tissue sarcoma subtypes. A viability assay with two HDAC inhibitors confirmed that both leiomyosarcoma and synovial sarcoma are sensitive to HDAC inhibition. In this study we identified novel diagnostic markers, prognostic markers and therapeutic leads from multiple soft tissue sarcoma gene expression datasets. Thus, machine learning algorithms are powerful new tools to improve our understanding of rare tumor entities.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/nvDdAFQafQ0" width="1" />

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25442?af=R">High frequency oscillation networks and surgical outcome in adult focal epilepsy</a></h4>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To investigate whether high frequency oscillations (HFOs) show spatiotemporal propagation and assess the relevance of the earliest oscillations in relation to the seizure onset zone and postsurgical outcome.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We retrospectively investigated the intracerebral EEG of patients who became seizure free after subsequent surgery. We marked HFOs during one hour of recordings. We calculated the time delay between pairs of channels as the median delay between their HFOs, and constructed a time line of the delay of each channel with respect to the earliest channel (first source channel). A network was defined when a temporal order could be established among the channels based on the existence of statistically significant delays.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Fifteen patients with good surgical outcome were included. We found ripple networks in all patients, and fast ripple networks in 9. For ripples, first source channels were found in a higher proportion in the seizure onset zone than the rest of the network channels (15/27, 56% vs. 93/262, 35%; p=0.04). For both ripples and fast ripples, first source channels were resected more often that the rest of the network channels (Ripples: 13/27, 48% vs. 65/262, 25%; p=0.01. Fast ripples: 8/9, 89% vs. 17/40, 43%; p=0.002); channels with the highest rates of ripples and fast ripples were resected in a similar proportion.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These results demonstrate that interictal HFOs are organized in networks, and indicate a possible need for the resection of first source channels. However, resecting them is not superior to resecting channels with highest rates of HFOs.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>During the 1990s we estimated the genetic contribution to Parkinson's disease risk in a large population‐based twin registry. Because many unaffected twins were still alive, prior concordance estimates were based on incomplete information. 95% of twins are now deceased. Here we update concordance and heritability through 2015 using National Death Index data. In total, we identified 30 concordant and 193 discordant pairs. Probandwise concordance was 0.20 in monozygotic and 0.13 in dizygotic pairs. Heritability was 0.27 overall, 0.83 in pairs diagnosed <span>&lt;</span>50, and 0.19 in pairs diagnosed &gt;50. High concordance in dizygotic twins suggests shared effects of early childhood environment.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>In this study, we examined the potential causal effect of smoking on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis using the Project MinE data involving 12,577 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and 23,475 controls in a Mendelian randomization (MR) framework. The MR approach has the potential to investigate causal relationship between a risk factor and a disease, avoiding confounding and information bias that often present in conventional epidemiological studies. We found that smokers had a higher risk of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis compared to never smokers. Our study thus provides evidence for a causal relationship between smoking and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/8/1539?rss=1">Increased Resurgent Sodium Currents in Nav1.8 Contribute to Nociceptive Sensory Neuron Hyperexcitability Associated with Peripheral Neuropathies</a></h4>

<p>Neuropathic pain is a significant public health challenge, yet the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Painful small fiber neuropathy (SFN) may be caused by gain-of-function mutations in Nav1.8, a sodium channel subtype predominantly expressed in peripheral nociceptive neurons. However, it is not clear how Nav1.8 disease mutations induce sensory neuron hyperexcitability. Here we studied two mutations in Nav1.8 associated with hypersensitive sensory neurons: G1662S reported in painful SFN; and T790A, which underlies increased pain behaviors in the <i>Possum</i> transgenic mouse strain. We show that, in male DRG neurons, these mutations, which impair inactivation, significantly increase TTX-resistant resurgent sodium currents mediated by Nav1.8. The G1662S mutation doubled resurgent currents, and the T790A mutation increased them fourfold. These unusual currents are typically evoked during the repolarization phase of action potentials. We show that the T790A mutation greatly enhances DRG neuron excitability by reducing current threshold and increasing firing frequency. Interestingly, the mutation endows DRG neurons with multiple early afterdepolarizations and leads to substantial prolongation of action potential duration. In DRG neurons, siRNA knockdown of sodium channel β4 subunits fails to significantly alter T790A current density but reduces TTX-resistant resurgent currents by 56%. Furthermore, DRG neurons expressing T790A channels exhibited reduced excitability with fewer early afterdepolarizations and narrower action potentials after β4 knockdown. Together, our data demonstrate that open-channel block of TTX-resistant currents, enhanced by gain-of-function mutations in Nav1.8, can make major contributions to the hyperexcitability of nociceptive neurons, likely leading to altered sensory phenotypes including neuropathic pain in SFN.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> This work demonstrates that two disease mutations in the voltage-gated sodium channel Na<sub>v</sub>1.8 that induce nociceptor hyperexcitability increase resurgent currents. Nav1.8 is crucial for pain sensations. Because resurgent currents are evoked during action potential repolarization, they can be crucial regulators of action potential activity. Our data indicate that increased Nav1.8 resurgent currents in DRG neurons greatly prolong action potential duration and enhance repetitive firing. We propose that Nav1.8 open-channel block is a major factor in Nav1.8-associated pain mechanisms and that targeting the molecular mechanism underlying these unique resurgent currents represents a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of aberrant pain sensations.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/8/1525?rss=1">Aberrant Somatosensory Processing and Connectivity in Mice Lacking Engrailed-2</a></h4>

<p>Overreactivity and defensive behaviors in response to tactile stimuli are common symptoms in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) patients. Similarly, somatosensory hypersensitivity has also been described in mice lacking ASD-associated genes such as <i>Fmr1</i> (fragile X mental retardation protein 1). <i>Fmr1</i> knock-out mice also show reduced functional connectivity between sensory cortical areas, which may represent an endogenous biomarker for their hypersensitivity. Here, we measured whole-brain functional connectivity in <i>Engrailed-2</i> knock-out (<i>En2</i><sup>–/–</sup>) adult mice, which show a lower expression of <i>Fmr1</i> and anatomical defects common to <i>Fmr1</i> knock-outs. MRI-based resting-state functional connectivity in adult <i>En2</i><sup>–/–</sup> mice revealed significantly reduced synchronization in somatosensory-auditory/associative cortices and dorsal thalamus, suggesting the presence of aberrant somatosensory processing in these mutants. Accordingly, when tested in the whisker nuisance test, <i>En2</i><sup>–/–</sup> but not WT mice of both sexes showed fear behavior in response to repeated whisker stimulation. <i>En2</i><sup>–/–</sup> mice undergoing this test exhibited decreased c-Fos-positive neurons (a marker of neuronal activity) in layer IV of the primary somatosensory cortex and increased immunoreactive cells in the basolateral amygdala compared with WT littermates. Conversely, when tested in a sensory maze, <i>En2</i><sup>–/–</sup> and WT mice spent a comparable time in whisker-guided exploration, indicating that whisker-mediated behaviors are otherwise preserved in <i>En2</i> mutants. Therefore, fearful responses to somatosensory stimuli in <i>En2</i><sup>–/–</sup> mice are accompanied by reduced basal connectivity of sensory regions, reduced activation of somatosensory cortex, and increased activation of the basolateral amygdala, suggesting that impaired somatosensory processing is a common feature in mice lacking ASD-related genes.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Overreactivity to tactile stimuli is a common symptom in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) patients. Recent studies performed in mice bearing ASD-related mutations confirmed these findings. Here, we evaluated the behavioral response to whisker stimulation in mice lacking the ASD-related gene <i>Engrailed-2</i> (<i>En2</i><sup>–/–</sup> mice). Compared with WT controls, <i>En2</i><sup>–/–</sup> mice showed reduced functional connectivity in the somatosensory cortex, which was paralleled by fear behavior, reduced activation of somatosensory cortex, and increased activation of the basolateral amygdala in response to repeated whisker stimulation. These results suggest that impaired somatosensory signal processing is a common feature in mice harboring ASD-related mutations.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/8/1505?rss=1">Degeneration of ipRGCs in Mouse Models of Huntington's Disease Disrupts Non-Image-Forming Behaviors Before Motor Impairment</a></h4>

<p>Intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs), which express the photopigment melanopsin, are photosensitive neurons in the retina and are essential for non-image-forming functions, circadian photoentrainment, and pupillary light reflexes. Five subtypes of ipRGCs (M1–M5) have been identified in mice. Although ipRGCs are spared in several forms of inherited blindness, they are affected in Alzheimer's disease and aging, which are associated with impaired circadian rhythms. Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal neurodegenerative disease caused by the expansion of a CAG repeat in the <i>huntingtin</i> gene. In addition to motor function impairment, HD mice also show impaired circadian rhythms and loss of ipRGC. Here, we found that, in HD mouse models (R6/2 and N171-82Q male mice), the expression of melanopsin was reduced before the onset of motor deficits. The expression of retinal T-box brain 2, a transcription factor essential for ipRGCs, was associated with the survival of ipRGCs. The number of M1 ipRGCs in R6/2 male mice was reduced due to apoptosis, whereas non-M1 ipRGCs were relatively resilient to HD progression. Most importantly, the reduced innervations of M1 ipRGCs, which was assessed by X-gal staining in R6/2-OPN4<sup>Lacz/+</sup> male mice, contributed to the diminished light-induced c-fos and vasoactive intestinal peptide in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), which may explain the impaired circadian photoentrainment in HD mice. Collectively, our results show that M1 ipRGCs were susceptible to the toxicity caused by mutant Huntingtin. The resultant impairment of M1 ipRGCs contributed to the early degeneration of the ipRGC–SCN pathway and disrupted circadian regulation during HD progression.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Circadian disruption is a common nonmotor symptom of Huntington's disease (HD). In addition to the molecular defects in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), the cause of circadian disruption in HD remains to be further explored. We hypothesized that ipRGCs, by integrating light input to the SCN, participate in the circadian regulation in HD mice. We report early reductions in melanopsin in two mouse models of HD, R6/2, and N171-82Q. Suppression of retinal T-box brain 2, a transcription factor essential for ipRGCs, by mutant Huntingtin might mediate the reduced number of ipRGCs. Importantly, M1 ipRGCs showed higher susceptibility than non-M1 ipRGCs in R6/2 mice. The resultant impairment of M1 ipRGCs contributed to the early degeneration of the ipRGC–SCN pathway and the circadian abnormality during HD progression.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/8/1484?rss=1">Activation of 5-HT1A Receptors Promotes Retinal Ganglion Cell Function by Inhibiting the cAMP-PKA Pathway to Modulate Presynaptic GABA Release in Chronic Glaucoma</a></h4>

<p>Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) receptor agonists are neuroprotective in CNS injury models. However, the neuroprotective functional implications and synaptic mechanism of 8-hydroxy-2- (di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8-OH-DPAT), a serotonin receptor (5-HT1A) agonist, in an adult male Wistar rat model of chronic glaucoma model remain unknown. We found that ocular hypertension decreased 5-HT1A receptor expression in rat retinas because the number of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) was significantly reduced in rats with induced ocular hypertension relative to that in control retinas and 8-OH-DPAT enhanced the RGC viability. The protective effects of 8-OH-DPAT were blocked by intravitreal administration of the selective 5-HT1A antagonist WAY-100635 or the selective GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist SR95531. Using patch-clamp techniques, spontaneous and miniature GABAergic IPSCs (sIPSCs and mIPSCs, respectively) of RGCs in rat retinal slices were recorded. 8-OH-DPAT significantly increased the frequency and amplitude of GABAergic sIPSCs and mIPSCs in ON- and OFF-type RGCs. Among the signaling cascades mediated by the 5-HT1A receptor, the role of cAMP-protein kinase A (PKA) signaling was investigated. The 8-OH-DPAT-induced changes at the synaptic level were enhanced by PKA inhibition by H-89 and blocked by PKA activation with bucladesine. Furthermore, the density of phosphorylated PKA (p-PKA)/PKA was significantly increased in glaucomatous retinas and 8-OH-DPAT significantly decreased p-PKA/PKA expression, which led to the inhibition of PKA phosphorylation upon relieving neurotransmitter GABA release. These results showed that the activation of 5-HT1A receptors in retinas facilitated presynaptic GABA release functions by suppressing cAMP-PKA signaling and decreasing PKA phosphorylation, which could lead to the de-excitation of RGC circuits and suppress excitotoxic processes in glaucoma.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We found that serotonin (5-HT) receptors in the retina (5-HT1A receptors) were downregulated after intraocular pressure elevation. Patch-clamp recordings demonstrated differences in the frequencies of miniature GABAergic IPSCs (mIPSCs) in ON- and OFF-type retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and RGCs in normal and glaucomatous retinal slices. Therefore, phosphorylated protein kinase A (PKA) inhibition upon release of the neurotransmitter GABA was eliminated by 8-hydroxy-2- (di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8-OH-DPAT), which led to increased levels of GABAergic mIPSCs in ON- and OFF-type RGCs, thus enhancing RGC viability and function. These protective effects were blocked by the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist SR95531 or the 5-HT1A antagonist WAY-100635. This study identified a novel mechanism by which activation of 5-HT1A receptors protects damaged RGCs via the cAMP-PKA signaling pathway that modulates GABAergic presynaptic activity.</p>

<p>An essential human skill is our capacity to monitor and execute a sequence of tasks in the service of an overarching goal. Such a sequence can be as mundane as making a cup of coffee or as complex as flying a fighter plane. Previously, we showed that, during sequential control, the rostrolateral prefrontal cortex (RLPFC) exhibits activation that ramps steadily through the sequence and is necessary for sequential task execution using fMRI in humans (Desrochers et al., 2015). It remains unknown what computations may underlie this ramping dynamic. Across two independent fMRI experiments, we manipulated three features that were unique to the sequential control task to determine whether and how they modulated ramping activity in the RLPFC: (1) sequence position uncertainty, (2) sequential monitoring without external position cues (i.e., from memory), and (3) sequential monitoring without multilevel decision making (i.e., task execution). We replicated the ramping activation in RLPFC and found it to be remarkably robust regardless of the level of task abstraction or engagement of memory functions. Therefore, these results both replicate and extend previous findings regarding the function of the RLPFC. They suggest that sequential control processes are integral to the dynamics of RLPFC activity. Advancing knowledge of the neural bases of sequential control is crucial for our understanding of the sequential processes that are necessary for daily living.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We perform sequences of tasks every day, but little is known about how they are controlled in the brain. Previously we found that ramping activity in the rostrolateral prefrontal cortex (RLPFC) was necessary to perform a sequence of tasks. We designed two independent fMRI experiments in human participants to determine which features of the previous sequential task potentially engaged ramping in the RLPFC. We found that any demand to monitor a sequence of state transitions consistently elicited ramping in the RLPFC, regardless of the level of the decisions made at each step in the sequence or engagement of memory functions. These results provide a framework for understanding RLPFC function during sequential control, and consequently, daily life.</p>

<p>Dynamic regulation of synaptic transmission at cortical inputs to the dorsal striatum is considered critical for flexible and efficient action learning and control. Presynaptic mechanisms governing the properties and plasticity of glutamate release from these inputs are not fully understood, and the corticostriatal synaptic processes that support normal action learning and control remain unclear. Here we show in male and female mice that conditional deletion of presynaptic proteins RIM1αβ (RIM1) from excitatory cortical neurons impairs corticostriatal synaptic transmission in the dorsolateral striatum. Key forms of presynaptic G-protein-coupled receptor-mediated short- and long-term striatal plasticity are spared following RIM1 deletion. Conditional RIM1 KO mice show heightened novelty-induced locomotion and impaired motor learning on the accelerating rotarod. They further show heightened self-paced instrumental responding for food and impaired learning of a habitual instrumental response strategy. Together, these findings reveal a selective role for presynaptic RIM1 in neurotransmitter release at prominent basal ganglia synapses, and provide evidence that RIM1-dependent processes help to promote the refinement of skilled actions, constrain goal-directed behaviors, and support the learning and use of habits.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Our daily functioning hinges on the ability to flexibly and efficiently learn and control our actions. How the brain encodes these capacities is unclear. Here we identified a selective role for presynaptic proteins RIM1αβ in controlling glutamate release from cortical inputs to the dorsolateral striatum, a brain structure critical for action learning and control. Behavioral analysis of mice with restricted genetic deletion of RIM1αβ further revealed roles for RIM1αβ-dependent processes in the learning and refinement of motor skills and the balanced expression of goal-directed and habitual actions.</p>

<p>Learning and decision-making are modulated by socio-emotional processing and such modulation is implicated in clinically relevant personality traits of social anxiety. The present study elucidates the computational and neural mechanisms by which emotionally aversive cues disrupt learning in socially anxious human individuals. Healthy volunteers with low or high trait social anxiety performed a reversal learning task requiring learning actions in response to angry or happy face cues. Choice data were best captured by a computational model in which learning rate was adjusted according to the history of surprises. High trait socially anxious individuals used a less-dynamic strategy for adjusting their learning rate in trials started with angry face cues and unlike the low social anxiety group, their dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) activity did not covary with the learning rate. Our results demonstrate that trait social anxiety is accompanied by disruption of optimal learning and dACC activity in threatening situations.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Social anxiety is known to influence a broad range of cognitive functions. This study tests whether and how social anxiety affects human value-based learning as a function of uncertainty in the learning environment. The findings indicate that, in a threatening context evoked by an angry face, socially anxious individuals fail to benefit from a stable learning environment with highly predictable stimulus–response–outcome associations. Under those circumstances, socially anxious individuals failed to use their dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, a region known to adjust learning rate to environmental uncertainty. These findings open the way to modify neurobiological mechanisms of maladaptive learning in anxiety and depressive disorders.</p>

<p>Dopamine (DA) levels in the striatum are increased by many therapeutic drugs, such as methylphenidate (MPH), which also alters behavioral and cognitive functions thought to be controlled by the PFC dose-dependently. We linked DA changes and functional connectivity (FC) using simultaneous [<sup>18</sup>F]fallypride PET and resting-state fMRI in awake male rhesus monkeys after oral administration of various doses of MPH. We found a negative correlation between [<sup>18</sup>F]fallypride nondisplaceable binding potential (BP<sub>ND</sub>) and MPH dose in the head of the caudate (hCd), demonstrating increased extracellular DA resulting from MPH administration. The decreased BP<sub>ND</sub> was negatively correlated with FC between the hCd and the PFC. Subsequent voxelwise analyses revealed negative correlations with FC between the hCd and the dorsolateral PFC, hippocampus, and precuneus. These results, showing that MPH-induced changes in DA levels in the hCd predict resting-state FC, shed light on a mechanism by which changes in striatal DA could influence function in the PFC.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Dopamine transmission is thought to play an essential role in shaping large scale-neural networks that underlie cognitive functions. It is the target of therapeutic drugs, such as methylphenidate (Ritalin), which blocks the dopamine transporter, thereby increasing extracellular dopamine levels. Methylphenidate is used extensively to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, even though its effects on cognitive functions and their underlying neural mechanisms are not well understood. To date, little is known about the link between changes in dopamine levels and changes in functional brain organization. Using simultaneous PET/MR imaging, we show that methylphenidate-induced changes in endogenous dopamine levels in the head of the caudate predict changes in resting-state functional connectivity between this structure and the prefrontal cortex, precuneus, and hippocampus.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/8/1420?rss=1">Frequency Shifts and Depth Dependence of Premotor Beta Band Activity during Perceptual Decision-Making</a></h4>

<p>Neural activity in the premotor and motor cortices shows prominent structure in the beta frequency range (13–30 Hz). Currently, the behavioral relevance of this beta band activity (BBA) is debated. The underlying source of motor BBA and how it changes as a function of cortical depth are also not completely understood. Here, we addressed these unresolved questions by investigating BBA recorded using laminar electrodes in the dorsal premotor cortex of 2 male rhesus macaques performing a visual reaction time (RT) reach discrimination task. We observed robust BBA before and after the onset of the visual stimulus but not during the arm movement. While poststimulus BBA was positively correlated with RT throughout the beta frequency range, prestimulus correlation varied by frequency. Low beta frequencies (~12–20 Hz) were positively correlated with RT, and high beta frequencies (~22–30 Hz) were negatively correlated with RT. Analysis and simulations suggested that these frequency-dependent correlations could emerge due to a shift in the component frequencies of the prestimulus BBA as a function of RT, such that faster RTs are accompanied by greater power in high beta frequencies. We also observed a laminar dependence of BBA, with deeper electrodes demonstrating stronger power in low beta frequencies both prestimulus and poststimulus. The heterogeneous nature of BBA and the changing relationship between BBA and RT in different task epochs may be a sign of the differential network dynamics involved in cue expectation, decision-making, motor preparation, and movement execution.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Beta band activity (BBA) has been implicated in motor tasks, in disease states, and as a potential signal for brain–machine interfaces. However, the behavioral relevance of BBA and its laminar organization in premotor cortex have not been completely elucidated. Here we addressed these unresolved issues using simultaneous recordings from multiple cortical layers of the premotor cortex of monkeys performing a decision-making task. Our key finding is that BBA is not a monolithic signal. Instead, BBA consists of at least two frequency bands. The relationship between BBA and eventual behavior, such as reaction time, also dynamically changes depending on task epoch. We also provide further evidence that BBA is laminarly organized, with greater power in deeper electrodes for low beta frequencies.</p>

<p>One of the challenges facing neuroscience entails localization of circuits and mechanisms accounting for how multiple features of stress responses are organized to promote survival during adverse experiences. The rodent medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is generally regarded as a key site for cognitive and affective information processing, and the anteroventral bed nuclei of the stria terminalis (avBST) integrates homeostatic information from a variety of sources, including the mPFC. Thus, we proposed that the mPFC is capable of generating multiple features (endocrine, behavioral) of adaptive responses via its influence over the avBST. To address this possibility, we first optogenetically inhibited input to avBST from the rostral prelimbic cortical region of mPFC and observed concurrent increases in immobility and hypothalamo–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) output in male rats during tail suspension, whereas photostimulation of this pathway decreased immobility during the same challenge. Anatomical tracing experiments confirmed projections from the rostral prelimbic subfield to separate populations of avBST neurons, and from these to HPA effector neurons in the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus, and to aspects of the midbrain periaqueductal gray that coordinate passive defensive behaviors. Finally, stimulation and inhibition of the prelimbic–avBST pathway, respectively, decreased and increased passive coping in the shock-probe defensive burying test, without having any direct effect on active coping (burying) behavior. These results define a new neural substrate in the coordination of a <i>response set</i> that involves the gating of passive, rather than active, coping behaviors while restraining neuroendocrine activation to optimize adaptation during threat exposure.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The circuits and mechanisms accounting for how multiple features of responses are organized to promote adaptation have yet to be elucidated. Our report identifies a prefrontal–bed nucleus pathway that organizes a <i>response set</i> capable of gating passive coping behaviors while concurrently restraining neuroendocrine activation during exposure to inescapable stressors. These data provide insight into the central organization of how multiple features of responses are integrated to promote adaptation during adverse experiences, and how disruption in one neural pathway may underlie a broad array of maladaptive responses in stress-related psychiatric disorders.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/8/1386?rss=1">Heparan Sulfate Sulfation by Hs2st Restricts Astroglial Precursor Somal Translocation in Developing Mouse Forebrain by a Non-Cell-Autonomous Mechanism</a></h4>

<p>Heparan sulfate (HS) is a cell surface and extracellular matrix carbohydrate extensively modified by differential sulfation. HS interacts physically with canonical fibroblast growth factor (FGF) proteins that signal through the extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK)/mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. At the embryonic mouse telencephalic midline, FGF/ERK signaling drives astroglial precursor somal translocation from the ventricular zone of the corticoseptal boundary (CSB) to the induseum griseum (IG), producing a focus of <i>Slit2</i>-expressing astroglial guidepost cells essential for interhemispheric corpus callosum (CC) axon navigation. Here, we investigated the cell and molecular function of a specific form of HS sulfation, 2-O HS sulfation catalyzed by the enzyme Hs2st, in midline astroglial development and in regulating FGF protein levels and interaction with HS. <i>Hs2st</i><sup>–/–</sup> embryos of either sex exhibit a grossly enlarged IG due to precocious astroglial translocation and conditional <i>Hs2st</i> mutagenesis and <i>ex vivo</i> culture experiments show that <i>Hs2st</i> is not required cell autonomously by CC axons or by the IG astroglial cell lineage, but rather acts non-cell autonomously to suppress the transmission of translocation signals to astroglial precursors. Rescue of the <i>Hs2st</i><sup>–/–</sup> astroglial translocation phenotype by pharmacologically inhibiting FGF signaling shows that the normal role of Hs2st is to suppress FGF-mediated astroglial translocation. We demonstrate a selective action of Hs2st on FGF protein by showing that <i>Hs2st</i> (but not <i>Hs6st1</i>) normally suppresses the levels of Fgf17 protein in the CSB region <i>in vivo</i> and use a biochemical assay to show that <i>Hs2st</i> (but not <i>Hs6st1</i>) facilitates a physical interaction between the Fgf17 protein and HS.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We report a novel non-cell-autonomous mechanism regulating cell signaling in developing brain. Using the developing mouse telencephalic midline as an exemplar, we show that the specific sulfation modification of the cell surface and extracellular carbohydrate heparan sulfate (HS) performed by Hs2st suppresses the supply of translocation signals to astroglial precursors by a non-cell-autonomous mechanism. We further show that Hs2st modification selectively facilitates a physical interaction between Fgf17 and HS and suppresses Fgf17 protein levels <i>in vivo</i>, strongly suggesting that Hs2st acts selectively on Fgf17 signaling. HS interacts with many signaling proteins potentially encoding numerous selective interactions important in development and disease, so this class of mechanism may apply more broadly to other biological systems.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/8/1374?rss=1">Cross-Modal Competition: The Default Computation for Multisensory Processing</a></h4>

<p>Mature multisensory superior colliculus (SC) neurons integrate information across the senses to enhance their responses to spatiotemporally congruent cross-modal stimuli. The development of this neurotypic feature of SC neurons requires experience with cross-modal cues. In the absence of such experience the response of an SC neuron to congruent cross-modal cues is no more robust than its response to the most effective component cue. This "default" or "naive" state is believed to be one in which cross-modal signals do not interact. The present results challenge this characterization by identifying interactions between visual-auditory signals in male and female cats reared without visual-auditory experience. By manipulating the relative effectiveness of the visual and auditory cross-modal cues that were presented to each of these naive neurons, an active competition between cross-modal signals was revealed. Although contrary to current expectations, this result is explained by a neuro-computational model in which the default interaction is mutual inhibition. These findings suggest that multisensory neurons at all maturational stages are capable of some form of multisensory integration, and use experience with cross-modal stimuli to transition from their initial state of competition to their mature state of cooperation. By doing so, they develop the ability to enhance the physiological salience of cross-modal events thereby increasing their impact on the sensorimotor circuitry of the SC, and the likelihood that biologically significant events will elicit SC-mediated overt behaviors.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The present results demonstrate that the default mode of multisensory processing in the superior colliculus is competition, not non-integration as previously characterized. A neuro-computational model explains how these competitive dynamics can be implemented via mutual inhibition, and how this default mode is superseded by the emergence of cooperative interactions during development.</p>

<p>Childhood socioeconomic status (SES) impacts cognitive development and mental health, but its association with human structural brain development is not yet well characterized. Here, we analyzed 1243 longitudinally acquired structural MRI scans from 623 youth (299 female/324 male) to investigate the relation between SES and cortical and subcortical morphology between ages 5 and 25 years. We found positive associations between SES and total volumes of the brain, cortical sheet, and four separate subcortical structures. These associations were stable between ages 5 and 25. Surface-based shape analysis revealed that higher SES is associated with areal expansion of lateral prefrontal, anterior cingulate, lateral temporal, and superior parietal cortices and ventrolateral thalamic, and medial amygdalo-hippocampal subregions. Meta-analyses of functional imaging data indicate that cortical correlates of SES are centered on brain systems subserving sensorimotor functions, language, memory, and emotional processing. We further show that anatomical variation within a subset of these cortical regions partially mediates the positive association between SES and IQ. Finally, we identify neuroanatomical correlates of SES that exist above and beyond accompanying variation in IQ. Although SES is clearly a complex construct that likely relates to development through diverse, nondeterministic processes, our findings elucidate potential neuroanatomical mediators of the association between SES and cognitive outcomes.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Childhood socioeconomic status (SES) has been associated with developmental disparities in mental health, cognitive ability, and academic achievement, but efforts to understand underlying SES–brain relationships are ongoing. Here, we leverage a unique developmental neuroimaging dataset to longitudinally map the associations between SES and regional brain anatomy at high spatiotemporal resolution. We find widespread associations between SES and global cortical and subcortical volumes and surface area and localize these correlations to a distributed set of cortical, thalamic, and amygdalo-hippocampal subregions. Anatomical variation within a subset of these regions partially mediates the positive relationship between SES and IQ. Our findings help to localize cortical and subcortical systems that represent candidate biological substrates for the known relationships between SES and cognition.</p>

<p>Mutations in the Joubert syndrome-associated small GTPase ARL13B are linked to photoreceptor impairment and vision loss. To determine the role of ARL13B in the development, function, and maintenance of ciliated photoreceptors, we generated a pan-retina knock-out (<i>Six3</i>-Cre) and a rod photoreceptor-specific inducible conditional knock-out (<i>Pde6g</i>-Cre<sup>ERT2</sup>) of ARL13B using murine models. Embryonic deletion of ARL13B led to defects in retinal development with reduced cell proliferation. In the absence of ARL13B, photoreceptors failed to develop outer segment (OS) membranous discs and axonemes, resulting in loss of function and rapid degeneration. Additionally, the majority of photoreceptor basal bodies did not dock properly at the apical edge of the inner segments. The removal of ARL13B in adult rod photoreceptor cells after maturation of OS resulted in loss of photoresponse and vesiculation in the OS. Before changes in photoresponse, removal of ARL13B led to mislocalization of rhodopsin, prenylated phosphodiesterase-6 (PDE6), and intraflagellar transport protein-88 (IFT88). Our findings show that ARL13B is required at multiple stages of retinogenesis, including early postnatal proliferation of retinal progenitor cells, development of photoreceptor cilia, and morphogenesis of photoreceptor OS discs regardless of sex. Last, our results establish a need for ARL13B in photoreceptor maintenance and protein trafficking.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The normal development of photoreceptor cilia is essential to create functional, organized outer segments with stacked membrane discs that house the phototransduction proteins necessary for sight. Our study identifies a complex role for ARL13B, a small GTPase linked to Joubert syndrome and visual impairment, at various stages of photoreceptor development. Loss of ARL13B led to defects in retinal proliferation, altered placement of basal bodies crucial for components of the cilium (transition zone) to emanate, and absence of photoreceptor-stacked discs. These defects led to extinguished visual response and dysregulated protein trafficking. Our findings show the complex role ARL13B plays in photoreceptor development, viability, and function. Our study accounts for the severe retinal impairment observed in ARL13B-linked Joubert syndrome patients.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/8/1334?rss=1">Loss of Adult 5-HT1A Autoreceptors Results in a Paradoxical Anxiogenic Response to Antidepressant Treatment</a></h4>

<p>Selective serotonin (5-HT) reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are first-line antidepressants but require several weeks to elicit their actions. Chronic SSRI treatment induces desensitization of 5-HT1A autoreceptors to enhance 5-HT neurotransmission. Mice (both sexes) with gene deletion of 5-HT1A autoreceptors in adult 5-HT neurons (<i>1AcKO</i>) were tested for response to SSRIs. Tamoxifen-induced recombination in adult <i>1AcKO</i> mice specifically reduced 5-HT1A autoreceptor levels. The <i>1AcKO</i> mice showed a loss of 5-HT1A autoreceptor-mediated hypothermia and electrophysiological responses, but no changes in anxiety- or depression-like behavior. Subchronic fluoxetine (FLX) treatment induced an unexpected anxiogenic effect in <i>1AcKO</i> mice in the novelty suppressed feeding and elevated plus maze tests, as did escitalopram in the novelty suppressed feeding test. No effect was seen in wild-type (<i>WT</i>) mice. Subchronic FLX increased 5-HT metabolism in prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and raphe of <i>1AcKO</i> but not <i>WT</i> mice, suggesting hyperactivation of 5-HT release. To detect chronic cellular activation, FosB<sup>+</sup> cells were quantified. FosB<sup>+</sup> cells were reduced in entorhinal cortex and hippocampus (CA2/3) and increased in dorsal raphe 5-HT cells of <i>1AcKO</i> mice, suggesting increased raphe activation. In <i>WT</i> but not <i>1AcKO</i> mice, FLX reduced FosB<sup>+</sup> cells in the median raphe, hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and median septum, which receive rich 5-HT projections. Thus, in the absence of 5-HT1A autoreceptors, SSRIs induce a paradoxical anxiogenic response. This may involve imbalance in activation of dorsal and median raphe to regulate septohippocampal or fimbria-fornix pathways. These results suggest that markedly reduced 5-HT1A autoreceptors may provide a marker for aberrant response to SSRI treatment.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Serotonin-selective reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are effective in treating anxiety and depression in humans and mouse models. However, in some cases, SSRIs can increase anxiety, but the mechanisms involved are unclear. Here we show that, rather than enhancing SSRI benefits, adulthood knockout (KO) of the 5-HT1A autoreceptor, a critical negative regulator of 5-HT activity, results in an SSRI-induced anxiety effect that appears to involve a hyperactivation of the 5-HT system in certain brain areas. Thus, subjects with very low levels of 5-HT1A autoreceptors, such as during childhood or adolescence, may be at risk for an SSRI-induced anxiety response.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Central nervous system pathology in multiple sclerosis includes both focal inflammatory perivascular injury and injury to superficial structures, including the subpial region of the cortex, which reportedly exhibits a gradient of damage from the surface inward. We assessed how early in the multiple sclerosis course a "surface‐in" process of injury suggesting progressive biology may begin.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We focused on the thalamus, which notably has both a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) interface and a white matter interface. Thalamic volume trajectories were assessed in a prospectively followed cohort of children from initial presentation with either multiple sclerosis or monophasic acquired demyelination, and healthy controls. Voxelwise volume changes were calculated using deformation‐based morphometry, and analyzed in relation to distance from the CSF interface by mixed effects modeling and semiparametric smoothing methods.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Twenty‐seven children with multiple sclerosis and 73 children with monophasic demyelination were prospectively followed with yearly brain scans (mean follow‐up = 4.6 years, standard deviation = 1.9). A total of 282 healthy children with serial scans were included as controls. Relative to healthy controls, children with multiple sclerosis and children with monophasic demyelination demonstrated volume loss in thalamic regions adjacent to the white matter. However, only children with multiple sclerosis exhibited an additional surface‐in gradient of thalamic injury on the ventricular side, which was already notable in the first year of clinical disease (asymptote estimate = 3.01, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.44–4.58, <i>p</i> = 0.0002) and worsened over time (asymptote:time estimate = 0.33, 95% CI = 0.12–0.54, <i>p</i> = 0.0021).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results suggest that a multiple sclerosis disease‐specific surface‐in process of damage can manifest at the earliest stages of the disease. Ann Neurol 2019;00:1–12</p>

<p>A major tenet in theoretical neuroscience is that cognitive and behavioral
processes are ultimately implemented in terms of the neural system dynamics.
Accordingly, a major aim for the analysis of neurophysiological measurements
should lie in the identification of the computational dynamics underlying task
processing. Here we advance a state space model (SSM) based on generative
piecewise-linear recurrent neural networks (PLRNN) to assess dynamics from
neuroimaging data. In contrast to many other nonlinear time series models which
have been proposed for reconstructing latent dynamics, our model is easily
interpretable in neural terms, amenable to systematic dynamical systems
analysis of the resulting set of equations, and can straightforwardly be
transformed into an equivalent continuous-time dynamical system. The major
contributions of this paper are the introduction of a new observation model
suitable for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) coupled to the latent
PLRNN, an efficient stepwise training procedure that forces the latent model to
capture the 'true' underlying dynamics rather than just fitting (or predicting)
the observations, and of an empirical measure based on the Kullback-Leibler
divergence to evaluate from empirical time series how well this goal of
approximating the underlying dynamics has been achieved. We validate and
illustrate the power of our approach on simulated 'ground-truth' dynamical
(benchmark) systems as well as on actual experimental fMRI time series. Given
that fMRI is one of the most common techniques for measuring brain activity
non-invasively in human subjects, this approach may provide a novel step toward
analyzing aberrant (nonlinear) dynamics for clinical assessment or
neuroscientific research.

<p>We show that \emph{stochastic bursting} is observed in a ring of
unidirectional delay-coupled noisy excitable systems, thanks to the
combinational action of time-delayed coupling and noise. Under the
approximation of timescale separation, i.e., when the time delays in each
connection are much larger than the characteristic duration of the spikes, the
observed rather coherent spike pattern can be described by idealized coupled
point processes with a leader-follower relationship. We derive analytically the
statistics of the spikes in each unit, pairwise correlations between any two
units, and the spectrum of the total output from the network. Theory is in a
good agreement with the simulations with a network of theta-neurons.

<p>Network inference algorithms are valuable tools for the study of large-scale
neuroimaging datasets. Multivariate transfer entropy is well suited for this
task, being a model-free measure that captures nonlinear and lagged
dependencies between time series to infer a minimal directed network model.
Greedy algorithms have been proposed to efficiently deal with high-dimensional
datasets while avoiding redundant inferences and capturing synergistic effects.
However, multiple statistical comparisons may inflate the false positive rate
and are computationally demanding, which limited the size of previous
validation studies. The algorithm we present---as implemented in the IDTxl
open-source software---addresses these challenges by employing hierarchical
statistical tests to control the family-wise error rate and to allow for
efficient parallelisation. The method was validated on synthetic datasets
involving random networks of increasing size (up to 100 nodes), for both linear
and nonlinear dynamics. The performance increased with the length of the time
series, reaching consistently high precision, recall, and specificity (&gt;98% on
average) for 10000 time samples. Varying the statistical significance threshold
showed a more favourable precision-recall trade-off for longer time series.
Both the network size and the sample size are one order of magnitude larger
than previously demonstrated, showing feasibility for typical EEG and MEG
experiments.

<p>by Daniel Rüdiger, Sascha Young Kupke, Tanja Laske, Pawel Zmora, Udo Reichl</p>

Influenza A viruses (IAV) are commonly used to infect animal cell cultures for research purposes and vaccine production. Their replication is influenced strongly by the multiplicity of infection (MOI), which ranges over several orders of magnitude depending on the respective application. So far, mathematical models of IAV replication have paid little attention to the impact of the MOI on infection dynamics and virus yields. To address this issue, we extended an existing model of IAV replication in adherent MDCK cells with kinetics that explicitly consider the time point of cell infection. This modification does not only enable the fitting of high MOI measurements, but also the successful prediction of viral release dynamics of low MOI experiments using the same set of parameters. Furthermore, this model allows the investigation of defective interfering particle (DIP) propagation in different MOI regimes. The key difference between high and low MOI conditions is the percentage of infectious virions among the total virus particle release. Simulation studies show that DIP interference at a high MOI is determined exclusively by the DIP content of the seed virus while, in low MOI conditions, it is predominantly controlled by the <i>de novo</i> generation of DIPs. Overall, the extended model provides an ideal framework for the prediction and optimization of cell culture-derived IAV manufacturing and the production of DIPs for therapeutic use.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/NatcusQY3NQ" width="1" />

<p>by Hongyu Zhou, Zheng Dong, Gennady Verkhivker, Brian D. Zoltowski, Peng Tao</p>

The fungal circadian clock photoreceptor Vivid (VVD) contains a photosensitive allosteric light, oxygen, voltage (LOV) domain that undergoes a large N-terminal conformational change. The mechanism by which a blue-light driven covalent bond formation leads to a global conformational change remains unclear, which hinders the further development of VVD as an optogenetic tool. We answered this question through a novel computational platform integrating Markov state models, machine learning methods, and newly developed community analysis algorithms. Applying this new integrative approach, we provided a quantitative evaluation of the contribution from the covalent bond to the protein global conformational change, and proposed an atomistic allosteric mechanism leading to the discovery of the unexpected importance of A’α/Aβ and previously overlooked Eα/Fα loops in the conformational change. This approach could be applicable to other allosteric proteins in general to provide interpretable atomistic representations of their otherwise elusive allosteric mechanisms.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/RJ65cTk-XxE" width="1" />

<p>by Koichiro Uriu, Hajime Tei</p>

Negative feedback loops (NFLs) for circadian clocks include light-responsive reactions that allow the clocks to shift their phase depending on the timing of light signals. Phase response curves (PRCs) for light signals in various organisms include a time interval called a dead zone where light signals cause no phase shift during daytime. Although the importance of the dead zone for robust light entrainment is known, how the dead zone arises from the biochemical reactions in an NFL underlying circadian gene expression rhythms remains unclear. In addition, the observation that the light-responsive reactions in the NFL vary between organisms raises the question as to whether the mechanism for dead zone formation is common or distinct between different organisms. Here we reveal by mathematical modeling that the saturation of a biochemical reaction in repressor synthesis in an NFL is a common mechanism of daytime dead zone generation. If light signals increase the degradation of a repressor protein, as in <i>Drosophila</i>, the saturation of repressor mRNA transcription nullifies the effect of light signals, generating a dead zone. In contrast, if light signals induce the transcription of repressor mRNA, as in mammals, the saturation of repressor translation can generate a dead zone by cancelling the influence of excess amount of mRNA induced by light signals. Each of these saturated reactions is located next to the light-responsive reaction in the NFL, suggesting a design principle for daytime dead zone generation.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/fl8k8W5KC3g" width="1" />

<p>by Muhammad Ali Al-Radhawi, Domitilla Del Vecchio, Eduardo D. Sontag</p>

Phenotypical variability in the absence of genetic variation often reflects complex energetic landscapes associated with underlying gene regulatory networks (GRNs). In this view, different phenotypes are associated with alternative states of complex nonlinear systems: stable attractors in deterministic models or modes of stationary distributions in stochastic descriptions. We provide theoretical and practical characterizations of these landscapes, specifically focusing on stochastic Slow Promoter Kinetics (SPK), a time scale relevant when transcription factor binding and unbinding are affected by epigenetic processes like DNA methylation and chromatin remodeling. In this case, largely unexplored except for numerical simulations, adiabatic approximations of promoter kinetics are not appropriate. In contrast to the existing literature, we provide rigorous analytic characterizations of multiple modes. A general formal approach gives insight into the influence of parameters and the prediction of how changes in GRN wiring, for example through mutations or artificial interventions, impact the possible number, location, and likelihood of alternative states. We adapt tools from the mathematical field of singular perturbation theory to represent stationary distributions of Chemical Master Equations for GRNs as mixtures of Poisson distributions and obtain explicit formulas for the locations and probabilities of metastable states as a function of the parameters describing the system. As illustrations, the theory is used to tease out the role of cooperative binding in stochastic models in comparison to deterministic models, and applications are given to various model systems, such as toggle switches in isolation or in communicating populations, a synthetic oscillator, and a trans-differentiation network.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/iXjE6wxdvww" width="1" />

Recent advances in next-generation sequencing and computational technologies have enabled routine analysis of large-scale single-cell ribonucleic acid sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. However, scRNA-seq technologies have suffered from several technical challenges, including low mean expression levels in most genes and higher frequencies of missing data than bulk population sequencing technologies. Identifying functional gene sets and their regulatory networks that link specific cell types to human diseases and therapeutics from scRNA-seq profiles are daunting tasks. In this study, we developed a Component Overlapping Attribute Clustering (COAC) algorithm to perform the localized (subpopulation) gene co-expression network analysis from large-scale scRNA-seq profiles. Gene subnetworks that represent specific gene co-expression patterns are inferred from the components of a decomposed matrix of scRNA-seq profiles. We showed that single-cell gene subnetworks identified by COAC from multiple time points within cell phases can be used for cell type identification with high accuracy (83%). In addition, COAC-inferred subnetworks from melanoma patients’ scRNA-seq profiles are highly correlated with survival rate from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Moreover, the localized gene subnetworks identified by COAC from individual patients’ scRNA-seq data can be used as pharmacogenomics biomarkers to predict drug responses (The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves ranges from 0.728 to 0.783) in cancer cell lines from the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) database. In summary, COAC offers a powerful tool to identify potential network-based diagnostic and pharmacogenomics biomarkers from large-scale scRNA-seq profiles.

<p>by Masayuki Maeda, Hideaki Yamashita</p>

The presence of treatment-resistant cells is an important factor that limits the efficacy of cancer therapy, and the prospect of resistance is considered the major cause of the treatment strategy. Several recent studies have employed mathematical models to elucidate the dynamics of generating resistant cancer cells and attempted to predict the probability of emerging resistant cells. The purpose of this paper is to present numerical approach to compute the number of resistant cells and the emerging probability of resistance. Stochastic model was designed and developed a method to approximately but efficiently compute the number of resistant cells and the probability of resistance. To model the progression of cancer, a discrete-state, two-dimensional Markov process whose states are the total number of cells and the number of resistant cells was employed. Then exact analysis and approximate aggregation approaches were proposed to calculate the number of resistant cells and the probability of resistance when the cell population reaches detection size. To confirm the accuracy of computed results of approximation, relative errors between exact analysis and approximation were computed. The numerical values of our approximation method were very close to those of exact analysis calculated in the range of small detection size M = 500, 100, and 1500. Then computer simulation was performed to confirm the accuracy of computed results of approximation when the detection size was M = 10000,30000,50000,100000 and 1000000. All the numerical results of approximation fell between the upper level and the lower level of 95% confidential intervals and our method took less time to compute over a broad range of cell size. The effects of parameter change on emerging probabilities of resistance were also investigated by computed values using approximation method. The results showed that the number of divisions until the cell population reached the detection size is important for emerging the probability of resistance. The next step of numerical approach is to compute the emerging probabilities of resistance under drug administration and with multiple mutation. Another effective approximation would be necessary for the analysis of the latter case.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/aiyrMkQ6Zrc" width="1" />

<p>by Ivar Grytten, Knut D. Rand, Alexander J. Nederbragt, Geir O. Storvik, Ingrid K. Glad, Geir K. Sandve</p>

Graph-based representations are considered to be the future for reference genomes, as they allow integrated representation of the steadily increasing data on individual variation. Currently available tools allow <i>de novo</i> assembly of graph-based reference genomes, alignment of new read sets to the graph representation as well as certain analyses like variant calling and haplotyping. We here present a first method for calling ChIP-Seq peaks on read data aligned to a graph-based reference genome. The method is a graph generalization of the peak caller MACS2, and is implemented in an open source tool, <i>Graph Peak Caller</i>. By using the existing tool <i>vg</i> to build a pan-genome of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, we validate our approach by showing that Graph Peak Caller with a pan-genome reference graph can trace variants within peaks that are not part of the linear reference genome, and find peaks that in general are more motif-enriched than those found by MACS2.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/5eBzGrN_ang" width="1" />

Rare variants are of increasing interest to genetic association studies because of their etiological contributions to human complex diseases. Due to the rarity of the mutant events, rare variants are routinely analyzed on an aggregate level. While aggregation analyses improve the detection of global-level signal, they are not able to pinpoint causal variants within a variant set. To perform inference on a localized level, additional information, e.g., biological annotation, is often needed to boost the information content of a rare variant. Following the observation that important variants are likely to cluster together on functional domains, we propose a protein structure guided local test (POINT) to provide variant-specific association information using structure-guided aggregation of signal. Constructed under a kernel machine framework, POINT performs local association testing by borrowing information from neighboring variants in the 3-dimensional protein space in a data-adaptive fashion. Besides merely providing a list of promising variants, POINT assigns each variant a p-value to permit variant ranking and prioritization. We assess the selection performance of POINT using simulations and illustrate how it can be used to prioritize individual rare variants in <i>PCSK9, ANGPTL4</i> and <i>CETP</i> in the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) clinical trial data.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/LIYyATJn8_E" width="1" />

Enjoying music reliably ranks among life’s greatest pleasures.

The human pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis encodes a proteasome that carries out regulated degradation of bacterial proteins. It has been proposed that the proteasome contributes to nitrogen metabolism in M. tuberculosis, although this hypothesis had not been tested. Upon assessing M. tuberculosis growth in several nitrogen sources, we found that a...<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/V98O9DLolWo" width="1" />

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Trials of B vitamin therapy to lower blood total homocysteine (tHcy) levels for prevention of stroke are inconclusive. Secondary analyses of trial data and epidemiologic studies suggest that tHcy levels may be particularly associated with small vessel stroke (SVS). We assessed whether circulating tHcy and B vitamin levels are selectively associated with SVS, but not other stroke subtypes, using Mendelian randomization.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used summary statistics data for single‐nucleotide polymorphisms associated with tHcy (n=18), folate (n=3), vitamin B<sub>6</sub> (n=1), and vitamin B<sub>12</sub> (n=14) levels, and the corresponding data for stroke from the MEGASTROKE consortium (n=16 952 subtyped ischemic stroke cases and 404 630 non‐cases).</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Genetically predicted tHcy was associated with SVS, with an odds ratio of 1.34 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.13‐1.58, <i>P</i>=6.7×10<sup>‐4</sup>) per 1 SD increase in genetically predicted tHcy levels, but was not associated with large artery or cardioembolic stroke. The association was mainly driven by single‐nucleotide polymorphisms at or near the <i>MTHFR</i> and <i>MUT</i> genes. The odds ratios of SVS per 1 SD increase in genetically predicted folate and vitamin B<sub>6</sub> levels were 0.49 (95% 0.34‐0.71, <i>p</i>=1.3×10<sup>‐4</sup>) and 0.70 (95% 0.52‐0.94, <i>p</i>=0.02), respectively. Genetically higher vitamin B<sub>12</sub> levels were not associated with any stroke subtype.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These findings suggest that any effect of homocysteine‐lowering treatment in preventing stroke will be confined to the SVS subtype. Whether genetic variants at or near the <i>MTHFR</i> and <i>MUT</i> genes influence SVS risk through pathways other than homocysteine levels and downstream effects require further investigation.</p>

Abstract<p>Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by the repeated rise of concerns (obsessions) and repetitive unwanted behavior (compulsions). Although selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) is the first-choice drug, response rates to SSRI treatment vary between symptom dimensions. In this study, to find a therapeutic target for SSRI-resilient OCD symptoms, we evaluated treatment responses of quinpirole sensitization-induced OCD-related behaviors in mice. SSRI administration rescued the cognitive inflexibility, as well as hyperactivity in the lateral orbitofrontal cortex (lOFC), while no improvement was observed for the repetitive behavior. D<sub>2</sub> receptor signaling in the central striatum (CS) was involved in SSRI-resistant repetitive behavior. An adenosine A<sub>2A</sub> antagonist, istradefylline, which rescued abnormal excitatory synaptic function in the CS indirect pathway medium spiny neurons of sensitized mice, alleviated both of the QNP-induced abnormal behaviors with only short-term administration. These results provide a new insight into therapeutic strategies for SSRI-resistant OCD symptoms and indicate the potential of A<sub>2A</sub> antagonists as a rapid-acting anti-OCD drug.</p><p><b>Significance statement</b> Clinical studies show distinct therapeutic efficacies for SSRIs between subtypes of OCD symptoms. While abnormal activity in the cortico-striatal pathway is critically involved in the pathophysiology of OCD, the neurological mechanisms and therapeutic strategies for SSRI-resistant symptoms remain unclear. In this study, we showed that repeated injection of dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptor agonist, quinpirole elicited two distinct OCD-related behaviors; cognitive inflexibility (SSRI-responsive) and repetitive behavior (SSRI-resistant). While SSRI treatment normalized hyperactivity of the orbitofrontal cortex, we also demonstrated the imbalanced excitatory inputs in the central striatum of quinpirole-treated mice and the therapeutic potential of an A<sub>2A</sub> antagonist as a modulator of indirect pathway medium spiny neurons (MSNs).</p>

<p>Grid cells in the entorhinal cortex, together with place, speed and border
cells, are major contributors to the organization of spatial representations in
the brain. In this contribution we introduce a novel theoretical and
algorithmic framework able to explain the emergence of hexagonal grid-like
response patterns from the statistics of the input stimuli. We show that this
pattern is a result of minimal variance encoding of neurons. The novelty lies
into the formulation of the encoding problem through the modern Frame Theory
language, specifically that of equiangular Frames, providing new insights about
the optimality of hexagonal grid receptive fields. The model proposed overcomes
some crucial limitations of the current attractor and oscillatory models. It is
based on the well-accepted and tested hypothesis of Hebbian learning, providing
a simplified cortical-based framework that does not require the presence of
theta velocity-driven oscillations (oscillatory model) or translational
symmetries in the synaptic connections (attractor model). We moreover
demonstrate that the proposed encoding mechanism naturally maps shifts,
rotations and scaling of the stimuli onto the shape of grid cells' receptive
fields, giving a straightforward explanation of the experimental evidence of
grid cells remapping under transformations of environmental cues.

Over a billion people worldwide are affected by vitamin D deficiency. Although vitamin D deficiency is associated with impaired cognition, the mechanisms mediating this link are poorly understood. The extracellular matrix (ECM) has now emerged as an important participant of synaptic plasticity and a new hypothesis is that vitamin D may interact with aggregates of the ECM, perineuronal nets (PNNs), to regulate brain plasticity. Dysregulation of PNNs caused by vitamin D deficiency may contribute to the presentation of cognitive deficits.

From an evolutionary perspective, the genes of enteric microbes transmitted reliably across generations are nearly as much a part of the human organism as our own genes. Disruption of the microbiome leading to extinction of key ‘heirloom’ taxa can deprive individuals of metabolic pathways that have been present in their ancestors for millennia. Some of these pathways support essential synthesis and toxin clearance processes, including the generation of blood–brain barrier-crossing metabolic products crucial for normal brain function.

Gene mutations associated with painless phenotypes offer great insight for analgesic development. Using a multi-modal approach, McDermott et al. show that mutations in the voltage-gated sodium channel NaV1.7 cause congenital insensitivity to pain due to a lack of functional nociceptors.

Darmohray et al. describe a rapid form of cerebellum-dependent locomotor learning in mice that appears to be highly conserved across vertebrates. Cell-type-specific chemogenetics combined with quantitative behavioral analysis reveals that mechanisms for spatial and temporal components of learning are dissociable on the circuit level.

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25428?af=R">The blood pressure paradox in acute ischemic stroke</a></h4>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To explore the association of poststroke baseline blood pressure with cerebral collateral flow and functional outcome in acute ischemic patients with large vessel occlusion/stenosis.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Patients identified with large vessel occlusion/stenosis with baseline multimodal computed tomography, follow‐up imaging, and complete clinical profiles were included. A 90‐day modified Rankin Scale of 0–1 was defined as an excellent functional outcome. Cerebral collateral flow was quantified by the volume ratio of tissue within the delay time &gt;3 seconds perfusion lesion with severely delayed contrast transit (delay time &gt;3 seconds/delay time &gt;6 seconds).</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>There were 306 patients included in this study. With every increase of 10 mmHg in baseline systolic blood pressure, the odds of achieving an excellent functional outcome decreased by 12% in multivariate analysis (odds ratio = 0.88, <i>p</i> = 0.048). Conversely, increased baseline blood pressure was associated with better collateral flow. In subgroup analysis of patients with major reperfusion, higher blood pressure was associated with decreased infarct growth and a better clinical outcome, and vice versa in patients without reperfusion.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Higher baseline blood pressure in acute ischemic stroke patients with large vessel occlusion/stenosis was associated with better collateral flow. However, for patients without reperfusion, higher baseline blood pressure was associated with increased infarct growth, leading to an unfavorable clinical outcome. The relationship between blood pressure and outcomes is highly dependent on reperfusion, and active blood pressure–lowering treatment may be inappropriate in acute ischemic stroke patients prior to reperfusion treatment.

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>We recently reported successful treatment of a child with febrile infection‐related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES), a subtype of new‐onset refractory status epilepticus (NORSE), with the recombinant interleukin‐1 (IL1) receptor antagonist (IL1RA) anakinra. On this basis, we tested whether endogenous IL1RA production or function is deficient in FIRES patients.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Levels of IL1β and IL1RA were measured in serum and CSF. The inhibitory activity of endogenous IL1RA was assessed using a cell‐based reporter assay. <i>IL1RN</i> gene variants were identified by sequencing. Expression levels for the secreted and intracellular isoforms of IL1RA were measured in patient and control cells by real‐time polymerase chain reaction.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Levels of endogenous IL1RA and IL1β were elevated in the serum and CSF of patients with FIRES (n=7) relative to healthy controls (n=10). Serum from FIRES patients drove IL1R signaling activity and potentiated IL1R signaling in response to exogenous IL1β in a cell‐based reporter assay. Functional assessment of endogenous IL1RA activity in three FIRES patients revealed attenuated inhibition of IL1R signaling. Sequencing of <i>IL1RN</i> in our index patient revealed multiple variants. This was accompanied by reduced expression of intracellular but not secreted isoforms of IL1RA in the patient's peripheral blood mononuclear cells.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings suggest that FIRES is associated with reduced expression of intracellular IL1RA isoforms and a functional deficiency in IL1RA inhibitory activity. These observations may provide insight into disease pathogenesis for FIRES and other inflammatory seizure disorders and may provide a valuable biomarker for therapeutic decision‐making.</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To elucidate the biophysical basis underlying the distinct and severe clinical presentation in patients with the recurrent missense <i>SCN1A</i> variant, p.Thr226Met. Patients with this variant show a well‐defined genotype‐phenotype correlation and present with developmental and early‐infantile epileptic encephalopathy that is far more severe than the typical <i>SCN1A</i> Dravet syndrome.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Whole cell patch clamp and dynamic action potential clamp were used to study T226M Na<sub>v</sub>1.1 channels expressed in mammalian cells. Computational modeling was used to explore the neuronal scale mechanisms that account for altered action potential firing.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>T226M channels exhibited hyperpolarizing shifts of the activation and inactivation curves and enhanced fast inactivation. Dynamic action potential clamp hybrid simulation showed that model neurons containing T226M conductance displayed a left shift in rheobase relative to control. At current stimulation levels that produced repetitive active potential firing in control model neurons, depolarization block and cessation of action potential firing occurred in T226M model neuron. Fully computationally simulated neuron models recapitulated the findings from dynamic action potential clamp and also showed that heterozygous T226M models were also more susceptible to depolarization block.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>From a biophysical perspective the T226M mutation produces gain‐of‐function. Somewhat paradoxically our data suggest that this gain‐of‐function would cause interneurons to more readily develop depolarization block. This “functional dominant negative” interaction would produce a more profound disinhibition than seen with haploinsufficiency that is typical of Dravet syndrome and could readily explain the more severe phenotype of patients with T226M mutation.</p>

Adler et al. reveal mechanisms underlying learning-dependent sequential activation of pyramidal neurons in the primary motor cortex. SST-expressing interneurons and CaMKII-dependent synaptic plasticity control the establishment of sequential activity during motor training and prevent the interference from new learning.

<p>by Ardi Tampuu, Tambet Matiisen, H. Freyja Ólafsdóttir, Caswell Barry, Raul Vicente</p>

Place cells in the mammalian hippocampus signal self-location with sparse spatially stable firing fields. Based on observation of place cell activity it is possible to accurately decode an animal’s location. The precision of this decoding sets a lower bound for the amount of information that the hippocampal population conveys about the location of the animal. In this work we use a novel recurrent neural network (RNN) decoder to infer the location of freely moving rats from single unit hippocampal recordings. RNNs are biologically plausible models of neural circuits that learn to incorporate relevant temporal context without the need to make complicated assumptions about the use of prior information to predict the current state. When decoding animal position from spike counts in 1D and 2D-environments, we show that the RNN consistently outperforms a standard Bayesian approach with either flat priors or with memory. In addition, we also conducted a set of sensitivity analysis on the RNN decoder to determine which neurons and sections of firing fields were the most influential. We found that the application of RNNs to neural data allowed flexible integration of temporal context, yielding improved accuracy relative to the more commonly used Bayesian approaches and opens new avenues for exploration of the neural code.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/lLRmD88blGo" width="1" />

<p>by Nico M. Franz, Lukas J. Musher, Joseph W. Brown, Shizhuo Yu, Bertram Ludäscher</p>

Phylogenomic research is accelerating the publication of landmark studies that aim to resolve deep divergences of major organismal groups. Meanwhile, systems for identifying and integrating the products of phylogenomic inference–such as newly supported clade concepts–have not kept pace. However, the ability to <i>verbalize</i> node concept congruence and conflict across multiple, in effect simultaneously endorsed phylogenomic hypotheses, is a prerequisite for building synthetic data environments for biological systematics and other domains impacted by these conflicting inferences. Here we develop a novel solution to the conflict verbalization challenge, based on a logic representation and reasoning approach that utilizes the language of Region Connection Calculus (RCC–5) to produce consistent <i>alignments</i> of node concepts endorsed by incongruent phylogenomic studies. The approach employs clade concept labels to individuate concepts used by each source, even if these carry identical names. Indirect RCC–5 modeling of <i>intensional</i> (property-based) node concept definitions, facilitated by the local relaxation of coverage constraints, allows parent concepts to attain congruence in spite of their differentially sampled children. To demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, we align two recent phylogenomic reconstructions of higher-level avian groups that entail strong conflict in the "neoavian explosion" region. According to our representations, this conflict is constituted by 26 instances of input "whole concept" overlap. These instances are further resolvable in the output labeling schemes and visualizations as "split concepts", which provide the labels and relations needed to build truly synthetic phylogenomic data environments. Because the RCC–5 alignments fundamentally reflect the trained, logic-enabled judgments of systematic experts, future designs for such environments need to promote a culture where experts routinely assess the intensionalities of node concepts published by our peers–even and especially when we are not in agreement with each other.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/UeKsJptfnwM" width="1" />

Recent analyses of MDGA–neuroligin complexes revealed the structural basis of this activity and indicate that MDGAs interact with all neuroligins with differential affinities. Surprisingly, analyses of mouse mutants revealed a functional divergence, with targeted mutation of <em>Mdga1</em> and <em>Mdga2</em> elevating inhibitory and excitatory synapses, respectively, on hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Further research is needed to determine the synapse-specific organizing properties of MDGAs in neural circuits, which may depend on relative levels and subcellular distributions of each MDGA, neuroligin and neurexin.

Abstract
<p>Large-scale slow oscillations allow the integration of neuronal activity across brain regions during sensory or cognitive processing. However, evidence that this form of coding also holds for pathological networks, such as for distributed networks in epileptic disorders, does not yet exist. Here, we show in a mouse model of unilateral hippocampal epilepsy that epileptic fast ripples generated in the neocortex distant from the primary focus occur during transient trains of interictal epileptic discharges. During these epileptic paroxysms, local phase-locking of neuronal firing and a phase–amplitude coupling of the epileptic discharges over a slow oscillation at 3–5 Hz are detected. Furthermore, the buildup of the slow oscillation begins in the bihippocampal network that includes the focus, which synchronizes and drives the activity across the large-scale epileptic network into the frontal cortex. This study provides the first functional description of the emergence of neocortical fast ripples in hippocampal epilepsy and shows that cross-frequency coupling might be a fundamental mechanism underlying the spreading of epileptic activity.</p>

Abstract
<p>Learning to read specializes a portion of the left mid-fusiform cortex for printed word recognition, the putative visual word form area (VWFA). This study examined whether a VWFA specialized for English is sufficiently malleable to support learning a perceptually atypical second writing system. The study utilized an artificial orthography, HouseFont, in which house images represent English phonemes. House images elicit category-biased activation in a spatially distinct brain region, the so-called parahippocampal place area (PPA). Using house images as letters made it possible to test whether the capacity for learning a second writing system involves neural territory that supports reading in the first writing system, or neural territory tuned for the visual features of the new orthography. Twelve human adults completed two weeks of training to establish basic HouseFont reading proficiency and underwent functional neuroimaging pre and post-training. Analysis of three functionally defined regions of interest (ROIs), the VWFA, and left and right PPA, found significant pre-training versus post-training increases in response to HouseFont words only in the VWFA. Analysis of the relationship between the behavioral and neural data found that activation changes from pre-training to post-training within the VWFA predicted HouseFont reading speed. These results demonstrate that learning a new orthography utilizes neural territory previously specialized by the acquisition of a native writing system. Further, they suggest VWFA engagement is driven by orthographic functionality and not the visual characteristics of graphemes, which informs the broader debate about the nature of category-specialized areas in visual association cortex.</p>

Abstract
<p>The membrane guanylate cyclase, ROS-GC, that synthesizes cyclic GMP for use as a second messenger for visual transduction in retinal rods and cones, is stimulated by bicarbonate. Bicarbonate acts directly on ROS-GC1, because it enhanced the enzymatic activity of a purified, recombinant fragment of bovine ROS-GC1 consisting solely of the core catalytic domain. Moreover, recombinant ROS-GC1 proved to be a true sensor of bicarbonate, rather than a sensor for CO<sub>2</sub>. Access to bicarbonate differed in rods and cones of larval salamander, <i>Ambystoma tigrinum</i>, of unknown sex. In rods, bicarbonate entered at the synapse and diffused to the outer segment, where it was removed by Cl<sup>-</sup>-dependent exchange. In contrast, cones generated bicarbonate internally from endogenous CO<sub>2</sub> or from exogenous CO<sub>2</sub> that was present in extracellular solutions of bicarbonate. Bicarbonate production from both sources of CO<sub>2</sub> was blocked by the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, acetazolamide. Carbonic anhydrase II expression was verified immunohistochemically in cones but not in rods. In addition, cones acquired bicarbonate at their outer segments as well as at their inner segments. The multiple pathways for access in cones may support greater uptake of bicarbonate than in rods and buffer changes in its intracellular concentration.</p>

<p>Ferroptotic death is a mechanism for tumor suppression by pharmacological inhibitors that target the X<sub>c</sub>  <sup>–</sup> transporter (cystine/glutamate antiporter) in a host of non-CNS and CNS tumors. Inhibition of this transporter leads to reduction of cystine uptake, cyst(e)ine deprivation, subsequent depletion of the versatile antioxidant glutathione, and reactive lipid species-dependent death. Accordingly, pharmacological inhibitors of the X<sub>c</sub>  <sup>–</sup> transporter can also induce neuronal cell death raising concerns about toxicity in the CNS and PNS if these agents are used for chemotherapy. Here, we show that ferroptotic death induced by the canonical ferroptosis inducer erastin is similar in HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells and primary cortical neurons although cell death is mediated more potently in cancer cells. Reducing the toxicity of ferroptosis inducers will require, among other things, the identification of agents that protect neurons from ferroptosis but exacerbate it in tumor cells. Although we show that a number of agents known to block ferroptosis in primary mouse neurons also inhibit ferroptosis in fibrosarcoma cells, class I histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors selectively protect neurons while augmenting ferroptosis in cancer cells. Our results further suggest that cell death pathways induced by erastin in these two cell types are statistically identical to each other and identical to oxidative glutamate toxicity in neurons, where death is also mediated via inhibition of X<sub>c</sub><sup>–</sup> cystine transport. Together, these studies identify HDACs inhibitors as a novel class of agents to augment tumor suppression by ferroptosis induction and to minimize neuronal toxicity that could manifest as peripheral neuropathy or chemo brain.</p>

<p>Low-threshold mechanosensitive C fibers (C-LTMRs) that express the vesicular glutamate transporter VGLUT3 are thought to signal affective touch, and may also play a role in mechanical allodynia. However, the nature of the central termination of C-LTMRs in the dorsal horn remains largely unexplored. Here, we used light and electron microscopy in combination with VGLUT3 immunolabeling as a marker of C-LTMR terminations to investigate this issue. VGLUT3<sup>+</sup> C-LTMRs formed central terminals of Type II glomeruli in the inner part of lamina II of the dorsal horn, often establishing multiple asymmetric synapses with postsynaptic dendrites but also participating in synaptic configurations with presynaptic axons and dendrites. Unexpectedly, essentially all VGLUT3<sup>+</sup> C-LTMR terminals showed substantial VGLUT1 expression in the rat, whereas such terminals in mice lacked VGLUT1. Most VGLUT3<sup>+</sup> C-LTMR terminals exhibited weak-to-moderate VGLUT2 expression. Further, C-LTMR terminals formed numerous synapses with excitatory protein kinase C (PKC) interneurons and inhibitory parvalbumin neurons, whereas synapses with calretinin neurons were scarce. C-LTMR terminals rarely if ever established synapses with neurokinin 1 receptor (NK1R)-possessing dendrites traversing lamina II. Thus, VGLUT3<sup>+</sup> C-LTMR terminals appear to largely correspond to neurofilament-lacking central terminals of Type II glomeruli in inner lamina II and can thus be identified at the ultrastructural level by morphological criteria. The participation of C-LTMR terminals in Type II glomeruli involving diverse populations of interneuron indicates highly complex modes of integration of C-LTMR mediated signaling in the dorsal horn. Furthermore, differences in VGLUT1 expression indicate distinct species differences in synaptic physiology of C-LTMR terminals.</p>

Next-Generation Sequencing has made available substantial amounts of large-scale Omics data, providing unprecedented opportunities to understand complex biological systems. Specifically, the value of RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) data has been confirmed in inferring how gene regulatory systems will respond under various conditions (bulk data) or cell types (single-cell data). RNA-Seq can generate genome-scale gene expression profiles that can be further analyzed using correlation analysis, co-expression analysis, clustering, differential gene expression (DGE), among many other studies. While these analyses can provide invaluable information related to gene expression, integration and interpretation of the results can prove challenging. Here we present a tool called IRIS-EDA, which is a Shiny web server for expression data analysis. It provides a straightforward and user-friendly platform for performing numerous computational analyses on user-provided RNA-Seq or Single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) data. Specifically, three commonly used R packages (edgeR, DESeq2, and limma) are implemented in the DGE analysis with seven unique experimental design functionalities, including a user-specified design matrix option. Seven discovery-driven methods and tools (correlation analysis, heatmap, clustering, biclustering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Multidimensional Scaling (MDS), and t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)) are provided for gene expression exploration which is useful for designing experimental hypotheses and determining key factors for comprehensive DGE analysis. Furthermore, this platform integrates seven visualization tools in a highly interactive manner, for improved interpretation of the analyses. It is noteworthy that, for the first time, IRIS-EDA provides a framework to expedite submission of data and results to NCBI’s Gene Expression Omnibus following the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) Data Principles. IRIS-EDA is freely available at http://bmbl.sdstate.edu/IRIS/.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/XQ7EidTt2EQ" width="1" />

<p>by Giuseppe Passucci, Megan E. Brasch, James H. Henderson, Vasily Zaburdaev, M. Lisa Manning</p>

We seek to characterize the motility of mouse fibroblasts on 2D substrates. Utilizing automated tracking techniques, we find that cell trajectories are super-diffusive, where displacements scale faster than <i>t</i><sup>1/2</sup> in all directions. Two mechanisms have been proposed to explain such statistics in other cell types: run and tumble behavior with Lévy-distributed run times, and ensembles of cells with heterogeneous speed and rotational noise. We develop an automated toolkit that directly compares cell trajectories to the predictions of each model and demonstrate that ensemble-averaged quantities such as the mean-squared displacements and velocity autocorrelation functions are equally well-fit by either model. However, neither model correctly captures the short-timescale behavior quantified by the displacement probability distribution or the turning angle distribution. We develop a hybrid model that includes both run and tumble behavior and heterogeneous noise during the runs, which correctly matches the short-timescale behaviors and indicates that the run times are not Lévy distributed. The analysis tools developed here should be broadly useful for distinguishing between mechanisms for superdiffusivity in other cells types and environments.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/KIPDgR1gWNs" width="1" />

The dynamic nature of technological developments invites us to rethink the learning spaces. In this context, science education can be enriched by the contribution of new computational resources, making the educational process more up-to-date, challenging, and attractive. Bioinformatics is a key interdisciplinary field, contributing to the understanding of biological processes that is often underrated in secondary schools. As a useful resource in learning activities, bioinformatics could help in engaging students to integrate multiple fields of knowledge (logical-mathematical, biological, computational, etc.) and generate an enriched and long-lasting learning environment. Here, we report our recent project in which high school students learned basic concepts of programming applied to solving biological problems. The students were taught the Python syntax, and they coded simple tools to answer biological questions using resources at hand. Notably, these were built mostly on the students’ own smartphones, which proved to be capable, readily available, and relevant complementary tools for teaching. This project resulted in an empowering and inclusive experience that challenged differences in social background and technological accessibility.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/DU--q7uExMA" width="1" />

Abstract
<p>Estradiol potentiates behavioral sensitization to cocaine as well as self-administration of cocaine and other drugs of abuse in female rodents. Furthermore, stimulated dopamine (DA) in the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) is rapidly enhanced by estradiol, and it is hypothesized that this enhanced DA release mediates the more rapid escalation of drug taking seen in females, compared with males. The mechanisms mediating the effect of estradiol to enhance stimulated DA release were investigated in this study. Using <i>in vivo</i> microdialysis and high performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrochemical detection, we first examined the effect of estradiol on amphetamine-induced DA increase in the DLS of ovariectomized rats. We then tested whether the potentiation of this DA increase could be blocked by the estradiol receptor antagonist, ICI 182,780 (ICI), or an antagonist to the metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5 (mGlu5), 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)pyridine (MPEP). There is evidence that estradiol receptors collaborate with mGlu5 within caveoli in DLS and mGlu5 is hypothesized to mediate many of the effects of estradiol in the addiction processes in females. Our data show that estradiol enhances the DA response to amphetamine. Either ICI or MPEP prevented the effect of estradiol to enhance DA release. Importantly, our results also showed that neither ICI or MPEP alone is able to influence the DA response to amphetamine when estradiol is not administrated, suggesting that ICI and MPEP act via estradiol receptors. Together, our findings demonstrate that estradiol potentiates amphetamine-stimulated DA release in the DLS and this effect requires both estradiol receptors and mGlu5.</p>

Abstract<p>Increased expression of the <i>FK506-binding protein 5</i> (<i>FKBP5)</i> gene has been associated with a number of diseases, but most prominently in connection to psychiatric illnesses. Many of these psychiatric disorders present with dementia and other cognitive deficits, but a direct connection between these issues and alterations in <i>FKBP5</i> remains unclear. We generated a novel transgenic mouse to selectively overexpress <i>FKBP5,</i> which encodes the FKBP51 protein, in the corticolimbic system, which had no overt effects on gross body weight, motor ability, or general anxiety. Instead, we found that overexpression of FKBP51 impaired long-term depression as well as spatial reversal learning and memory, suggesting a role in glutamate receptor regulation. Indeed, FKBP51 altered the association of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) with AMPA receptors, which was accompanied by an accelerated rate of AMPA receptor. In this way, the chaperone system is critical in triage decisions for AMPA receptor trafficking. Imbalance in the chaperone system may manifest in impairments in both inhibitory learning and cognitive function. These findings uncover an unexpected and essential mechanism for learning and memory that is controlled by the psychiatric risk factor <i>FKBP5</i>.</p><p><b>Significance statement</b> Candidate studies have identified a link between <i>FKBP5</i> allelic variants and psychiatric disorders. Patients with these disorders often present with cognitive defects. <i>FKBP5</i> variants have been correlated to decreased hippocampal volume, but a direct connection between <i>FKBP5</i> and cognitive function has not been established. Here, we have found that mice with high levels of <i>FKBP5</i> have altered reversal learning and memory, which may be through direct regulation of neuronal activity by regulating AMPA receptors.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p><i>LRRK2</i> mutations, the most common genetic cause of Parkinson's disease (PD) display incomplete penetrance, indicating the importance of other genetic and environmental influences on disease pathogenesis in <i>LRRK2</i> mutation carriers. The present study investigates whether urate, an antioxidant, Nrf2 activator, and inverse risk factor for idiopathic PD, is one such candidate biomarker of PD risk modulation in pathogenic <i>LRRK2</i> mutation carriers.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Banked plasma samples or urate levels were obtained for three cohorts of age‐ and sex‐matched subjects with and without a known <i>LRRK2</i> mutation in PD and unaffected controls to conduct a pilot study of 192 subjects from the LRRK2 Cohort Consortium (LCC) and two validation studies of 380 additional subjects from the LCC and of 922 subjects from the Parkinson Progression Marker Initiative. Urate levels were compared by multiple regression between subjects with and without a PD diagnosis conditional on <i>LRRK2</i> status, controlling for age and sex.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Non‐manifesting <i>LRRK2</i> mutation carriers had significantly higher levels of urate than those who developed PD in each of the three independent cohorts. A meta‐analysis demonstrated an adjusted mean difference of 0.62 mg/dL (p&lt;0.001), with similar results for separate assessments of women (p&lt;0.02) and men (p&lt;0.001). A 2 mg/dL increment in urate concentration decreased the odds of having PD by more than 50% (OR = 0.48; p = 0.004).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These findings identify and substantiate urate as a biomarker of resistance to PD among <i>LRRK2</i> mutation carriers.</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>This study analyzed serum neurofilament light chains (NfL) in 2 European cohorts of 312 MS patients to investigate whether NfL are biomarkers of PML during natalizumab treatment. The cohort comprised 25 PML, 136 natalizumab‐treated, and 151 untreated MS patients. Patients subsequently developing PML had similar NfL to other natalizumab‐treated MS patients. At PML onset, NfL were 10‐fold higher than in the pre‐PML condition and in natalizumab‐treated or untreated MS patients, and NfL continued to increase until onset of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome. The results suggest that in natalizumab‐treated patients NfL may represent an early and accessible marker of PML.</p>

<p><b>Significance statement</b> Motor and reinforcement learning have been classically linked to functionally independent brain networks centered on the cerebellum and the basal ganglia respectively. In a recent study published in <i>eNeuro,</i> Therrien et al. (2018) showed that increasing motor noise in healthy subjects disrupts reinforcement learning. However, this impairment remained well below that detected in cerebellar patients even when motor noise in healthy subjects was adjusted to match that observed in the patients. This suggests that impaired reinforcement learning following cerebellar damage cannot be solely accounted for by altered motor noise in these patients. Based on recent anatomical and functional evidence, we argue that the cerebellum may directly contribute to reinforcement learning, consistent with its tight connections with the basal ganglia.</p>

Abstract<p>Parkinson’s disease (PD) is characterized by the gradual degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, leading to striatal dopamine depletion. A partial unilateral striatal 6-OHDA lesion causes 40 – 60% dopamine depletion in the lesioned rat striatum, modeling the early stage of PD. In this study, we explored the connectivity between the brain regions in partially 6-OHDA lesioned male Wistar rats under urethane anesthesia using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at 5 weeks after the 6-OHDA infusion. Under urethane anesthesia, the brain fluctuates between the two states, resembling rapid-eye-movement (REM) and non-REM (NREM) sleep states. We observed clear urethane-induced sleep-like states in 8/19 lesioned animals and 8/18 control animals. 6-OHDA lesioned animals exhibited significantly lower functional connectivity between the brain regions. However, we observed these differences only during the REM-like sleep state, suggesting the involvement of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway in REM sleep regulation. Corticocortical and corticostriatal connections were decreased in both hemispheres, reflecting the global effect of the lesion. Overall, this study describes a promising model to study PD-related sleep disorders in rats using fMRI.</p><p><b>Significance statement</b> Disturbances in sleep patterns and rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder are among the first symptoms of Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, PD-related sleep disorders have been virtually unexplored in animal models. This is a first study which has examined the functional connectivity (FC) during urethane-induced sleep-like states in the partial striatal 6-OHDA lesion rat model of early-stage PD using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We found that FC is significantly decreased in 6-OHDA lesioned animals, but only during the REM-like state. These changes affected both the lesioned and intact hemispheres, mostly involving corticocortical and corticostriatal connections. The results suggest that this rat model is a promising tool for studying sleep disturbances in early-stage Parkinson’s disease with resting-state fMRI.</p>

<p>Individuals with sleep apnea often exhibit changes in cognitive behaviors consistent with alterations in the hippocampus. It is hypothesized that adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus is an ongoing process that maintains normal hippocampal function in many mammalian species, including humans. However, the impact of chronic intermittent hypoxia (IH), a principal consequence of sleep apnea, on hippocampal adult neurogenesis remains unclear. Using a murine model, we examined the impact of 30 d of IH (IH<sub>30</sub>) on adult neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity in the dentate gyrus. Although IH<sub>30</sub> did not affect paired-pulse facilitation, IH<sub>30</sub> suppressed long-term potentiation (LTP). Immunohistochemical experiments also indicate that IH perturbs multiple aspects of adult neurogenesis. IH<sub>30</sub> increased the number of proliferating Sox2<sup>+</sup> neural progenitor cells in the subgranular zone yet reduced the number of doublecortin-positive neurons. Consistent with these findings, cell lineage tracing revealed that IH<sub>30</sub> increased the proportion of radial glial cells in the subgranular zone, yet decreased the proportion of adult-born neurons in the dentate gyrus. While administration of a superoxide anion scavenger during IH did not prevent neural progenitor cell proliferation, it mitigated the IH-dependent suppression of LTP and prevented adult-born neuron loss. These data demonstrate that IH causes both reactive oxygen species-dependent and reactive oxygen species-independent effects on adult neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity in the dentate gyrus. Our findings identify cellular and neurophysiological changes in the hippocampus that may contribute to cognitive and behavioral deficits occurring in sleep apnea.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Individuals with sleep apnea experience periods of intermittent hypoxia (IH) that can negatively impact many aspects of brain function. Neurons are continually generated throughout adulthood to support hippocampal physiology and behavior. This study demonstrates that IH exposure attenuates hippocampal long-term potentiation and reduces adult neurogenesis. Antioxidant treatment mitigates these effects indicating that oxidative signaling caused by IH is a significant factor that impairs synaptic plasticity and reduces adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus.</p>

<p>The 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) is a recurrent copy number variant with high penetrance for developmental neuropsychiatric disorders. Study of individuals with 22q11DS therefore may offer key insights into neural mechanisms underlying such complex illnesses. Resting-state functional connectivity MRI studies in idiopathic schizophrenia have consistently revealed disruption of thalamic and hippocampal circuitry. Here, we sought to test whether this circuitry is similarly disrupted in the context of this genetic high-risk condition. To this end, resting-state functional connectivity patterns were assessed in a sample of human youth with 22q11DS (<i>n</i> = 42; 59.5% female) and demographically matched healthy controls (<i>n</i> = 39; 53.8% female). Neuroimaging data were acquired via single-band protocols and analyzed in line with methods provided by the Human Connectome Project. We computed functional relationships between individual-specific anatomically defined thalamic and hippocampal seeds and all gray matter voxels in the brain. Whole-brain Type I error protection was achieved through nonparametric permutation-based methods. The 22q11DS patients displayed dissociable disruptions in thalamic and hippocampal functional connectivity relative to control subjects. Thalamocortical coupling was increased in somatomotor regions and reduced across associative networks. The opposite effect was observed for the hippocampus in regards to somatomotor and associative network connectivity. The thalamic and hippocampal dysconnectivity observed in 22q11DS suggests that high genetic risk for psychiatric illness is linked with disruptions in large-scale corticosubcortical networks underlying higher-order cognitive functions. These effects highlight the translational importance of large-effect copy number variants for informing mechanisms underlying neural disruptions observed in idiopathic developmental neuropsychiatric disorders.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Investigation of neuroimaging biomarkers in highly penetrant genetic syndromes represents a more biologically tractable approach to identify neural circuit disruptions underlying developmental neuropsychiatric conditions. The 22q11.2 deletion syndrome confers particularly high risk for psychotic disorders and is thus an important translational model in which to investigate systems-level mechanisms implicated in idiopathic illness. Here, we show resting-state fMRI evidence of large-scale sensory and executive network disruptions in youth with 22q11DS. In particular, this study provides the first evidence that these networks are disrupted in a dissociable fashion with regard to the functional connectivity of the thalamus and hippocampus, suggesting circuit-level dysfunction.</p>

<p>Emotionally evocative messages can be an effective way to change behavior, but the neural pathways that translate messages into effects on individuals and populations are not fully understood. We used a human functional neuroimaging approach to ask how affect-, value-, and regulation-related brain systems interact to predict effects of graphic anti-smoking messages for individual smokers (both males and females) and within a population-level messaging campaign. Results indicated that increased activity in the amygdala, a region involved in affective reactivity, predicted both personal quit intentions and population-level information-seeking and this was mediated by activity in ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), a region involved in computing an integrative value signal. Further, the predictive value of these regions was moderated by expression of a meta-analytically defined brain pattern indexing emotion regulation. That is, amygdala and vmPFC activity strongly tracked with population behavior only when participants showed low recruitment of this brain pattern, which consists of regions involved in goal-driven regulation of affective responses. Overall, these findings suggest that affective and value-related brain responses can predict the success of persuasive messages and that neural mechanisms of emotion regulation can shape these responses, moderating the extent to which they track with population-level message impact.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> People and organizations often appeal to our emotions to persuade us, but how these appeals engage the brain to drive behavior is not fully understood. We present an fMRI-based model that integrates affect-, control-, and value-related brain responses to predict the impact of graphic anti-smoking stimuli within a small group of smokers and a larger-scale public messaging campaign. This model indicated that amygdala activity predicted the impact of the anti-smoking messages, but that this relationship was mediated by ventromedial prefrontal cortex and moderated by expression of a distributed brain pattern associated with regulating emotion. These results suggest that neural mechanisms of emotion regulation can shape the extent to which affect and value-related brain responses track with population behavioral effects.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/7/1275?rss=1">Upregulation of Anandamide Hydrolysis in the Basolateral Complex of Amygdala Reduces Fear Memory Expression and Indices of Stress and Anxiety</a></h4>

<p>Increased anandamide (AEA) signaling through inhibition of its catabolic enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) in the basolateral complex of amygdala (BLA) is thought to buffer against the effects of stress and reduces behavioral signs of anxiety and fear. However, examining the role of AEA signaling in stress, anxiety, and fear through pharmacological depletion has been challenging due to the redundant complexity of its biosynthesis and the lack of a pharmacological synthesis inhibitor. We developed a herpes simplex viral vector to rapidly yet transiently overexpress FAAH specifically within the BLA to assess the impact of suppressing AEA signaling on stress, fear, and anxiety in male rats. Surprisingly, FAAH overexpression in BLA dampened stress-induced corticosterone release, reduced anxiety-like behaviors, and decreased conditioned fear expression. Interestingly, depleting AEA signaling in the BLA did not prevent fear conditioning itself or fear reinstatement. These effects were specific to the overexpression of FAAH because they were reversed by intra-BLA administration of an FAAH inhibitor. Moreover, the fear-suppressive effects of FAAH overexpression were also mitigated by intra-BLA administration of a low dose of a GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist, but not an NMDA/AMPA/kainate receptor antagonist, suggesting that they were mediated by an increase in GABAergic neurotransmission. Our data suggest that a permissive AEA tone within the BLA might gate GABA release and that loss of this tone through elevated AEA hydrolysis increases inhibition in the BLA, which in turn reduces stress, anxiety, and fear. These data provide new insights on the mechanisms by which amygdalar endocannabinoid signaling regulates emotional behavior.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Amygdala endocannabinoid signaling is involved in the regulation of stress, anxiety, and fear. Our data indicate that viral-mediated augmentation of anandamide hydrolysis within the basolateral amygdala reduces behavioral indices of stress, anxiety, and conditioned fear expression. These same effects have been previously documented with inhibition of anandamide hydrolysis in the same brain region. Our results indicate that the ability of anandamide signaling to regulate emotional behavior is nonlinear and may involve actions at distinct neuronal populations, which could be influenced by the basal level of anandamide. Modulation of anandamide signaling is a current clinical therapeutic target for stress-related psychiatric illnesses, so these data underscore the importance of fully understanding the mechanisms by which anandamide signaling regulates amygdala-dependent changes in emotionality.</p>

Myelin is a multilayer lipid membrane structure that wraps and insulates axons, allowing for the efficient propagation of action potentials. During developmental myelination of the central nervous system (CNS), oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) proliferate and migrate to their final destination, where they terminally differentiate into mature oligodendrocytes and myelinate axons. Lineage progression and terminal differentiation of oligodendrocyte lineage cells are under tight transcriptional and post-transcriptional control.

<p>Publication date: August 2019</p><p><b>Source:</b> Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 57</p><p>Author(s): Gladys Lima Caldeira, João Peça, Ana Luísa Carvalho</p><div><p>Growing evidence implicates synaptic proteins in the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), intellectual disability (ID) and schizophrenia. In fact, mutations in genes encoding synaptic proteins are enriched and overlap among different conditions highlighting the complex and pleiotropic nature of these disorders. In this review, we discuss recently described candidate genes that affect excitatory synapse function and result in changes in spine number and morphology. Spine pathology has been observed in several animal models of disease and in human brain post-mortem samples from ID, ASD, and schizophrenia patients. Recent data point to convergent mechanisms, such as dysregulation of the actin cytoskeleton and dysfunction of microglia synaptic remodeling, underlying dendritic spine dysgenesis. Interestingly, the reversion of important pathologic features, including spine abnormalities, has been observed in adult animal models of neuropsychiatric disorders, suggesting that therapies may not be restricted to a specific developmental window. Shedding light on the specific mechanisms impacted in neuropsychiatric disorders will undeniably contribute to the development of more directed and personalized therapies.</p></div>

In neurons and circuits, these molecules serve especially critical functions that ensure neural activity is maintained within appropriate physiological parameters. Their targets include synaptic proteins, ion channels, neurotransmitter receptors, and components of essential signaling cascades. Here, we discuss how several species of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) regulate intrinsic excitability and synaptic transmission, both during development and in mature circuits. Furthermore, we present the relationships between aberrant ncRNA expression and psychiatric disorders. The research presented here demonstrates how ncRNAs can be useful tools for elucidating fundamental neurobiology mechanisms and identifying the key molecular players.</p></div>

<p>Publication date: August 2019</p><p><b>Source:</b> Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 57</p><p>Author(s): Michael T Kelliher, Harriet AJ Saunders, Jill Wildonger</p><div><p>Neurons are exquisitely polarized cells whose structure and function relies on microtubules. Microtubules in signal-receiving dendrites and signal-sending axons differ in their organization and microtubule-associated proteins. These differences, coupled with microtubule post-translational modifications, combine to locally regulate intracellular transport, morphology, and function. Recent discoveries provide new insight into the regulation of non-centrosomal microtubule arrays in neurons, the relationship between microtubule acetylation and mechanosensation, and the spatial patterning of microtubules that regulates motor activity and cargo delivery in axons and dendrites. Together, these new studies bring us closer to understanding how microtubule function is locally tuned to match the specialized tasks associated with signal reception and transmission.</p></div>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>In real-life situations, the appearance of a person’s face can vary substantially across different encounters, making face recognition a challenging task for the visual system. Recent fMRI decoding studies have suggested that face recognition is supported by identity representations located in regions of the occipitotemporal cortex. Here, we used EEG to elucidate the temporal emergence of these representations. Human participants viewed a set of highly variable face images of 4 highly familiar celebrities (2 males and 2 females), while performing an orthogonal task. Univariate analyses of event-related EEG responses revealed a pronounced differentiation between male and female faces, but not between identities of the same sex. Using multivariate representational similarity analysis, we observed a gradual emergence of face identity representations, with an increasing degree of invariance. Face identity information emerged rapidly, starting shortly after 100 ms from stimulus onset, but was modulated by sex differences and image similarities. From 400 ms after onset and predominantly in the right hemisphere, identity representations showed 2 invariance properties: 1) they equally discriminated identities of opposite sexes and of the same sex, and 2) they were tolerant to image-based variations. These invariant representations may be a crucial prerequisite for successful face recognition in everyday situations, where the appearance of a familiar person can vary drastically.</span>

                <h4><a href="https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhz009/5308441?rss=1">Motivational Impairment is Accompanied by Corticoaccumbal Dysfunction in the BACHD-Tg5 Rat Model of Huntington’s Disease</a></h4>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as avolition, apathy, and anhedonia, precede the onset of debilitating motor symptoms in Huntington’s disease (HD), and their development may give insight into early disease progression and treatment. However, the neuronal and circuit mechanisms of premanifest HD pathophysiology are not well-understood. Here, using a transgenic rat model expressing the full-length human mutant HD gene, we find early and profound deficits in reward motivation in the absence of gross motor abnormalities. These deficits are accompanied by significant and progressive dysfunction in corticostriatal processing and communication among brain areas critical for reward-driven behavior. Together, our results define early corticostriatal dysfunction as a possible pathogenic contributor to psychiatric disturbances and may help identify potential pharmacotherapeutic targets for the treatment of HD.</span>
