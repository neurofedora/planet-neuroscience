              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Rate-distortion theory of neural coding and its implications for working memory</a></h4>

              
                Rate-distortion theory provides a powerful framework for understanding the nature of human memory by formalizing the relationship between information rate (the average number of bits per stimulus transmitted across the memory channel) and distortion (the cost of memory errors). Here we show how this abstract computational-level framework can be realized by a model of neural population coding. The model reproduces key regularities of visual working memory, including some that were not previously explained by population coding models. We verify a novel prediction of the model by reanalyzing recordings of monkey prefrontal neurons during an oculomotor delayed response task.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Protocol for a feasibility study of longitudinal surveys to assess the impact of policies on tobacco use among school-going adolescents in South Asia [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Smokeless tobacco (ST) use is common among youth in South Asia where 85% of the world’s 300 million ST users live and use the most lethal ST forms. Little is known about the impact of tobacco control policies on the youth ST uptake in those countries. We planned to conduct longitudinal surveys among school going adolescents to evaluate existing tobacco control policies on tobacco uptake and use, and a feasibility study for that prospective, observational cohort study. Study objectives: (1) To demonstrate the feasibility of selection, recruitment and retention of schools and of study participants; (2) To assess the feasibility and acceptability of the study procedure and study tool (questionnaire); (3) To evaluate if the questionnaire can assess tobacco uptake and use, and their potential predictors. Methods and analysis: The feasibility study will be conducted in two administrative areas within each of three South Asian countries: Bangladesh, India and Pakistan. We will use both quantitative and qualitative data collection methods. Eight eligible schools will be randomly selected within purposively selected sub-districts from each country. We plan to conduct one baseline and one follow up survey among students of grade 6-8, one year apart. At each time point, data on tobacco uptake and potential predictors will be collected from students via self-administered questionnaires that were designed for the longitudinal study. The qualitative component will be embedded into the study with each round of data collection to assess the acceptability of the study instrument (questionnaire) and data collection methods, via focus group discussions with students and semi-structured interviews with schoolteachers. Recruitment and retention rates, completeness of the questionnaires, frequencies and associations of tobacco use and explanatory variables will be reported. Data gathered from the focus group and interviews will be analysed using the framework approach.

                Introduction: Indonesia has the second highest number of Tuberculosis (TB) in the world and tuberculosis still pose as a global health priority problem. For the diagnostics, microscopy is still one of important modalities in TB diagnosis especially in peripheral areas for screening, case-finding, and treatment evaluation. The use of microscopy is limited to operator visual burden and specimen load. This study aims to modify the use of the microscope by using everyday item to increase microscope operator workload. Method: This is an analytic study of the use of colored cellophane in microscopic examination of sputum smear from 24 pulmonary TB patients from Jakarta and Surabaya. The sputum samples were confirmed positive by standardized ZN-AFB microscopy and/or Xpert MTB/RIF. Each sputum were made into two slides, for each slide, 10 oil immersion fields were captured using Optilab microscope camera mounted on microscope. A total of 480 data pairs were analysed by comparing color characteristic of acid-fast bacilli pixels and its adjacent background pixels and by counting Acid fast Bacilli for each observation field. IUATLD scale were also observed by 3 operators. Results: Contrast ratio for each AFB and its adjacent pixels were significantly higher in groups using cellophane filter than without using filter (p = 0.001). AFB identification per image acquired using filter were not significantly higher (p=0.815). Conclusion: Colored cellophane increases contrast ratio and eases microscopic examination, thus increases sputum smear microscopic observation capability. Also it might increase identification capability with digital image processing.

                Thermal injuries in young children involving the buttocks, perineum, and lower limbs raise suspicion of child abuse. Determining the manner of death and ruling out homicide in a fatal case of scalding remains a challenge for forensic practitioners. One such issue is reported in the present case report, where a medicolegal evaluation of a fatal scald in a two-year-old girl child is discussed. Young children sustaining serious injuries from scalds is a grave social concern. Such young lives need to be protected from scald injuries whether accidental or purposeful. Differences in injury patterns on the basis of their distribution and their characteristics are important to determine manner of death in such cases.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">The ER membrane complex (EMC) can functionally replace the Oxa1 insertase in mitochondria</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Büsra Güngör, Tamara Flohr, Sriram G. Garg, Johannes M. Herrmann</p>

Two multisubunit protein complexes for membrane protein insertion were recently identified in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER): the guided entry of tail anchor proteins (GET) complex and ER membrane complex (EMC). The structures of both of their hydrophobic core subunits, which are required for the insertion reaction, revealed an overall similarity to the YidC/Oxa1/Alb3 family members found in bacteria, mitochondria, and chloroplasts. This suggests that these membrane insertion machineries all share a common ancestry. To test whether these ER proteins can functionally replace Oxa1 in yeast mitochondria, we generated strains that express mitochondria-targeted Get2–Get1 and Emc6–Emc3 fusion proteins in Oxa1 deletion mutants. Interestingly, the Emc6–Emc3 fusion was able to complement an <i>Δoxa1</i> mutant and restored its respiratory competence. The Emc6–Emc3 fusion promoted the insertion of the mitochondrially encoded protein Cox2, as well as of nuclear encoded inner membrane proteins, although was not able to facilitate the assembly of the Atp9 ring. Our observations indicate that protein insertion into the ER is functionally conserved to the insertion mechanism in bacteria and mitochondria and adheres to similar topological principles.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Global research on syndemics: a meta-knowledge analysis (2001-2020) [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Syndemics or synergies of cooccurring epidemics are widely studied across health and social sciences in recent years. Methods: We conducted a meta-knowledge analysis of articles published between 2001 to 2020 in this growing field of academic scholarship. Results: We found a total of 830 articles authored by 3025 authors, mostly from high-income countries. Publications on syndemics are gradually increasing since 2003, with rapid development in 2013. Each article was cited more than 15 times on average, and most (n = 604) articles were original studies. Syndemics research focused on several areas, including HIV/AIDS, substance abuse, mental health, gender minority stressors, racism, violence, chronic physical and mental disorders, food insecurity, social determinants of health, and coronavirus disease 2019. Moreover, biopsychosocial interactions between multiple health problems were studied across medical, anthropological, public health, and other disciplines of science. Conclusions: The limited yet rapidly evolving literature on syndemics informs transdisciplinary interests to understand complex coexisting health challenges in the context of systematic exclusion and structural violence in vulnerable populations. The findings also suggest applications of syndemic theory to evaluate clinical and public health problems, examine the socioecological dynamics of factors influencing health and wellbeing, and use the insights to alleviate health inequities in the intersections of synergistic epidemics and persistent contextual challenges for population health.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The differentiation of mesenchymal bone marrow stem cells into nerve cells induced by Chromolaena odorata extracts [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can differentiate into nerve cells with an induction from chemical compounds in medium culture. Chromolaena odorata contains active compounds, such as alkaloids and flavonoids, that can initiate the transformation of MSCs into nerve cells. The aim of this study was to determine the potential of methanol extracted C. odorata leaf to induce the differentiation of bone marrow MSCs into nerve cells. Methods: A serial concentration of C. odorata leaf extract (0.7–1.0 mg/mL) with two replications was used. The parameters measured were the number of differentiated MSCs into nerve cells (statistically analyzed using ANOVA) and cell confirmation using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results: The results showed that the C. odorata extract had a significant effect on the number MSCs differentiating into nerve cells (p < 0.05) on the doses of 0.8 mg/ml with 22.6%. Molecular assay with RT-PCR confirmed the presence of the nerve cell gene in all of the samples. Conclusions: In conclusion, this study showed the potential application of C. odorata leaf extract in stem cell therapy for patients experiencing neurodegeneration by inducing the differentiation of MSCs into nerve cells.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Strategies of enhancing rural livelihoods and promoting sustainable use and conservation of indigenous chicken breeds in Zambia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                This review explores innovative and sustainable strategies for conservation and use of village or indigenous chickens (IC) (Gallus domesticus) in Zambia and parts of Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Small scale farmers (SSF) have kept IC for hundreds of years to meet their households’ nutritional needs, incomes, social-cultural and religious uses among others. The commitment exhibited by SSF in keeping IC has made them the major custodians of essential animal genetic resources in low-income regions. Between 1991 and 2012, private breeders invested over US$95 million in Zambia’s commercial poultry sector resulting in over 100% increase in annual production of day-old chicks to 65 million. However, high production cost and low market access hindered the participation of SSF hence their continued dependence on IC. Unfortunately, the future of IC genetic resources is threatened due to the rapid loss and erosion of IC breeds. In the 2015 biodiversity status report, the Food and Agriculture Organisation, an international body of the United Nation highlighted that over 3.5% of IC breeds were extinct, nearly 33% were at high risk and over 67% were of unknown status. Poultry diseases, lack of sustainable conservation strategies and poor use among others have significantly contributed to these losses. For example, in 2012, 60% of IC were diseased in parts of SSA including Zambia. If these challenges are not mitigated, the loss of IC genetic resources and the adverse impact on rural communities are inevitable. Further, future research and breeding programs on commercial chickens may also be limited as a result of erosion of IC genetic resources. Therefore, this paper reviews and contributes to previous studies that demonstrated how researcher-community-stakeholder engagements potentially enhanced sustainability and the adoption of innovative ideas including the potential to increase conservation and sustainable use of local chicken biodiversity in Zambia and parts of SSA.

                Unlike previous pandemics, the COVID-19 pandemic is unique in that, for the first time, social isolation is not isolation but a migration imperative. World 4.0, the digital society, has endowed people with a capacity for interconnectedness through using social networks for entertainment. In particular, stickers and memes, as founding grammars of discourses, narratives, ways of feeling, and imaginaries, can demonstrate, from an informational sociobiological approach, the phenomenon of memes in the COVID-19 pandemic. This article highlights the meme as a shock of laughter for the mind and body, becoming the phenomenon that has prevailed and strengthened throughout the pandemic. It proposes some reflections on the role of memes as a shock of personal enjoyment and reflection unveiling the contemporary social context. We present four moments of the memes during the pandemic, in the first the memes reflect the new emerging condition with subjectivities such as mockery, reduction, and denial. The second moment shows the unfathomable encounter between the person and the pandemic, where the panic in the meme turns into humour. The third moment shows the terror beginning to unravel. Here, the meme operates as a shocking power of laughter in epicconscious activity. In the fourth moment, the memes reflect the establishment of a new normal. The meme is already a vehicle for unexpected situations as a consequence of the pandemic phenomenon.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study was undertaken to describe and compare disease course and prognosis of early (ie, disease onset before age 11 years) and late (ie, disease onset after age 11 years) onset pediatric multiple sclerosis.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Prospectively collected clinical information from Italian Multiple Sclerosis Register of 1993 pediatric multiple sclerosis patients, of whom 172 had early onset, was analyzed. Cox models adjusted for sex, baseline Expanded Disability Status Scale score, and disease-modifying treatments and stratified for diagnostic criteria adopted (Poser vs McDonald) were used to assess the risk of reaching irreversible Expanded Disability Status Scale scores of 3, 4, and 6, and conversion to secondary progressive phenotype in early versus late onset pediatric patients. Prognostic factors were also evaluated.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A greater proportion of males, isolated brainstem involvement, and longer time interval between first and second clinical episode were observed in early versus late onset pediatric patients. Compared to late onset, early onset pediatric patients took longer from disease onset to convert to secondary progressive phenotype and to reach all disability milestones. Recovery from first demyelinating event, time to first relapse, annualized relapse rate during the first 3 years of disease, and disease-modifying treatment exposure were independent predictors for long-term disability in early onset pediatric patients. In late onset pediatric patients, isolated optic neuritis, multifocal symptoms, and progressive course at disease onset were additional predictors for long-term disability.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These findings point toward the existence of a different natural history in early versus late onset pediatric multiple sclerosis patients. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

                Exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls is a risk factor for a neurodevelopmental disorder. In a mouse model of exposure to a human-relevant mixture, Laufer et al. utilize WGBS to profile DNA methylation within placenta and fetal brain. Both tissues display shared alterations at regions related to neurodevelopment and autism spectrum disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A cellular and molecular atlas reveals the basis of chytrid development</a></h4>

              
                The chytrids (phylum Chytridiomycota) are a major fungal lineage of ecological and evolutionary importance. Despite their importance, many fundamental aspects of chytrid developmental and cell biology remain poorly understood. To address these knowledge gaps, we combined quantitative volume electron microscopy and comparative transcriptome profiling to create an ‘atlas’ of the cellular and molecular basis of the chytrid life cycle, using the model chytrid <i>Rhizoclosmatium globosum</i>. From our developmental atlas, we describe the transition from the transcriptionally inactive free-swimming zoospore to the more biologically complex germling, and show that lipid processing is multifaceted and dynamic throughout the life cycle. We demonstrate that the chytrid apophysis is a compartmentalised site of high intracellular trafficking, linking the feeding/attaching rhizoids to the reproductive zoosporangium, and constituting division of labour in the chytrid cell plan. We provide evidence that during zoosporogenesis, zoospores display amoeboid morphologies and exhibit endocytotic cargo transport from the interstitial maternal cytoplasm. Taken together, our results reveal insights into chytrid developmental biology and provide a basis for future investigations into non-dikaryan fungal cell biology.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Coil-to-a-helix transition at the Nup358-BicD2 interfaceactivates BicD2 for dynein recruitment</a></h4>

              
                Nup358, a protein of the nuclear pore complex, facilitates a nuclear positioning pathway that is essential for many biological processes, including neuromuscular and brain development. Nup358 interacts with the dynein adaptor Bicaudal D2 (BicD2), which in turn recruits the dynein machinery to position the nucleus. However, the molecular mechanisms of the Nup358/BicD2 interaction and the activation of transport remain poorly understood. Here for the first time, we show that a minimal Nup358 domain activates dynein/dynactin/BicD2 for processive motility on microtubules. Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) titration and chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST), mutagenesis and circular dichroism spectroscopy (CD), a Nup358 a-helix encompassing residues 2162-2184 was identified, which transitioned from a random coil to an a-helical conformation upon BicD2-binding and formed the core of the Nup358-BicD2 interface. Mutations in this region of Nup358 decreased the Nup358/BicD2 interaction, resulting in decreased dynein recruitment and impaired motility. BicD2 thus recognizes Nup358 though a 'cargo recognition a-helix', a structural feature that may stabilize BicD2 in its activated state and promote processive dynein motility.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">GFPT2/GFAT2 and AMDHD2 act in tandem to control the hexosamine pathway</a></h4>

              
                The hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP) produces the essential metabolite UDP-GlcNAc and plays a key role in metabolism, health, and aging. The HBP is controlled by its rate-limiting enzyme glutamine fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase (GFPT/GFAT) that is directly inhibited by UDP-GlcNAc in a feedback loop. HBP regulation by GFPT is well studied but other HBP regulators have remained obscure. Elevated UDP‑GlcNAc levels counteract the glycosylation toxin tunicamycin (TM) and thus we screened for TM resistance in haploid mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) using random chemical mutagenesis to determine alternative HBP regulation. We identified the N‑acetylglucosamine deacetylase AMDHD2 that catalyzes a reverse reaction in the HBP and its loss strongly elevated UDP-GlcNAc. To better understand AMDHD2, we solved the crystal structure and found that loss-of-function is caused by protein destabilization or interference with its catalytic activity. Finally, we show that mESCs express AMDHD2 together with GFPT2 instead of the more common paralog GFPT1. Compared with GFPT1, GFPT2 had a much lower sensitivity to UDP-GlcNAc inhibition, explaining how AMDHD2 loss-of-function resulted in HBP activation. This HBP configuration in which AMDHD2 serves to balance GFPT2 activity was also observed in other mESCs and, consistently, the GFPT2:GFPT1 ratio decreased with differentiation of human embryonic stem cells. Together, our data reveal a critical function of AMDHD2 in limiting UDP‑GlcNAc production in cells that use GFPT2 for metabolite entry into the HBP.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Tadr Is an axonal histidine transporter required for visual neurotransmission in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Neurotransmitters are generated by <i>de novo</i> synthesis and are essential for sustained, high-frequency synaptic transmission. Histamine, a monoamine neurotransmitter, is synthesized through decarboxylation of histidine by Histidine decarboxylase (Hdc). However, little is known about how histidine is presented to Hdc as a precursor. Here, we identified a specific histidine transporter, TADR (Torn And Diminished Rhabdomeres), which is required for visual transmission in <i>Drosophila</i>. Both TADR and Hdc localized to neuronal terminals, and mutations in <i>tadr</i> reduced levels of histamine, thus disrupting visual synaptic transmission and phototaxis behavior. These results demonstrate that a specific amino acid transporter provides precursors for monoamine neurotransmitters, providing the first genetic evidence that a histidine amino acid transporter plays a critical role in synaptic transmission. These results suggest that TADR-dependent local <i>de novo </i>synthesis of histamine is required for synaptic transmission.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Role of Nrp1 in controlling cortical inter-hemispheric circuits</a></h4>

              
                Axons of the corpus callosum (CC) mediate the interhemispheric communication required for complex perception in mammals. In the somatosensory (SS) cortex, the CC exchanges inputs processed by the primary (S1) and secondary (S2) areas, which receive tactile and pain stimuli. During early postnatal life, a multistep process involving axonal navigation, growth, and refinement, leads to precise CC connectivity. This process is often affected in neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism and epilepsy. We herein show that in mice, expression of the axonal signaling receptor Neuropilin 1 (Nrp1) in SS layer (L) 2/3 is temporary and follows patterns that determine CC connectivity. At postnatal day 4, <i>Nrp1</i> expression is absent in the SS cortex while abundant in the motor area, creating a sharp border. During the following 3 weeks, <i>Nrp1</i> is transiently upregulated in subpopulations of SS L2/3 neurons, earlier and more abundantly in S2 than in S1. In vivo knock-down and overexpression experiments demonstrate that transient expression of <i>Nrp1</i> does not affect the initial development of callosal projections in S1 but is required for subsequent S2 innervation. Moreover, knocking-down <i>Nrp1</i> reduces the number of S2L2/3 callosal neurons due to excessive postnatal refinement. Thus, an exquisite temporal and spatial regulation of <i>Nrp1</i> expression determines SS interhemispheric maps.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Ecological and social pressures interfere with homeostatic sleep regulation in the wild</a></h4>

              
                Sleep is fundamental to the health and fitness of all animals. The physiological importance of sleep is underscored by the central role of homeostasis in determining sleep investment – following periods of sleep deprivation, individuals experience longer and more intense sleep bouts. Yet, most sleep research has been conducted in highly controlled settings, removed from evolutionarily relevant contexts that may hinder the maintenance of sleep homeostasis. Using triaxial accelerometry and GPS to track the sleep patterns of a group of wild baboons (<i>Papio anubis</i>), we found that ecological and social pressures indeed interfere with homeostatic sleep regulation. Baboons sacrificed time spent sleeping when in less familiar locations and when sleeping in proximity to more group-mates, regardless of how long they had slept the prior night or how much they had physically exerted themselves the preceding day. Further, they did not appear to compensate for lost sleep via more intense sleep bouts. We found that the collective dynamics characteristic of social animal groups persist into the sleep period, as baboons exhibited synchronized patterns of waking throughout the night, particularly with nearby group-mates. Thus, for animals whose fitness depends critically on avoiding predation and developing social relationships, maintaining sleep homeostasis may be only secondary to remaining vigilant when sleeping in risky habitats and interacting with group-mates during the night. Our results highlight the importance of studying sleep in ecologically relevant contexts, where the adaptive function of sleep patterns directly reflects the complex trade-offs that have guided its evolution.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A plasma membrane-localized polycystin-1/polycystin-2 complex in endothelial cells elicits vasodilation</a></h4>

              
                Polycystin-1 (PC-1, PKD1), a receptor-like protein expressed by the <i>Pkd1</i> gene, is present in a wide variety of cell types, but its cellular location, signaling mechanisms and physiological functions are poorly understood. Here, by studying tamoxifen-inducible, endothelial cell (EC)-specific <i>Pkd1</i> knockout (<i>Pkd1</i> ecKO) mice, we show that flow activates PC-1-mediated, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent cation currents in ECs. EC-specific PC-1 knockout attenuates flow-mediated arterial hyperpolarization and vasodilation. PC-1-dependent vasodilation occurs over the entire functional shear stress range and via the activation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and intermediate (IK)- and small (SK)-conductance Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> channels. EC-specific PC-1 knockout increases systemic blood pressure without altering kidney anatomy. PC-1 coimmunoprecipitates with polycystin-2 (PC-2, PKD2), a TRP polycystin channel, and clusters of both proteins locate in nanoscale proximity in the EC plasma membrane. Knockout of either PC-1 or PC-2 (<i>Pkd2</i> ecKO mice) abolishes surface clusters of both PC-1 and PC-2 in ECs. Single knockout of PC-1 or PC-2 or double knockout of PC-1 and PC-2 (<i>Pkd1</i>/<i>Pkd2</i> ecKO mice) similarly attenuates flow-mediated vasodilation. Flow stimulates non-selective cation currents in ECs that are similarly inhibited by either PC-1 or PC-2 knockout or by interference peptides corresponding to the C-terminus coiled-coil domains present in PC-1 or PC-2. In summary, we show that PC-1 regulates arterial contractility through the formation of an interdependent signaling complex with PC-2 in endothelial cells. Flow stimulates PC-1/PC-2 clusters in the EC plasma membrane, leading to eNOS, IK channel and SK channel activation, vasodilation and a reduction in blood pressure.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Chemogenetics defines a short-chain fatty acid receptor gut–brain axis</a></h4>

              
                Volatile small molecules, including the short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), acetate and propionate, released by the gut microbiota from the catabolism of nondigestible starches, can act in a hormone-like fashion via specific G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). The primary GPCR targets for these SCFAs are FFA2 and FFA3. Using transgenic mice in which FFA2 was replaced by an altered form called a Designer Receptor Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (FFA2-DREADD), but in which FFA3 is unaltered, and a newly identified FFA2-DREADD agonist 4-methoxy-3-methyl-benzoic acid (MOMBA), we demonstrate how specific functions of FFA2 and FFA3 define a SCFA–gut–brain axis. Activation of both FFA2/3 in the lumen of the gut stimulates spinal cord activity and activation of gut FFA3 directly regulates sensory afferent neuronal firing. Moreover, we demonstrate that FFA2 and FFA3 are both functionally expressed in dorsal root- and nodose ganglia where they signal through different G proteins and mechanisms to regulate cellular calcium levels. We conclude that FFA2 and FFA3, acting at distinct levels, provide an axis by which SCFAs originating from the gut microbiota can regulate central activity.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Robust and annotation-free analysis of alternative splicing across diverse cell types in mice</a></h4>

              
                Although alternative splicing is a fundamental and pervasive aspect of gene expression in higher eukaryotes, it is often omitted from single-cell studies due to quantification challenges inherent to commonly used short-read sequencing technologies. Here, we undertake the analysis of alternative splicing across numerous diverse murine cell types from two large-scale single-cell datasets-the Tabula Muris and BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Network-while accounting for understudied technical artifacts and unannotated events. We find strong and general cell-type-specific alternative splicing, complementary to total gene expression but of similar discriminatory value, and identify a large volume of novel splicing events. We specifically highlight splicing variation across different cell types in primary motor cortex neurons, bone marrow B cells, and various epithelial cells, and we show that the implicated transcripts include many genes which do not display total expression differences. To elucidate the regulation of alternative splicing, we build a custom predictive model based on splicing factor activity, recovering several known interactions while generating new hypotheses, including potential regulatory roles for novel alternative splicing events in critical genes like Khdrbs3 and Rbfox1. We make our results available using public interactive browsers to spur further exploration by the community.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Left hemisphere dominance for bilateral kinematic encoding in the human brain</a></h4>

              
                Neurophysiological studies in humans and nonhuman primates have revealed movement representations in both the contralateral and ipsilateral hemispheres. Inspired by clinical observations, we ask if this bilateral representation differs for the left and right hemispheres. Electrocorticography was recorded in human participants during an instructed-delay reaching task, with movements produced with either the contralateral or ipsilateral arm. Using a cross-validated kinematic encoding model, we found stronger bilateral encoding in the left hemisphere, an effect that was present during preparation and was amplified during execution. Consistent with this asymmetry, we also observed better across-arm generalization in the left hemisphere, indicating similar neural representations for right and left arm movements. Notably, these left hemisphere electrodes were centered over premotor and parietal regions. The more extensive bilateral encoding in the left hemisphere adds a new perspective to the pervasive neuropsychological finding that the left hemisphere plays a dominant role in praxis.

                Immigration and activation of immune cells play a significant role in damage progression after ischemic stroke. It has been shown that the nuclear receptor NR4A1 exerts a crucial role within the inflammatory response of various immune diseases via regulating immune cell activation. In this study, we investigated the role of NR4A1 on the activation and recruitment of brain resident and peripheral immune cells after cerebral ischemia. Here, we show that NR4A1 mediates an anti-inflammatory and damage limiting effect after ischemic stroke through immigrating neutrophil granulocytes. Importantly, NR4A1-activation with its ligand Cytosporone-B improves functional outcome and diminishes brain damage. Therefore, modulation of NR4A1 is a promising therapeutic target in the treatment of stroke.

                The extreme neurotoxicity of botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs), broadly used as a therapeutics, is mediated by their direct binding to two plasma membrane receptors: polysialogangliosides (PSGs) and serotype-dependently either synaptotagmin 1/2 (Syt1/2) or synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2 (SV2). Here, we demonstrate that although BoNT/A serotype binds directly to PSG and SV2, its neurotoxicity depends on Syt1. Using single-molecule super-resolution microscopy of pathological concentrations of BoNT/A holotoxins, we demonstrate that the toxin binds to a preassembled PSG-Syt1 complex that forms nanoclusters with SV2 on the plasma membrane of hippocampal neurons. This coincidental interaction controls the selective endocytic targeting of BoNT/A into synaptic vesicles, leading to incapacitation of neuronal communication. Our results suggest that Syt1-SV2 plasma membrane nanoclusters may acts as a common target for various BoNT serotypes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">C21orf2 mutations found in ALS disrupt primary cilia function</a></h4>

              
                Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects 1 in 400 people. Almost 40 genes have been associated with ALS, currently explaining about 15% of the ALS risk. These genes tend to cluster in certain disease pathways such as protein quality control, RNA metabolism and axonal function. Despite these advances, adequate treatments for ALS patients are still missing. In this study, we investigate the role of a newly discovered ALS gene, C21orf2, in ALS pathology. We show that C21orf2 is localized to the basal body of the primary cilium and plays an important role in ciliogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Knock down of C21orf2 also lowers cilia frequency and length in human iPSC-derived spinal motor neurons (sMNs). Furthermore, we show that intraflagellar transport is impaired, causing primary cilia to fail in transducing extracellular signals essential in the sonic hedgehog pathway. ALS-associated mutations in C21orf2 lead to loss of binding to centrosomal proteins, loss of proper localization at the basal body and hereby prevent C21orf2 from carrying out its normal function in cilia by loss-of-function. Finally, we confirm that sMNs derived from iPSCs from ALS patients with C21orf2 mutations display similar cilia dysfunction and have disturbed sonic hedgehog signaling. Collectively, our data reveal impaired cilia homeostasis as a novel disease mechanism at play in ALS, opening new avenues for further research.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sleep and circadian rhythm disruption alters the lung transcriptome to predispose to viral infection</a></h4>

              
                Sleep and circadian rhythm disruption (SCRD), as encountered during shift work, increases the risk of respiratory viral infection including SARS-CoV-2. However, the mechanism(s) underpinning higher rates of respiratory viral infection following SCRD remain poorly characterised. To address this, we investigated the effects of acute sleep deprivation on the mouse lung transcriptome. Here we show that sleep deprivation profoundly alters the transcriptional landscape of the lung, causing the suppression of both innate and adaptive immune systems, disrupting the circadian clock, and activating genes implicated in SARS-CoV-2 replication, thereby generating a lung environment that promotes viral infection and associated disease pathogenesis. Our study provides a mechanistic explanation of how SCRD increases the risk of respiratory viral infections including SARS-CoV-2 and highlights therapeutic avenues for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Increased reliability of visually-evoked activity in area V1 of the MECP2-duplication mouse model of autism</a></h4>

              
                Atypical sensory processing is now thought to be a core feature of the autism spectrum. Influential theories have proposed that both increased and decreased neural response reliability within sensory systems could underlie altered sensory processing in autism. Here, we report evidence for abnormally increased reliability of visual-evoked responses in layer 2/3 neurons of adult primary visual cortex in the MECP2-duplication syndrome animal model of autism. Increased response reliability was due in part to decreased response amplitude, decreased fluctuations in endogenous activity, and decreased neuronal coupling to endogenous activity. Similarly to what was observed neuronally, the optokinetic reflex occurred more reliably at low contrasts in mutant mice compared to controls. Retinal responses did not explain our observations. These data suggest that the circuit mechanisms for convolution of sensory-evoked and endogenous signal and noise may be altered in this form of syndromic autism.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Sex differences in contextual pattern separation, activation of new neurons, and functional connectivity within the limbic system</a></h4>

              
                Sex differences in the structure and function of hippocampus exist. Here, we examined sex differences in contextual pattern separation, functional connectivity, and activation of new neurons during fear memory. Two-month-old male and female Sprague-Dawley rats were injected with the DNA synthesis markers, iododeoxyuridine (IdU) and chlorodeoxyuridine (CldU) three weeks and four weeks before perfusion, respectively. One week after CldU injection, the rats underwent a context discrimination task in which rats were placed in context A (shock) and context A' (no shock) every day for 12 days. On the test day, rats were placed in the shock context (context A) to measure fear memory and expression of zif268, an immediate early gene across 15 different limbic and reward regions. We found that females, but not males, showed contextual discrimination during the last days of training. On the test day, both sexes displayed similar levels of freezing, indicating equivalent fear memory for context A. Despite similar fear memory, males showed more positive correlations of zif268 activation between the limbic regions and the striatum, whereas females showed more negative correlations among these regions. Females showed greater activation of the frontal cortex, dorsal CA1, and 3-week-old adult-born dentate granular cells compared to males. These results highlight the importance of studying sex differences in fear memory and the contribution of adult neurogenesis to the neuronal network and may contribute to differences in susceptibility to fear related disorders such as post traumatic stress disorder.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Social cues of safety can override differences in threat level</a></h4>

              
                Animals in groups integrate social information with that directly-gathered about the environment to guide decisions regarding reproduction, foraging and defence againts predatory threats. In the context of predation, usage of social information has acute fitness benefits, aiding the detection of predators, the mounting of concerted defensive responses, or allowing the inference of safety, permitting other beneficial behaviours such as foraging for food. Individual and group defence responses to predatory threats can vary in modality and vigour depending on the perceived threat level. Moreover, predation level has been shown to modulate the use of social cues about foraging sites. Whether and how different threat levels affect the use of social cues to guide defence responses, is currently unknow. We previously showed that Drosophila melanogaster display a graded decrease in freezing behaviour, triggered by an inescapable visual threat, with increasing group sizes. Crucially, we identified the movement of others as a cue of safety and its cessation a cue of threat and found the group responses to be primarily guided by the safety cues, resulting in a net social buffering effect. Here, we investigated how threat level impacts the use of social cues by exposing flies individually and in groups to two threat imminences using looms of different speeds. We show that freezing responses are stronger to the faster looms regardless of social condition. However, social buffering was stronger for groups exposed to the fast looms, such that the increase in freezing caused by the higher threat was less prominent in flies tested in groups than those tested individually. Through artificial control of behaviour, we created different group compositions, titrating the motion cues that were maintained across threat levels. We, found that the same level of safety motion cues had a bigger weight on the flies' decisions when these were exposed to the higher threat, thus overriding differences in perceived threat levels. These findings shed light on the 'safety in numbers' effect, revealing the modulation of the saliency of social safety cues across threat intensities, a possible mechanism to regulate costly defensive responses.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Identification of protein aggregates in the aging vertebrate brain with prion-like andphase separation properties</a></h4>

              
                Protein aggregation, which can sometimes spread in a prion-like manner, is a hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases. However, whether prion-like aggregates form during normal brain aging remains unknown. Here we use quantitative proteomics in the African turquoise killifish to identify protein aggregates that accumulate in old vertebrate brains. These aggregates are enriched for prion-like RNA binding proteins, notably the ATP-dependent RNA helicase DDX5. We validate that DDX5 forms mislocalized cytoplasmic aggregates in the brains of old killifish and mice. Interestingly, DDX5 prion-like domain allows these aggregates to propagate across many generations in yeast. In vitro, DDX5 phase separates into condensates. Mutations that abolish DDX5 prion propagation also impair DDX5 ability to phase separate. DDX5 condensates exhibit enhanced enzymatic activity, but they can mature into inactive, solid aggregates. Our findings suggest that protein aggregates with prion-like properties form during normal brain aging, which could have implications for the age-dependency of cognitive decline.

                This paper proposes a simple algorithm to remove noise and artifact from multichannel data. Data are processed trial by trial: for each trial the covariance matrix of the trial is diagonalized together with that of the full data to reveal the subspace that is -- locally -- most excentric relative to other trials. That subspace is then projected out from the data of that trial. This algorithm addresses a fundamental limitation of standard linear analysis methods (e.g. ICA) that assume that brain and artifact are linearly separable within the data. That assumption fails if there are more sources, including noise and brain sources, than data channels. The algorithm captializes on the fact that, if enough of those sources are temporally sparse, linear separation may succeed locally in time. The paper explains the rationale, describes the algorithm, and evaluates the outcome using synthetic and real brain data.

                Axon loss contributes to many common neurodegenerative disorders. In healthy axons, the axon survival factor NMNAT2 inhibits SARM1, the central executioner of programmed axon degeneration. We identified two rare NMNAT2 missense variants in two brothers afflicted with a progressive neuropathy syndrome. The polymorphisms result in amino acid substitutions, V98M and R232Q, which reduce NMNAT2 NAD+-synthetase activity. We generated a mouse model of the human syndrome and found that Nmnat2V98M/Nmnat2R232Q compound-heterozygous CRISPR mice survive to adulthood but develop progressive motor dysfunction, peripheral axon loss, and macrophage infiltration. These disease phenotypes are all SARM1-dependent. Remarkably, macrophage depletion therapy blocks and reverses neuropathic phenotypes in Nmnat2V98M/R232Q mice, identifying a SARM1-dependent neuroimmune mechanism as a key driver of disease pathogenesis. These findings demonstrate that SARM1 induces an inflammatory neuropathy and highlight the potential of immune therapy to treat this rare syndrome and other neurodegenerative conditions associated with NMNAT2 loss and SARM1 activation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Salient 40 Hz sounds probe affective aversion and neural excitability</a></h4>

              
                The human auditory system is not equally reactive to all frequencies of the audible spectrum. Emotional and behavioral reactions to loud or aversive acoustic features can vary from one individual to another, to the point that some exhibit exaggerated or even pathological responses to certain sounds. The neural mechanisms underlying these interindividual differences remain unclear. Whether distinct aversion profiles map onto neural excitability at the individual level needs to be tested. Here, we measured behavioral and EEG responses to click trains (from 10 to 250 Hz, spanning the roughness and pitch perceptual ranges) to test the hypothesis that interindividual variability in aversion to rough sounds is reflected in neural response differences between participants. Linking subjective aversion to 40 Hz steady-state EEG responses, we demonstrate that participants experiencing enhanced aversion to roughness also show stronger neural responses to this attribute. Interestingly, this pattern also correlates with inter-individual anxiety levels, suggesting that this personality trait might interact with subjective sensitivity and neural excitability to these sounds. These results support the idea that 40 Hz sounds can probe the excitability of non-canonical auditory systems involved in exogenous salience processing and aversive responses at the individual level. By linking subjective aversion to neural excitability, 40 Hz sounds provide neuromarkers relevant to a variety of pathological conditions, such as those featuring enhanced emotional sensitivity (hyperacusis, anxiety) or aberrant neural responses at 40 Hz (autism, schizophrenia).

                Sensitivity to numbers is a crucial and evolutionarily conserved cognitive ability. The lack of experimental models amenable to systematic genetic and neural manipulation has precluded discovering circuits required for numerical cognition. Here, we demonstrate that in a two-choice task Drosophila fruit flies spontaneously prefer sets containing more objects. This preference is determined by the ratio between the two numerical quantities tested, a characteristic signature of numerical cognition across species. Individual flies maintained their numerical choice over consecutive days. Using a numerical visual conditioning paradigm, we found that flies are capable of associating sucrose with numerical quantities and can be trained to reverse their spontaneous preference for large quantities. Finally, we show that silencing LC11 neurons reduces the preference for more objects, thus identifying a neuronal substrate for numerical cognition in invertebrates. This discovery paves the way for the systematic analysis of the behavioral and neural mechanisms underlying sensitivity to numerosity.

                Human perception requires complex cortical networks that function at neuroanatomical scales of microns and temporal scales of milliseconds. Despite this complexity, what if just one morphological feature of the brain could predict perceptual ability? Here, we tested this hypothesis with pre-registered analyses of neuroanatomy and face perception in neurotypical controls (NTs) and individuals with developmental prosopagnosia (DPs). Results show that the length of the mid- fusiform sulcus (MFS), a hominoid-specific tertiary sulcus in ventral temporal cortex (VTC), was shorter in DPs than NTs. Furthermore, individual differences in MFS length in the right, but not left, hemisphere predicted individual differences in face perception. These results support theories linking brain structure and function to perception, as well as indicate that one feature -- variability in MFS length -- can predict face perception. Finally, these findings add to growing evidence supporting a role of morphological variability of late developing, tertiary sulci and individual differences in cognition.

                Ligand-receptor interactions guide axon navigation and dendrite arborization. Mechanical forces also influence guidance choices. However, the nature of such mechanical stimulations, the mechanosensors identity and how they interact with guidance receptors are unknown. Here, we demonstrate that mechanosensitive DEG/ENaC channels are required for dendritic arbor morphogenesis in Caenorhabditis elegans. Inhibition of DEG/ENaC channels causes reduced dendritic outgrowth and branching in vivo, a phenotype that is alleviated by overexpression of the mechanosensitive channels PEZO-1/Piezo or YVC1/TrpY1. DEG/ENaCs trigger local Ca2+ transients in growing dendritic filopodia via activation of L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. Anchoring of filopodia by guidance ligand/receptor is required for the mechanical activation of DEG/ENaC channels. Therefore, mechanosensitive channels serve as a checkpoint for appropriate chemoaffinity by activating Ca2+ transients required for neurite growth.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Critical periods in which dopamine exerts control over behavioral responding during Pavlovian learning</a></h4>

              
                Learning the association between rewards and predictive cues is critical for appetitive behavioral responding. The mesolimbic dopamine system is thought to play an integral role in establishing these cue-reward associations. The dopamine response to cues can signal differences in reward value, though this emerges only after significant training. This suggests that the dopamine system may differentially regulate behavioral responding depending on the phase of training. To address this, separate groups of male rats were trained on Pavlovian tasks in which distinct audio cues signaled either differences in reward size or differences in reward rate. The dopamine receptor antagonist flupenthixol was systemically administered prior to either the first ten sessions of training (acquisition phase) or the second ten sessions of training (expression phase) and we monitored the effect of these manipulations for an additional ten training sessions. We identified acute effects of dopamine receptor antagonism on conditioned responding, the latency to respond, and post-reward head entries in both Pavlovian tasks. Interestingly, dopamine receptor antagonism during the expression phase produced persistent deficits in behavioral responding only in rats trained on the reward size Pavlovian task. Together, our results illustrate that dopamine's control over behavior in Pavlovian tasks depends upon one's prior training experience and the information signaled by the cues.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">LabNet: hardware control software for the Raspberry Pi</a></h4>

              
                Single-board computers such as the Raspberry Pi make it easy to control hardware setups for laboratory experiments. GPIOs and expansion boards (HATs) give access to a whole range of sensor and control hardware. However, controlling such hardware can be challenging, when many experimental setups run in parallel and the time component is critical. LabNet is a C++ optimized control layer software to give access to the Raspberry Pi connected hardware over a simple network protocol. LabNet was developed to be suitable for time-critical operations, and to be simple to expand. It leverages the actor model to simplify multithreading programming and to increase modularity. The message protocol is implemented in Protobuf and offers performance, small message size, and supports a large number of programming languages on the client side. It shows good performance compared to locally executed tools like Bpod or pyControl, outperforms Autopilot and reaches sub-millisecond range in network communication latencies. LabNet itself does not provide support for the design of experimental tasks. This is left to the client. LabNet can be used for general automation in experimental laboratories with its control PC located at some distance. LabNet is open source and under continuing development.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Label-free three-photon imaging of intact human cerebral organoids: tracking early events in brain development and deficits in Rett Syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Human cerebral organoids are unique in their development of progenitor-rich zones akin to ventricular zones from which neuronal progenitors differentiate and migrate radially. Analyses of cerebral organoids thus far have been performed in sectioned tissue or in superficial layers due to their high scattering properties. Here, we demonstrate label-free three-photon imaging of whole, uncleared intact organoids (~2 mm depth) to assess early events of early human brain development. Optimizing a custom-made three-photon microscope to image intact cerebral organoids generated from Rett Syndrome patients, we show defects in the ventricular zone volumetric structure of mutant organoids compared to isogenic control organoids. Long-term imaging live organoids reveals that shorter migration distances and slower migration speeds of mutant radially migrating neurons are associated with more tortuous trajectories. Our label-free imaging system constitutes a particularly useful platform for tracking normal and abnormal development in individual organoids, as well as for screening therapeutic molecules via intact organoid imaging.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Path vectors: a neural code for sequential memory</a></h4>

              
                While recalling lists of unrelated items is highly challenging we can recall much longer sequences structured as an episode or story. It is unknown why these patterns have such a striking influence on memory. We introduce a model where the experience of an episode or story is represented as a path through a pre-existing network of cognitive states. We demonstrate that by summing the neural representations of the visited states, this path can be transformed into a simple neural code: a path vector. We show how, by leveraging sparse connectivity and high dimensionality, path vectors provide robust codes for a large set of sequences and can be decoded mechanistically for memory retrieval. Fitting our model to data reveals how human free and serial recall may emerge from adapting coding mechanisms tuned for sequences aligned with existing network paths. We thus posit that sequences such as episodes or stories map more directly to existing cognitive network paths than arbitrary lists, with the latter eliciting paths that tend to interfere and impair recall. Our model suggests that mnemonic strategies like imposing narrative structure on a list act to improve recall by reducing such path interference. This work illuminates a simple bioplausible means for flexibly recruiting existing cognitive structures to encode new memories.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">EphB1 controls proper long-range cortical axon guidance through a cell non-autonomous role in GABAergic cells</a></h4>

              
                EphB1 is required for proper guidance of cortical long-range axon projections during brain development, but how EphB1 regulates this process remains unclear. To determine the relevant cell types in which EphB1 functions for proper cortical axon guidance, we generated a new floxed EphB1 mouse. We show here that EphB1 conditional knockout (cKO) in most of the developing cortical excitatory neurons (Emx1-Cre) failed to produce cortical axon guidance defects. However, EphB1 cKO in GABAergic cell populations (Vgat-Cre or dlx1/2-Cre) reproduced fully the cortical axon guidance defects observed in global EphB1-/- mice. Interestingly, in the EphB1 cKOVgat mice, the misguided axon bundles in the dorsal striatum contained comingled striatal GABAergic and cortical glutamatergic axons. Surprisingly, conditional loss of EphB1 in D1 or D2 dopamine receptor-expressing populations did not produce the cortical axon guidance defects, and no D1- or D2-SPN axons were detected within the misguided axon bundles of EphB1 KO mice. In contrast, parvalbumin-positive GABAergic cell axons were observed in the misguided axon bundles in EphB1 KO mice. Finally, a large fraction of the ectopic axons in EphB1 KO mice were in close apposition to the major blood vessels in the ventral telencephalon, suggesting that EphB1 expression in GABAergic cells normally promotes avoidance of these ectopic long-range axons from the developing cerebral vasculature. Together, our data reveal a new role for EphB1 in GABAergic cells to influence proper cortical glutamatergic long-range axon guidance during early brain development.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Influence of age and cognitive performance on resting-state functional connectivity of dopaminergic and noradrenergic centres</a></h4>

              
                The process of ageing is associated with structural and functional changes in the brain, with a decline in cognitive functions observed as its inevitable symptom, even in the absence of neurodegenerative changes. A body of literature suggests dopamine and noradrenaline as prominent candidate molecules to mediate these effects, however, the knowledge regarding the underlying mechanisms is scarce. To fill this gap, we compared local and distant resting-state functional connectivity patterns of ventral tegmental area, substantia nigra pars compacta and locus coeruleus in healthy young (20-35 years; N = 37) and older adults (55-80 years; N = 27). Additionally, we sought long-range functional connectivity patterns of these structures associated with performance in tasks probing executive, attentional and reward functioning, as well as compared the functional coupling of the left and right substantia nigra. The results showed that each substantia nigra had stronger coupling with ipsilateral cortical and subcortical areas along with contralateral cerebellum, and that strength of functional connections of this structure with angular gyrus and lateral orbitofrontal cortex predicted the visuomotor search abilities. In turn, ageing was associated with increased local synchronisation in the ventral tegmental area, and differences in functional connectivity of the dopaminergic midbrain with numerous cortical and subcortical structures. Locus coeruleus functional coupling showed no differences between the groups and was not associated with any of the behavioural functions. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first one to report the age-related effects on midbrain local synchronisation and its connectivity with key recipients of dopaminergic innervation, such as striatum, anterior cingulate and insula.

                The subventricular zone (SVZ) is the largest neural stem cell (NSC) niche in the adult brain; herein, the blood-brain barrier is leaky, allowing direct interactions between NSCs and endothelial cells (ECs). Mechanisms by which direct NSC-EC interactions in the SVZ control NSC behavior are unclear. We found Cx43 to be highly expressed by both NSCs and ECs in the SVZ, and its deletion in either cell type leads to increased NSC proliferation and neuroblast generation, suggesting that Cx43-mediated NSC-EC interactions maintain NSC quiescence. This is further supported by in vitro studies showing co-culture with ECs decreases NSC proliferation and increases their expression of genes associated with quiescence in a Cx43-dependent manner. Cx43 mediates these effects in a channel-independent manner involving its cytoplasmic tail and ERK activation. Such insights further advance our understanding of NSC regulation in vivo and may inform NSC maintenance ex vivo for stem cell therapies for neurodegenerative disorders.

	<p>To test the ability of different entropy measures to classify patients with different conditions of chronic disorder of consciousness, we applied the Lempel&amp;amp;ndash;Ziv complexity, the amplitude coalition entropy (ACE), and the synchrony coalition entropy (SCE) to the EEG signals recorded in 32 patients, clinically evaluated using the coma recovery scale revised (CRS-R). All the entropy measures indicated that differences found in the theta and alpha bands can distinguish patients in a minimal consciousness state (MCS) with respect to those in a vegetative state/unresponsive wakefulness state (VS/UWS). These differences were significant comparing the entropy measure performed on the anterior region of the left hemisphere and midline region. The values of theta-alpha entropy positively correlated with those of the CRS-R scores. Among the entropy measures, ACE most often highlighted significant differences. The higher values found in MCS were for the less impaired patients, according to their CRS-R, suggest that the preservation of signal entropy on the anterior region of the dominant hemisphere correlates with better preservation of consciousness, even in chronic conditions.</p>

	<p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are part of the same disease spectrum. While thalamic&amp;amp;ndash;cerebellar degeneration has been observed in C9orf72 expansion carriers, the exact subregions involved across the clinical phenotypes of the ALS&amp;amp;ndash;FTD spectrum remain unclear. Using MRIs from 58 bvFTD, 41 ALS&amp;amp;ndash;FTD and 52 ALS patients compared to 57 controls, we aimed to delineate thalamic and cerebellar subregional changes across the ALS&amp;amp;ndash;FTD spectrum and to contrast these profiles between cases with and without C9orf72 expansions. Thalamic involvement was evident across all ALS&amp;amp;ndash;FTD clinical phenotypes, with the laterodorsal nucleus commonly affected across all groups (values below the 2.5th control percentile). The mediodorsal nucleus was disproportionately affected in bvFTD and ALS&amp;amp;ndash;FTD but not in ALS. Cerebellar changes were only observed in bvFTD and ALS&amp;amp;ndash;FTD predominantly in the superior&amp;amp;ndash;posterior region. Comparison of genetic versus sporadic cases revealed significantly lower volumes exclusively in the pulvinar in C9orf72 expansion carriers compared to non-carriers, irrespective of clinical syndrome. Overall, bvFTD showed significant correlations between thalamic subregions, level of cognitive dysfunction and severity of behavioural symptoms. Notably, strong associations were evident between mediodorsal nucleus atrophy and severity of behavioural changes in C9orf72-bvFTD (r = &amp;amp;minus;0.9, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.0005). Our findings reveal distinct thalamic and cerebellar atrophy profiles across the ALS&amp;amp;ndash;FTD spectrum, with differential impacts on behaviour and cognition, and point to a unique contribution of C9orf72 expansions in the clinical profiles of these patients.</p>

	<p>The internal representation of numbers on the mental number line (MNL) was demonstrated by performing the computerized version of the number-to-position (CNP) task on a touchscreen while restricting response time. We found that the estimation pattern is best fit by a sigmoid function, further denoted as the &amp;amp;ldquo;sigmoidal model&amp;amp;rdquo;. Two developmental leaps occurring during elementary school were recognized: (1) the division of the number line into two segments and (2) consistent use of different anchor points on the number line&amp;amp;mdash;the left endpoint in first grade, the right endpoint in second grade, and finally the midpoint in third grade. Additionally, when examining the differences between the breakpoints, we found that first graders demonstrated a breakpoint close to 6, which linearly decreased over the years until stabilizing close to 5. The relation between the ability to place individual numbers on a number line and performance of mental arithmetic showed that the consistent use of anchor points correlated significantly with faster responses in mental arithmetic.</p>

	<p>In tinnitus literature, researchers have increasingly been advocating for a clearer distinction between tinnitus perception and tinnitus-related distress. In non-bothersome tinnitus, the perception itself can be more specifically investigated: this has provided a body of evidence, based on resting-state and activation fMRI protocols, highlighting the involvement of regions outside the conventional auditory areas, such as the right parietal operculum. Here, we aim to conduct a review of available investigations of the human parietal operculo&amp;amp;ndash;insular subregions conducted at the microscopic, mesoscopic, and macroscopic scales arguing in favor of an auditory&amp;amp;ndash;somatosensory cross-talk. Both the previous literature and new results on functional connectivity derived from cortico&amp;amp;ndash;cortical evoked potentials show that these subregions present a dense tissue of interconnections and a strong connectivity with auditory and somatosensory areas in the healthy brain. Disrupted integration processes between these modalities may thus result in erroneous perceptions, such as tinnitus. More precisely, we highlight the role of a subregion of the right parietal operculum, known as OP3 according to the J&amp;amp;uuml;lich atlas, in the integration of auditory and somatosensory representation of the orofacial muscles in the healthy population. We further discuss how a dysfunction of these muscles could induce hyperactivity in the OP3. The evidence of direct electrical stimulation of this area eliciting auditory hallucinations further suggests its involvement in tinnitus perception. Finally, a small number of neuroimaging studies of therapeutic interventions for tinnitus provide additional evidence of right parietal operculum involvement.</p>

	<p>Physical activity leads to well-established health benefits. Current efforts to enhance physical activity have targeted mainly socioeconomic factors. However, despite these efforts, only a small number of adults engage in regular physical activity to the point of meeting current recommendations. Evidence collected in rodent models and humans establish a strong central nervous system component that regulates physical activity behavior. In particular, dopaminergic pathways in the central nervous system are among the best-characterized biological mechanisms to date with respect to regulating reward, motivation, and habit formation, which are critical for establishing regular physical activity. Herein, we discuss evidence for a role of brain dopamine in the regulation of voluntary physical activity behavior based on selective breeding and pharmacological studies in rodents, as well as genetic studies in both rodents and humans. While these studies establish a role of dopamine and associated mechanisms in the brain in the regulation of voluntary physical activity behavior, there is clearly need for more research on the underlying biology involved in motivation for physical activity and the formation of a physical activity habit. Such knowledge at the basic science level may ultimately be translated into better strategies to enhance physical activity levels within the society.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The role of newspapers published in North Sumatra during Indonesia's independence struggle between 1916-1925: A discourse analysis [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: In the history of Indonesian independence, newspapers not only functioned as a medium of information but also as a tool for the struggle for independence. This is because of the role of newspapers in bringing out the spirit of nationalism and the concept of “nation” to the Indonesian people through various writings and reports in each edition. This study aims to describe the form of Indonesia's struggle for independence in newspapers published in North Sumatra in 1916-1925. Methods: This research uses the critical discourse analysis method. The research data are in the form of texts published in thirteen indigenous newspapers published in North Sumatra in 1916-1925. Data analysis used three structures of Teun A. van Dijk's discourse analysis model, namely: macrostructure, superstructure, and microstructure. Results: From 1910-1925 there were 24 indigenous newspapers published in North Sumatra. Of these, there were 13 newspapers demanding Indonesian independence: Soeara Djawa, Pewarta Deli, Benih Merdeka, Perempoean Bergerak, Soeara Bondjol, Sinar Zaman, Orgaan Bataksche Studiefonds, Andalas, Mandailing, Warta Timur, Al Moektabas, Tjermin Karo, Soeara Batak. These newspapers published articles that fought for Indonesian independence by demanding Indonesian independence openly, criticizing various policies of the Dutch Colonial Government, and building awareness of Indonesian nationalism. Conclusion: The role of newspapers in the struggle for Indonesian independence in North Sumatra in 1916-1925 can be seen from the findings of 51 articles demanding Indonesia's independence from Dutch colonialism, criticizing the policies of the Dutch colonial government, and building the spirit of nationalism to encourage the Indonesian people to fight for their independence.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Nothing to Cheer About: Endorsing  Imaginary Economic Evaluations and Value Claims with CHEERS 22 [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                One of the more unfortunate features of health technology assessment is the tenacity with which leaders in the field and organizations such as the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR) and the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) cling to an evaluation framework that fails to meet the standards of normal science. Believers subscribe to a meme that is clearly non-science (metaphysics and pseudoscience) and one that should have been discarded over 30 years ago. Certainly, subscribing to an impossible belief is not unusual; indeed it may make the belief that much stronger. Yet the meme is non-sustainable; it is also pointless as the economic evaluation claims are non-evaluable. There is no acknowledgement of the standards of normal science or the limitations imposed by the axioms of fundamental measurement. The purpose of this commentary is to make the case that the recent release of the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards 2022 (CHEERS 22) checklist is misleading; CHEERS 22 fails to address the manifest deficiencies in the approach to economic evaluations endorsed by ISPOR and ICER. Instead, it continues to promote economic evaluations in healthcare that invent evidence and non-empirically evaluable value claims. Given the widespread publicity that has accompanied the release of CHEERS 22, the purpose of this commentary is to detail the deficiencies in CHEERS 22 and propose an alternative framework for economic evaluation in health care to meet the information needs of formulary committees. This means abandoning the standards for economic evaluations that have dominated health technology assessment for 30 years, notably the key role assigned to the mathematically impossible quality adjusted life year (QALY). The proposed new start recommends single attribute evaluable value claims that meet ratio or interval measurement standards and are supported by evaluation protocols.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: High-grade anterior prostate cancer previously undetected by transrectal biopsy, diagnosed with MRI-US fusion transperineal robotic prostate biopsy [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Seventy percent of anterior prostate cancer cases are diagnosed during rebiopsy. MRI-US fusion transperineal robotic prostate biopsy is an emerging diagnostic method and might be an effective one in diagnosing prostate cancers in difficult sites such as the anterior zone. We report a case of a high grade anterior prostate cancer previously undetected by transrectal biopsy, diagnosed with MRI-US fusion transperineal robotic prostate biopsy. This case report suggests that MRI-US fusion transperineal robotic prostate biopsy might be valuable in diagnosing prostate cancer especially in difficult sites – the anterior region in this case – and might be an imperative diagnostic method in suspicious cases with prior negative biopsy.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Distinct roles of rodent thalamus and corpus callosum in seizure generalization</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Bilateral synchronous cortical activity occurs during sleep, attention, and seizures. Canonical models place the thalamus at the center of bilateral cortical synchronization because it generates bilateral sleep spindle oscillations and primarily generalized absence seizures. However, classical studies suggest that the corpus callosum mediates bilateral cortical synchronization.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We mapped the spread of right frontal lobe-onset, focal to bilateral seizures in mice and modified it using chemo and optogenetic suppression of motor thalamic nucleus and corpus callosotomy.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Seizures from the right cortex spread faster to the left cortex than to the left thalamus. The two thalami have minimal monosynaptic commissural connections compared to the massive commissure corpus callosum. Chemogenetic and closed-loop optogenetic inhibition of the right ventrolateral thalamic nucleus did not alter inter-hemispheric seizure spread. However, anterior callosotomy delayed bilateral seizure oscillations.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Thalamocortical oscillations amplify focal onset motor seizures, and corpus callosum spreads them bilaterally.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">MS‐driven metabolic alterations are recapitulated in iPSC‐derived astrocytes</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Astrocytes play a significant role in the pathology of Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Nevertheless, for ethical reasons, most studies in these cells were performed using the Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis model. As there are significant differences between human and mouse cells, we aimed here to better characterize astrocytes from patients with MS (PwMS), focusing mainly on mitochondrial function and cell metabolism.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We obtained and characterized induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived astrocytes from three PwMS and three unaffected controls, and performed electron microscopy, flow cytometry, cytokine and glutamate measurements, gene expression, <i>in situ</i> respiration, and metabolomics. We validated our findings using a single-nuclei RNA sequencing dataset.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We detected several differences in MS astrocytes including: (i) enrichment of genes associated with neurodegeneration, (ii) increased mitochondrial fission, (iii) increased production of superoxide and MS-related proinflammatory chemokines, (iv) impaired uptake and enhanced release of glutamate, (v) increased electron transport capacity and proton leak, in line with the increased oxidative stress, and (vi) a distinct metabolic profile, with a deficiency in amino acid catabolism and increased sphingolipid metabolism, which have already been linked to MS.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Here we describe the metabolic profile of iPSC-derived astrocytes from PwMS and validate this model as a very powerful tool to study disease mechanisms and to perform non-invasive drug targeting assays <i>in vitro</i>. Our findings recapitulate several disease features described in patients and provide new mechanistic insights into the metabolic rewiring of astrocytes in MS, which could be targeted in future therapeutic studies.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">A secretory vesicle failure in Parkinson's disease occurs in human platelets</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The presence of elevated dopamine (DA) and its major metabolites in the cytosol of neurons has been associated with their vulnerability in Parkinson's disease (PD). Over 99% of the cell's amines are confined to secretory vesicles (SVs), making these structures fundamental in the regulation of cytosolic DA levels. SVs of platelets use similar, if not the same mechanisms to accumulate serotonin in SVs as dopaminergic neurons do to store DA. Hence, any functional defects in platelets probably mirrors events in DA neurons.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We have isolated fresh platelets from the blood of 75 PD patients, 116 matched controls and 24 patients with Parkinsonism, assaying serotonin handling (basal content, accumulation, secretion and spontaneous leakage).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We found a dramatic decrease in the serotonin content and uptake by SVs, as well as decreased thrombin-induced release by platelets from PD patients but not in those from most Parkinsonism cases. Platelets from PD patients also failed to retain serotonin in SVs.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These findings indicate a functional impairment in the handling of amines by SVs in PD patients. This defect may serve as a biomarker of PD, and the approach described here may be potentially used for the subclinical detection of PD and to establish a platform to assay disease modifying drugs.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Modified recurrent equation-based cubic spline interpolation for missing data recovery in phasor measurement unit (PMU) [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Smart grid systems require high-quality phasor measurement unit (PMU) data for proper operation, control, and decision-making. Missing PMU data may lead to improper actions or even blackouts. While the conventional cubic interpolation methods based on the solution of a set of linear equations to solve for the cubic spline coefficients have been applied by many researchers for interpolation of missing data, the computational complexity increases non-linearly with increasing data size. Methods: In this work, a modified recurrent equation-based cubic spline interpolation procedure for recovering missing PMU data is proposed. The recurrent equation-based method  makes the computations of spline constants simpler. Using PMU data from the State Load Despatch Center (SLDC) in Madhya Pradesh, India, a comparison of the root mean square error (RMSE) values and time of calculation (ToC) is calculated for both methods. Results: The modified recurrent relation method could retrieve missing values 10 times faster when compared to the conventional cubic interpolation method based on the solution of a set of linear equations.  The RMSE values have shown the proposed method is effective even for special cases of missing values (edges, continuous missing values). Conclusions: The proposed method can retrieve any number of missing values at any location using observed data with a minimal number of calculations.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">In heart failure reactivation of RNA-binding proteins is associated with the expression of 1,523 fetal-specific isoforms</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Matteo D’Antonio, Jennifer P. Nguyen, Timothy D. Arthur, Hiroko Matsui, Margaret K. R. Donovan, Agnieszka D’Antonio-Chronowska, Kelly A. Frazer</p>

Reactivation of fetal-specific genes and isoforms occurs during heart failure. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms and the extent to which the fetal program switch occurs remains unclear. Limitations hindering transcriptome-wide analyses of alternative splicing differences (i.e. isoform switching) in cardiovascular system (CVS) tissues between fetal, healthy adult and heart failure have included both cellular heterogeneity across bulk RNA-seq samples and limited availability of fetal tissue for research. To overcome these limitations, we have deconvoluted the cellular compositions of 996 RNA-seq samples representing heart failure, healthy adult (heart and arteria), and fetal-like (iPSC-derived cardiovascular progenitor cells) CVS tissues. Comparison of the expression profiles revealed that reactivation of fetal-specific RBPs, and the accompanied re-expression of 1,523 fetal-specific isoforms, contribute to the transcriptome differences between heart failure and healthy adult heart. Of note, isoforms for 20 different RBPs were among those that reverted in heart failure to the fetal-like expression pattern. We determined that, compared with adult-specific isoforms, fetal-specific isoforms encode proteins that tend to have more functions, are more likely to harbor RBP binding sites, have canonical sequences at their splice sites, and contain typical upstream polypyrimidine tracts. Our study suggests that compared with healthy adult, fetal cardiac tissue requires stricter transcriptional regulation, and that during heart failure reversion to this stricter transcriptional regulation occurs. Furthermore, we provide a resource of cardiac developmental stage-specific and heart failure-associated genes and isoforms, which are largely unexplored and can be exploited to investigate novel therapeutics for heart failure.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Objective quantification of nerves in immunohistochemistry specimens of thyroid cancer utilising deep learning</a></h4>

Accurate quantification of nerves in cancer specimens is important to understand cancer behaviour. Typically, nerves are manually detected and counted in digitised images of thin tissue sections from excised tumours using immunohistochemistry. However the images are of a large size with nerves having substantial variation in morphology that renders accurate and objective quantification difficult using existing manual and automated counting techniques. Manual counting is precise, but time-consuming, susceptible to inconsistency and has a high rate of false negatives. Existing automated techniques using digitised tissue sections and colour filters are sensitive, however, have a high rate of false positives. In this paper we develop a new automated nerve detection approach, based on a deep learning model with an augmented classification structure. This approach involves pre-processing to extract the image patches for the deep learning model, followed by pixel-level nerve detection utilising the proposed deep learning model. Outcomes assessed were a) sensitivity of the model in detecting manually identified nerves (expert annotations), and b) the precision of additional model-detected nerves. The proposed deep learning model based approach results in a sensitivity of 89% and a precision of 75%. The code and pre-trained model are publicly available at https://github.com/IA92/Automated_Nerves_Quantification.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Meta-control of social learning strategies</a></h4>

Social learning, copying other’s behavior without actual experience, offers a cost-effective means of knowledge acquisition. However, it raises the fundamental question of which individuals have reliable information: successful individuals versus the majority. The former and the latter are known respectively as success-based and conformist social learning strategies. We show here that while the success-based strategy fully exploits the benign environment of low uncertainly, it fails in uncertain environments. On the other hand, the conformist strategy can effectively mitigate this adverse effect. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that meta-control of individual and social learning strategies provides effective and sample-efficient learning in volatile and uncertain environments. Simulations on a set of environments with various levels of volatility and uncertainty confirmed our hypothesis. The results imply that meta-control of social learning affords agents the leverage to resolve environmental uncertainty with minimal exploration cost, by exploiting others’ learning as an external knowledge base.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">RNA-Seq is not required to determine stable reference genes for qPCR normalization</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Nirmal Kumar Sampathkumar, Venkat Krishnan Sundaram, Prakroothi S. Danthi, Rasha Barakat, Shiden Solomon, Mrityunjoy Mondal, Ivo Carre, Tatiana El Jalkh, Aïda Padilla-Ferrer, Julien Grenier, Charbel Massaad, Jacqueline C. Mitchell</p>

Assessment of differential gene expression by qPCR is heavily influenced by the choice of reference genes. Although numerous statistical approaches have been proposed to determine the best reference genes, they can give rise to conflicting results depending on experimental conditions. Hence, recent studies propose the use of RNA-Seq to identify stable genes followed by the application of different statistical approaches to determine the best set of reference genes for qPCR data normalization. In this study, however, we demonstrate that the statistical approach to determine the best reference genes from commonly used conventional candidates is more important than the preselection of ‘stable’ candidates from RNA-Seq data. Using a qPCR data normalization workflow that we have previously established; we show that qPCR data normalization using conventional reference genes render the same results as stable reference genes selected from RNA-Seq data. We validated these observations in two distinct cross-sectional experimental conditions involving human iPSC derived microglial cells and mouse sciatic nerves. These results taken together show that given a robust statistical approach for reference gene selection, stable genes selected from RNA-Seq data do not offer any significant advantage over commonly used reference genes for normalizing qPCR assays.

                Background: The loss of E-cadherin expression and the induction of N-cadherin are known as hallmarks of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, an essential initial step in the process of metastasis in solid tumors. Although several studies have reported expressions of these cadherins in patients with multiple myeloma (MM), their clinical significance is unknown as MM cells are non-epithelial. Methods: In this study, we examined the expression of E- and N-cadherins by immunohistochemistry using bone marrow (BM) biopsy specimens from 31 newly diagnosed MM patients and in subsequent biopsy specimens from six of these. Results: Negative E-cadherin expression on BM myeloma cell membranes was significantly associated with the presence of soft-tissue masses arising from bone lesions and breaking through the cortical bone, referred to as extramedullary disease (EMD). Conclusions: Given the aggressive nature of EMD, our study suggests that screening for E-cadherin using BM immunohistochemistry is one measure that could predict the development of EMD in patients with MM.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A pilot study assessing the similarity between core outcome sets and outcomes included in health technology assessments [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Objective: Core outcome sets (COS) are an agreed standardised collection of outcomes created with representation from all key stakeholders (such as patients, clinicians, researchers), which should be reported as a minimum for all trials in that corresponding clinical area. There has been little research investigating the use of core outcomes in Health technology assessments (HTAs) and none in non-oncology HTAs. This study aimed to assess the similarity between COS and HTA outcomes. Methods: Ten COS published between 2015 and 2019 were selected, with patient participation taken as a proxy measure for a high quality COS. The INAHTA database was used as a source to identify relevant HTAs, which were accessed through the hyperlinks provided. Outcomes selected for these assessments were categorised as either a specific, partial or no match compared to the COS. An additional cohort of non-oncology HTAs published between 2019 and 2021 were identified from the NICE website and compared against a relevant COS. Results: Six hundred and fifty-one HTAs were matched to the ten COS areas, of which 119 were reviewed. Of a possible 1318 core outcome matches, there were 562 (43%) matches, 413 (31%) specific and 149 (11%) partial. NICE HTA matches against corresponding COS ranged from 44% to 100%, with a total of 78% (73/94) matches, 57 (61%) specific and 16 (17%) partial. Conclusion: Further work is required to promote the awareness and implementation of COS within HTAs. The degree of matching between COS and NICE HTA outcomes is encouraging, demonstrating acceptance of COS by HTA producers.

<p>The subcallosal cingulate cortex (SCC) and its connections have been implicated in the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD). We used diffusion tensor imaging to examine the MDD-related structural abnormalities underlying depressive symptoms in PD (n = 31). SCC (green box) and medial prefrontal cortex (yellow box) connectivity (group averaged red tract) in the left hemisphere was positively correlated with severity of dysphoric mood symptoms, suggesting abnormal SCC connectivity underlies depressive symptoms in both PD and MDD, particularly when depression in PD is dominated by dysphoric mood.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Depression is a heterogeneous clinical syndrome prevalent in patients with Parkinson disease (PD) that remains incompletely understood. Further, the differences in biomarkers of depression in PD and in non-PD patients are unclear. The subcallosal cingulate cortex (SCC) and its connections have been implicated in the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD). Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) provides a tool to quantify MDD-related structural abnormalities underlying depressive symptoms in PD. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging data were collected from 31 patients with PD. Depression symptom severity was measured using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II), and assessed using three subscales: dysphoric mood, loss of interest/pleasure, and somatic symptoms. Probabilistic tractography methods were used to quantify the SCC connectivity to target regions in cortico-limbic-striatal network (ventral striatum, medial prefrontal cortex [mPFC], dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, and uncinate fasciculus), while fractional anisotropy (FA) was calculated in predefined white matter regions of interest. DTI data were correlated with severity of depression across three domains. SCC-mPFC connectivity in the left hemisphere was positively correlated with severity of dysphoric mood (Benjamini–Hochberg adjusted <i>p</i> = .02). Region of interest-based analyses demonstrated a significant and distinct topographic association between FA and dysphoric mood, loss of interest/pleasure, and somatic symptom severity, although these findings did not maintain significance after applying the false discovery rate correction. Abnormal SCC connectivity underlies depressive symptoms in both PD and MDD, suggesting that interventions used for MDD should be explored in treating depressive symptoms in PD, particularly depression dominated by dysphoric mood.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A grammatico-pragmatic analysis of the because X construction: Private expression within public expression [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: This article investigates an innovative use of because, called the because X construction (e.g., because homework). Quantitative and qualitative research as well as research about the historical development of the construction have been conducted. The present article aims to determine what motivates the use of the construction.  Methods: Based on the data collected from the literature and online sources, the grammar of the because X construction is described in detail. The construction is then analyzed  within Hirose’s (2015) three-tier model of language use.  Results: A two-layered expressive structure is proposed: The X-element serves as a private expression, which is a speaker’s expression of thought with no intention of communication, whereas the whole construction functions publicly. The private nature of the X-element consistently accounts for the syntactic categories of the X-element and the restrictions on them observed in the literature.  Conclusion: The proposed two-layered expressive structure reflects a metapragmatic function of the construction. A private, subjective expression embedded in a public expression has the function of connecting the hearer to the speaker, and it accordingly brings about a joint attention effect. With such a function, the proposed structure is effective especially (but not exclusively) in online communication because one can strategically indicate closeness or intimacy to others, particularly in an environment where nonverbal means are difficult to apply.

                Background: Salinity is a significant abiotic stress which affects eggplant (Solanum melongena) growth and development, decreasing photosynthesis and reducing yield. To address this problem, we performed a salt induction response (SIR) study in eggplant. Methods: In this experiment, we optimized the salt induction cycle of 60, 80, 100 and 125 mM NaCl concentrations at 120-min time intervals. Eggplant seeds were exposed to three treatments. In particular, induced, non-induced, and control. The induction responses were tested with a supply of sub-lethal dose (100 mM NaCl) of saline water irrigation. Results: Salt induction improved the eggplant seedling vigour, germination, adjusts the physiology, antioxidant machinery and increase the fruit yield under salinity. Conclusion: Salt induction acclimatizes the eggplant seedlings to salinity stress and enhances the salinity tolerance at the whole-plant level.

                Background: iron and calcium dysmetabolism, with hyperferritinemia, hypoferremia, hypocalcemia and anemia have been documented in the majority of COVID-19 patients at later/worse stages. Furthermore, complementary to ACE2, both sialic acid (SA) molecules and CD147 proved relevant host receptors for SARS-CoV-2 entry, which explains the viral attack to multiple types of cells, including erythrocytes, endothelium and neural tissue. Several authors advocated that cell ferroptosis may be the core and final cell degenerative mechanism. Methods: a literature research was performed in several scientific search engines, such as PubMed Central, Cochrane Library, Chemical Abstract Service. More than 500 articles were retrieved until mid-December 2021, to highlight the available evidence about the investigated issues. Results: based on COVID-19 literature data, we have highlighted a few pathophysiological mechanisms, associated with virus-based cation dysmetabolism, multi-organ attack, mitochondria degeneration and ferroptosis. Our suggested elucidated pathological sequence is: a) spike protein subunit S1 docking with sialylated membrane glycoproteins/receptors (ACE2, CD147), and S2 subunit fusion with the lipid layer; b) cell membrane morpho-functional changes due to the consequent electro-chemical variations and viroporin action, which induce an altered ion channel function and intracellular cation accumulation; c) additional intracellular iron concentration due to a deregulated hepcidin-ferroportin axis, with higher hepcidin levels. Viral invasion may also affect erythrocytes/erythroid precursors, endothelial cells and macrophages, through SA and CD147 receptors, with relative hemoglobin and iron/calcium dysmetabolism. AB0 blood group, hemochromatosis, or environmental elements may represent possible factors which affect individual susceptibility to COVID-19.     Conclusions: our literature analysis confirms the combined role of SA molecules, ACE2, CD147, viroporins and hepcidin in determining the cation dysmetabolism and final ferroptosis in the cells infected by SARS-CoV-2. The altered ion channels and electrochemical gradients of the cell membrane have a pivotal role in the virus entry and cell dysmetabolism, with subsequent multi-organ immune-inflammatory degeneration and erythrocyte/hemoglobin alterations.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">How to build phylogenetic species trees with OMA [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Knowledge of species phylogeny is critical to many fields of biology. In an era of genome data availability, the most common way to make a phylogenetic species tree is by using multiple protein-coding genes, conserved in multiple species. This methodology is composed of several steps: orthology inference, multiple sequence alignment and inference of the phylogeny with dedicated tools. This can be a difficult task, and orthology inference, in particular, is usually computationally intensive and error prone if done ad hoc. This tutorial provides protocols to make use of OMA Orthologous Groups, a set of genes all orthologous to each other, to infer a phylogenetic species tree. It is designed to be user-friendly and computationally inexpensive, by providing two options: (1) Using only precomputed groups with species available on the OMA Browser, or (2) Computing orthologs using OMA Standalone for additional species, with the option of using precomputed orthology relations for those present in OMA. A protocol for downstream analyses is provided as well, including creating a supermatrix, tree inference, and visualization. All protocols use publicly available software, and we provide scripts and code snippets to facilitate data handling. The protocols are accompanied with practical examples.

                The persistence of infectious diseases that continue to plague the world, as well as the formation of harmful substances within the human body, such as free radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS) have sparked new research. Thus, the need for innovative approaches for developing new or modification of existing therapeutic agents. The design of biologically important metal complexes of dithiocarbamates (DTCs) has been made possible by recent advancements in innovative research. Dithiocarbamates are reduced thiuram disulfides with excellent complexing capabilities and have various applications. They are potent and work in tandem with the core metal ions of coordinating compounds to produce synergistic effects. Dithiocarbamates have many uses, including as antidotes for metal poisoning, cisplatin or carboplatin toxicity, and clinical trials for cancer, Lyme disease, human immunodeficiency virus and antibiotics. They exert anti-oxidant effect in cells. The understanding of the mechanisms of action of this therapeutic agent is important in drug repurposing. This review highlights the protective and therapeutic properties of dithiocarbamate compounds in biological systems.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Duration of dry and humidified incubation of single-step embryo culture medium and oxygen tension during sham culture do not alter metabolomics signature [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The extended embryo culture using single-step medium gained popularity in clinical in vitro fertilisation (IVF). However, there are concerns about the degradation of unstable medium components and their negative effects on the developing embryos. Further, dry-incubation can increase osmolality, which can in-turn enhance the concentration of constituents of the media and their stability. Hence, this study was conducted to understand the immediate changes in the culture media metabolites in relation to clinically comparable situations such as single-step extended embryo culture and use of dry and humidified-incubation in two-different gaseous conditions. Methods: Commercially available single-step medium was sham-cultured in droplets under oil in two different conditions viz. dry (37°C; 6%CO2; 5%O2) and humidified (37°C; 6% CO2; atmospheric O2) for 0h, 72h, and 120h intervals. Droplets were subjected to the sensitivity-enhanced nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based profiling using 800 MHz NMR equipped with a cryogenically cooled micro-coil (1.7mm) probe. Metabolomic signatures between the two groups were comprehensively assessed. Results: A total of ten amino acids and four energy substrates were identified from the culture medium. Metabolite levels showed a non-significant increase in the dry-incubation group at 72h and then declined at 120h. Humidified incubation had no effects on the level of the metabolite until 120h. No significant differences in the levels of metabolites were observed between the dry and humidified-groups at various time-points tested. Conclusions: A non-significant variation in the levels of metabolites observed in the dry-incubation of single-step medium most unlikely to influence a clinical outcome. However, the impact of these subtle changes on the (epi)genetic integrity of the embryos in a clinical set-up to be addressed.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Implementation of a Teleneurology Clinic in Zambia during the COVID‐19 Pandemic</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and benefits of a teleneurology clinic serving adults usually attending a neurology outpatient clinic in Lusaka, Zambia during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Televisits were offered to patients scheduled for neurology appointments between March and July 2020 using the telephone, WhatsApp video, or Zoom calls based on patient accessibility. Visit outcomes were documented, and patient and neurologist satisfaction surveys were completed.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of 323 patients, 195 (60%) were reachable by telephone, 179 of these were alive, and 74% (133/179) of those alive agreed to a televisit. Stroke (30%), seizures (20%), and headache (16%) were the most common diagnoses seen via televisit. Most televisits (80%) were by telephone call, 14% by WhatsApp video call, and 6% by Zoom. Nearly one-third (30%) of the patients were stable and discharged from the clinic, 32% only required medication refills, and 19% required an in-person visit. Sixty patients (out of 85 reachable and 71% response rate) and 7 of 9 neurologists (78% response rate) completed satisfaction surveys. Neurologists reported greater assessment confidence with Zoom, but confidence was high for all modalities. Patients preferring televisits (75%, 45/60) noted reduced expense and time requirements, whereas those preferring in-person visits (22%, 13/60) cited the desire for physical examinations. Overall, 98% of patients and 100% of neurologists were satisfied with televisits.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Teleneurology visits were acceptable and feasible for adults attending an outpatient neurology clinic in Zambia and their neurologists. They offer a promising supplement to in-person visits in resource-limited settings, even when video-conference capabilities and electronic medical records are absent.

                <p>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 infection) can lead to intensive care unit (ICU) admission and critical illness myopathy (CIM). We examined 3 ICU patients with COVID-19 who required mechanical ventilation for pneumonia and developed CIM. Pathological examination of the skeletal muscle biopsies revealed myopathic changes consistent with CIM, variable inflammation with autophagic vacuoles, SARS-CoV immunostaining + fibers/granules, and electron microscopy findings of mitochondrial abnormalities and coronavirus-like particles. Although mitochondrial dysfunction with compromised energy production is a critical pathogenic mechanism of non-COVID-19-associated CIM, in our series of COVID-19-associated CIM, myopathic changes including prominent mitochondrial damage suggest a similar mechanism and association with direct SARS-CoV-2 muscle infection.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Online academic satisfaction during the COVID-19 pandemic in medical students: role of sleep, emotions, college adjustment, and digital skills [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The measures taken to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, led to significant changes in university education, resulting in the new normal standard of virtual teaching in many undergraduate medical schools worldwide. Therefore, the aim of this paper was to determine the factors related to academic satisfaction with virtual teaching in medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A cross-sectional-analytical study was conducted on medical students at a private university in Peru, through self-reported questionnaires divided into sociodemographic data and variables of interest that could influence academic satisfaction during the pandemic. To evaluate possible factors related to academic satisfaction, stepwise regression models were performed for both sexes. Results: In total, data from 310 medical students, 117 males and 193 females, were analyzed. Academic satisfaction reached a score of 11.2 ± 2.9, which was similar in both sexes. The best regression model for males (AIC: 544.32; RMSE: 2.42; R2: 0.30) showed that adaptation to university life (favorable change) and depression (unfavorable change) explained 30% of changes in students' academic satisfaction. While in females (AIC: 907.59; RMSE: 2.49; R 2: 0.22) the model integrated favorable factors such as adjustment to college life and anxiety; while depression and poor sleep quality were unfavorable factors. Conclusion: Factors that contributed to academic satisfaction in medical students were determined in this study, which differed by gender. Thus, it is important to take into account the particularities of male and female medical students in order to improve their academic satisfaction during their university careers.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Consistent population activity on the scale of minutes in the mouse hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Neurons in the hippocampus fire in consistent sequence over the timescale of seconds during the delay period of some memory experiments. For longer timescales, the firing of hippocampal neurons also changes slowly over minutes within experimental sessions. It was thought that these slow dynamics are caused by stochastic drift or a continuous change in the representation of the episode, rather than consistent sequences unfolding over minutes. This paper studies the consistency of contextual drift in three chronic calcium imaging recordings from the hippocampus CA1 region in mice. Computational measures of consistency show reliable sequences within experimental trials at the scale of seconds as one would expect from time cells or place cells during the trial, as well as across experimental trials on the scale of minutes within a recording session. Consistent sequences in the hippocampus are observed over a wide range of time scales, from seconds to minutes. The hippocampal activity could reflect a scale-invariant spatiotemporal context as suggested by theories of memory from cognitive psychology.</p>

                Background: Automation has increasingly become more commonplace in the research laboratory workspace. The introduction of articulated robotic arms allows the researcher more flexibility in the tasks a single piece of automated machinery can perform. We set out to incorporate automation in processing of genomic DNA organic extractions to increase throughput and limit researchers to the exposure of organic solvents. Methods: In order to automate the genome sequencing pipeline in our laboratory, we programmed a dual-arm anthropomorphic robot, the Robotic Biology Institute's Maholo LabDroid, to perform organic solvent-based genomic DNA extraction from cell lysates. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that automation of phenol-chloroform extraction has been reported. Results: We achieved routine extraction of high molecular weight genomic DNA (>100 kb) from diverse biological samples including algae cultured in sea water, bacteria, whole insects, and human cell lines. The results of pulse-field electrophoresis size analysis and the N50 sequencing metrics of reads obtained from Nanopore MinION runs verified the presence of intact DNA suitable for direct sequencing. Conclusions: We present the workflow that can be used to program similar robots and discuss the problems and solutions we encountered in developing the workflow. The protocol can be adapted to analogous methods such as RNA extraction, and there is ongoing work to incorporate further post-extraction steps such as library construction. This work shows the potential for automated robotic workflows to free molecular biological researchers from manual interventions in routine experimental work. A time-lapse movie of the entire automated run is included in this report.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">Interbrain synchrony: on wavy ground</a></h4>

              
                In recent years the study of dynamic, between-brain coupling mechanisms has taken social neuroscience by storm. In particular, interbrain synchrony (IBS) is a putative neural mechanism said to promote social interactions by enabling the functional integration of multiple brains. In this article, I argue that this research is beset with three pervasive and interrelated problems. First, the field lacks a widely accepted definition of IBS. Second, IBS wants for theories that can guide the design and interpretation of experiments.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Perception is associated with the brain's metabolic response to sensory stimulation</a></h4>

              
                Processing of incoming sensory stimulation triggers an increase of cerebral perfusion and blood oxygenation (neurovascular response) as well as an alteration of the metabolic neurochemical profile (neurometabolic response). Here we show in human primary visual cortex (V1) that perceived and unperceived isoluminant chromatic flickering stimuli designed to have similar neurovascular responses as measured by blood oxygenation level dependent functional MRI (BOLD-fMRI) have markedly different neurometabolic responses as measured by functional MRS. In particular, a significant regional buildup of lactate, an index of aerobic glycolysis, and glutamate, an index of malate-aspartate shuttle, occurred in V1 only when the flickering was perceived, without any relation with behavioral or physiological variables. Whereas the BOLD-fMRI signal in V1, a proxy for input to V1, was insensitive to flickering perception by design, the BOLD-fMRI signal in secondary visual areas was larger during perceived than unperceived flickering, indicating increased output from V1. These results demonstrate that the upregulation of energy metabolism induced by visual stimulation depends on the type of information processing taking place in V1, and that 1H-fMRS provides unique information about local input/output balance that is not measured by BOLD fMRI.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Target-specific control of olfactory bulb periglomerular cells by GABAergic and cholinergic basal forebrain inputs</a></h4>

              
                The olfactory bulb (OB), the first relay for odor processing in the brain, receives dense GABAergic and cholinergic long-range projections from basal forebrain (BF) nuclei that provide information about the internal state and behavioral context of the animal. However, the targets, impact and dynamic of these afferents are still unclear. I studied how BF synaptic inputs modulate activity in diverse subtypes of periglomerular (PG) interneurons using optogenetic stimulation and loose cell-attached or whole-cell patch-clamp recording in OB slices from adult mice. GABAergic BF inputs potently blocked PG cells firing except in a minority of calretinin-expressing cells in which GABA release elicited spiking. Parallel cholinergic projections excited a previously overlooked PG cell subtype via synaptic activation of M1 muscarinic receptors. Low frequency stimulation of the cholinergic axons drove persistent firing in these PG cells thereby increasing tonic inhibition in principal neurons. Taken together, these findings suggest that modality-specific BF inputs can orchestrate synaptic inhibition in OB glomeruli using multiple, potentially independent, inhibitory or excitatory target-specific pathways.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Augmentation of progestin signaling rescues testis organization and spermatogenesis in zebrafish with the depletion of androgen signaling</a></h4>

              
                Disruption of androgen signaling is known to cause testicular malformation and defective spermatogenesis in zebrafish. However, knockout of <i>cyp17a1</i>, a key enzyme responsible for the androgen synthesis, in <i>ar</i>-/- male zebrafish paradoxically causes testicular hypertrophy and enhanced spermatogenesis. Because Cyp17a1 plays key roles in hydroxylation of pregnenolone and progesterone (P4), and convert of 17α-hydroxypregnenolone to dehydroepiandrosterone and 17α-hydroxyprogesterone to androstenedione, we hypothesize that the unexpected phenotype in <i>cyp17a1</i>-/-;<i>androgen receptor</i> (<i>ar</i>)-/- zebrafish may be mediated through an augmentation of progestin/nuclear progestin receptor (nPgr) signaling. In support of this hypothesis, we show that knockout of <i>cyp17a1</i> leads to accumulation of 17α,20β-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one (DHP) and P4. Further, administration of progestin, a synthetic DHP mimetic, is sufficient to rescue testicular development and spermatogenesis in <i>ar</i>-/- zebrafish, whereas knockout of <i>npgr</i> abolishes the rescue effect of <i>cyp17a1</i>-/- in the <i>cyp17a1</i>-/-;<i>ar</i>-/- double mutant. Analyses of the transcriptomes among the mutants with defective testicular organization and spermatogenesis (<i>ar</i>-/-, <i>ar</i>-/-;<i>npgr</i>-/- and <i>cyp17a</i>-/-;<i>ar</i>-/-;<i>npgr</i>-/-), those with normal phenotype (Control and <i>cyp17a1</i>-/-), and rescued phenotype (<i>cyp17a1</i>-/-;<i>ar</i>-/-) reveal a common link between a down-regulated expression of <i>insl3</i> and its related downstream genes in <i>cyp17a</i>-/-;<i>ar</i>-/-;<i>npgr</i>-/- zebrafish. Taken together, our data suggest that genetic or pharmacological augmentation of the progestin/nPgr pathway is sufficient to restore testis organization and spermatogenesis in zebrafish with the depletion of androgen signaling.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Ribosome profiling of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus reveals novel features of viral gene expression</a></h4>

              
                Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is an arterivirus which causes significant economic losses to the swine industry worldwide. Here, we use ribosome profiling (RiboSeq) and parallel RNA sequencing (RNASeq) to characterise the transcriptome and translatome of both species of PRRSV and to analyse the host response to infection. We quantified viral gene expression over a timecourse of infection, and calculated the efficiency of programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) at both sites on the viral genome. At the nsp2 frameshift site (a rare example of protein-stimulated frameshifting), −2 PRF efficiency increases over time, likely facilitated by accumulation of the PRF-stimulatory viral protein (nsp1β) during infection. This marks arteriviruses as the second example of temporally regulated PRF. Surprisingly, we find that PRF efficiency at the canonical ORF1ab frameshift site also increases over time, in apparent contradiction of the common assumption that RNA structure-directed frameshift sites operate at a fixed efficiency. This has potential implications for the numerous other viruses with canonical PRF sites. Furthermore, we discovered several highly translated additional viral ORFs, the translation of which may be facilitated by multiple novel viral transcripts. For example, we found a 125-codon ORF overlapping nsp12, which is expressed as highly as nsp12 itself at late stages of replication, and is likely translated from novel subgenomic (sg) RNA transcripts that overlap the 3′ end of ORF1b. Similar transcripts were discovered for both PRRSV-1 and PRRSV-2, suggesting a potential conserved mechanism for temporal regulation of expression of the 3′-proximal region of ORF1b. In addition, we identified a highly translated, short upstream ORF (uORF) in the 5′ UTR, the presence of which is highly conserved amongst PRRSV-2 isolates. This is the first application of RiboSeq to arterivirus-infected cells, and reveals new features which add to the complexity of gene expression programmes in this important family of nidoviruses.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Identification of bipotent progenitors that give rise to myogenic and connective tissues in mouse</a></h4>

              
                How distinct cell fates are manifested by direct lineage ancestry from bipotent progenitors, or by specification of individual cell types is a key question for understanding the emergence of tissues. The interplay between skeletal muscle progenitors and associated connective tissue cells provides a model for examining how muscle functional units are established. Most craniofacial structures originate from the vertebrate-specific neural crest cells except in the dorsal portion of the head, where they arise from cranial mesoderm. Here, using multiple lineage-tracing strategies combined with single cell RNAseq and in situ analyses, we identify bipotent progenitors expressing <i>Myf5 </i>(an upstream regulator of myogenic fate) that give rise to both muscle and juxtaposed connective tissue. Following this bifurcation, muscle and connective tissue cells retain complementary signalling features and maintain spatial proximity. Disrupting myogenic identity shifts muscle progenitors to a connective tissue fate. The emergence of <i>Myf5</i>-derived connective tissue is associated with the activity of several transcription factors, including <i>Foxp2</i>. Interestingly, this unexpected bifurcation in cell fate was not observed in craniofacial regions that are colonised by neural crest cells. Therefore, we propose that an ancestral bi-fated program gives rise to muscle and connective tissue cells in skeletal muscles that are deprived of neural crest cells.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Competition between parallel sensorimotor learning systems</a></h4>

              
                Sensorimotor learning is supported by at least two parallel systems: a strategic process that benefits from explicit knowledge, and an implicit process that adapts subconsciously. How do these systems interact? Does one system's contributions suppress the other, or do they operate independently? Here we illustrate that during reaching, implicit and explicit systems both learn from visual target errors. This shared error leads to competition such that an increase in the explicit system's response siphons away resources that are needed for implicit adaptation, thus reducing its learning. As a result, steady-state implicit learning can vary across experimental conditions, due to changes in strategy. Furthermore, strategies can mask changes in implicit learning properties, such as its error sensitivity. These ideas, however, become more complex in conditions where subjects adapt using multiple visual landmarks, a situation which introduces learning from sensory prediction errors in addition to target errors. These two types of implicit errors can oppose each other, leading to another type of competition. Thus, during sensorimotor adaptation, implicit and explicit learning systems compete for a common resource: error.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Apelin signaling dependent endocardial protrusions promote cardiac trabeculation in zebrafish</a></h4>

              
                During cardiac development, endocardial cells (EdCs) produce growth factors to promote myocardial morphogenesis and growth. In particular, EdCs produce Neuregulin which is required for ventricular cardiomyocytes (CMs) to seed the multicellular ridges known as trabeculae. Defects in Neuregulin signaling, or in endocardial sprouting towards CMs, cause hypotrabeculation. However, the mechanisms underlying endocardial sprouting remain largely unknown. Here, we first show by live imaging in zebrafish embryos that EdCs interact with CMs via dynamic membrane protrusions. After touching CMs, these protrusions remain in close contact with their target despite the vigorous cardiac contractions. Loss of the CM-derived peptide Apelin, or of the Apelin receptor, which is expressed in EdCs, leads to reduced endocardial sprouting and hypotrabeculation. Mechanistically, Neuregulin signaling requires endocardial protrusions to induce extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) activity in CMs and trigger their delamination. Altogether, these data show that Apelin signaling dependent endocardial protrusions modulate CM behavior during trabeculation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Global and context-specific transcriptional consequences of oncogenic Fbw7 mutations</a></h4>

              
                The Fbw7 ubiquitin ligase targets many proteins for proteasomal degradation, which include oncogenic transcription factors (TFs) (e.g., c-Myc, c-Jun, Notch). Fbw7 is a tumor suppressor and tumors often contain mutations in <i>FBXW7</i>, the gene that encodes Fbw7. The complexity of its substrate network has obscured the mechanisms of Fbw7-associated tumorigenesis, yet this understanding is needed for developing therapies. We used an integrated approach employing RNA-Seq and high-resolution mapping (CUT&amp;RUN) of histone modifications and TF occupancy (c-Jun and c-Myc) to examine the combinatorial effects of mis-regulated Fbw7 substrates in colorectal cancer cells with engineered tumor-associated <i>FBXW7</i> null or missense mutations. Both Fbw7 mutations caused widespread transcriptional changes associated with active chromatin and altered TF occupancy: some were common to both Fbw7 mutant cell lines, whereas others were mutation specific. We identified loci where both Jun and Myc were co-regulated by Fbw7, suggesting that substrates may have synergistic effects. One co-regulated gene was <i>CIITA</i>, the master regulator of MHC Class II gene expression. Fbw7 loss increased MHC Class II expression and Fbw7 mutations were correlated with increased CIITA expression in TCGA colorectal tumors and cell lines, which may have immunotherapeutic implications for Fbw7-associated cancers. Analogous studies in neural stem cells in which <i>FBXW7</i> had been acutely deleted closely mirrored the results in colorectal cancer cells. Gene set enrichment analyses revealed Fbw7-asssociated pathways that were conserved across both cell types that may reflect fundamental Fbw7 functions. These analyses provide a framework for understanding normal and neoplastic context specific Fbw7 functions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Hippocampal GFAP-positive astrocyte responses to amyloid and tau pathologies</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: In Alzheimer's disease clinical research, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) released in the cerebrospinal fluid and blood is widely measured and perceived as a biomarker of reactive astrogliosis. However, it was recently demonstrated that plasma GFAP levels are associated with amyloid-beta (Abeta) but not tau pathology. The molecular underpinnings behind this specificity are unexplored. Here we investigated biomarker and transcriptomic associations of GFAP-positive astrocytes with Abeta and tau pathologies in humans and mouse models. Methods: We studied 90 individuals with plasma GFAP, Abeta- and Tau-PET to investigate the association between biomarkers. Then, transcriptomic analysis in hippocampal GFAP-positive astrocytes isolated from mouse models presenting Abeta (PS2APP) or tau (P301S) pathologies was applied to explore differentially expressed genes (DEGs), Gene Ontology processes, and protein-protein interaction networks associated with each phenotype. Findings: In humans, we found that plasma GFAP associates with Abeta but not tau pathology. Supporting these results, mouse transcriptomics showed scarce overlap of DEGs between the Abeta and tau mouse models, revealing the unique nature of GFAP-positive astrocytic responses to Abeta or tau pathology. While Abeta GFAP-positive astrocytes were overrepresented with genes associated with proteostasis and exocytosis-related processes, tau hippocampal GFAP-positive astrocytes presented greater abnormalities in functions related to DNA/RNA processing and cytoskeleton dynamics. Interpretation: Our results offer insights into Abeta and tau-driven specific signatures in GFAP-positive astrocytes. Characterizing how different underlying pathologies distinctly influence astrocyte responses is critical for the biological interpretation of astrocyte-related biomarker and suggests the need to develop context-specific astrocyte targets to study AD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Fast and functionally specific cortical thickness changes induced by visual stimulation</a></h4>

              
                Structural characteristics of the human brain serve as important markers of brain development, aging, disease progression and neural plasticity. They are considered stable properties, changing slowly over time. Multiple recent studies reported that structural brain changes measured with MRI may occur much faster than previously thought, happening on a time scale as fast as several minutes. The mechanisms behind such fast changes remain unclear, with hemodynamics as one possible explanation. Here we investigated the functional specificity of cortical thickness changes induced by a flickering checkerboard stimulus. We also compared the thickness effects to those measured with BOLD fMRI. We found that checkerboard stimulation led to a significant thickness increase, which was functionally specific to V1 and spatially confined to the retinotopic representation of the checkerboard stimulus. Although functional specificity and the effect size of these changes were comparable to those of the BOLD signal in V1, thickness effects were substantially weaker in V3. Furthermore, a comparison of predicted and measured thickness changes for different stimulus timings suggested a slow increase of thickness over time, speaking against a hemodynamic explanation. Altogether, our findings suggest that visual stimulation can induce structural gray matter enlargement measurable with MRI.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Memory Consolidation with Orthogonal Gradients for avoiding Catastrophic Forgetting</a></h4>

              
                The memory consolidation process enables the accumulation of recent and remote memories in the long-term memory store. In general, the deep network models of memory suffer from forgetting old information while learning new information, called catastrophic forgetting/interference. The human brain overcomes this problem quite effectively, a problem that continues to challenge current deep neural network models. We propose a regularization-based model to solve the problem of catastrophic forgetting. According to the proposed training mechanism, the network parameters are constrained to vary in a direction orthogonal to the average of the error gradients corresponding to the previous tasks. We also ensure that the constraint used in parameter updating satisfies the locality principle. The proposed model's performance is compared with Elastic Weight Consolidation on standard datasets such as permuted MNIST and split MNIST on classification tasks using fully connected networks, and Convolution-based networks. The model performance is also compared to an autoencoder on split MNIST dataset, and to complex core50 dataset on two types of classification tasks with EWC. The proposed model gives a new view on plasticity at the neuronal level. In the proposed model, the parameter updating is controlled by the neuronal level plasticity rather than synapse level plasticity as in other standard models. The biological plausibility of the proposed model is discussed by linking the extra parameters to synaptic tagging, which represents the state of the synapse involved in Long Term Potentiation (LTP).

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Deciphering the developmental patterns of white matter tracts in a diffusion MRI based fetal brain atlas</a></h4>

              
                White matter of the fetal brain undergoes rapid development to form the early structural connections. Diffusion MRI has shown to be a useful tool to depict the fetal brain white matter in utero, and many studies have observed increasing fractional anisotropy and decreasing mean diffusivity in the fetal brain during the second-to-third trimester, whereas others reported non-monotonic changes. Unbiased diffusion MRI atlases of the fetal brain are important for characterizing developmental trajectories of white matter and providing normative references for in-utero diagnosis of prenatal abnormalities. To date, the sole fetal brain diffusion MRI atlas was collected from a Caucasian/mixed population, and was constructed based on the diffusion tensor model with limited spatial resolution.

In this work, we proposed a fiber orientation distribution (FOD) based pipeline for the generation of fetal brain diffusion MRI atlases, which showed better registration accuracy than diffusion tensor-based pipeline. Based on the FOD pipeline, we constructed the first Chinese fetal brain diffusion MRI atlas using 89 normal fetal diffusion MRI scans at GA between 24 and 38 weeks. Complex non-monotonic trends of tensor- and FOD-derived microstructural parameters in eight white matter tracts were observed, which jointly pointed to different phases of microstructural development. Specifically, we speculated that the turning point of the diffusivity trajectory may correspond to the starting point of pre-myelination, based on which, the developmental order of white matter tracts can be mapped and the order was in agreement with order of myelination from histological studies. The normative atlas also provided a reference for detection of abnormal white matter development, such as that in congenital heart disease. Therefore, the high-order fetal brain diffusion MRI atlas established in this study depicted the spatiotemporal pattern of early white matter development, and findings may help decipher the distinct microstructural events in utero.

                Age-related decline in intestinal barrier function impacts survival across species, but the underlying cell intrinsic and extrinsic factors remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate a role for neuropeptides in regulating aging-associated increases in intestinal leakiness. Adult-specific knockdown of insulin-like peptides daf-28 or ins-7 in C. elegans neurons or dilp3 in D. melanogaster neurons improves intestinal integrity and lifespan of these animals, respectively. Neuropeptide knockdowns activate intestinal DAF-16/FOXO transcription factor that likely increases expression of epithelial barrier components. Furthermore, age-associated changes in neuronal DAF-28 peptide secretion mirrors C. elegans reproductive span and overexpression of this peptide suppresses the improved intestinal health in long-lived germline-less animals. Collectively, we show that intestinal integrity is subject to neuronal regulation, and this neuropeptidergic axis may be modulated by the animals germline.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A molecular mechanism for high salt taste in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                Dietary salt detection and consumption are crucial to maintaining fluid and ionic homeostasis. To optimize salt intake, animals employ salt-dependent activation of multiple taste pathways. Generally, sodium activates attractive taste cells, but attraction is overridden at high salt concentrations by cation non-selective activation of aversive taste cells. In flies, high salt avoidance is driven by both  bitter taste neurons and a class of glutamatergic  high salt neurons expressing pickpocket23 (ppk23). Although the cellular basis of salt taste has been described, many of the molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we show that ionotropic receptor 7c (IR7c) is expressed in glutamatergic high salt neurons, where it functions with co-receptors IR76b and IR25a to detect high salt. Misexpression of IR7c in sweet neurons, which endogenously express IR76b and IR25a, confers responsiveness to non-sodium salts, indicating that IR7c is sufficient to convert a sodium-selective receptor to a cation non-selective receptor. Furthermore, the resultant transformation of taste neuron tuning switches potassium chloride from an aversive to an attractive tastant. This research provides insight into the molecular basis of monovalent and divalent salt taste coding and the full repertoire of IRs needed to form a functional salt receptor.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">TMS over dorsolateral prefrontal cortex affects the timing of motor imagery but not overt action: further support for the Motor-Cognitive model</a></h4>

              
                The Motor-Cognitive model suggests a functional dissociation between motor imagery and overt action, in contrast to the traditional notion of shared processes central to the Functional Equivalence view. According to the Motor-Cognitive model, motor imagery differs from overt action primarily through the use of executive resources to monitor and elaborate a motor image during execution. This can result in a lack of correspondence between motor imagery and its overt action counterpart. The present study examined the importance of executive resources in motor imagery using TMS to impair the function of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, while measuring the time to complete imagined versus overt actions. In two experiments, TMS over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex slowed motor imagery but did not affect overt actions. TMS over the same region also interfered with performance of a mental calculation task, though it did not reliably affect less demanding cognitive tasks also thought to rely on executive functions. Taken together, these results were consistent with the Motor-Cognitive model but not with the idea of functional equivalence. The implications of these results for the theoretical understanding of motor imagery, and potential applications of the Motor-Cognitive model to the use of motor imagery in training and rehabilitation, are discussed.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Opioid Antagonism in Humans: A Primer on Optimal Dose and Timing for Central Mu-Opioid Receptor Blockade</a></h4>

              
                Non-human animal studies outline precise mechanisms of central mu-opioid regulation of pain, stress, affiliation and reward processing. In humans, pharmacological blockade with non-selective opioid antagonists such as naloxone and naltrexone is typically used to assess involvement of the mu-opioid system in such processing. However, robust estimates of the opioid receptor blockade achieved by opioid antagonists are missing. Dose and timing schedules are highly variable and often based on single studies. Here, we provide a detailed analysis of central opioid receptor blockade after opioid antagonism based on existing positron emission tomography data. We also create models for estimating opioid receptor blockade with intravenous naloxone and oral naltrexone. We find that common doses of intravenous naloxone (0.10-0.15 mg/kg) and oral naltrexone (50 mg) are more than sufficient to produce full blockade of central MOR (>90% receptor occupancy) for the duration of a typical experimental session ([~]60 minutes), presumably due to initial super saturation of receptors. Simulations indicate that these doses also produce high KOR blockade (78-100%) and some DOR blockade (10% with naltrexone and 48-74% with naloxone). Lower doses (e.g., 0.01 mg/kg intravenous naloxone) are estimated to produce less DOR and KOR blockade while still achieving a high level of MOR blockade over [~]30 minutes. The models and simulations form the basis of two novel web applications for detailed planning and evaluation of experiments with opioid antagonists. These tools and recommendations enable selection of appropriate antagonists, doses and assessment time points, and determination of the achieved receptor blockade in previous studies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Basolateral amygdala to insular cortex activity makes sign-tracking behavior insensitive to outcome value</a></h4>

              
                Goal-tracking rats are sensitive to Pavlovian outcome devaluation while sign-tracking rats are devaluation insensitive. During outcome devaluation, goal-tracking (GT) rats flexibly modify responding to cues based on the current value of the associated outcome. However, sign-tracking (ST) rats rigidly respond to cues regardless of the current outcome value. Our prior study demonstrated disconnection of the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and anterior insular cortex (aIC) decreased both goal- and sign-tracking behaviors. Given the role of these regions in appetitive motivation and behavioral flexibility we predicted that disrupting BLA to aIC pathway during outcome devaluation would reduce flexibility in GT rats and reduce rigid appetitive motivation in ST rats. We inhibited the BLA to aIC pathway by infusing inhibitory DREADDs (hM4Di-mcherry) or control (mCherry) virus into the BLA and implanted cannulae into the aIC to inhibit BLA terminals using intracranial injections of clozapine N-oxide (CNO). After training, we used a within subject satiety-induced outcome devaluation procedure in which we sated rats on training pellets (devalued condition) or homecage chow (valued condition). All rats received bilateral CNO infusions into the aIC prior to brief non-reinforced test sessions. Contrary to our hypothesis, BLA-IC inhibition did not interfere with devaluation sensitivity in GT rats but did make ST behaviors sensitive to devaluation. Intermediate rats showed the opposite effect, showing rigid in responding to cues with BLA-aIC pathway inactivation. Together, these results demonstrate BLA-IC projections mediate tracking-specific Pavlovian devaluation sensitivity and highlights the importance of considering individual differences in Pavlovian approach when evaluating circuitry contributions to behavioral flexibility.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Temporally extended and reversible neuronal silencing with Aion</a></h4>

              
                Optogenetic silencing allows to reveal the necessity of selected neuronal populations for various neurophysiological functions ranging from specific behaviors to neuronal network activity. An ideal optogenetic silencing tool should be switchable between active and inactive states with precise timing while preserving its activity in the absence of light until switched to an inactive state. Although bistable anion-conducting channelrhodopsins (ACRs) were previously engineered to reach this goal, their conducting state life time was limited to only a few minutes and some ACRs were not fully switchable. Here we report Aion, a bistable ACR displaying a long-lasting open state with a spontaneous closing time constant close to 15 min. Moreover, Aion can be switched between the open and closed state with millisecond precision using blue and orange light, respectively. The long conducting state enables overnight silencing of neurons with minimal light exposure. We further generated trafficking-optimized versions of Aion, which show enhanced membrane localization and allow precisely timed, long-lasting all-optical control of nociceptive responses in larvae of Drosophila melanogaster.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Meta-Analysis of the Functional Neuroimaging Literature with Probabilistic Logic Programming</a></h4>

              
                Inferring reliable brain-behavior associations requires synthesizing evidence from thousands of functional neuroimaging studies through meta-analysis. However, existing meta-analysis tools are limited to investigating simple neuroscience concepts and expressing a restricted range of questions. Here, we expand the scope of neuroimaging meta-analysis by designing NeuroLang: a domain-specific language to express and test hypotheses using probabilistic first-order logic programming. By leveraging formalisms found at the crossroads of artificial intelligence and knowledge representation, NeuroLang provides the expressivity to address a larger repertoire of hypotheses in a meta-analysis, while seamlessly modelling the uncertainty inherent to neuroimaging data. We demonstrate the language's capabilities in conducting comprehensive neuroimaging meta-analysis through use-case examples that address questions of structure-function associations. Specifically, we infer the specific functional roles of three canonical brain networks, support the role of the visual word-form area in visuospatial attention, and investigate the heterogeneous organization of the fronto-parietal control network.

	<p>High-grade pediatric glioma (p-HGG&amp;amp;mdash;WHO 2021, formerly GBM&amp;amp;mdash;WHO 2016), as a common, aggressive, and highly lethal primary brain malignancy in adults, accounts for only 3&amp;amp;ndash;15% of primary brain tumors in pediatric patients. After leukemia, brain malignancies are the second most common in the pediatric population and first in incidences concerning solid tumors. This study was designed on the basis of 14 pediatric patients hospitalized at Children&amp;amp;rsquo;s Memorial Health Institute in Warsaw, Poland, due to p-HGG treatment. All the patients had a histopathological diagnosis performed by an experienced neuropathologist according to WHO guidelines (WHO 2016 Grade IV Glioblastoma). A significant correlation was found between the miR-155 concentration and the level of PD-L1 expression in p-HGG tumor tissue. Very few reports have indicated PD-L1 expression in pediatric patients.</p>

	<p>Monitoring the level of responsiveness of patients with Disorders of Consciousness (DoCs) represents an issue in all the settings where there is not the daily presence of clinicians, such as long-term and domestic settings. The involvement of patients&amp;amp;rsquo; informal caregivers (i.e., patients&amp;amp;rsquo; family) in such a monitoring process is thus fundamental. However, to date, no standardized tailored-made instruments exist that informal caregivers can use without the presence of clinicians, despite evidence illustrating the good accuracy of caregivers when expressing their opinions about the level of responsiveness of DoC patients. The present work aims to set the foundational knowledge, to create a standardized instrument that is able to assess the level of responsiveness of patients with DoCs by their informal caregivers. After selecting and modifying the items to be included in the new scale from the gold standard to diagnose DoCs (i.e., the Coma Recovery Scale-revised), and following a consensus process, we created the Social and Family Evaluation (SAFE) scale for caregivers of patients with DoCs. Although the SAFE needs a validation process, with the present work we provided its preliminary description along with insights into its clinical utility.</p>

	<p>Our study aimed to assess functional, structural changes of the right ventricular using strain parameters and sleep structure using polysomnography in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Our study group consisted of 43 patients, 29 men, 14 women. The mean age was 56.36 &amp;amp;plusmn; 14.77. All patients underwent full night polysomnography and transthoracic echocardiography. The right ventricular global longitudinal strain was measured by 2D speckle-tracking echocardiography. The prevalence of OSA (AHI &amp;amp;ge; 5) was 76.7% in the studied group. We observed a significant positive correlation between OAH and average free wall strain (r = 0.37), snore and mid-free wall strain (r = 0.34), average HR, and basal free wall strain (r = 0.34). Moreover, CSB was positively correlated with basal septal strain and mid septal strain (r = 0.36 and 0.42). In summary, among patients with sleep disorders, functional disorders of the right ventricle, assessed using the strain method, are partly observed.</p>

	<p>Objective: While cavernous carotid aneurysms can cause neurological symptoms, their often-uneventful natural course and the increasing options of intravascular aneurysm closure call for educated decision-making. However, evidence-based guidelines are missing. Here, we report 64 patients with cavernous carotid aneurysms, their respective therapeutic strategies, and follow-up. Methods: We included all patients with cavernous carotid aneurysms who presented to our clinic between 2014 and 2020 and recorded comorbidities (elevated blood pressure, diabetes mellitus, and nicotine consumption), PHASES score, aneurysm site, size and shape, therapeutic strategy, neurological deficits, and clinical follow-up. Results: The mean age of the 64 patients (86% female) was 53 years, the mean follow-up time was 3.8 years. A total of 22 patients suffered from cranial nerve deficit. Of these patients, 50% showed a relief of symptoms regardless of the therapy regime. We found no significant correlations between aneurysm size or PHASES score and the occurrence of neurological symptoms. Conclusion: If aneurysm specific symptoms persist over a longer period of time, relief is difficult to achieve despite aneurysm treatment. Patients should be advised by experts in neurovascular centers, weighing the possibility of an uneventful course against the risks of treatment. In this regard, more detailed prospective data is needed to improve individual patient counseling.</p>

	<p>Despite an abundance of research related to the functional and structural changes of the brain in patients with geriatric depression, knowledge related to early alterations such as decreased white matter connectivity and their association with cognitive decline remains lacking. We aimed to investigate early alterations in hippocampal microstructure and identify their associations with memory function in geriatric patients with subclinical depression. Nineteen participants with subclinical geriatric depression and 19 healthy controls aged &amp;amp;ge;65 years exhibiting general cognitive function within the normal range were included in the study and underwent assessments of verbal memory. Hippocampal subfield volumes were determined based on T1-weighted magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo (T1-MPRAGE) images, while group tractography and connectometry analyses were conducted using diffusion tensor images. Our findings indicated that the volumes of whole bilateral hippocampus, cornus ammonis (CA) 1, molecular layer, left subiculum, CA3, hippocampal tail, right CA4, and granule cell/molecular layers of the dentate gyrus (GC-ML-DG) were significantly smaller in the subclinical depression group than in the control group. In the subclinical depression group, verbal learning was positively correlated with the volumes of the CA1, GC-ML-DG, molecular layer, and whole hippocampus in the right hemisphere. The fractional anisotropy of the bilateral fornix was also significantly lower in the subclinical depression group and exhibited a positive correlation with verbal learning and recall in both groups. Our results suggest that hippocampal microstructure is disrupted and associated with memory in patients with subclinical depression.</p>

	<p>Cerebellar dysfunction can be associated with ataxia, dysarthria, dysmetria, nystagmus and cognitive deficits. While cerebellar dysfunction can be caused by vascular, traumatic, metabolic, genetic, inflammatory, infectious, and neoplastic events, the cerebellum is also a frequent target of autoimmune attacks. The underlying cause for this vulnerability is unclear, but it may be a result of region-specific differences in blood&amp;amp;ndash;brain barrier permeability, the high concentration of neurons in the cerebellum and the presence of autoantigens on Purkinje cells. An autoimmune response targeting the cerebellum&amp;amp;mdash;or any structure in the CNS&amp;amp;mdash;is typically accompanied by an influx of peripheral immune cells to the brain. Under healthy conditions, the brain is protected from the periphery by the blood&amp;amp;ndash;brain barrier, blood&amp;amp;ndash;CSF barrier, and blood&amp;amp;ndash;leptomeningeal barrier. Entry of immune cells to the brain for immune surveillance occurs only at the blood-CSF barrier and is strictly controlled. A breakdown in the barrier permeability allows peripheral immune cells uncontrolled access to the CNS. Often&amp;amp;mdash;particularly in infectious diseases&amp;amp;mdash;the autoimmune response develops because of molecular mimicry between the trigger and a host protein. In this review, we discuss the immune surveillance of the CNS in health and disease and also discuss specific examples of autoimmunity affecting the cerebellum.</p>

	<p>Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) struggle to access high-quality health care due to the shortage of trained providers. ECHO (Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes) Autism is a unique educational program that allows ASD experts to provide knowledge and skills to professionals in local communities to deliver evidence-based care to children with ASD and their families. The model teaches clinicians how to screen and diagnose ASD, as well as manage common co-occurring medical and mental health issues. ECHO Autism is particularly useful for addressing the complex needs of children with ASD and reducing disparities often present in rural and underserved communities. The model can be disseminated globally due to its flexibility in accommodating local and regional differences in social norms and constructs. This article provides an overview of the format of the ECHO Autism model, data supporting the model&amp;amp;rsquo;s efficacy, and discusses future research directions.</p>

	<p>The synapsin family offers a strong linkage between synaptic mechanisms and the epileptic phenotype. Synapsins are phosphoproteins reversibly associated with synaptic vesicles. Synapsin deficiency can cause epilepsy in humans, and synapsin II (SynII) in knockout (KO) mice causes generalized epileptic seizures. To differentiate between the direct effect of SynII versus its secondary adaptations, we used neonatal intracerebroventricular injections of the adeno-associated virus (AAV) expressing SynII. We found that SynII reintroduction diminished the enhanced synaptic activity in Syn2 KO hippocampal slices. Next, we employed the epileptogenic agent 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) and found that SynII reintroduction completely rescued the epileptiform activity observed in Syn2 KO slices upon 4-AP application. Finally, we developed a protocol to provoke behavioral seizures in young Syn2 KO animals and found that SynII reintroduction balances the behavioral seizures. To elucidate the mechanisms through which SynII suppresses hyperexcitability, we injected the phospho-incompetent version of Syn2 that had the mutated protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylation site. The introduction of the phospho-incompetent SynII mutant suppressed the epileptiform and seizure activity in Syn2 KO mice, but not to the extent observed upon the reintroduction of native SynII. These findings show that SynII can directly suppress seizure activity and that PKA phosphorylation contributes to this function.</p>

	<p>Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a major health problem in Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) patients. We described the clinical and sociodemographic factors of MDD among patients with PD at a national neurological referral center in Mexico. One hundred patients with PD + MDD were included in the study. All the patients were evaluated during the &amp;amp;ldquo;ON&amp;amp;rdquo; treatment phase of PD. Clinical scales for cognition (MMSE and MoCA) and MDD (MADRS) were applied. The mean age was 58.49 &amp;amp;plusmn; 11.02 years, and 57% of the sample was male. The most frequent symptom of PD was tremor (67%), and onset was more frequent on the right side (57%). Additionally, 49% of the patients with PD had moderate to severe (M/S) MDD. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors were the most frequent antidepressant treatment (69%). The scores of the scales were MADRS 21.33 &amp;amp;plusmn; 5.49, MoCA 21.06 &amp;amp;plusmn; 4.65, and MMSE 26.67 &amp;amp;plusmn; 1.20. The females had lower MMSE scores compared to the males (p = 0.043). The patients with M/S MDD had more rigidity at the beginning of PD (p = 0.005), fewer march alterations (p = 0.023), and a greater prevalence of left-side initial disease (p = 0.037). Rigidity was associated with M/S MDD (OR 3.75 p = 0.013). MDD was slightly more frequent in the males than in the females. The MDD symptoms and cognitive impairment were worse in the female population.</p>
