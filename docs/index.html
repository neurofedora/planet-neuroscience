              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07696">Inferring collective synchrony observing spiking of one or several neurons</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2501.07696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We tackle a quantification of synchrony in a large ensemble of interacting neurons from the observation of spiking events. In a simulation study, we efficiently infer the synchrony level in a neuronal population from a point process reflecting spiking of a small number of units and even from a single neuron. We introduce a synchrony measure (order parameter) based on the Bartlett covariance density; this quantity can be easily computed from the recorded point process. This measure is robust concerning missed spikes and, if computed from observing several neurons, does not require spike sorting. We illustrate the approach by modeling populations of spiking or bursting neurons, including the case of sparse synchrony.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07660">Operators in the mind: Jan Lukasiewicz and Polish notation</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2501.07660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1929 Jan Lukasiewicz used, apparently for the first time, his Polish notation to represent the operations of formal logic. This is a parenthesis-free notation, which also implies that logical functions are operators preceding the variables on which they act. In the 1980s, within the framework of research into mathematical models on the parallel processing of neural systems, a group of operators emerged -- neurally inspired and based on matrix algebra -- which computed logical operations automatically. These matrix operators reproduce the order of operators and variables of Polish notation. These logical matrices can also generate a three-valued logic with broad similarities to Lukasiewicz's three-valued logic. In this paper, a parallel is drawn between relevant formulas represented in Polish notation, and their counterparts in terms of neurally based matrix operators. Lukasiewicz's three-valued logic, shown in Polish notation has several points of contact with what matrices produce when they process uncertain truth vectors. This formal parallelism opens up scientific and philosophical perspectives that deserve to be further explored.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17395">CREIMBO: Cross-Regional Ensemble Interactions in Multi-view Brain Observations</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2405.17395v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern recordings of neural activity provide diverse observations of neurons across brain areas, conditions, and subjects; presenting an exciting opportunity to reveal the fundamentals of brain-wide dynamics. Current analysis methods often fail to harness the richness of such data, as they provide either uninterpretable representations or oversimplify models (e.g., by assuming stationary dynamics). Here, instead of regarding asynchronous neural recordings that lack alignment in neural identity or brain areas as a limitation, we leverage these diverse views into the brain to learn a unified model of neural dynamics. We assume that brain activity is driven by multiple hidden global sub-circuits. These sub-circuits represent global basis interactions between neural ensembles -- functional groups of neurons -- such that the time-varying decomposition of these circuits defines how the ensembles' interactions evolve over time non-stationarily. We discover the neural ensembles underlying non-simultaneous observations, along with their non-stationary evolving interactions, with our new model, CREIMBO. CREIMBO identifies the hidden composition of per-session neural ensembles through graph-driven dictionary learning and models the ensemble dynamics on a low-dimensional manifold spanned by a sparse time-varying composition of the global sub-circuits. Thus, CREIMBO disentangles overlapping temporal neural processes while preserving interpretability due to the use of a shared underlying sub-circuit basis. Moreover, CREIMBO distinguishes session-specific computations from global (session-invariant) ones by identifying session covariates and variations in sub-circuit activations. We demonstrate CREIMBO's ability to recover true components in synthetic data, and uncover meaningful brain dynamics including cross-subject neural mechanisms and inter- vs. intra-region dynamical motifs.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09308">Divergences between Language Models and Human Brains</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2311.09308v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Do machines and humans process language in similar ways? Recent research has hinted at the affirmative, showing that human neural activity can be effectively predicted using the internal representations of language models (LMs). Although such results are thought to reflect shared computational principles between LMs and human brains, there are also clear differences in how LMs and humans represent and use language. In this work, we systematically explore the divergences between human and machine language processing by examining the differences between LM representations and human brain responses to language as measured by Magnetoencephalography (MEG) across two datasets in which subjects read and listened to narrative stories. Using an LLM-based data-driven approach, we identify two domains that LMs do not capture well: social/emotional intelligence and physical commonsense. We validate these findings with human behavioral experiments and hypothesize that the gap is due to insufficient representations of social/emotional and physical knowledge in LMs. Our results show that fine-tuning LMs on these domains can improve their alignment with human brain responses.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14773">Mode-conditioned music learning and composition: a spiking neural network inspired by neuroscience and psychology</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2411.14773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Musical mode is one of the most critical element that establishes the framework of pitch organization and determines the harmonic relationships. Previous works often use the simplistic and rigid alignment method, and overlook the diversity of modes. However, in contrast to AI models, humans possess cognitive mechanisms for perceiving the various modes and keys. In this paper, we propose a spiking neural network inspired by brain mechanisms and psychological theories to represent musical modes and keys, ultimately generating musical pieces that incorporate tonality features. Specifically, the contributions are detailed as follows: 1) The model is designed with multiple collaborated subsystems inspired by the structures and functions of corresponding brain regions; 2)We incorporate mechanisms for neural circuit evolutionary learning that enable the network to learn and generate mode-related features in music, reflecting the cognitive processes involved in human music perception. 3)The results demonstrate that the proposed model shows a connection framework closely similar to the Krumhansl-Schmuckler model, which is one of the most significant key perception models in the music psychology domain. 4) Experiments show that the model can generate music pieces with characteristics of the given modes and keys. Additionally, the quantitative assessments of generated pieces reveals that the generating music pieces have both tonality characteristics and the melodic adaptability needed to generate diverse and musical content. By combining insights from neuroscience, psychology, and music theory with advanced neural network architectures, our research aims to create a system that not only learns and generates music but also bridges the gap between human cognition and artificial intelligence.

                arXiv:2501.06698v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In virtual reality applications, users often navigate through virtual environments, but the issue of physiological responses, such as cybersickness, fatigue, and cognitive workload, can disrupt or even halt these activities. Despite its impact, the underlying mechanisms of how the sensory system encodes information in VR remain unclear. In this study, we compare three sensory encoding models, Bayesian Efficient Coding, Fitness Maximizing Coding, and the Linear Nonlinear Poisson model, regarding their ability to simulate human navigation behavior in VR. By incorporating the factor of physiological responses into the models, we find that the Bayesian Efficient Coding model generally outperforms the others. Furthermore, the Fitness Maximizing Code framework provides more accurate estimates when the error penalty is small. Our results suggest that the Bayesian Efficient Coding framework offers superior predictions in most scenarios, providing a better understanding of human navigation behavior in VR environments.

                arXiv:2501.07952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have garnered attention over recent years due to their increased energy efficiency and advantages in terms of operational complexity compared to traditional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). Two important questions when implementing SNNs are how to best encode existing data into spike trains and how to efficiently process these spike trains in hardware. This paper addresses both of these problems by incorporating the encoding into the learning process, thus allowing the network to learn the spike encoding alongside the weights. Furthermore, this paper proposes a hardware architecture based on a recently introduced differential-time representation for spike trains allowing decoupling of spike time and processing time. Together these contributions lead to a feedforward SNN using only Leaky-Integrate and Fire (LIF) neurons that surpasses 99% accuracy on the MNIST dataset while still being implementable on medium-sized FPGAs with inference times of less than 295us.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07611">Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks and Evolutionary Game Theory for More Personalized Cancer Treatment</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2501.07611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Personalized cancer treatment is revolutionizing oncology by leveraging precision medicine and advanced computational techniques to tailor therapies to individual patients. Despite its transformative potential, challenges such as limited generalizability, interpretability, and reproducibility of predictive models hinder its integration into clinical practice. Current methodologies often rely on black-box machine learning models, which, while accurate, lack the transparency needed for clinician trust and real-world application. This paper proposes the development of an innovative framework that bridges Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) and Evolutionary Game Theory (EGT) to address these limitations. Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, KANs offer interpretable, edge-based neural architectures capable of modeling complex biological systems with unprecedented adaptability. Their integration into the EGT framework enables dynamic modeling of cancer progression and treatment responses. By combining KAN's computational precision with EGT's mechanistic insights, this hybrid approach promises to enhance predictive accuracy, scalability, and clinical usability.

                arXiv:2501.07855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image Super-Resolution (SR) aims to recover a high-resolution image from its low-resolution counterpart, which has been affected by a specific degradation process. This is achieved by enhancing detail and visual quality. Recent advancements in transformer-based methods have remolded image super-resolution by enabling high-quality reconstructions surpassing previous deep-learning approaches like CNN and GAN-based. This effectively addresses the limitations of previous methods, such as limited receptive fields, poor global context capture, and challenges in high-frequency detail recovery. Additionally, the paper reviews recent trends and advancements in transformer-based SR models, exploring various innovative techniques and architectures that combine transformers with traditional networks to balance global and local contexts. These neoteric methods are critically analyzed, revealing promising yet unexplored gaps and potential directions for future research. Several visualizations of models and techniques are included to foster a holistic understanding of recent trends. This work seeks to offer a structured roadmap for researchers at the forefront of deep learning, specifically exploring the impact of transformers on super-resolution techniques.

Abstract: Orthogonal convolutional layers are the workhorse of multiple areas in machine learning, such as adversarial robustness, normalizing flows, GANs, and Lipschitzconstrained models. Their ability to preserve norms and ensure stable gradient propagation makes them valuable for a large range of problems. Despite their promise, the deployment of orthogonal convolution in large-scale applications is a significant challenge due to computational overhead and limited support for modern features like strides, dilations, group convolutions, and transposed convolutions.In this paper, we introduce AOC (Adaptative Orthogonal Convolution), a scalable method for constructing orthogonal convolutions, effectively overcoming these limitations. This advancement unlocks the construction of architectures that were previously considered impractical. We demonstrate through our experiments that our method produces expressive models that become increasingly efficient as they scale. To foster further advancement, we provide an open-source library implementing this method, available at https://github.com/thib-s/orthogonium.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07954">Many-Objective Neuroevolution for Testing Games</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2501.07954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating tests for games is challenging due to the high degree of randomisation inherent to games and hard-to-reach program states that require sophisticated gameplay. The test generator NEATEST tackles these challenges by combining search-based software testing principles with neuroevolution to optimise neural networks that serve as test cases. However, since NEATEST is designed as a single-objective algorithm, it may require a long time to cover fairly simple program states or may even get stuck trying to reach unreachable program states. In order to resolve these shortcomings of NEATEST, this work aims to transform the algorithm into a many-objective search algorithm that targets several program states simultaneously. To this end, we combine the neuroevolution algorithm NEATEST with the two established search-based software testing algorithms, MIO and MOSA. Moreover, we adapt the existing many-objective neuroevolution algorithm NEWS/D to serve as a test generator. Our experiments on a dataset of 20 SCRATCH programs show that extending NEATEST to target several objectives simultaneously increases the average branch coverage from 75.88% to 81.33% while reducing the required search time by 93.28%.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16625">Set-based Neural Network Encoding Without Weight Tying</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2305.16625v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a neural network weight encoding method for network property prediction that utilizes set-to-set and set-to-vector functions to efficiently encode neural network parameters. Our approach is capable of encoding neural networks in a model zoo of mixed architecture and different parameter sizes as opposed to previous approaches that require custom encoding models for different architectures. Furthermore, our \textbf{S}et-based \textbf{N}eural network \textbf{E}ncoder (SNE) takes into consideration the hierarchical computational structure of neural networks. To respect symmetries inherent in network weight space, we utilize Logit Invariance to learn the required minimal invariance properties. Additionally, we introduce a \textit{pad-chunk-encode} pipeline to efficiently encode neural network layers that is adjustable to computational and memory constraints. We also introduce two new tasks for neural network property prediction: cross-dataset and cross-architecture. In cross-dataset property prediction, we evaluate how well property predictors generalize across model zoos trained on different datasets but of the same architecture. In cross-architecture property prediction, we evaluate how well property predictors transfer to model zoos of different architecture not seen during training. We show that SNE outperforms the relevant baselines on standard benchmarks.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10243">TrIM, Triangular Input Movement Systolic Array for Convolutional Neural Networks: Architecture and Hardware Implementation</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2408.10243v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern hardware architectures for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), other than targeting high performance, aim at dissipating limited energy. Reducing the data movement cost between the computing cores and the memory is a way to mitigate the energy consumption. Systolic arrays are suitable architectures to achieve this objective: they use multiple processing elements that communicate each other to maximize data utilization, based on proper dataflows like the weight stationary and row stationary. Motivated by this, we have proposed TrIM, an innovative dataflow based on a triangular movement of inputs, and capable to reduce the number of memory accesses by one order of magnitude when compared to state-of-the-art systolic arrays. In this paper, we present a TrIM-based hardware architecture for CNNs. As a showcase, the accelerator is implemented onto a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) to execute the VGG-16 and AlexNet CNNs. The architecture achieves a peak throughput of 453.6 Giga Operations per Second, outperforming a state-of-the-art row stationary systolic array up to ~3x in terms of memory accesses, and being up to ~11.9x more energy-efficient than other FPGA accelerators.

	<p>Background: Clinicians are challenged by the ambiguity and uncertainty in assessing level of consciousness in individuals with disorder of consciousness (DoC). There are numerous challenges to valid and reliable neurobehavioral assessment and classification of DoC due to multiple environmental and patient-related biases including behavioral fluctuation and confounding or co-occurring medical conditions. Addressing these biases could impact accuracy of assessment and is an important aspect of the DoC assessment process. Methods: A pre-assessment checklist was developed by a group of interdisciplinary DoC clinical experts and researchers based on the existing literature, current validated tools, and expert opinions. Once finalized, the checklist was electronically distributed to clinicians with a range of experience in neurobehavioral assessment with DoC. Respondents were asked to use the checklist prior to completing a neurobehavioral assessment. A survey was also provided to respondents to obtain feedback regarding checklist feasibility and utility in optimizing the behavioral assessments. Results: Thirty-three clinicians completed the survey after using the checklist. Over half of the respondents were a combination of physicians, neuropsychologists, and physical therapists. All respondents served the adult DoC population and 42% percent had over ten years of clinical experience. Eighty percent reported they found the format of the checklist useful and easy to use. All respondents reported the checklist was relevant to preparing for behavioral assessment in the DoC population. Eighty-four percent reported they would recommend the use of the tool to other clinicians. Conclusions: The use of a pre-assessment checklist was found to be feasible and efficacious in increasing interdisciplinary clinician&amp;amp;rsquo;s ability to optimize the patient and environment in preparation for neurobehavioral assessment. Initial results of clinicians&amp;amp;rsquo; perception of the utility of a pre-assessment checklist were positive. However, further validation of the tool is needed with larger sample sizes to improve representation of clinical use across disciplines and care settings.</p>

                Background Disease-related malnutrition is common among hospitalised and recently discharged older adults. Consequences of malnutrition are physical limitations, negative health outcomes, decreased quality of life and increased healthcare costs. Dietetic care can counteract the effects of malnutrition by increasing protein and energy intake. The ProIntens study aims to evaluate the impact of an intensive dietetic care pathway on dietary protein intake and physical functioning in older adults during hospitalisation and after discharge. Process and economic evaluations will be performed. Methods The ProIntens study is a multicentre two-armed parallel individually randomised trial in five hospitals in the Amsterdam region. In total, 250 hospitalised older adults, aged ≥55 years and at risk of malnutrition will be randomised to receive regular care (control) or intensive dietetic care (intervention). The intervention consists of intensive personalised care which involves transmural guidance by trained dietitians, supportive materials on protein intake in a social context and a mobilization program during hospitalisation until three months after discharge. Controls will receive regular care. The primary outcome will be the between-groups difference in the mean change on the Short Physical Performance Battery three months after discharge. Secondary outcomes include dietary protein intake, body composition, physical activity, activities of daily living, quality of life and healthcare costs. Discussion The ProIntens trial will study the effects and costs of an intensive dietetic treatment on recovery outcomes in hospitalised older adults at risk of malnutrition. The intervention will result in practical tools for care professionals which aim to improve malnutrition treatment for older patients.

                Background The United Arab Emirates (UAE) construction industry has rapidly expanded, but construction work, by its nature, poses a high risk of work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs). These disorders significantly impact quality of life (QoL) and productivity and lead to disability and absenteeism. Aims and Objectives The study aims to determine the prevalence of WMSDs among UAE construction workers using the Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire (NMQ) and assess their QoL using the Short-Form (SF-36) survey. Additionally, it aims to explore factors associated with WMSDs and QoL among construction workers in the United Arab Emirates. Methods This study is a cross-sectional, survey-based design conducted from July 2023 to May 2024 in the United Arab Emirates. The study included male construction workers aged 18-50 with at least 1 year of experience. Participants were recruited using a combination of convenience and purposive sampling methods. The data were collected via paper-based forms using the SF-36 and NMQ questionnaires. The study instruments were chosen after reviewing relevant literature to ensure minimal measurement bias. Statistical methods included descriptive statistics, tests for normality, and Pearson’s correlation test with a significance level of p <0.05. Results A total of 346 construction workers were accessed and the study found an 81.8% 12-month WMSD prevalence, most commonly affecting the lower back (44.8%), neck (45.1%), and shoulders (37.9%). Additionally, 70.5% reported pain-related limitations, and 63.6% experienced pain in the past week. SF-36 scores were lowest for role limitations due to physical health (30.33) and emotional problems (33.43), with an overall mean of 52.27 out of 100. Conclusion The study found a high prevalence of WMSD in construction workers and moderate quality of life scores. These findings highlight the urgent need to prioritize construction worker health through targeted interventions.

                Background Cardiovascular disease is rampant worldwide and has become the leading factor in increasing the global mortality rates. According to the World Heart Federation, death toll due to CVD has increased from 12.1 million in 1990 to around 19 million in 2019. Myocardial Infarction (MI) is a condition where the heart muscle dies due to reduced or inhibited flow of oxygenated blood. It has affected approximately 3 million people worldwide, with more than 1 million deaths in the United States annually. Such unusual proliferation in global death toll due to CVD can be reduced to a great extent by predicting the risk of CVD at an early stage. Method In this paper, several feature selection techniques including Variance-based, Mutual Information (MI), Maximum Relevance Minimum Redundancy (MRMR), Boruta, and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) algorithms are used feature optimization. For class prediction, the Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), and Adaboost algorithms were implemented in their ordinary, One-vs-Rest (OVR) and One-vs-One (OVO) methods. Result The performance of Adaboost model has significantly improved by using feature selection techniques, that is, the accuracy of 74% (without any feature selection taking 5.3 seconds) is increased to 85% (with Boruta feature selection taking only 2.17 seconds training time) and 88% (with MRMR feature selection taking 1.6 seconds training time). Similarly, the DT-OVO model’s performance has improved from 84% (without any feature selection taking 1.48 seconds training time) to 86% (with Boruta feature selection taking 0.58 training time). For other models, the performance is maintained with reduced model training times. Conclusion This research paper prioritizes on feature selection in developing machine learning models for CVD prediction. This conclusion is justified by demonstrating the significant reduction in model training times for the 72 models generated while maintaining or even improving the model’s predictive performance.

                Melatonin, the “sleep hormone,” shows significant promise in dentistry owing to its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory properties. It is beneficial for treating periodontal disorders and aiding osseointegration of dental implants. Additionally, melatonin helps to manage dental anxiety, offering an alternative to traditional sedatives. Periodontal disease is orchestrated by bacterial plaques along with an exaggerated immune-inflammatory host response. Treatment of periodontitis not only involves the removal of plaque, but also aims to minimize the cytokine load and control the reactive oxygen species burden in the tissues, which would re-establish a healthy periodontium and a balanced bone metabolism. Melatonin is known to exert beneficial effects, such as regulation of circadian rhythm, bone remodeling, and antimicrobial effects. Recent studies have demonstrated the successful use of melatonin as an adjunct to mechanical debridement for the treatment of periodontal disease. Its various uses include systemic administration of melatonin after one-stage full-mouth Non-Surgical Periodontal Therapy in healthy subjects as well as patients. This article provides a summary of the various clinical applications of melatonin, describing its mechanism of action, uses, and potential avenues for future research in dentistry.

                Tracheobronchial endoluminal hamartochondroma (HC) is a rare benign tumor, most frequently diagnosed in individuals between the sixth and seventh decades of life. The clinical presentation is usually very noisy. Here, we report two interesting cases. The first patient is a 58-year-old man who was wrongly treated for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. HC was in the lower third of the trachea. The second patient is a 43-year-old man with a history of bronchiectasis and right lower lobectomy. HC was in the middle lobe bronchus. The resection via rigid bronchoscopy with diode laser was successful without any complications. Only one patient keeps a small stable tumor residue. The rigid bronchoscopy with laser-application in tracheobronchial endoluminal HC is safe and effective. Flexible bronchoscopy is important during the follow-up.

                <p>by Alexander G. Ginsberg, Scott F. Lempka, Bo Duan, Victoria Booth, Jennifer Crodelle</p>

Chronic pain is a wide-spread condition that is debilitating and expensive to manage, costing the United States alone around $600 billion in 2010. In a common symptom of chronic pain called allodynia, non-painful stimuli produce painful responses with highly variable presentations across individuals. While the specific mechanisms remain unclear, allodynia is hypothesized to be caused by the dysregulation of excitatory-inhibitory (E-I) balance in pain-processing neural circuitry in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. In this work, we analyze biophysically-motivated subcircuit structures that represent common motifs in neural circuits in laminae I-II of the dorsal horn. These circuits are hypothesized to be part of the neural pathways that mediate two different types of allodynia: static and dynamic. We use neural firing rate models to describe the activity of populations of excitatory and inhibitory interneurons within each subcircuit. By accounting for experimentally-observed responses under healthy conditions, we specify model parameters defining populations of subcircuits that yield typical behavior under normal conditions. Then, we implement a sensitivity analysis approach to identify the mechanisms most likely to cause allodynia-producing dysregulation of the subcircuit’s E-I signaling. We find that disruption of E-I balance generally occurs either due to downregulation of inhibitory signaling so that excitatory neurons are “released” from inhibitory control, or due to upregulation of excitatory neuron responses so that excitatory neurons “escape” their inhibitory control. Which of these mechanisms is most likely to occur, the subcircuit components involved in the mechanism, and the proportion of subcircuits exhibiting the mechanism can vary depending on the subcircuit structure. These results suggest specific hypotheses about diverse mechanisms that may be most likely responsible for allodynia, thus offering predictions for the high interindividual variability observed in allodynia and identifying targets for further experimental studies on the underlying mechanisms of this chronic pain symptom.

                <p>by Luis L. Fonseca, Lucas Böttcher, Borna Mehrad, Reinhard C. Laubenbacher</p>

This paper describes and validates an algorithm to solve optimal control problems for agent-based models (ABMs). For a given ABM and a given optimal control problem, the algorithm derives a surrogate model, typically lower-dimensional, in the form of a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), solves the control problem for the surrogate model, and then transfers it back to the original ABM. It applies to quite general ABMs and offers several options for the ODE structure, depending on what information about the ABM is to be used. There is a broad range of applications for such an algorithm, since ABMs are used widely in the life sciences, such as ecology, epidemiology, and biomedicine and healthcare, areas where optimal control is an important purpose for modeling, such as for medical digital twin technology.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002954">Dorsal hippocampus represents locations to avoid as well as locations to approach during approach-avoidance conflict</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Olivia L. Calvin, Matthew T. Erickson, Cody J. Walters, A. David Redish</p>

Worrying about perceived threats is a hallmark of multiple psychological disorders including anxiety. This concern about future events is particularly important when an individual is faced with an approach-avoidance conflict. Potential goals to approach are known to be represented in the dorsal hippocampus during theta cycles. Similarly, important information that is distant from the animal’s position is represented during hippocampal high-synchrony events (HSEs), which coincide with sharp-wave ripples (SWRs). It is likely that potential future threats may be similarly represented. We examined how threats and rewards were represented within the hippocampus during approach-avoidance conflicts in rats faced with a predator-like robot guarding a food reward. We found decoding of the pseudo-predator’s location during HSEs when hesitating in the nest and during theta prior to retreating as the rats approached the pseudo-predator. After the first attack, we observed new place fields appearing at the location of the robot (not the location the rat was when attacked). The anxiolytic diazepam reduced anxiety-like behavior and altered hippocampal local field potentials (LFPs), including reducing SWRs, suggesting that one potential mechanism of diazepam’s actions may be through altered representations of imagined threat. These results suggest that hippocampal representation of potential threats could be an important mechanism that underlies worry and a potential target for anxiolytics.

                <p>by Joseph T. Ortega, Jacklyn M. Gallagher, Andrew G. McKee, Yidan Tang, Miguel Carmena-Bargueňo, Maria Azam, Zaiddodine Pashandi, Marcin Golczak, Jens Meiler, Horacio Pérez-Sánchez, Jonathan P. Schlebach, Beata Jastrzebska</p>

Pathogenic mutations that cause rhodopsin misfolding lead to a spectrum of currently untreatable blinding diseases collectively termed retinitis pigmentosa. Small molecules to correct rhodopsin misfolding are therefore urgently needed. In this study, we utilized virtual screening to search for drug-like molecules that bind to the orthosteric site of rod opsin and improve its folding and trafficking. We identified and validated the biological effects of 2 non-retinoid compounds with favorable pharmacological properties that cross the blood–retina barrier. These compounds reversibly bind to unliganded rod opsin, each with a K<sub>d</sub> comparable to 9-<i>cis</i>-retinal and improve opsin stability. By improving the internal protein structure network (PSN), these rod opsin ligands also enhanced the plasma membrane expression of total 36 of 123 tested clinical RP variants, including the most prevalent P23H variant. Importantly, these compounds protected retinas against light-induced degeneration in mice vulnerable to bright light injury and prolonged survival of photoreceptors in a retinitis pigmentosa mouse model for rod opsin misfolding.

                Background Deficits in sensorimotor gating have been reported in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), as well as in ASD murine models. However, this behavior has not been examined in the neuronal subset-specific (NS)-Pten knockout (KO) model of ASD. NS-Pten KO mice exhibit hyperactivity of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway which is implicated in the onset of autistic deficits. This study investigates the potential relationship between PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling and deficits in sensorimotor gating. Methods To assess sensorimotor gating in NS-Pten KO mice we utilized a three-day paradigm. On day 1 (habituation) the mice were administered 80 repetitions of a 120-dB startle stimulus. On day 2, prepulse inhibition was measured with 90 trials of the startle stimulus that was paired with a smaller (2, 7, or 12 dB) prepulse stimulus. Day 3 was assessed one week later, consisting of randomized startle trials and trials with no stimulus and was used to determine the startle response. Results No significant difference between NS-Pten KO or wildtype (WT) mice was found for habituation (p > 0.05). No significant differences were found between groups when assessing the percentage of prepulse inhibition at 2, 7, and 12 dB (p > 0.05). There was also no difference in startle response between groups (p > 0.05). Conclusion Our study found that the NS-Pten KO model does not display significant deficits in sensorimotor gating processes. The present findings help to elucidate the relationship between PI3K/AKT/mTOR hyperactivation and sensory reactivity.

                Background The topic of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) in civil and commercial contexts presents a contemporary legal challenge aimed at fostering equitable solutions. Among ADR methods, mediation stands out for its ability to reduce time, costs, and litigation duration. This study explores the conceptual framework, essential conditions, and procedural aspects of mediation. It evaluates the sufficiency, regulation, and effectiveness of mediation principles in conflict resolution and risk mitigation. Methods This study is conducted through a comprehensive review of current literature on Alternative Dispute Resolution methods, with a particular focus on mediation as an alternative to dispute settlement. The study utilizes qualitative analysis techniques to examine the effectiveness of mediation principles and their application in resolving civil and commercial disputes. Comparative analyses are also conducted to extract useful insights from various legal systems and authorities. Results The study provides an analysis that illustrates the effectiveness of mediation in resolving disputes, emphasizing its potential benefits in terms of time and cost savings, as well as its srole in facilitating amicable resolutions. The results of this study shall contribute to the current body of knowledge on mediation and provide practical recommendations for its application in diverse legal contexts. Conclusion In conclusion, the study proposes strategies to enhance mediation practices, promote a culture of its adoption, and integrate it more closely into the judicial system. Additionally, it anticipates the future effectiveness of mediation in jurisdictions lacking comprehensive legislation, drawing from successful Western experiences to guide potential developments in Arab legal frameworks.

">Self-organized and self-sustained ensemble activity patterns in simulation of mouse primary motor cortex</a></h4>

              
                The idea of self-organized signal processing in the cerebral cortex has become a focus of research since Beggs and Plentz reported avalanches in local field potential recordings from organotypic cultures and acute slices of rat somatosensory cortex. How the cortex intrinsically organizes signals remains unknown. A current hypothesis was proposed by the condensed matter physicists Bak, Tang, and Wiesenfeld when they conjectured that if neuronal avalanche activity followed inverse power law distributions, then brain activity may be set around phase transitions within self-organized signals. We asked if we would observe self-organized signals in an isolated slice of our data driven detailed simulation of the mouse primary motor cortex? If we did, would we observe avalanches with power-law distributions in size and duration and what would they look like? Our results demonstrate that a brief unstructured stimulus (100ms, 57A current) to a small subset of neurons (about 181 of more than 10,000) in a simulated mouse primary motor cortex slice results in self-organized and self-sustained avalanches with power-law size and duration distributions and values similar to those reported from in vivo and in vitro experiments. We observed 4 cross-layer and cross-neuron population patterns, 3 of which displayed a dominant rhythmic component. Avalanches were each composed of one or more of the 4 population patterns.

">Spatiotemporal Complexity in the Psychotic Brain</a></h4>

              
                Psychotic disorders, such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, pose significant diagnostic challenges with major implications on mental health. The measures of resting-state fMRI spatiotemporal complexity offer a powerful tool for identifying irregularities in brain activity. To capture global brain connectivity, we employed information-theoretic metrics, overcoming the limitations of pairwise correlation analysis approaches. This enables a more comprehensive exploration of higher-order interactions and multiscale intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) in the psychotic brain. In this study, we provide converging evidence suggesting that the psychotic brain exhibits states of randomness across both spatial and temporal dimensions. To further investigate these disruptions, we estimated brain network connectivity using redundancy and synergy measures, aiming to assess the integration and segregation of topological information in the psychotic brain. Our findings reveal a disruption in the balance between redundant and synergistic information, a phenomenon we term brainquake in this study, which highlights the instability and disorganization of brain networks in psychosis. Moreover, our exploration of higher-order topological functional connectivity reveals profound disruptions in brain information integration. Aberrant information interactions were observed across both cortical and subcortical ICNs. We specifically identified the most easily affected irregularities in the sensorimotor, visual, temporal, default mode, and fronto-parietal networks, as well as in the hippocampal and amygdalar regions, all of which showed disruptions. These findings underscore the severe impact of psychotic states on multiscale critical brain networks, suggesting a profound alteration in the brain's complexity and organizational states.

">Specialized response of default mode subnetworks and multiple-demand regions to transitions of person, place and time</a></h4>

              
                This study used functional MRI data from the StudyForrest dataset to investigate the role of subnetworks of the default mode network (DMN) during naturalistic stimulus transitions of different types and magnitudes. We found distinct activation profiles within the DMN: the dmPFC subnetwork was specifically associated with character and location transitions, the MTL subnetwork preferred location and temporal transitions, while the Core DMN subnetwork responded to all three transition types. The multiple-demand network instead responded selectively to temporal transitions. These distinct response profiles appeared largely invariant to the semantic distance implied by the transitions. All subnetworks also responded significantly, and in a graded manner, to subjective event boundaries. Results suggest specific roles of the DMN subnetworks in perceiving and segmenting naturalistic events, supporting the view that DMN subnetworks cooperate in interpreting continuous external events and maintaining an updated contextual model of the world.

">Robustness of working memory to prefrontal cortex microstimulation</a></h4>

              
                Delay period activity in the dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) has been linked to the maintenance and control of sensory information in working memory. The stability of working memory related signals found in such delay period activity is believed to support robust memory-guided behavior during sensory perturbations, such as distractors. Here, we directly probed dlPFC's delay period activity with a diverse set of activity perturbations, and measured their consequences on neural activity and behavior. We applied patterned microstimulation to the dlPFC of monkeys implanted with multi-electrode arrays by electrically stimulating different electrodes in the array while the monkeys performed a memory guided saccade task. We found that the microstimulation perturbations affected spatial working memory-related signals in individual dlPFC neurons. However, task performance remained largely unaffected. These apparently contradictory observations could be understood by examining different dimensions of the dlPFC population activity. In dimensions where working memory related signals naturally evolved over time, microstimulation impacted neural activity. In contrast, in dimensions containing working memory related signals that were stable over time, microstimulation minimally impacted neural activity. This dissociation explained how working memory-related information could be stably maintained in dlPFC despite the activity changes induced by microstimulation. Thus, working memory processes are robust to a variety of activity perturbations in the dlPFC.

">The olivocerebellar system differentially encodes the effect sensory events exert on behavior</a></h4>

              
                Inferior olive neurons convey information about sensorimotor events via climbing fibers to the cerebellum, but their functional significance remains unclear. We directly imaged, with two-photon microscopy, climbing fiber axonal terminals in the cerebellum during a task that successively exposed mice to a force perturbation, a movement instruction and reward; each followed by multiple modes of motor activity. Climbing fiber activations by the sensory events were either generic or informative about the consequences the encoded event has on behavior. The number of informative cells and the information strength are regulated by event modality and functional complexity of the cell's activity. We observed an additional, previously unreported activation of climbing fibers: they carried probabilistic information on the behavioral context during idle waiting periods preceding stimulus presentation. Our findings reveal properties of olivary neurons that are key for defining their function in the cerebellum-dependent control of behavior. They suggest that the inferior olive flexibly instructs the cerebellum of any process that may shape an animal's action.

">Affiliative behaviours regulate allostasis development and shape biobehavioural trajectories in horse</a></h4>

              
                Social interactions shape both physiological and behavioural development of offspring and poor care/early caregiver loss are known to promote negative outcomes in adulthood in both animals and humans. How affiliative behaviours impact future development of offspring remains unknown. Here, we used Equus caballus (domestic horse) as a model to investigate this question. By coupling magnetic resonance imaging, longitudinal biobehavioural assessment and advanced multivariate statistical modelling we found that maternal presence during childhood promotes maturation of brain territories involved in both social behaviour (anterior cingulate, retrosplenial cortex) and physiological regulation (hypothalamus, amygdala). Additionally, we found that offsprings benefiting from prolonged maternal presence showed higher default mode network (DMN) connectivity, improved social competences, more efficient feeding behaviours, and metabolic profiles. The present study underscores the salient role of social interactions for the development of allostatic regulation in offspring.

                Reading, face recognition, and navigation are supported by visuospatial computations in category-selective regions across ventral, lateral, and dorsal visual streams. However, the nature of visuospatial computations across streams and their development in adolescence remain unknown. Using fMRI and population receptive field (pRF) modeling in adolescents and adults, we estimate pRFs in high-level visual cortex and determine their development. Results reveal that pRF location, size, and visual field coverage vary across category, stream, and hemisphere in both adolescents and adults. While pRF location is mature by adolescence, pRF size and visual field coverage continue to develop - increasing in face-selective and decreasing in place-selective regions - alongside similar development of category selectivity. These findings provide a timeline for differential development of visual functions and suggest that visuospatial computations in high-level visual cortex continue to be optimized to accommodate both category and stream demands through adolescence.

">Dissociation of SYNGAP1 Enzymatic and Structural Roles: Intrinsic Excitability and Seizure Susceptibility</a></h4>

              
                SYNGAP1 is a key Ras-GAP protein enriched at excitatory synapses, with mutations causing intel-lectual disability and epilepsy in humans. Recent studies have revealed that in addition to its role as a negative regulator of G-protein signaling through its GAP enzymatic activity, SYNGAP1 plays an important structural role through its interaction with post-synaptic density proteins. Here, we reveal that intrinsic excitability deficits and seizure phenotypes in heterozygous Syngap1 knockout (KO) mice are differentially dependent on Syngap1 GAP activity. Cortical excitatory neurons in heterozy-gous KO mice displayed reduced intrinsic excitability, including lower input resistance, and in-creased rheobase, a phenotype recapitulated in GAP-deficient Syngap1 mutants. However, seizure severity and susceptibility to pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced seizures were significantly elevated in heterozygous KO mice but unaffected in GAP-deficient mutants, implicating the structural rather than enzymatic role of Syngap1 in seizure regulation. These findings highlight the complex interplay between SYNGAP1 structural and catalytic functions in neuronal physiology and disease.

">Lower slow wave sleep and rapid eye-movement sleep are associated with brain atrophy of AD-vulnerable regions</a></h4>

              
                Study objectives: Sleep deficiency is associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. We examined the association of sleep architecture with anatomical features observed in AD: (1) atrophy of hippocampus, entorhinal, inferior parietal, parahippocampal, precuneus, and cuneus regions (AD-vulnerable regions) and (2) cerebral microbleeds. Methods: In 271 participants of the Atherosclerosis Risk in the Communities Study, we examined the association of baseline sleep architecture with anatomical features identified on brain MRI 13~17 years later. Sleep architecture was quantified as the proportion of slow wave sleep (SWS), proportion of rapid eye-movement sleep (REM), and arousals index using polysomnography. Outcomes included (1) volumetric measurements of each AD-vulnerable region and (2) the presence of any cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) and that of lobar CMBs, which are more specifically associated with AD. We analyzed the association of each sleep predictor with each MRI outcome, adjusting for covariates. Results: Having less SWS was associated with smaller inferior parietal region (beta=-44.19 mm3 [95%CI=-76.63,-11.76]) and cuneus (beta=-11.99 mm3 [-20.93,-3.04]) after covariate adjustment. Having less REM was associated with smaller inferior parietal region (beta=-75.52 mm3 [-129.34, -21.70]) and precuneus (beta=-31.93 mm3 [-63.79,-0.07]). After FDR adjustments, lower SWS and REM, respectively, were associated with smaller inferior parietal region. Arousal index was not associated with the volumes of AD-vulnerable regions. None of the sleep architecture variables were associated with CMBs or lobar CMBs. Conclusions: Sleep deficiency is associated with the atrophy of the inferior parietal region, which is observed in early AD. Sleep architecture may be a modifiable risk factor for AD. Key words: sleep architecture, brain atrophy, inferior parietal region, Alzheimer's disease, cerebral microbleeds

">Atlas of plasma metabolic markers linked to human brain morphology</a></h4>

              
                Background: Metabolic processes form the basis of the development, functioning and maintenance of the brain. Despite accumulating evidence of the vital role of metabolism in brain health, no study to date has comprehensively investigated the link between circulating markers of metabolic activity and in vivo brain morphology in the general population. Methods: We performed uni- and multivariate regression on metabolomics and MRI data from 24,940 UK Biobank participants, to estimate the individual and combined associations of 249 circulating metabolic markers with 91 measures of global and regional cortical thickness, surface area and subcortical volume. We investigated similarity of the identified spatial patterns with brain maps of neurotransmitters, and used Mendelian randomization to uncover causal relationships between metabolites and the brain. Results: Intracranial volume and total surface area were highly significantly associated with circulating lipoproteins and glycoprotein acetyls, with correlations up to .15. There were strong regional associations of individual markers with mixed effect directions, with distinct patterns involving frontal and temporal cortical thickness, brainstem and ventricular volume. Mendelian randomization provided evidence of bidirectional causal effects, with the majority of markers affecting frontal and temporal regions. Discussion: The results indicate strong bidirectional causal relationships between circulating metabolic markers and distinct patterns of global and regional brain morphology. The generated atlas of associations provides a better understanding of the role of metabolic pathways in structural brain development and maintenance, in both health and disease.

">Individualized Phenotyping of Functional ALS Pathology in Sensorimotor Cortex</a></h4>

              
                Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by the loss of motor neurons in primary motor cortex (MI), leading to muscle weakness, atrophy, and death within a median of three years. Even though ALS is characterized by different disease subtypes affecting different body parts, individiualized phenotyping of functional ALS pathology has so far not been achieved. We recorded 7 Tesla functional MRI (7T-fMRI) data while ALS patients and matched controls moved affected and non-affected body parts in the MR scanner. We applied robust Shared Response Modeling (rSRM) for capturing ALS-specific shared responses for group classification , and Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression for relating the latent variables to clinical subtypes and the degree of disease progression. We show that both functional connectivity and functional activation in MI are a predictor for disease onset site. However, disease severity could best be predicted by functional connectivity rather than pure activation changes. Critically, we show that functionally disease-defining information in MI is not strongest in the area that is behaviorally first-affected, deviating from the behavioral phenotype of the patients. When computing the model weight distribution of the King stage classification and projecting them back into voxel space, the highest mean weights are present in the foot and tongue/face regions that seem to drive disease progress. Our data highlight the importance of 7T-fMRI task-based functional connectivity measures for classifying ALS-patients, and provide evidence that a single 7T-MRI scan can be used for identifying a disease signature of each individual ALS patient.

">Integrating explicit reliability for optimal choices: effect of trustworthiness on decisions and metadecisions</a></h4>

              
                In everyday life, decision-makers need to integrate information from various sources which differ in how reliable the correct information is provided. The present study addressed whether people can optimally use explicit information about the trustworthiness of the information source and whether people know how information sources affect their decisions. In each trial, we presented a sequence of six information sources which indicated a correct colour (red or blue) each with a different level of reliability. Each source was explicitly labelled the reliability percentage, i.e., the likelihood that a source provides correct information. Participants were asked to decide which colour was more likely to be correct. In the first series of three experiments, we found that participants failed to make use of explicit reliability cues optimally. In particular, participants were less able to use reliably wrong information sources (reliability below 50%) than reliably correct information sources (reliability above 50%), even though these two types of information sources were equally informative. In addition, participants failed to ignore the colour displayed by unreliable sources (50% reliability), although these sources gave just random information for a binary decision. In the second series of two experiments, we asked participants, after each choice, to report their subjective feelings of whether they followed or opposed a colour suggested by sources with a specific reliability percentage. We found that the ratings of the participant's influence report tracked the amount of evidence which supported the choice they just made. Further, participants were able to introspect their own choice bias guided by unreliable information sources. These findings suggest that human choice behaviour deviates from Bayesian integration. However, people have a good metacognitive monitoring of how their decisions are driven by external stimuli.

	<p>Background: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), a variant of Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI), enables a neuroanatomical microscopic-like examination of the brain, which can detect brain damage using physical parameters. DTI&amp;amp;rsquo;s application to traumatic brain injury (TBI) has the potential to reveal radiological features that can assist in predicting the clinical outcomes of these patients. What is the ongoing role of DTI in detecting brain alterations and predicting neurological outcomes in patients with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury and/or diffuse axonal injury? Methods: A scoping review of the PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. The aim was to identify all potentially relevant studies concerning the role of DTI in TBI. From an initial pool of 3527 publications, 26 articles were selected based on relevance. These studies included a total of 729 patients with moderate to severe TBI and/or diffuse axonal injury. DTI parameters were analyzed to determine their relationship with neurological outcomes post-TBI, with assessments of several brain functions and regions. Results: The studies included various DTI parameters, identifying significant relationships between DTI variations and neurological outcomes following TBI. Multiple brain functions and regions were evaluated, demonstrating the capability of DTI to detect brain alterations with higher accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity than MRI alone. Conclusions: DTI is a valuable tool for detecting brain alterations in TBI patients, offering enhanced accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity compared to MRI alone. Recent studies confirm its effectiveness in identifying neurological impairments and predicting outcomes in patients following brain trauma, underscoring its utility in clinical settings for managing TBI.</p>

	<p>Background: The brainstem auditory-evoked response (BAER) is an established electrophysiological measure of neural activity from the auditory nerve up to the brain stem. The BAER is used to diagnose abnormalities in auditory pathways and in neurophysiological human and animal research. However, normative data for BAERs in sheep, which represent an adequate large animal model for translational and basic otological research, are lacking. Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the function of the ovine auditory nervous system by determining normative values for the BAER and to compare sheep with human BAER data. Methods: In this retrospective study, BAER data for click stimuli at a range of sound pressure levels (SPLs) were analyzed. A series of 15 samples from six sheep with a mean age of 41.8 months was included. Results: The mean BAER threshold was 45.3 dB SPL. At 100 dB SPL, the mean (&amp;amp;plusmn;standard deviation, SD) latency of wave V was 4.35 (&amp;amp;plusmn;0.18) ms, that of wave III was 2.44 (&amp;amp;plusmn;0.15) ms, and that of wave I was 0.88 (&amp;amp;plusmn;0.13) ms. At 100 dB SPL, the mean interpeak latency of waves I&amp;amp;ndash;III was 1.56 (&amp;amp;plusmn;0.18) ms, that of waves III&amp;amp;ndash;V was 1.91 (&amp;amp;plusmn;0.16) ms, and that of waves I&amp;amp;ndash;V was 3.47 (&amp;amp;plusmn;0.20) ms. The mean amplitudes at 100 dB SPL were 0.04 (&amp;amp;plusmn;0.03) &amp;amp;micro;V for wave I, 0.50 (&amp;amp;plusmn;0.24) &amp;amp;micro;V for wave III, and 0.40 (&amp;amp;plusmn;0.25) &amp;amp;micro;V for wave V. Conclusions: The normative values for sheep BAERs were reproducible and similar to those of humans. The normative BAER values further support sheep as an adequate animal model for otological research.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: The classification of psychological disorders has gained significant importance due to recent advancements in signal processing techniques. Traditionally, research in this domain has focused primarily on binary classifications of disorders. This study aims to classify five distinct states, including one control group and four categories of psychological disorders. Methods: Our investigation will utilize algorithms based on Granger causality and local graph structures to improve classification accuracy. Feature extraction from connectivity matrices was performed using local structure graphs. The extracted features were subsequently classified employing K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), AdaBoost, and Na&amp;amp;iuml;ve Bayes classifiers. Results: The KNN classifier demonstrated the highest accuracy in the gamma band for the depression category, achieving an accuracy of 89.36%, a sensitivity of 89.57%, an F1 score of 94.30%, and a precision of 99.90%. Furthermore, the SVM classifier surpassed the other machine learning algorithms when all features were integrated, attaining an accuracy of 89.06%, a sensitivity of 88.97%, an F1 score of 94.16%, and a precision of 100% for the discrimination of depression in the gamma band. Conclusions: The proposed methodology provides a novel approach for analyzing EEG signals and holds potential applications in the classification of psychological disorders.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: This study aimed to address limitations of the pilot reliability study on the Sensory&amp;amp;ndash;Motor Dysfunction Questionnaire (SMD-Q) in two parts. Part 1 evaluated the intra-rater reliability of SMD-Q version 2 (V2). Part 2 addressed V2&amp;amp;rsquo;s limitations before assessing the intra-rater reliability of version 3 (V3). V2 framed questions as &amp;amp;ldquo;over the past week&amp;amp;rdquo;, whereas V3 also framed questions as &amp;amp;ldquo;in a typical/usual week&amp;amp;rdquo;. Methods: The SMD-Q was administered via QualtricsTM at baseline and 4 to 7 days later to subclinical neck pain participants, 51 in part 1 (32 F; mean age &amp;amp;plusmn; SD: 21.17 &amp;amp;plusmn; 2.66 y) and 27 in part 2 (20 F; mean age &amp;amp;plusmn; SD: 21.89 &amp;amp;plusmn; 2.81 y). Reliability statistics (quadratic weighted kappa (Kw) and Cronbach&amp;amp;rsquo;s alpha (&amp;amp;alpha;)) were calculated for all items (V2) and total scores (V2 and V3). Results: There was excellent agreement for V2 total scores (Kw &amp;amp;ge; 0.75), and V3 total scores for &amp;amp;ldquo;in a typical/usual week&amp;amp;rdquo; (Kw &amp;amp;ge; 0.75), but fair to good agreement for V3 total scores of &amp;amp;ldquo;over the past week&amp;amp;rdquo; (0.40 &amp;amp;lt; Kw &amp;amp;lt; 0.75). V2 had acceptable (0.7 &amp;amp;le; &amp;amp;alpha; &amp;amp;lt; 0.8) to good internal consistency (0.8 &amp;amp;le; &amp;amp;alpha; &amp;amp;lt; 0.9), while V3 had good internal consistency for both administrations. Conclusions: Versions 2 and 3 of the SMD-Q appear to reliably capture disordered sensorimotor integration in people with subclinical neck pain, with improved reliability in V3 when questions are framed as &amp;amp;ldquo;in a typical/usual week&amp;amp;rdquo;. However, further research is needed to confirm this finding.</p>

                <p>Mammalian parenting is an unusually demanding commitment. How has the reward system been co-opted to ensure parental care? Previous work has implicated the lateral habenula (LHb), an epithalamic nucleus, as a potential intersection of parenting behavior and reward. Here, we examine the role of the LHb in the maternal behavior of naturally parturient primiparous mouse dams. We show that kainic acid lesions of the LHb induced a severe maternal neglect phenotype in dams toward their biological pups. Next, we demonstrate that chronic chemogenetic inactivation of the LHb using inhibitory DREADDs impaired acquisition and performance of various maternal behaviors, such as pup retrieval and nesting. We present a random intercept model suggesting LHb inactivation prevents the acquisition of pup retrieval, a novel maternal behavior in primiparous mouse dams, and decreases nest building performance, an already-established behavior, in primiparous mouse dams. Lastly, we examine the spatial histology of kainic acid-treated dams with a random intercept model, which suggests the role of LHb in maternal behavior may be preferentially localized at the posterior aspect of this structure. Together, these findings serve to establish the LHb as required for maternal behavior in the mouse dam, thereby complementing previous findings implicating the LHb in parental behavior using pup-sensitized virgin female mice.</p>

                Background The objective of this study was to determine the conditioning factors for scientific research productivity in university students of health sciences. Scientific productivity, in addition to making visible the generation of new knowledge, contributes to the well-being of the population and provides feedback to the scientific community in terms of methodologies, perspectives and results that help to break down barriers that delimit productivity in scientific research. Methods A cross-sectional analytical observational study was conducted. The study population was 4104 students enrolled during the 2021-I semester in the Faculty of Health Sciences of a private Peruvian university. A sample size of 400 students was determined and a stratified probability sampling was used. The variables were measured through surveys. The dependent variable was scientific research productivity, and the independent variables were institutional culture, knowledge management and technological capital. Summary measures are reported according to the type of variable. The chi-square test with a significance level of p<0.05 was applied to assess the association between the variables of interest. A multiple logistic regression analysis was performed using the Stepwise method. Prevalence ratios (PR) with their respective 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were calculated. Results From the total of 400 students, 74.5% were male, 57.25% were aged between 18 and 27 years, 17% belonged to the school of human medicine and 72% were in their sixth year of studies. Scientific research productivity was associated with management commitment (PR=1.493; 95%CI: 1.077–2.068, p=0.015), sense of personal growth (PR=1.632; 95%CI: 1.041–2.558; p=0.024), recognition by the university (PR=1.385; 95%CI: 1.012–1.896; p=0.043), strategic alliances (PR=1.422; 95%CI: 1.032–1.959; p=0. 03), having research proposals (PR=1.522; 95%CI: 1.114–2.08; p=0.009), dissemination of results obtained (PR=1.542; 95%CI: 1.12–2.122; p=0.01), availability of human resources (PR=1.591; 95%CI: 1.165–2.173; p=0.004), access to equipment and software (PR=1.482; 95%CI: 1.061–2.069; p=0.018) and to laboratories (PR=1.438; 95%CI: 1.047–1.974; p=0.024). Conclusion It is concluded that the research productivity of undergraduate students of health sciences is low. It is imperative to strengthen the university research culture that empowers students as agents of change and strengthens faculty participation in scientific networks and communities.

                Background Age-related central auditory processing disorder and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) can be concomitant in older adults, making it difficult to communicate, especially in challenging listening conditions. This preliminary study investigated the efficacy of auditory-based cognitive training on the auditory processing abilities and cognitive functions of older adults with MCI. Methods In this randomized controlled trial twenty-two older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) were randomly assigned to either an experimental (n=11) or a control group (n=11). The experimental group received 15 cognitive training sessions through tasks involving the auditory domain. The outcome measures of this study included auditory resolution (Temporal gap detection, frequency discrimination, and modulation detection) and cognitive measures (Trail making tests and digit recall), which were administered at three-time points (before training, post-training, and follow-up). The linear mixed model computed the effects of training on the outcome measures. Results A significant improvement was observed in the modulation detection threshold between baseline and follow-up and between post-training and follow-up sessions. However, GDT and FD thresholds did not reveal any statistically significant difference. In the trail making test, Part B showed consistent significance across the time points, whereas Part A and the delayed recall task showed no significant difference. Conclusion Auditory-based cognitive training may improve auditory processing and executive function in older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).

                Background PMS-algebras are a specific algebraic structure that generalizes a propositional algebra called BCK-algebra. This paper delves into the intricate group structure of these algebras and the concept of derivations within this framework. Methods We employ rigorous mathematical techniques to analyze the properties of derivations in P MS-algebras. This involves examining various characteristics of derivations and investigating their behavior in specific subcategories, such as torsion-free P MS-algebras. Results Our research reveals several key findings. Firstly, we establish that the set of all derivations associated with the binary operation defined on a P MS-algebra constitutes a semigroup. Secondly, we provide a comprehensive analysis of generalized derivations, d-invariant ideals, fixed sets, and torsion-free P MS-algebras within the context of P MS-algebras. Conclusions This study contributes to a deeper understanding of the algebraic structure of P MS-algebras and the role of derivations within this context. The findings presented here have implications for further research in abstract algebra and related fields.

                Abstract* The processes of industrialization and overconsumption of natural resources have resulted in significant environmental changes and degradation. Furthermore, the discrepancy between social and economic classes has resulted in the emergence of inequality among social groups. These issues have been further exacerbated by the advent of the global pandemic, with the greatest impact being observed in some nations, which has served to further widen the social and economic gaps. Consequently, world leaders are keen to take action to mitigate these impacts and disparities among different social groups, given that environmental degradation and climate change have a significant impact on human and planetary health. Furthermore, these factors impede the ability of individuals in disadvantaged social groups to exercise their right to food sovereignty. The objective of this article is to identify perspectives on food sovereignty in the context of climate change impacts through a bibliometric analysis. The analysis reveals that climate change research is an emerging field, with the United States playing a significant role in its development. The principal conclusion is that developed countries are primarily concerned with addressing the challenges posed by climate change to food sovereignty. Furthermore, a correlation was identified between regional CO₂ emissions and malnutrition rates, indicating a potential link between environmental degradation and food security.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-73/v1?src=rss">Optimizing outcomes in phacoemulsification: Addressing intraoperative and postoperative complications in a case series from Iraq [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Phacoemulsification is still considered the most performed surgery in the field of cataract extraction, boasting one of the highest successes of all surgical procedures. However, complications of posterior capsular rupture (PCR) and increased intra-ocular pressure (IOP) bear the potential for great risk, especially in patients with comorbidities such as diabetes or advanced age. Methods A retrospective analysis of 31 cases regarding patients undergoing phacoemulsification in a private ophthalmology clinic in Baghdad was done by noting intraoperative and postoperative complications. A systematic review is also carried out so that findings could be contextualized; studies have been sourced from both PubMed and Scopus databases. Our review covered studies that researched complications such as PCR, increased IOP, and corneal edema, chronicling developments in surgical techniques and patient management. Results The case series resulted in a postoperative best-corrected visual acuity of 6/6 in 35.5% of the patients in the right eye and 29% in the left eye. This series was associated with PCR and raised IOP; however, appropriate management ensured good improvement in vision for the majority of cases. The systematic review supports these findings, pointing out that contemporary surgical procedures and personalized attention can reduce complications substantially, even among high-risk patients. Conclusion Case series and systematic review bring forth the importance of meticulous surgical techniques combined with early recognition of risk factors and personalized postoperative management in attempting to minimize complications. These findings point to the implication of an ideal strategy in handling complications from phacoemulsification, but also have shown that continuing improvement in the surgical and postoperative protocols could further improve patient outcomes, especially those very highly at-risk.

                Background The opioid crisis is a public health challenge in the United States, significantly impacting mortality rates. This has been further exacerbated by COVID-19, contributing to a surge in substance use and overdose deaths. Methods Data from the CDC Wonder Database was used to identify opioid use-related deaths in the United States from 1999 to 2023. Crude and age-adjusted mortality rates (AAMR) were calculated across different geographic and demographic groups. Temporal trends in mortality were analyzed using the Joinpoint Regression Program. Annual percentage change (APC) and average annual percentage change (AAPC) in mortality rates were calculated. Results Opioid-related mortality surged during the COVID-19 period, with significant regional, racial, and state-level disparities. The Midwest region exhibited the highest AAPC from 1999 to 2023. State-specific analyses showed that West Virginia experienced the highest increase in AAMR from 1999 to 2023. Among racial groups, non-Hispanic American Indians/Alaska Natives had the highest AAPC from 1999 to 2023. Gender-specific analyses revealed that males had a higher AAPC from 1999 to 2023 than females. Conclusion The United States opioid crisis continued to escalate during the COVID-19 period, with significant increases in mortality across the regions. The highest AAPCs were seen in the Midwest and among non-Hispanic American Indians/Alaska Natives. These findings underscore the need for targeted interventions to account for trends in racial and regional disparities in opioid-related mortality that have increased during and post-COVID-19.

                Background PMS algebras are a type of algebraic structure that has been studied extensively in recent years. They are a generalization of several other algebraic structures, such as Boolean algebras and MV-algebras. Methods In this paper, we introduce the concept of t-derivations on PMS algebras. T-derivations are a type of mapping between PMS algebras that satisfies certain properties. We then study the properties of t-derivations and regular t-derivations on PMS algebras. Results We characterize further properties of t-derivations in the context of PMS algebras. We also investigate a novel result of t-derivations on the G-part of a PMS-algebra. Finally, we prove that the set of all t-derivations on a PMS-algebra forms a semigroup. Conclusions This paper provides a comprehensive study of t-derivations on PMS algebras. We have established several new results and characterized the properties of t-derivations in detail. Our results contribute to the further understanding of PMS algebras and their associated structures.

                Very little research has been conducted to rigorously study the application of geometry for qualitative analysis in the field of disaster management. The present work aims to examine how to enhance qualitative analysis in the field by applying geometry. Descriptive qualitative analysis was used as the main methodology with the support of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) checklist and flow chart to describe not only the nature of qualitative analysis but also how the method can be enhanced by geometric application. The principal finding was that the field supplements qualitative analysis with geometry to improve the quality of research, considering the scratch programming language, machine-oriented learning, geometric effects, and the issue of awareness. This study provides a comprehensive approach to the topic by specifically addressing pluralism and flexibility.

                <p>by Alejandro Feito, Ignacio Sanchez-Burgos, Ignacio Tejero, Eduardo Sanz, Antonio Rey, Rosana Collepardo-Guevara, Andrés R. Tejedor, Jorge R. Espinosa</p>

Intracellular liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) of proteins and nucleic acids is a fundamental mechanism by which cells compartmentalize their components and perform essential biological functions. Molecular simulations play a crucial role in providing microscopic insights into the physicochemical processes driving this phenomenon. In this study, we systematically compare six state-of-the-art sequence-dependent residue-resolution models to evaluate their performance in reproducing the phase behaviour and material properties of condensates formed by seven variants of the low-complexity domain (LCD) of the hnRNPA1 protein (A1-LCD)—a protein implicated in the pathological liquid-to-solid transition of stress granules. Specifically, we assess the HPS, HPS-cation–<i>π</i>, HPS-Urry, CALVADOS2, Mpipi, and Mpipi-Recharged models in their predictions of the condensate saturation concentration, critical solution temperature, and condensate viscosity of the A1-LCD variants. Our analyses demonstrate that, among the tested models, Mpipi, Mpipi-Recharged, and CALVADOS2 provide accurate descriptions of the critical solution temperatures and saturation concentrations for the multiple A1-LCD variants tested. Regarding the prediction of material properties for condensates of A1-LCD and its variants, Mpipi-Recharged stands out as the most reliable model. Overall, this study benchmarks a range of residue-resolution coarse-grained models for the study of the thermodynamic stability and material properties of condensates and establishes a direct link between their performance and the ranking of intermolecular interactions these models consider.

                <p>by Obaï Bin Ka’b Ali, Alexandre Vidal, Christophe Grova, Habib Benali</p>

Astrocytes critically shape whole-brain structure and function by forming extensive gap junctional networks that intimately and actively interact with neurons. Despite their importance, existing computational models of whole-brain activity ignore the roles of astrocytes while primarily focusing on neurons. Addressing this oversight, we introduce a biophysical neural mass network model, designed to capture the dynamic interplay between astrocytes and neurons via glutamatergic and GABAergic transmission pathways. This network model proposes that neural dynamics are constrained by a two-layered structural network interconnecting both astrocytic and neuronal populations, allowing us to investigate astrocytes’ modulatory influences on whole-brain activity and emerging functional connectivity patterns. By developing a simulation methodology, informed by bifurcation and multilayer network theories, we demonstrate that the dialogue between astrocytic and neuronal networks manifests over fast–slow fluctuation mechanisms as well as through phase–amplitude connectivity processes. The findings from our research represent a significant leap forward in the modeling of glial-neuronal collaboration, promising deeper insights into their collaborative roles across health and disease states.

Respiratory diseases represent a significant healthcare burden, as evidenced by the devastating impact of COVID-19. Biophysical models offer the possibility to anticipate system behavior and provide insights into physiological functions, advancements which are comparatively and notably nascent when it comes to pulmonary mechanics research. In this context, an Inverse Finite Element Analysis (IFEA) pipeline is developed to construct the first continuously ventilated three-dimensional structurally representative pulmonary model informed by both organ- and tissue-level breathing experiments from a cadaveric human lung. Here we construct a generalizable computational framework directly validated by pressure, volume, and strain measurements using a novel inflating apparatus interfaced with adapted, lung-specific, digital image correlation techniques. The parenchyma, pleura, and airways are represented with a poroelastic formulation to simulate pressure flows within the lung lobes, calibrating the model’s material properties with the global pressure-volume response and local tissue deformations strains. The optimization yielded the following shear moduli: parenchyma (2.8 kPa), airways (0.2 kPa), and pleura (1.7 Pa). The proposed complex multi-material model with multi-experimental inputs was successfully developed using human lung data, and reproduced the shape of the inflating pressure-volume curve and strain distribution values associated with pulmonary deformation. This advancement marks a significant step towards creating a generalizable human lung model for broad applications across animal models, such as porcine, mouse, and rat lungs to reproduce pathological states and improve performance investigations regarding medical therapeutics and intervention.

                <p>by Evan Gorstein, Rosa Aghdam, Claudia Solís-Lemus</p>

High-dimensional mixed-effects models are an increasingly important form of regression in which the number of covariates rivals or exceeds the number of samples, which are collected in groups or clusters. The penalized likelihood approach to fitting these models relies on a coordinate descent algorithm that lacks guarantees of convergence to a global optimum. Here, we empirically study the behavior of this algorithm on simulated and real examples of three types of data that are common in modern biology: transcriptome, genome-wide association, and microbiome data. Our simulations provide new insights into the algorithm’s behavior in these settings, and, comparing the performance of two popular penalties, we demonstrate that the smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) penalty consistently outperforms the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) penalty in terms of both variable selection and estimation accuracy across omics data. To empower researchers in biology and other fields to fit models with the SCAD penalty, we implement the algorithm in a Julia package, HighDimMixedModels.jl.

                <p>by Sarah M. Tashjian, Joseph Cussen, Wenning Deng, Bo Zhang, Dean Mobbs</p>

Pivotal to self-preservation is the ability to identify when we are safe and when we are in danger. Previous studies have focused on safety estimations based on the features of external threats and do not consider how the brain integrates other key factors, including estimates about our ability to protect ourselves. Here, we examine the neural systems underlying the online dynamic encoding of safety. The current preregistered study used 2 novel tasks to test 4 facets of safety estimation: <i>Safety Prediction</i>, <i>Meta-representation</i>, <i>Recognition</i>, and <i>Value Updating</i>. We experimentally manipulated safety estimation changing both levels of external threats and self-protection. Data were collected in 2 independent samples (behavioral <i>N</i> = 100; MRI <i>N</i> = 30). We found consistent evidence of subjective changes in the sensitivity to safety conferred through protection. Neural responses in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) tracked increases in safety during all safety estimation facets, with specific tuning to protection. Further, informational connectivity analyses revealed distinct hubs of safety coding in the posterior and anterior vmPFC for external threats and protection, respectively. These findings reveal a central role of the vmPFC for coding safety.

                Background Biomarkers are essential tools in modern medicine, allowing stratification and monitoring of clinical care and treatment response. While systemic blood biomarkers, typically collected from the antecubital vein (AV), are widely used, their sensitivity for joint-specific pathologies such as osteoarthritis (OA) may be limited due to systemic dilution. At present, no serum biomarker reliably reflects the microenvironment of an affected joint in clinical practice. Although synovial fluid (SF) assessment can provide insights into localised pathology and are clinically used for diagnosis in crystal arthropathies and joint infections, their collection is invasive, painful, and carries risks, including infection, making repeated sampling impractical, limiting utility for monitoring treatment responses. This study introduces a novel ultrasound-guided venous sampling technique targeting the saphenous vein (SV) proximal to the knee joint as a less invasive alternative to SF aspiration, hypothesising that it may better reflect the joint-specific microenvironment. Methods A standardised gel model was used to train medically qualified researchers in ultrasound-guided venepuncture of vescles around 2-15 mm in diameter. Subsequently, 32 participants consented to blood sampling from the SV above the knee, with a proximally applied tourniquet to dilate vein diameter for easier venepuncture collection. Results The technique achieved serum collection in over 80% of consented individuals with minimal adverse effects (including n=2 minor bruising and n=1 transient nerve irritation). Key procedural insights included optimal site selection, appropriate pressure application, and effective tourniquet use. Discussion This method demonstrates feasibility, acceptability, and the potential for more localised sample collection, advancing biomarker research. Further validation, including paired SF comparisons, is required to confirm diagnostic utility and develop therapeutic strategies for joint-specific conditions.

                Introduction Globally, oral cancer is the 15th deadliest cancer among humans. Diverse health education interventions have played a very significant role in the prevention of oral cancer. Of these interventions, digital interventions, especially mhealth-driven interventions, have been largely underutilized. So far, only two known educative mobile health applications (MHAs) for oral cancer exits; unfortunately, these two applications are not comprehensive and not inclusive for diverse populations. There is a need for a comprehensive and more inclusive MHA that can be used to educate the public about oral cancer. Objectives To co-develop, co-create, and test a comprehensive and inclusive MHA that can be used to educate the public about oral cancer. Methods The proposed study will be conducted and reported using the PRODUCES (PRoblem, Objective, Design, (end-) Users, Co-creators, Evaluation, Scalability) framework—this framework provides a novel approach which can be used to develop mhealth interventions through participatory action research methodologies. This study will have three parts. The first part will co-develop an eight-sectioned lay educational content on oral cancer through three-round Delphi consultations with thirty subject matter experts in the field of oral cancer and public health. Using the co-developed educational content, the second part of this study will co-create an educative MHA prototype on oral cancer through three-round Delphi consultations with twenty digital communication experts and persons at risk of oral cancer. Lastly, the third part will, through a three-arm, parallel, open-label randomized control trial, test and compare, among seventy-five young adults, the effectiveness, usability, uptake, and acceptability of the co-created MHA prototype on oral cancer against a web-based educational resource on oral cancer. Conclusion The outcomes of this study will co-produce and test an inclusive and comprehensive MHA prototype that can be used to educate diverse populations across the world about oral cancer.

                Background Understanding the epidemiology of soccer injuries during specific international competitions is essential for customizing preventive strategies. Several studies have reported outcomes related to international competitions but, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no investigation into the injury patterns during any African Cup of Nations (AFCON) tournaments. This study aimed to analyse the incidence and the characteristics of soccer injuries during the 2021 African Cup of Nations (AFCON), which took place in Cameroon from January 9 to February 6, 2022. Methods A video-based analysis covering 52 matches was conducted by two independent consultant physicians. They reviewed injury replays to determine incidence and characteristics ( i.e. ; mechanisms, body location, match moment, player substitution, absence in the next match, and referee decisions). Results The tournament involved 519 male players, comprising 275 African (ALP) and 244 Non-African (NALP) league players. Eighty-seven injuries occurred, with incidences of 1.7 and 48.8 injuries per match and per 1000 match hours, respectively. Injury incidence rose with competition stages, particularly contact mechanism injuries. Non-contact injuries (23/87) predominantly occurred after 60 minutes of play (19/23), with the thigh being the most frequently affected body part (18/87). Older age and playing time significantly correlated with injury occurrence (p=0.032 and p<0.001, respectively). NALP midfielders and forwards were notably injured by contact mechanisms (36/45) in the attacking zone. Although non-contact mechanisms were more common in ALP than NALP (13/42 vs. 9/45), the difference lacked statistical significance (p=0.240), with a higher rate of muscle injuries (13/42 vs. 10/45, p=0.001). Conclusion Muscle injuries prevailed among professional soccer players in the 2021 AFCON, with older age and playing time identified as key associated factors. Muscle injuries were more prevalent in ALP compared to NALP.

     alt="Afferent Projections to the Calca/CGRP-Expressing Parabrachial Neurons in Mice"/>
<p>The calcitonin gene-related peptide (Calca/CGRP)-expressing parabrachial (PB) neurons receive strong inputs from GABAergic bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BST) and central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) neurons and moderate GABAergic inputs from the substantia innominata (SI) and ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (VLPAG). They also receive strong or moderate inputs from glutamatergic neurons of the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PVH), parasubthalamic nucleus (PSTN), and nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS). Some regions such as the infralimbic cortex (IL), insular cortex (IC), SI, arcuate nucleus (Arc), and PVH show strong or moderate labeling with cholera toxin subunit B (CTb) but little labeling with rabies, suggesting these regions may innervate non-Calca/CGRP PB neurons.

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The parabrachial nucleus (PB), located in the dorsolateral pons, contains primarily glutamatergic neurons that regulate responses to a variety of interoceptive and cutaneous sensory signals. One lateral PB subpopulation expresses the <i>Calca</i> gene, which codes for the neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). These PB<i>
   <sup>Calca</sup>
</i>
<sup>/CGRP</sup> neurons relay signals related to threatening stimuli such as hypercarbia, pain, and nausea, yet their inputs and their neurochemical identity are only partially understood. We mapped the afferent projections to the lateral part of the PB in mice using conventional cholera toxin B subunit (CTb) retrograde tracing and then used conditional rabies virus retrograde tracing to map monosynaptic inputs specifically targeting the PB<i>
   <sup>Calca</sup>
</i>
<sup>/CGRP</sup> neurons. Using vesicular GABA (vGAT) and glutamate (vGLUT2) transporter reporter mice, we found that lateral PB neurons receive GABAergic afferents from regions such as the lateral part of the central nucleus of the amygdala, lateral dorsal subnucleus of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, substantia innominata, and ventrolateral periaqueductal gray. Additionally, they receive glutamatergic afferents from the infralimbic and insular cortex, paraventricular nucleus, parasubthalamic nucleus, trigeminal complex, medullary reticular nucleus, and nucleus of the solitary tract. Using anterograde tracing and confocal microscopy, we then identified close axonal appositions between these afferents and PB<i>
   <sup>Calca</sup>
</i>
<sup>/CGRP</sup> neurons. Finally, we used channelrhodopsin-assisted circuit mapping and found that GABAergic neurons of the central nucleus of the amygdala directly inhibit the PB<i>
   <sup>Calca</sup>
</i>
<sup>/CGRP</sup> neurons. These findings provide a comprehensive neuroanatomical framework for understanding the afferent projections regulating the PB<i>
   <sup>Calca</sup>
</i>
<sup>/CGRP</sup> neurons.</p>

This work also uncovers how ssDNA binding reshapes the protein’s energy landscape, coupling folding dynamics with ligand interactions.</p><img src="//cdn.journals.aps.org/journals/PRE/key_images/10.1103/PhysRevE.111.014413.png" width="200" height=\"100\"><br/><p>[Phys.

                Yue et al. investigate the neuronal mechanisms underlying nociceptive-evoked gamma-band oscillations (GBOs) in human and rodent models. Nociceptive-evoked GBOs preferentially encoding pain intensity are causally generated by parvalbumin (PV) interneurons in the primary somatosensory cortex. These findings provide valuable insights for developing targeted pain therapies aimed at modulating GBOs.

Neurobiologically, microarousals support the roles of noradrenergic infraslow fluctuations in healthy mouse sleep.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97981">Robust single-nucleus RNA sequencing reveals depot-specific cell population dynamics in adipose tissue remodeling during obesity</a></h4>

              
                Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq), an alternative to single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), encounters technical challenges in obtaining high-quality nuclei and RNA, persistently hindering its applications. Here, we present a robust technique for isolating nuclei across various tissue types, remarkably enhancing snRNA-seq data quality. Employing this approach, we comprehensively characterize the depot-dependent cellular dynamics of various cell types underlying mouse adipose tissue remodeling during obesity. By integrating bulk nuclear RNA-seq from adipocyte nuclei of different sizes, we identify distinct adipocyte subpopulations categorized by size and functionality. These subpopulations follow two divergent trajectories, adaptive and pathological, with their prevalence varying by depot. Specifically, we identify a key molecular feature of dysfunctional hypertrophic adipocytes, a global shutdown in gene expression, along with elevated stress and inflammatory responses. Furthermore, our differential gene expression analysis reveals distinct contributions of adipocyte subpopulations to the overall pathophysiology of adipose tissue. Our study establishes a robust snRNA-seq method, providing novel insights into the biological processes involved in adipose tissue remodeling during obesity, with broader applicability across diverse biological systems.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96303">Geometry and dynamics of representations in a precisely balanced memory network related to olfactory cortex</a></h4>

              
                Biological memory networks are thought to store information by experience-dependent changes in the synaptic connectivity between assemblies of neurons. Recent models suggest that these assemblies contain both excitatory and inhibitory neurons (E/I assemblies), resulting in co-tuning and precise balance of excitation and inhibition. To understand computational consequences of E/I assemblies under biologically realistic constraints we built a spiking network model based on experimental data from telencephalic area Dp of adult zebrafish, a precisely balanced recurrent network homologous to piriform cortex. We found that E/I assemblies stabilized firing rate distributions compared to networks with excitatory assemblies and global inhibition. Unlike classical memory models, networks with E/I assemblies did not show discrete attractor dynamics. Rather, responses to learned inputs were locally constrained onto manifolds that ‘focused’ activity into neuronal subspaces. The covariance structure of these manifolds supported pattern classification when information was retrieved from selected neuronal subsets. Networks with E/I assemblies therefore transformed the geometry of neuronal coding space, resulting in continuous representations that reflected both relatedness of inputs and an individual’s experience. Such continuous representations enable fast pattern classification, can support continual learning, and may provide a basis for higher-order learning and cognitive computations.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92683">AI-driven automated discovery tools reveal diverse behavioral competencies of biological networks</a></h4>

              
                Many applications in biomedicine and synthetic bioengineering rely on understanding, mapping, predicting, and controlling the complex behavior of chemical and genetic networks. The emerging field of diverse intelligence investigates the problem-solving capacities of unconventional agents. However, few quantitative tools exist for exploring the competencies of non-conventional systems. Here, we view gene regulatory networks (GRNs) as agents navigating a problem space and develop automated tools to map the robust goal states GRNs can reach despite perturbations. Our contributions include: (1) Adapting curiosity-driven exploration algorithms from AI to discover the range of reachable goal states of GRNs, and (2) Proposing empirical tests inspired by behaviorist approaches to assess their navigation competencies. Our data shows that models inferred from biological data can reach a wide spectrum of steady states, exhibiting various competencies in physiological network dynamics without requiring structural changes in network properties or connectivity. We also explore the applicability of these ‘behavioral catalogs’ for comparing evolved competencies across biological networks, for designing drug interventions in biomedical contexts and synthetic gene networks for bioengineering. These tools and the emphasis on behavior-shaping open new paths for efficiently exploring the complex behavior of biological networks.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101727">Assessing the balance between excitation and inhibition in chronic pain through the aperiodic component of EEG</a></h4>

              
                Chronic pain is a prevalent and debilitating condition whose neural mechanisms are incompletely understood. An imbalance of cerebral excitation and inhibition (E/I), particularly in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), is believed to represent a crucial mechanism in the development and maintenance of chronic pain. Thus, identifying a non-invasive, scalable marker of E/I could provide valuable insights into the neural mechanisms of chronic pain and aid in developing clinically useful biomarkers. Recently, the aperiodic component of the electroencephalography (EEG) power spectrum has been proposed to represent a non-invasive proxy for E/I. We, therefore, assessed the aperiodic component in the mPFC of resting-state EEG recordings in 149 people with chronic pain and 115 healthy participants. We found robust evidence against differences in the aperiodic component in the mPFC between people with chronic pain and healthy participants, and no correlation between the aperiodic component and pain intensity. These findings were consistent across different subtypes of chronic pain and were similarly found in a whole-brain analysis. Their robustness was supported by preregistration and multiverse analyses across many different methodological choices. Together, our results suggest that the EEG aperiodic component does not differentiate between people with chronic pain and healthy individuals. These findings and the rigorous methodological approach can guide future studies investigating non-invasive, scalable markers of cerebral dysfunction in people with chronic pain and beyond.

">Spinal Cord Ultrasound Stimulation Modulates Corticospinal Excitability</a></h4>

              
                Background: Low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) offers superior tissue penetration and enables precise neuromodulation of cortical and subcortical circuits. However, its effects on neural activity in the human spinal cord remain largely unexplored. Objective: To investigate the effects of LIFU on spinal cord neuromodulation under varying conditions of intensity (spatial-peak pulse-average intensity, ISPPA), duty cycle (DC), and pulse repetition frequency (PRF). Methods: Thirty-six healthy human volunteers participated in the study. A 500 kHz ultrasound transducer with a focal depth exceeding 100 mm was used to target the C8 spinal cord. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was applied to the primary motor cortex (M1) hotspot corresponding to the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle, innervated by the C8 nerve. A 500 ms-duration LIFU was delivered to the C8 spinal cord 400 ms prior to single-pulse TMS over the FDI hotspot. Spinal cord ultrasound stimulation (SCUS) was administered with varying acoustic parameters: intensities (ISPPA: 2.5 and 10 W/cm2), DCs (10% and 30%), and PRFs (500 and 1000 Hz). Changes in corticospinal excitability were assessed by comparing TMS-elicited motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) between active and sham SCUS conditions. Results: SCUS with an ISPPA of 10 W/cm2, a DC of 30%, and a PRF of 1000 Hz significantly reduced MEP amplitudes compared to sham stimulation. However, at the high intensity (ISPPA of 10 W/cm2), varying the DC between 10% and 30% did not affect MEP amplitudes. Additionally, while a PRF of 1000 Hz decreased MEP amplitudes at 10 W/cm2, a PRF of 500 Hz did not produce significant changes. Conclusions: The results indicate that ultrasound stimulation of the spinal cord can suppress corticospinal drive to muscles, especially when utilizing high intensity and high PRF parameters. This suggests that ultrasound stimulation may provide a novel method for modulating human spinal neural activity.

">EEG-Informed fMRI Analysis Reveals Neurovascular Coupling in Motor Execution and Imagery</a></h4>

              
                The complementary strengths of electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have driven extensive research into integrating these two noninvasive modalities to better understand the neural mechanisms underlying cognitive, sensory, and motor functions. However, the precise neural patterns associated with motor functions, especially imagined movements, remain unclear. Specifically, the correlations between electrophysiological responses and hemodynamic activations during executed and imagined movements have not been fully elucidated at a whole-brain level. In this study, we employed an EEG-informed fMRI approach on concurrent EEG-fMRI data to map hemodynamic changes associated with dynamic EEG temporal features during motor-related brain activities. We localized and differentiated the hemodynamic activations corresponding to continuous EEG temporal dynamics across multiple motor execution and imagery tasks. Validation against conventional block fMRI analysis demonstrated high precision in identifying regions specific to motor activities, underscoring the accuracy of the EEG-driven model. Beyond the expected sensorimotor activations, the integrated analysis revealed supplementary coactivated regions showing significant negative covariation between blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) activities and sensorimotor EEG alpha power, including the cerebellum and insular cortex. These findings confirmed both the colocalization of EEG and fMRI activities in sensorimotor regions and a negative covariation between EEG alpha band power and BOLD changes. Moreover, the results provide novel insights into neurovascular coupling during motor execution and imagery on a brain-wide scale, advancing our understanding of the neural dynamics underlying motor functions.

">Self-supervision deep learning models are better models of human high-level visual cortex: The roles of multi-modality and dataset training size</a></h4>

              
                With the rapid development of Artificial Neural Network based visual models, many studies have shown that these models show unprecedented potence in predicting neural responses to images in visual cortex. Lately, advances in computer vision have introduced self-supervised models, where a model is trained using supervision from natural properties of the training set. This has led to examination of their neural prediction performance, which revealed better prediction of self-supervised than supervised models for models trained with language supervision or with image-only supervision. In this work, we delve deeper into the models ability to explain neural representations of object categories. We compare models that differed in their training objectives to examine where they diverge in their ability to predict fMRI and MEG recordings while participants are presented with images of different object categories. Results from both fMRI and MEG show that self-supervision was advantageous in comparison to classification training. In addition, language supervision is a better predictor for later stages of visual perception, while image-only supervision shows a consistent advantage over a longer duration, beginning from 80ms after exposure. Examination of the effect of data size training revealed that large dataset did not necessarily improve neural predictions, in particular in visual self-supervised models. Finally, examination of the correspondence of the hierarchy of each model to visual cortex showed that image-only self-supervision led to better correspondence than image only models. We conclude that while self-supervision shows consistently better prediction of fMRI and MEG recordings, each type of supervision reveals a different property of neural activity, with language-supervision explaining later onsets, while image-only self-supervision explains long and very early latencies of the neural response, with the model hierarchy naturally sharing corresponding hierarchical structure as the brain.

">Prolyl isomerase FKBP12 reduces axon growth and negatively regulates microtubule polymerization by inhibiting CRMP2A</a></h4>

              
                Prolyl isomerases are enzymes catalyzing conformational change of the peptide bond between proline and the preceding amino acid, regulating the function and stability of their substrates. We have previously identified CRMP2A - the longer isoform of a microtubule-associated protein Collapsin response mediator protein 2 - as a substrate of the phospho-specific prolyl isomerase Pin1. CRMP2A is negatively regulated and destabilized by CDK5 phosphorylation in the distal axons and growth cones. Pin1 specifically binds to phosphorylated CRMP2A and stabilizes it by inducing conformational changes. However, the conformational regulation of unphosphorylated CRMP2 remains unknown. Here, we show that the prolyl isomerase FKBP12 specifically binds to unphosphorylated CRMP2A and regulates its activity. Using in vitro microtubule polymerization assays we demonstrate that CRMP2A promotes microtubule growth and that this function is inhibited by FKBP12. Next, using GFP-EB3 microtubule plus-end tracking assay, we demonstrate that FKBP12 inhibits CRMP2A-mediated microtubule polymerization also in cells. Furthermore, we show that FKBP12 co-localizes with unphosphorylated CRMP2A in growth cones and that expression of FKBP12 reduces axon growth in microfluidic chambers, while FKBP12 knockdown enhances it. Together, we demonstrate that FKBP12 is a negative regulator of microtubule dynamics and axon growth. Moreover, we show that two prolyl isomerases can differentially (positively or negatively) regulate activity of a common substrate depending on its phosphorylation. This provides an additional layer of phosphorylation-dependent or -independent control of protein activity, microtubule dynamics, and neuronal growth. Given the broad substrate specificity of FKBP12 and Pin1, this regulatory mechanism likely contributes to the modulation of diverse proteins and cellular processes in the nervous system and beyond.

                Reward-predictive Pavlovian cues can selectively invigorate instrumental behaviors. Accumulating evidence pinpoints the basolateral amygdala (BLA) as a key brain structure to assign outcome-specific motivational significance to Pavlovian cues or Instrumental actions. However, whether neuronal representations of Pavlovian and Instrumental learnings are processed in different BLA circuits and how the resulting memories interact is unknown. Here, we used calcium imaging and optogenetic manipulation of the BLA neurons in mice that acquired and expressed Pavlovian and Instrumental behaviors in a multi-phase behavioral task called specific Pavlovian to Instrumental Transfer (sPIT). We first confirmed that Pavlovian cues selectively invigorate instrumental actions and showed that this effect, referred as the sPIT effect, depends on BLA activity. Then, by tracking the activity of single BLA neurons across days, we found that BLA neurons integrate common reward-anticipation information relevant for Pavlovian and instrumental learning. Interestingly, this reward-anticipation information re-emerged during subsequent memory transfer and covaried with sPIT effect. These findings reveal that the BLA encodes an outcome-specific motivational state that generalizes across Pavlovian and instrumental behaviors to promote and guide reward-seeking behavior.

">In vivo Quantification of White Matter Pathways in the Human Hippocampus</a></h4>

              
                The hippocampus is a key structure in cognition. Although much research has focused on defining the functions of its anatomically distinct subfields, the communication among these subfields within the hippocampal circuit, supported by white matter pathways, is theoretically key to emergent cognitive function. Yet, hippocampal white matter connections in humans have not been fully explored in vivo. By leveraging diffusion weighted imaging and a large healthy sample (N=831), we developed a processing pipeline for in vivo quantification of human hippocampal pathways. We provided evidence for monosynaptic and trisynaptic pathway-related connections in humans, supporting the described hippocampal circuit in ex vivo and animal studies. In addition to hemispheric and sex differences, the individual variability in hippocampal pathways was linked to cognitive abilities. Thus, in vivo characterization of human hippocampal pathways highlights the individual differences within these structures and paves the way for their implications in cognition, aging, and diseases.

">Smooth pursuit eye movements contribute to long-latency reflex modulation in the lower extremity</a></h4>

              
                Somatosensory mediated reactions play a fundamental role in adapting to environmental changes, particularly through long-latency responses (LLRs). We investigated how smooth pursuit eye movements (SPEM), which are slow eye movements used to track moving objects, influence LLRs of the upper and lower limb during mechanical interactions with moving objects. Seventeen participants stabilized their limb in anticipation of a collision with a virtual object approaching at 25 cm/s while standing. This task occurred while subjects either visually pursued the object or fixated a central location. Mechanical perturbations were applied at two time points: approximately 200ms and 60ms before the anticipated collision. On a random subset of trials, the robot applied a mechanical perturbation either 200ms (early) or 60ms (late) before the anticipated collision. As in previous studies LLRs were observed in leg muscles to upper limb displacement. Moreover, the leg LLRs were modulated by gaze, being larger during pursuit than fixation but only during late perturbations. This timing-specific modulation aligns with previous reports of policy transitions in feedback control roughly 60ms before impact. Upper limb LLRs were not impacted by gaze indicating a prioritization on postural control circuits. This work extends our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying sensorimotor integration and highlights the sophisticated nature of the human motor control system in coordinating eye movements with whole-body postural responses.

">BDNF in Ventrolateral Orbitofrontal Cortex to Dorsolateral Striatum Circuit Moderates Alcohol Consumption and Gates Alcohol Habit</a></h4>

              
                BDNF plays a crucial role in shaping the structure and function of neurons. BDNF signaling in the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) is part of an endogenous pathway that protects against the development of alcohol use disorder (AUD). Dysregulation of BDNF levels in the cortex or dysfunction of BDNF/TrkB signaling in the DLS results in the escalation of alcohol drinking and compulsive alcohol use. The major source of BDNF in the striatum is the prefrontal cortex. We identified a small ensemble of BDNF-positive neurons in the ventrolateral orbitofrontal cor-tex (vlOFC), a region involved in AUD, that extend axonal projections to the DLS. We speculated that BDNF in vlOFC-to-DLS circuit may play a role in limiting alcohol drinking and that heavy alcohol use disrupts this protec-tive pathway. We found that BDNF expression is reduced in the vlOFC of male but not female mice after long-term cycles of binge alcohol drinking and withdrawal. We discovered that overexpression of BDNF in vlOFC-to-DLS but not in vlOFC-to-dorsomedial striatum (DMS) or M2 motor cortex-to-DLS circuit reduces alcohol but not sucrose intake and preference. The DLS plays a major role in habitual behaviors. We hypothesized that BDNF in vlOFC-to-DLS circuitry controls alcohol intake by gating habitual alcohol seeking. We found that BDNF over-expression in vlOFC-to-DLS circuit and systemic administration of BDNF receptor TrkB agonist, LM22A-4, bi-ases habitually trained mice towards goal-directed alcohol seeking. Together, our data suggest that BDNF in a small ensemble of vlOFC-to-DLS neurons gates alcohol intake by attenuating habitual alcohol seeking.

">dlmoR: An open-source R package for the dim-light melatonin onset (DLMO) hockey-stick method</a></h4>

              
                The dim-light melatonin onset (DLMO) is a commonly used circadian phase marker indicating the start time of evening melatonin synthesis in humans. Several quantitative techniques have been developed to determine DLMO from melatonin time-series, including fixed- or variable-threshold techniques and the hockey-stick method developed by Danilenko and colleagues (2014). Here, we introduce dlmoR, an open-source implementation of the hockey-stick method implemented in the R programming language and licensed under the permissive MIT License. Our clean-room implementation followed the algorithm description from the original article, supported by iterative validation against the existing binary executable software. We benchmark our implementation using a total of 112 melatonin time-series data sets from two different studies (Blume et al, 2024; Heinrichs and Spitschan, 2024), and find high agreement between our implementation and the reference implementation. The mean DLMO point discrepancy between implementations was -2.1 +/- 11.1 minutes for the Blume et al. (2024) dataset and -1.482 +/- 21.7 for the Heinrichs and Spitschan (2024) dataset. Circular correlation coefficients were 0.986 and 0.964, respectively, and paired t-tests (p > 0.05) were not significant, suggesting no systematic difference or bias between the methods. dlmoR allows for the programmatic and batchable analysis of evening melatonin concentration data, enabling transparency and reproducibility of analytic techniques.

                Dysfunction of RNA-binding proteins, including TDP-43 and FUS, has been associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS); however, the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. Here, we reported that a neuronal upregulation of TRIM72 (Tripartite Motif Containing 72) in FUS mutation knockin ALS models slows disease progression. TRIM72 interacts with Commander, a protein complex for recycling of membrane proteins, facilitating membrane repair and antioxidation. Exosomal TRIM72 is detected in ALS patient cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and extracellular application of exosomal TRIM72 protects cell from membrane damage. In a sporadic ALS cohort, CSF TRIM72 level associates ALS disease progression. AAV-mediated neuronal expression of TRIM72 slows down the disease progressions in ALS models and in an ALS patient without adverse effects over a year treatment course. Taken together, our results suggest a universal neuronal protection of a TRIM family protein in cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous manners in ALS.

">Selective Targeting of Pathogenic Tau Seeds via a Novel VHH</a></h4>

              
                In Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related tauopathies, progressive pathology has been linked to prion mechanisms, whereby ordered tau assemblies, or ''seeds,'' form in one cell and transit to neighboring or connected cells where they serve as templates for their own replication. Despite intensive efforts to develop early diagnosis and effective treatment, none has emerged. This is due partly to the structural heterogeneity of tau seeds and limitations in selectively targeting their pathogenic conformations. Here we report the discovery of a camelid variable heavy domain of heavy chain (VHH) that preferentially binds tau seeds of AD, corticobasal degeneration (CBD), and PS19 tauopathy mouse brains. From a published synthetic VHH yeast display library, we identified VHH clones that bound 2N4R tau monomer. After counter-screening for immunoprecipitation of seeding from human brain, we identified two seed-selective anti-tau VHH--VHH(510) and VHH(50)--that preferentially bound pathological tau. We enhanced the stability of these VHHs through framework mutations without affecting their seed-binding characteristics. We characterized VHH(510) in detail, determining that it binds the carboxy terminus of tau, maintains robust seed avidity even in the presence of competing monomer, and stains pathological tau inclusions in mouse and human AD tissues. These results highlight the power of seed-selective VHH to bind pathogenic tau, paving the way for future therapeutic and diagnostic applications across a wide range of neurodegenerative disorders.

">Characterization of auditory responsive neurons in the mouse superior colliculus to naturalistic sounds</a></h4>

              
                Locating the source of a specific sound in a complex environment and determining its saliency is critical for survival. The superior colliculus (SC), a sensorimotor midbrain structure, plays an important role in sound localization and has been shown to have a topographic map of the auditory space in a range of species. In mice, previous studies using broadband white noise stimuli found that neurons use high-frequency monaural spectral cues and interaural level differences (ILDs) to compute spatially restricted receptive fields (RFs), and that these RFs are organized topographically along the azimuth. However, in a naturalistic environment, the auditory stimuli that an animal encounters may have rich spectral components; however, these sound sources can still be localized efficiently. It remains unknown whether and how the SC neurons respond to naturalistic sounds and, in turn, compute a spatially restricted RF. Here, we show results from large-scale in vivo physiological recordings of SC neurons in response to white noise, naturalistic ultrasonic pup calls and chirps. We find that mouse SC auditory neurons respond to pup calls with distinct temporal patterns and a spatial preference predominantly at ~60 degrees in contralateral azimuth. In addition, we categorized auditory SC neurons based on their spectrotemporal receptive field patterns and demonstrated that there are at least 4 distinct subtypes of auditory responsive SC neurons.

">Acoustic features of and behavioral responses to emotionally intense mouse vocalizations</a></h4>

              
                Social vocalizations contain cues that reflect the motivational state of a vocalizing animal. Once perceived, these cues may in turn affect the internal state and behavioral responses of listening animals. Using the CBA/CAJ mouse model of acoustic communication, this study examined acoustic cues that signal intensity in male-female interactions, then compared behavioral responses to intense mating vocal sequences with those from another intense behavioral context, restraint. Experiment I in this study examined behaviors and vocalizations associated with male-female social interactions. Based on several behaviors, we distinguished more general, courtship-type interactions from mating interactions involving mounting or attempted mounting behaviors. We then compared vocalizations between courtship and mating. The increase in behavioral intensity from courtship to mating was associated with altered syllable composition, more harmonic structure, lower minimum frequency, longer duration, reduced inter-syllable interval, and increased sound intensity. We then used these features to construct highly salient playback stimuli associated with mating. In Experiment II, we compared behavioral responses to playback of these mating sequences with responses to playback of aversive vocal sequences produced by restrained mice, described in previous studies. Subjects were females in estrus and males. We observed a range of behavioral responses. Some (e.g., Attending and Stretch-Attend) showed similar responses across playback type and sex, while others were context dependent (e.g., Flinching, Locomotion). Still other behaviors showed either an effect of sex (e.g., Self-Grooming, Still-and-Alert) or an interaction between playback type and sex (Escape). These results demonstrate both state-dependent features of mouse vocalizations and their effectiveness in evoking a range of behavioral responses, independent of contextual cues provided by other sensory stimuli or behavioral interactions.

                Coastal organisms express daily and tidal rhythms of physiology and behaviour to adapt to their intertidal environments. Although the molecular-genetic basis of the circadian clocks driving daily rhythms is well understood, the nature and mechanism of circatidal clocks remain a mystery. Using fluorescent in situ hybridisation, we mapped discrete clusters of putative clock cells co-expressing canonical circadian clock genes across the brains of the intertidal crustaceans Eurydice pulchra and Parhyale hawaiensis. Tidally rhythmic, field-collected E. pulchra exhibited ~12-hour and ~24-hours rhythms of gene expression in discrete cell groups. Laboratory-reared P. hawaiensis entrained to 24-hour light:dark cycles (LD) and exhibiting daily behaviour exhibited robust 24-hour rhythms of gene expression in several cell groups. In P. hawaiensis showing circatidal behaviour following tidal entrainment by agitation cycles under LD, circadian gene expression was evident in some of the daily rhythmic cell groups, but cells in the dorsal-lateral cluster exhibited robust ~12-hour, i.e., circatidal, transcriptional rhythms. This oscillation was phased to the prior tidal agitation, not to LD. These brain networks of cell groups with circadian or circatidal periodicities tracking LD or tidal agitation, respectively, reveal a neural substrate for the interactive generation of rhythms appropriate to complex intertidal habitats.

">Narrative 'twist' shifts within-individual neural representations of dissociable story features</a></h4>

              
                Given the same external input, one's understanding of that input can differ based on internal contextual knowledge. Where and how does the brain represent latent belief frameworks that interact with incoming sensory information to shape subjective interpretations? In this study, participants listened to the same auditory narrative twice, with a plot twist in the middle that dramatically shifted their interpretations of the story. Using a robust within-subject whole-brain approach, we leveraged shifts in neural activity between the two listens to identify where latent interpretations are represented in the brain. We considered the narrative in terms of its hierarchical structure, examining how global situation models and their subcomponents-namely, episodes and characters-are represented, finding that they rely on partially distinct sets of brain regions. Results suggest that our brains represent narratives hierarchically, with individual narrative elements being distinct and dynamically updated as a part of changing interpretations of incoming information.

">Cerebellar transcranial alternating current stimulation in the theta band facilitates extinction of learned fear responses</a></h4>

              
                Fear extinction is a major component of exposure therapy for anxiety disorders. There is initial evidence that the cerebellum contributes to fear extinction learning, i.e., the ability to learn that certain stimuli are no longer associated with an aversive outcome. So far, however, knowledge of the cerebellum's role in extinction is scarce. In the present study, 6 Hz cerebellar transcranial alternating current stimulation (ctACS) was used to modulate cerebellar function during extinction learning in young and healthy human participants in an MRI study. A two-day differential fear conditioning paradigm was used with acquisition and extinction training being performed on day 1, and fear extinction recall being tested on day 2. 6 Hz ctACS reduced spontaneous recovery of the initial fear association during recall, stabilizing extinction effects compared to sham ctACS. fMRI data during recall revealed significantly reduced activation in cortical areas involved in initial fear acquisition, such as the anterior cingulate and insula, in the verum ctACS group compared to the sham group. During extinction training, on the other hand, the verum group exhibited more widespread cerebral activation compared to the sham group. Group differences were significant in occipital cortical areas. Although direct stimulation effects cannot be excluded, increased activation in the visual cortex may reflect enhanced encoding and processing of visual information during fear extinction learning. The findings suggest that theta-range oscillatory interactions between the cerebellum and cortical areas support extinction processes and provide causal evidence of the cerebellar role in the human fear extinction network.

">Deciphering Brain Organoids Heterogeneity by Identifying Key Quality Determinants</a></h4>

              
                Brain organoids derived from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) hold immense potential for modeling neurodevelopmental processes and disorders. However, undefined organoid selection criteria for analysis and their variability hinder reproducibility. As part of the Bavarian ForInter consortium, we generated 72 brain organoids from distinct hPSC lines. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of their morphological and cellular characteristics at an early stage of their development. In our assessment, the Feret diameter emerged as a reliable, single parameter that characterizes brain organoid quality. Transcriptomic analysis further confirmed the reliability of this marker and identified a negative impact of mesenchymal cells on the abundance of organoid formation. High-quality organoids consistently displayed a lower mesenchymal cell presence. These findings offer a framework for enhancing brain organoid standardization and reproducibility, underscoring the need for morphological quality controls and the consideration of mesenchymal cell influence on organoid-based modeling.

">Risk preferences causally rely on parietal magnitude representations: Evidence from combined TMS-fMRI</a></h4>

              
                Risk preferences have traditionally been considered as stable traits that reflect subjective-valuation processes in prefrontal areas. More recently, however, it has been suggested that risk preferences may also be shaped by how choice problems are perceived and processed in perceptual brain regions. Specifically, the acuity of the parietal approximate number system (ANS), which encodes payoff magnitudes for different choice options, has been shown to correlate with both risk preferences and choice consistency. However, this correlational relationship leaves open the question whether parietal magnitude representations in fact causally underlie choice. Here, we provide direct evidence for such a key causal role of parietal magnitude representations in economic choice, using continuous theta-burst transcranial magnetic stimulation (cTBS), combined with functional MRI (fMRI) and numerical population receptive field (nPRF) modeling. Our stimulation protocol targeted numerosity-tuned regions in the right parietal cortex, identified through nPRF modeling of individual fMRI data (n=35; within-subject design). The stimulation successfully perturbed neural processing, as evidenced by decreased amplitude of numerical magnitude-tuned responses and less accurate multivariate decoding of presented magnitudes from unseen data that were not used for model fitting. In line with a perceptual account of risky choice, the reduction in neural information capacity was also reflected in noisier behavioral responses. Moreover, a computational cognitive model fitted to choice behavior revealed that perturbing the ANS specifically increased the noisiness of small-magnitude representations. This perturbation made small magnitudes to be perceived as larger than they actually are, leading to more risk-seeking behavior. Finally, individual estimates of the cTBS effect on cognitive noise correlated with the corresponding decrease in amplitude of numerical magnitude-tuned fMRI responses, further solidifying the role of the parietal ANS in economic choice. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that the precision of parietal magnitude representations causally influences economic decision-making, with noisier encoding promoting biased risk-taking as formalized in recent perceptual models of risky choice.

	<p>Background/Objectives: Objective memory decline is associated with poor quality of life (QOL) in Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD, but it is unclear what role perception of memory (metamemory) plays. The Multifactorial Memory Questionnaire (MMQ) measures metamemory and is proposed to have a three-factor structure, but the factor structure of the MMQ in PD has not been explored. The current study examined (i) the factor structure of the MMQ in PD and (ii) the relationship between the metamemory and QOL in PD. Methods: This longitudinal, observational study involved 149 participants with PD (98 males, M age = 65.78 years, SD = 9.25). Participants completed the MMQ and the Unified Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease Rating Scale (disease severity) at baseline, and the Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease Questionnaire-39 (QOL) two years later. Results: Confirmatory factor analysis revealed both the three-factor and four-factor models were inadequate. Exploratory factor analysis resulted in a four-factor solution. The contentment and ability subscales from the original factor structure remained, while the strategies subscale was divided into external strategies and internal strategies. Disease severity, ability, and internal strategies uniquely predicted QOL. Individuals who reported low subjective memory ability and high use of internal strategies reported worse QOL two years later. Conclusions: These findings indicate that metamemory predicts QOL in PD and suggest that improved perceived memory ability and strategy use could offer avenues for improved QOL.</p>

	<p>Background: This study examined the prevalence of mental health issues among Paraguayan researchers and their relationships with emotional regulation and psychosocial factors. Methods: A cross-sectional survey of 235 researchers was conducted using validated instruments: the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21); the Job Content Questionnaire (JCQ); and the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS). Sociodemographic, academic, and behavioral variables were also analyzed. Results: Findings revealed significant rates of depression (26.4%), anxiety (30.6%), and stress (32.3%), with female researchers reporting nearly twice the rates of anxiety and stress compared to males. Researchers with doctoral degrees exhibited lower anxiety levels, emphasizing the protective role of advanced academic qualifications. Conversely, younger and early-career researchers were more vulnerable to psychological distress. High job demands and emotional dysregulation were strongly associated with poorer mental health outcomes, while hazardous alcohol consumption and low physical activity further exacerbated risks. Conclusions: These findings highlight the urgent need for institutional reforms to prioritize mental health and well-being in academic environments. By advancing the understanding of occupational health in resource-limited settings, this study provides actionable recommendations to improve the working conditions and mental health of researchers in Paraguay and beyond.</p>

     alt="Neurological and Cognitive Effects of Hypothyroidism in Patients With Epilepsy: A Study on Anti-Seizure Medicines Therapy"/>
<p>The study's significance lies in its comprehensive analysis of neurological disorders and cognitive pathologies in hypothyroidism and epilepsy patients undergoing anti-seizure medicines therapy. The study findings underscore the importance of early diagnosis and appropriate therapy in managing cognitive and neurological impairments in patients with hypothyroidism and epilepsy. To enhance clinical practice, specific measures that could be implemented include integrating routine cognitive assessments into the standard care of patients with thyroid dysfunction and personalizing treatment protocols based on individual risk factors such as hormone levels, family history, and stress indicators.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The primary objective of this study was to examine neurological disorders and cognitive impairments in patients with secondary hypothyroidism and epilepsy undergoing treatment with antiepileptic medications. The study included 184 patients divided into three groups: Group 1 (subclinical hypothyroidism, <i>n</i> = 60), Group 2 (manifest hypothyroidism, <i>n</i> = 64), and Group 3 (control, <i>n</i> = 60). Patients in Group 2 received levothyroxine therapy (initial dose of 25 μg/day, titrated to 50–100 μg/day), while Groups 1 and 2 were treated with anti-seizure medications (valproic acid, 40 mg/kg/day). Neurological symptoms, including Babinski's reflex abnormalities (<i>χ</i>
<sup>2</sup> = 8.15, <i>p</i> = 0.017) and sensory disturbances (<i>χ</i>
<sup>2</sup> = 12.44, <i>p</i> = 0.005), were significantly more frequent in Group 2 than in Group 1. Cognitive test scores were significantly lower in Group 2 compared to Group 3 across all domains (<i>F</i>(2, 181) = 6.55, <i>p</i> = 0.002 for MMSE; <i>F</i>(2, 181) = 4.70, <i>p</i> = 0.010 for FAB; and <i>F</i>(2, 181) = 5.75, <i>p</i> = 0.006 for CDT), with Group 1 showing intermediate results. Regression analysis identified neurodegenerative disease risk (<i>β</i> = 0.34, CI: 0.20–0.48, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), anemia (<i>β</i> = 0.32, CI: 0.15–0.49, <i>p</i> = 0.001), and prolonged stress (<i>β</i> = 0.26, CI: 0.12–0.40, <i>p</i> = 0.002) as significant predictors of cognitive decline, while higher education was protective (<i>β</i> = −0.28, CI: −0.42 to −0.14, <i>p</i> = 0.003). An inverse relationship was observed between TSH levels and cognitive scores (<i>r</i> = −0.55, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001).</p>

<p>In this study, we used immunoelectron microscopic methods combined with tract-tracing approaches to demonstrate that GluD1 is primarily expressed in the core of symmetric synapses formed by GABAergic terminals that originate from the lateral hypothalamus and entopeduncular nucleus in the rodent and primate lateral habenula.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Glutamate delta receptor 1 (GluD1) is a unique synaptogenic molecule expressed at excitatory and inhibitory synapses. The lateral habenula (LHb), a subcortical structure that regulates negative reward prediction error and major monoaminergic systems, is enriched in GluD1. LHb dysfunction has been implicated in psychiatric disorders such as depression and schizophrenia, both of which are associated with <i>GRID1</i>, the gene that encodes GluD1. Thus, disruption in GluD1 synaptic signaling may contribute to LHb dysfunction and the pathophysiology of LHb-associated disorders. Despite its strong cellular expression, little is known about the subsynaptic and subcellular localization of GluD1 in LHb neurons. Given that GluD1 is involved in the development and/or regulation of glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses in various brain regions, a detailed map of GluD1 synaptic localization is essential to elucidate its role in the LHb. To address this issue, we used immunoelectron microscopy methods in rodents and monkeys. In both species, GluD1 immunoreactivity was primarily expressed in dendritic profiles, with lower expression in somata, spines, and glial elements. Pre- and post-embedding immunogold experiments revealed strong GluD1 expression in the core of symmetric GABAergic synapses. Albeit less frequent, GluD1 was also found at the edges (i.e., perisynaptic) of asymmetric, putative glutamatergic synapses. Through the combination of anterograde tracing with immunogold labeling in rats, we showed that axon terminals from the entopeduncular nucleus and the lateral hypothalamus express postsynaptic GluD1 immunolabeling in the LHb. Our findings suggest that GluD1 may play a critical role in modulating GABAergic transmission in the rodent and primate LHb.</p>

	<p>Background: Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH) is the most dreaded complication after reperfusion therapy for acute ischemic stroke. We performed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to estimate and compare risks of sICH after mechanical thrombectomy (MT) depending on the location of the large vessel occlusion, concomitant use of intravenous thrombolysis, timing of treatment, and core size. Methods: Randomized controlled trials were included, following a comprehensive search of different databases from inception to 1 March 2024. Random-effect models in a meta-analysis were employed to obtain the pooled risk ratios (RRs) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for sICH with MT, and were then compared to other reperfusion treatment regimens, including best medical treatment and intravenous thrombolysis (IVT). Results: MT in the anterior circulation was associated with a significantly higher risk of sICH as compared with no-MT (RR: 1.46; 95%CI: 1.03&amp;amp;ndash;2.07; p = 0.037). The risk of sICH was comparable between the MT and MT+IVT groups (RR: 0.77; 95%CI: 0.57&amp;amp;ndash;1.03; p = 0.079). There was no difference in sICH risk with MT as compared with no-MT within 6 h of last known well (RR: 1.14; 95%CI: 0.78&amp;amp;ndash;1.66; p = 0.485) and beyond that time (RR: 1.29; 95%CI: 0.80&amp;amp;ndash;2.08; p = 0.252); the risk of sICH was also comparable between MT conducted within 6 h of last known well and MT conducted beyond that time (p = 0.512). The sICH risk for MT in the posterior circulation (RR: 7.48; 95%CI: 2.27&amp;amp;ndash;24.61) was significantly higher than for MT in the anterior circulation (RR: 1.18; 95%CI: 0.90&amp;amp;ndash;1.56) (p = 0.003). MT was also associated with a significantly higher sICH risk than no-MT among patients with large core strokes (RR: 1.71; 95%CI: 1.09&amp;amp;ndash;2.66, p = 0.018). Conclusions: When evaluating cumulative evidence from randomized controlled trials, the risk of sICH is increased after MT compared with patients not treated with MT. Yet, the difference is largely driven by the greater risk of sICH in patients treated with MT for posterior circulation occlusions and, to a lesser degree, large core strokes. Concomitant use of intravenous thrombolysis and the use of MT in the extended therapeutic window do not raise the risk of sICH.</p>

	<p>Background: Previous studies have shown that multiple post-traumatic irradiations of the cochlea with near-infrared light (NIR) can significantly reduce noise-induced hearing loss. However, a single NIR pre-treatment was shown to have the same effect. Extending the pre-treatment time did not result in any further reduction in hearing loss. The present study investigated whether a combined NIR pre- and post-treatment had an increased effect on hearing preservation. Methods: Frequency-specific auditory brainstem potential thresholds (ABR) were determined in young adult mice. One group (n = 8) underwent NIR irradiation (808 nm, 120 mW, 15 min) of the cochlea, followed by a 30 min noise exposure (5&amp;amp;ndash;20 kHz, 115 dB SPL). A post-NIR treatment was administered for 30 min immediately following the noise trauma. After 14 days, hearing loss was determined by ABR measurements. The results were compared with a trauma-only group (n = 8) and an untreated control group (n = 5). Subsequently, the spiral ganglion neuron density was investigated. Results: A peri-traumatic NIR treatment resulted in a significantly lower hearing loss compared to the trauma-only group. Hearing protection in these animals significantly exceeded the effect of an exclusive pre- or post-treatment across all frequencies. A loss of spiral ganglion neurons in the trauma-only group was observed, which was significantly rescued by the peri-traumatic NIR treatment. Conclusions: A single peri-traumatic NIR treatment seems to be the more effective approach for the preservation of hearing thresholds after noise trauma compared to an isolated pre- or post-treatment. One target of the protective effect seems to be the spiral ganglion.</p>

	<p>Background/Objectives: Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder, characterised by cardinal motor features and a multitude of non-motor manifestations. Among them, cognitive impairment in PD has been recognised as a defined clinical entity, and it might lead to an increased risk of developing dementia. Consequently, the present review aimed to ascertain the available interventions for the training of cognitive abilities in persons with PD (PwPD). Methods: PRISMA guidelines were followed to select studies in the following databases: PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science. Two independent reviewers conducted the different phases of the review, and a third expert was called in to address any doubts/conflicts. Randomised controlled trials and randomised clinical trials concerning cognitive training with cognitive outcomes in PwPD were selected. Results: A total of 28 articles were included. The considered studies applied various experimental interventions for the training of cognitive functions in PwPD: computer-based platforms, exergames, paper-and-pencil programmes, dual-task or treadmill training with action observation therapy, motor imagery, and virtual reality components, interventions targeting precise cognitive domain, tele-rehabilitation, transcranial direct current stimulation, structured cognitive training, and multimodal treatments. Cognitive functions were assessed employing neuropsychological tests, self-report questionnaires, and computerised batteries. Conclusions: Overall, the review reported better performances in the experimental groups compared to the control groups, in several cognitive domains. Structured cognitive training emerged as the most effective strategy to enhance cognitive functioning in PwPD. However, further studies are necessary to determine the most appropriate and useful training and to develop interventions that also consider patients&amp;amp;rsquo; quality of life.</p>

	<p>Objective: Functional magnetic resonance imaging data pose significant challenges due to their inherently noisy and complex nature, making traditional statistical models less effective in capturing predictive features. While deep learning models offer superior performance through their non-linear capabilities, they often lack transparency, reducing trust in their predictions. This study introduces the Time Reversal (TR) pretraining method to address these challenges. TR aims to learn temporal dependencies in data, leveraging large datasets for pretraining and applying this knowledge to improve schizophrenia classification on smaller datasets. Methods: We pretrained an LSTM-based model with attention using the TR approach, focusing on learning the direction of time in fMRI data, achieving over 98 % accuracy on HCP and UK Biobank datasets. For downstream schizophrenia classification, TR-pretrained weights were transferred to models evaluated on FBIRN, COBRE, and B-SNIP datasets. Saliency maps were generated using Integrated Gradients (IG) to provide post hoc explanations for pretraining, while Earth Mover&amp;amp;rsquo;s Distance (EMD) quantified the temporal dynamics of salient features in the downstream tasks. Results: TR pretraining significantly improved schizophrenia classification performance across all datasets: median AUC scores increased from 0.7958 to 0.8359 (FBIRN), 0.6825 to 0.7778 (COBRE), and 0.6341 to 0.7224 (B-SNIP). The saliency maps revealed more concentrated and biologically meaningful salient features along the time axis, aligning with the episodic nature of schizophrenia. TR consistently outperformed baseline pretraining methods, including OCP and PCL, in terms of AUC, balanced accuracy, and robustness. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the dual benefits of the TR method: enhanced predictive performance and improved interpretability. By aligning model predictions with meaningful temporal patterns in brain activity, TR bridges the gap between deep learning and clinical relevance. These findings emphasize the potential of explainable AI tools for aiding clinicians in diagnostics and treatment planning, especially in conditions characterized by disrupted temporal dynamics.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/12/1/ENEURO.0418-24.2024?rss=1">Functional Regrowth of Norepinephrine Axons in the Adult Mouse Brain Following Injury</a></h4>

              
                <p>It is widely believed that axons in the central nervous system of adult mammals do not regrow following injury. This failure is thought, at least in part, to underlie the limited recovery of function following injury to the brain or spinal cord. Some studies of fixed tissue have suggested that, counter to dogma, norepinephrine (NE) axons regrow following brain injury. Here, we have used in vivo two-photon microscopy in layer 1 of the primary somatosensory cortex in transgenic mice harboring a fluorophore selectively expressed in NE neurons. This protocol allowed us to explore the dynamic nature of NE axons following injury with the selective NE axon toxin <I>N</I>-(2-chloroethyl)-<I>N</I>-ethyl-2-bromobenzylamine (DSP4). Following DSP4, NE axons were massively depleted and then slowly and partially recovered their density over a period of weeks. This regrowth was dominated by new axons entering the imaged volume. There was almost no contribution from local sprouting from spared NE axons. Regrown axons did not appear to use either the paths of previously lesioned NE axons or NE axons that were spared and survived DSP4 as a guide. To measure NE release, GCaMP8s was selectively expressed in neocortical astrocytes and startle-evoked, NE receptor-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients were measured. These Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients were abolished soon after DSP4 lesion but returned to pre-lesion values after 3&ndash;5&nbsp;weeks, roughly coincident with NE axon regrowth, suggesting that the regrown NE axons are competent to release NE in response to a physiological stimulus in the awake mouse.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/12/1/ENEURO.0419-24.2024?rss=1">Interaction between Facial Expression and Color in Modulating ERP P3</a></h4>

              
                <p>The relationships between facial expression and color affect human cognition functions such as perception and memory. However, whether these relationships influence selective attention and brain activity contributed to selective attention remains unclear. For example, reddish angry faces increase emotion intensity, but it is unclear whether brain activity and selective attention are similarly enhanced. To investigate these questions, we examined whether event-related potentials for faces vary depending on facial expression and color by recording electroencephalography (EEG) data. We conducted an oddball task using stimuli that combined facial expressions (angry, neutral) and facial colors (original, red, green). The participants counted the number of times a rarely appearing target face stimulus appeared among the standard face stimuli. The results indicated that the difference in P3 amplitudes for the target and standard faces depended on the combinations of facial expressions and facial colors; the P3 for red angry faces were greater than those for red neutral faces. Additionally, facial expression or facial color had no significant main effect or interaction effect on P1 amplitudes for the target, and facial expression had significant main effects only on the N170 amplitude. These findings suggest that the interaction between facial expression and color modulates the P3 associated with selective attention. Moreover, the response enhancement resulting from this interaction appears to occur at a cognitive processing stage that follows the processing stage associated with facial color or expression alone. Our results support the idea that red color increases the human response to anger from an EEG perspective.</p>

                Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a persistent, devastating, yet neglected, non-communicable disease, particularly in developing and emerging countries. The traditional risk factors for CKD, such as hypertension and diabetes have received relatively ample attention but do not sufficiently explain the high burden of CKD. Ambient air pollution is an emerging environmental risk factor for CKD; however, epidemiological data and evidence are lacking for susceptible populations in developing countries. The Niger Delta region of Nigeria is a petrochemical hub known for environmental degradation, including air pollution, and thus, serves as a good case study for investigating the association between air pollution and CKD. This brief is based on an exploratory mixed-methods study conducted in four communities situated near an oil and gas refinery in Warri, Nigeria, to explore perceived and actual air pollution risks and determine whether long-term exposure to ambient air pollution is associated with CKD. Air pollutant concentrations measured in partnership with citizen scientists using portable air sensors, showed that all except one air pollutant (ozone) exceeded the WHO acceptable limits in all four communities. PM2.5 ranged from 22.8 to 28.0 μg/m3, PM10, 40.6 to 55.5 μg/m3, and CO2, 584-652 ppm. The overall prevalence of CKD was 12.3% but even higher (18%) in a socially deprived semi-urban community closest to the oil refinery. Hypertension, diabetes, other behavioral risk factors, and exposures associated with CKD were prevalent in the four communities and environmental health information was lacking. A multifaceted approach is required to mitigate air pollution and the associated NCD risks in the region. The government needs to invest in air monitoring services, cleaner technologies, and environmental risk communication through various media channels. We strongly recommend public inclusion in planning, designing, and implementing educational interventions. Lastly, environmental risk factors such as air pollution should feature prominently in strategic plans for NCD prevention.

                This article provides a comprehensive analysis of knee strengthening post-surgery, focusing on key performance indicators (KPIs) essential for recovery and performance enhancement. The study delves into the importance of range of motion (ROM), load management through repetitions maximum (RM) and velocity-based training (VBT), speed variations, repetition schemes for hypertrophy and strength, and the assessment of pain, inflammation, and effusion. Emphasis is placed on dynamic alignment, muscle activation, and rate of perceived exertion (RPE) to tailor individualized rehabilitation programs. The integration of these KPIs ensures a balanced approach, enhancing muscle strength and joint integrity while minimizing injury risk. Regular monitoring and adjustments based on these indicators are recommended to optimize outcomes and ensure sustained progress in knee function and overall mobility.

                Introduction Recent advances in elucidating the pathogenetic mechanisms of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) and improvements in clinical trial design have reinvigorated the potential for agents developed in preclinical studies to be translated into new therapeutic agents, as well as highlighting the need for improved and effective means of measuring neuropathy in preclinical and clinical research. A systematic review of the literature on the methods of measuring the severity of DPN and the association of the results of each method with diabetic retinopathy would contribute positively to the above developments. Methods The intended scoping review will be aligned, in combination, with the frameworks proposed by Arksey and O’Malley, the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR), and the framework proposed by Peters et al. in 2015. The PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL, and ProQuest databases will be searched, as well as the ClinicalTrials.gov registry. The search strategy will include the following sequence of Boolean terms and operators: (“retinopathy” OR “eye disease” OR “eye disease” OR “maculopathy” OR “retinal” OR “macular”) AND “neuropathy” and for the title/abstract or abstract only “severity” AND (“diabetes” OR “diabetic”). The yielded publications will be screened according to criteria. This will be followed by data extraction, synthesis and presentation of results, discussion and conclusions. Discussion The different ways of measuring the severity of peripheral neuropathy identified in the previous literature will be discussed, as well as the association of neuropathy and/or its severity with retinopathy in patients with diabetes. The main aim of the discussion will be to elucidate the role of different methods of measuring the severity of DPN and its association with retinopathy. Registration The protocol has been registered on the international platform of registered systematic review and meta-analysis protocols (INPLASY).

                Abstract* Background This study investigates how perceived work alienation influences whistleblowing intention, with religious political orientation as a mediator and social value orientation as a moderator. Previous research has shown work alienation negatively correlates with prosocial behavior and activism while positively correlating with knowledge hiding. The study proposes that work alienation negatively predicts whistleblowing intention, with both religious political orientation and social value orientation playing influential roles in this relationship. Methods Predictive correlational design with a mediation and moderation analysis was used in this study. The participants of this study were 263 Indonesians (131 males, 132 females; M age = 25.91 years old; SD age = 5.47 years). Results The findings confirm that higher work alienation leads to lower whistleblowing intention. While religious political orientation did not significantly mediate the relationship between work alienation and whistleblowing intention as hypothesized, the study revealed that prosocial-type social value orientation weakens the negative relationship between work alienation and whistleblowing intention. The individualistic type showed no significant moderating effect. Conclusion The research demonstrates that work alienation significantly predicts whistleblowing intention, with prosocial social value orientation serving as a buffer against the negative effects of work alienation on whistleblowing intention. These findings contribute to our understanding of the psychological factors influencing whistleblowing behavior in corruption prevention and eradication efforts.

                Background Insufficient awareness of foot self-care among diabetic individuals results in diabetic foot ulcers especially in the Indian population considering its varied ethnicity and lifestyle practices. The management of diabetes and diabetic foot ulcers therefore demands a well-coordinated approach that involves multiple healthcare providers (HCPs). The present study aims to develop and validate an interprofessional collaborative (IPC) educational program involving HCPs to efficiently oversee and instruct the public on appropriate strategies for self-managing diabetic foot health in the Indian population. Methods The research group worked on creating an educational module titled ‘An Interprofessional Collaborative Educational Module on Self-Management of Foot for Individuals with Type II Diabetes Mellitus.’ The objective of this module was to promote the adoption of proper practices in self-managing foot health for individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus. A panel of 13 experts participated in a two-stage validation process using the Delphi method to assess the module and its educational resources. Subsequently, the module was tested on a group of 30 participants, i.e., individuals with diabetes, with its efficacy evaluated through conversation analysis and in-depth interviews. Results The three-month-long module included three sessions • 1: Diabetes and its health implications • 2: Diabetic foot and self-management • 3: Interprofessional education in diabetic foot care The mode of content delivery was via Whatsapp, and the educational resources, in the form of pamphlets, flowcharts, handouts, case-based cartoons, and videos on diabetes, including diabetic foot, its risks, and self-management, were shared regularly. All participating experts consensually validated the module and educational resources. Analysis of in-depth interviews revealed that the module immensely benefitted the participants and helped them improve their knowledge and practices of foot care in diabetes. Conclusions The study highlights the importance of developing and validating IPC educational modules tailored to diabetic foot care. It can aid in enhancing adherence to proper diabetic foot care practices. By promoting collaborative care approaches, these educational resources can contribute to better preventive practices, potentially reducing the risk of complications like foot ulcers and amputations in individuals with diabetes.

                Background The deductive system of BCL-algebra has not been thoroughly explored, and its fuzzification remains undefined. This study aims to the association of this gap by introducing a fuzzy extension of the deductive system of BCL-algebra using Pythagorean fuzzy sets. Methods We define a Pythagorean fuzzy set as a pair of membership and non-membership functions, where the sum of their squares lies between 0 and 1. These functions are used to extend the classical deductive system of BCL-algebra, allowing for reasoning based on fuzzy degrees. The system incorporates fuzzy operations such as union, intersection, and complement, while maintaining the structure of BCL-algebra. We also introduce key components such as the accuracy function, score function, degree of indeterminacy, and square deviation to measure the certainty, truth, uncertainty, and deviation of fuzzy sets. Results We prove that the intersection of two Pythagorean fuzzy deductive systems remains a valid Pythagorean fuzzy deductive system within BCL-algebra. However, we show that the union of such systems does not necessarily form a valid fuzzy deductive system. The study also provides detailed proofs using induction, logical derivations, and algebraic techniques. Conclusion The results disclose that while the intersection of Pythagorean fuzzy deductive systems preserves the system's structure, the union does not, offering new insights into the behavior and limitations of fuzzy systems in BCL-algebra.

                Introduction Pancreatic carcinoma (PC) is a highly malignant and lethal tumor characterized by a dismal prognosis which raised the need to identify other prognostic factors for better patient risk stratification. This study investigated the prognostic significance of tumor budding (TB) in pancreatic carcinoma using artificial intelligence. Methods In this retrospective multicenter study, we collected all cases of PC diagnosed (2008-2022). TB was assed using 2methods: manuel on hematoxylin-eosin (HE) slides and semi-automated using QUPATH software. The selected slide for each case was digitalized using NIS software version 4.00 connected to the microscope NIKON (Eclipse Ni-U). The pathological images were then incorporated into QUPATH. The budds were counted using cell count functionality based on the nucleus size and pixel variability, and TB scores were categorized as BUDD1(0-4), BUDD2(5-9) and BUDD3(≥10). We analyzed the association between the TB score and prognostic clinicopathological factors and overall survival. Results 25patients were included (mean age:62.3years;male-to-female ratio:2.57). TB was found in 100%of cases and a high TB score (BUDD2-3) was observed in 56%of cases (using QUPATH versus 48% using HE slides); statistical analysis showed no significant difference between the two methods(p=0.589). A high TB score was associated with older age(>72 years), ductal histological subtype and advanced stage (pT>2).53.8% of patients with lymph node metastasis or advanced stage had high TB score. Multivariate analysis revealed that TB score was strongly and independently associated with overall survival (OS), with a hazard ratio of 2.35. Conclusion TB is an additional prognostic factor in PC, and using artificial intelligence via QUPATH software offers a promising and accessible tool for pathologists to evaluate TB and to improve risk stratification in patients with PC.

                <p>by Ahmed Daoud, Asa Ben-Hur</p>

Complex deep learning models trained on very large datasets have become key enabling tools for current research in natural language processing and computer vision. By providing pre-trained models that can be fine-tuned for specific applications, they enable researchers to create accurate models with minimal effort and computational resources. Large scale genomics deep learning models come in two flavors: the first are large language models of DNA sequences trained in a self-supervised fashion, similar to the corresponding natural language models; the second are supervised learning models that leverage large scale genomics datasets from ENCODE and other sources. We argue that these models are the equivalent of foundation models in natural language processing in their utility, as they encode within them chromatin state in its different aspects, providing useful representations that allow quick deployment of accurate models of gene regulation. We demonstrate this premise by leveraging the recently created Sei model to develop simple, interpretable models of intron retention, and demonstrate their advantage over models based on the DNA language model DNABERT-2. Our work also demonstrates the impact of chromatin state on the regulation of intron retention. Using representations learned by Sei, our model is able to discover the involvement of transcription factors and chromatin marks in regulating intron retention, providing better accuracy than a recently published custom model developed for this purpose.

Transfer learning aims to integrate useful information from multi-source datasets to improve the learning performance of target data. This can be effectively applied in genomics when we learn the gene associations in a target tissue, and data from other tissues can be integrated. However, heavy-tail distribution and outliers are common in genomics data, which poses challenges to the effectiveness of current transfer learning approaches. In this paper, we study the transfer learning problem under high-dimensional linear models with t-distributed error (Trans-PtLR), which aims to improve the estimation and prediction of target data by borrowing information from useful source data and offering robustness to accommodate complex data with heavy tails and outliers. In the oracle case with known transferable source datasets, a transfer learning algorithm based on penalized maximum likelihood and expectation-maximization algorithm is established. To avoid including non-informative sources, we propose to select the transferable sources based on cross-validation. Extensive simulation experiments as well as an application demonstrate that Trans-PtLR demonstrates robustness and better performance of estimation and prediction when heavy-tail and outliers exist compared to transfer learning for linear regression model with normal error distribution.

Computational models are complex scientific constructs that have become essential for us to better understand the world. Many models are valuable for peers within and beyond disciplinary boundaries. However, there are no widely agreed-upon standards for sharing models. This paper suggests 10 simple rules for you to both (i) ensure you share models in a way that is at least “good enough,” and (ii) enable others to lead the change towards better model-sharing practices.

                <p>by Julien Laussu, Deborah Michel, Léa Magne, Stephane Segonds, Steven Marguet, Dimitri Hamel, Muriel Quaranta-Nicaise, Frederick Barreau, Emmanuel Mas, Vincent Velay, Florian Bugarin, Audrey Ferrand</p>

Understanding the interplay between biology and mechanics in tissue architecture is challenging, particularly in terms of 3D tissue organization. Addressing this challenge requires a biological model enabling observations at multiple levels from cell to tissue, as well as theoretical and computational approaches enabling the generation of a synthetic model that is relevant to the biological model and allowing for investigation of the mechanical stresses experienced by the tissue. Using a monolayer human colon epithelium organoid as a biological model, freely available tools (Fiji, Cellpose, Napari, Morphonet, or Tyssue library), and the commercially available Abaqus FEM solver, we combined vertex and FEM approaches to generate a comprehensive viscoelastic finite element model of the human colon organoid and demonstrated its flexibility. We imaged human colon organoid development for 120 hours, following the evolution of the organoids from an immature to a mature morphology. According to the extracted architectural/geometric parameters of human colon organoids at various stages of tissue architecture establishment, we generated organoid active vertex models. However, this approach did not consider the mechanical aspects involved in the organoids’ morphological evolution. Therefore, we applied a finite element method considering mechanical loads mimicking osmotic pressure, external solicitation, or active contraction in the vertex model by using the Abaqus FEM solver. Integration of finite element analysis (FEA) into the vertex model achieved a better fit with the biological model. Therefore, the FEM model provides a basis for depicting cell shape, tissue deformation, and cellular-level strain due to imposed stresses. In conclusion, we demonstrated that a combination of vertex and FEM approaches, combining geometrical and mechanical parameters, improves modeling of alterations in organoid morphology over time and enables better assessment of the mechanical cues involved in establishing the architecture of the human colon epithelium.

                <p>by Steffen N. Lindner, Markus Ralser</p>

The structure of the early metabolic network is unknown. Here, we report that when considered together, pentose utilization pathways form all life-essential precursors. We speculate that the chemistry preserved in pentose metabolism could therefore have been a central structural element in early metabolism.

                This study explored the occurrence of Listeria monocytogenes in fresh produce across Nigeria and selected developing countries, applying a holistic health perspective through a structured review and quantitative synthesis of available research published between 2006 and 2022. Following PRISMA standards, a pre-specified protocol for the review was designed and documented in PROSPERO (ID = CRD42024521833). A comprehensive search of PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases yielded 12 eligible studies. Data were extracted using standardized protocols, and pooled prevalence was calculated using a random-effects model. The overall prevalence was 8.4% (95% CI: 6.3-10.8%), with higher contamination in West Africa (10.5%) compared to Southeast Asia (5.2%). Leafy vegetables exhibited the highest contamination (12.1%). Molecular detection via PCR had higher detecting sensitivity (11.6%) compared to traditional culture methods (7.3%). The analysis revealed significant heterogeneity among the included studies (I2 = 97.79%, p < 0.0001), indicating considerable variability in the reported prevalence of Listeria spp. Environmental factors, such as temperature and poor agricultural practices, contributed to contamination. These findings underscore the need for robust hygiene controls and monitoring to mitigate L. monocytogenes risks in fresh produce.

                Ayurveda is one of the oldest holistic healthcare approaches in the world, underpinning the interdependency of mind, body, and spirit in encouraging harmony and preventing disease. The safety and effectiveness of Ayurveda were explored systematically through this review in various global contexts, including its historical development, current practice, and epidemiological trends. This study assesses the integration of Ayurveda into healthcare systems by analyzing experiences in India, the United States, Europe, and the Middle East and its potential to contribute to global health challenges. As Ayurveda’s originator, India has established a robust regulatory framework, extensive clinical research, and government policy support for its integration into mainstream medicine. Evidence supports the efficacy of Ayurvedic therapies, such as Panchakarma and herbal formulations, for treating chronic diseases with minimal side effects. Ayurveda has entered the fold of complementary and alternative medicine in the United States and Germany. Ayurveda treatments have been shown to be effective in various conditions, such as diabetes and arthritis, although regulatory inconsistencies and quality assurance remain significant barriers. There is a cultural affinity towards traditional medicine in the Middle East and Southeast Asia, leading to a growing adoption supported by collaborative initiatives and research. Despite the globally relevant Ayurveda, the non-uniform nature of regulatory standards, lack of large-scale clinical trials, and standardization of formulations form barriers to its more general acceptance. Recommendations for the future include fostering interdisciplinary research, harmonizing regulation, and leveraging digital health in furthering personalized medicine. This study underscores Ayurveda’s transformative potential in global healthcare, advocating sustainable, patient-centered solutions to address chronic and emerging health issues.

                Background Behaviorally conditioned immune functions are suggested to be regulated by bidirectional interactions between CNS and peripheral immune system via the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, sympathetic nervous system (SNS), and the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS). Since the current knowledge about biochemical pathways triggering conditioned immune enhancement is limited, the aim of this pilot study was gaining more insights into that. Methods Rats were conditioned with camphor smell and poly I:C injection, mimicking a viral infection. Following stimulus re-exposure, animals were sacrificed at different time points, and neural tissues along the HPA axis was analyzed with a rat genome array together with plasma protein using Luminex analysis. Results In the hypothalamus, we observed a strong upregulation of genes related to Wnt/β-catenin signaling (Otx2, Spp1, Fzd6, Zic1), monoaminergic transporter Slc18a2 and opioid-inhibitory G-protein Gpr88 as well as downregulation of dopaminergic receptors, vasoactive intestinal peptide Vip, and pro-melanin-concentrating hormone Pmch. In the pituitary, we recognized mostly upregulation of steroid synthesis in combination with GABAergic, cholinergic and opioid related neurotransmission, in adrenal glands, altered genes showed a pattern of activated metabolism plus upregulation of adrenoceptors Adrb3 and Adra1a. Data obtained from spleen showed a strong upregulation of immunomodulatory genes, chemo-/cytokines and glutamatergic/cholinergic neurotransmission related genes, as also confirmed by increased chemokine and ACTH levels in plasma. Conclusions Our data indicate that in addition to the classic HPA axis, there could be additional pathways as e.g. the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAIP), connecting brain and immune system, modulating and finetuning communication between brain and immune system.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Approximately 20% of familial cases of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are caused by mutations in the gene encoding superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1). Epidemiological data have identified traumatic brain injury (TBI) as an exogenous risk factor for ALS; however, the mechanisms by which TBI may worsen SOD1 ALS remain largely undefined.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We sought to determine whether repetitive TBI (rTBI) accelerates disease onset and progression in the transgenic SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mouse ALS model, and whether loss of the primary regulator of axonal degeneration sterile alpha and TIR motif containing 1 (<i>Sarm1</i>) mitigates the histological and behavioral pathophysiology. We subjected wild-type (n = 23), <i>Sarm1</i> knockout (KO; n = 17), SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> (n = 19), and SOD1<sup>G93A</sup>xSarm1<sup>KO</sup> (n = 26) mice of both sexes to rTBI or sham surgery at age 64 days (62–68 days). Body weight and ALS-deficit score were serially assessed up to 17 weeks after surgery and histopathology assessed in layer V of the primary motor cortex at the study end point.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In sham injured SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice, genetic ablation of <i>Sarm1</i> did not attenuate axonal loss, improve neurological deficits, or survival. The rTBI accelerated onset of G93A-SOD1 ALS, as indicated by accentuated body weight loss, earlier onset of hindlimb tremor, and shortened survival. The rTBI also triggered TDP-43 mislocalization, enhanced axonal and neuronal loss, microgliosis, and astrocytosis. Loss of <i>Sarm1</i> significantly diminished the impact of rTBI on disease progression and rescued rTBI-associated neuropathology.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>SARM1-mediated axonal death pathway promotes pathogenesis after TBI in SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice suggesting that anti-SARM1 therapeutics are a viable approach to preserve neurological function in injury-accelerated G93A-SOD1 ALS. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-59/v1?src=rss">Case Report: Surgical and cultural approaches to managing hematocolpos in adolescents: A Tunisian case report with video insights [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Hematocolpos is a gynecological disorder characterized by the accumulation of menstrual blood in the vagina due to anatomical obstruction, often resulting from an imperforate hymen (IH), the most common etiology in approximately 90% of cases. This condition can remain undiagnosed until adolescence, when menarche triggers clinical symptoms such as cyclical lower abdominal pain, primary amenorrhea, and in severe cases, a rapidly enlarging pelvic mass. Complications may include urinary retention, constipation, and infection if not promptly treated. Early diagnosis and intervention are crucial to prevent long-term consequences such as endometriosis, retrograde menstruation, and infertility. In Tunisia, the hymen holds significant cultural and social value, symbolizing virginity and moral purity, complicating the surgical management of hematocolpos. This case report discusses the surgical and cultural considerations involved in the treatment of a 13-year-old Tunisian girl diagnosed with hematocolpos. A hymen-sparing hymenotomy was selected, preserving the hymenal ring while creating an adequate orifice for menstrual flow, ensuring a balance between medical treatment and cultural sensitivities. The procedure, which included drainage of 600 ml of retained blood and meticulous suturing to maintain the hymen’s appearance, was successful. The patient experienced regular menstrual cycles and expressed satisfaction with the outcome 12 months postoperatively. This case highlights the importance of providing culturally sensitive care in regions where the hymen holds symbolic value. Virginity-sparing surgical techniques offer a suitable approach that addresses both medical and social concerns, ensuring patient well-being while respecting cultural beliefs.

                Social pain is emotional distress caused harm or threat to social connections that results in social exclusion, rejection, or loss. Social Pain is also a potentiator of physical pain. Supportive social relationships are widely recognized for their impact on maintaining health and well-being. The Passion of Jesus Christ serves as a quintessential example of social pain (i.e., desertion, betrayal, denial) potentiating physical pain (i.e., beatings, Crown of Thorns, crucifixion). Christ opts to forgive. Although forgiveness is one solution to reduce social pain, other interventions exist. This review seeks to identify and summarize interventions associated with reducing social pain. We conducted a systematic review using Medline (PubMed), Google Scholar, and Cochrane CENTRAL to identify relevant articles. Results: The database searches produced 548 articles. Fourteen randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included in this systematic review. Acetaminophen, both deceptive and open-label placebos, mindfulness training, and psilocybin were found to reduce social pain. Of note, the combination of acetaminophen and forgiveness yielded superior results compared to either acetaminophen or forgiveness alone. Pharmacological interventions operate on the premise that the neural pathways responsible for physical pain also play a role in social pain. Both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions are available for reducing social pain.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/97731">Mapping patterns of thought onto brain activity during movie-watching</a></h4>

              
                Movie-watching is a central aspect of our lives and an important paradigm for understanding the brain mechanisms behind cognition as it occurs in daily life. Contemporary views of ongoing thought argue that the ability to make sense of events in the ‘here and now’ depend on the neural processing of incoming sensory information by auditory and visual cortex, which are kept in check by systems in association cortex. However, we currently lack an understanding of how patterns of ongoing thoughts map onto the different brain systems when we watch a film, partly because methods of sampling experience disrupt the dynamics of brain activity and the experience of movie-watching. Our study established a novel method for mapping thought patterns onto the brain activity that occurs at different moments of a film, which does not disrupt the time course of brain activity or the movie-watching experience. We found moments when experience sampling highlighted engagement with multi-sensory features of the film or highlighted thoughts with episodic features, regions of sensory cortex were more active and subsequent memory for events in the movie was better—on the other hand, periods of intrusive distraction emerged when activity in regions of association cortex within the frontoparietal system was reduced. These results highlight the critical role sensory systems play in the multi-modal experience of movie-watching and provide evidence for the role of association cortex in reducing distraction when we watch films.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101523">Parabrachial CGRP neurons modulate active defensive behavior under a naturalistic threat</a></h4>

              
                Recent studies suggest that calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) neurons in the parabrachial nucleus (PBN) represent aversive information and signal a general alarm to the forebrain. If CGRP neurons serve as a true general alarm, their activation would modulate both passive nad active defensive behaviors depending on the magnitude and context of the threat. However, most prior research has focused on the role of CGRP neurons in passive freezing responses, with limited exploration of their involvement in active defensive behaviors. To address this, we examined the role of CGRP neurons in active defensive behavior using a predator-like robot programmed to chase mice. Our electrophysiological results revealed that CGRP neurons encode the intensity of aversive stimuli through variations in firing durations and amplitudes. Optogenetic activation of CGRP neuron during robot chasing elevated flight responses in both conditioning and retention tests, presumably by amyplifying the perception of the threat as more imminent and dangerous. In contrast, animals with inactivated CGRP neurons exhibited reduced flight responses, even when the robot was programmed to appear highly threatening during conditioning. These findings expand the understanding of CGRP neurons in the PBN as a critical alarm system, capable of dynamically regulating active defensive behaviors by amplifying threat perception, ensuring adaptive responses to varying levels of danger.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/75393">Oversized cells activate global proteasome-mediated protein degradation to maintain cell size homeostasis</a></h4>

              
                Proliferating animal cells maintain a stable size distribution over generations despite fluctuations in cell growth and division size. Previously, we showed that cell size control involves both cell size checkpoints, which delay cell cycle progression in small cells, and size-dependent regulation of mass accumulation rates (Ginzberg et al., 2018). While we previously identified the p38 MAPK pathway as a key regulator of the mammalian cell size checkpoint (S. Liu et al., 2018), the mechanism of size-dependent growth rate regulation has remained elusive. Here, we quantified global rates of protein synthesis and degradation in cells of varying sizes, both under unperturbed conditions and in response to perturbations that trigger size-dependent compensatory growth slowdown. We found that protein synthesis rates scale proportionally with cell size across cell cycle stages and experimental conditions. In contrast, oversized cells that undergo compensatory growth slowdown exhibit a superlinear increase in proteasome-mediated protein degradation, with accelerated protein turnover per unit mass, suggesting activation of the proteasomal degradation pathway. Both nascent and long-lived proteins contribute to the elevated protein degradation during compensatory growth slowdown, with long-lived proteins playing a crucial role at the G1/S transition. Notably, large G1/S cells exhibit particularly high efficiency in protein degradation, surpassing that of similarly sized or larger cells in S and G2, coinciding with the timing of the most stringent size control in animal cells. These results collectively suggest that oversized cells reduce their growth efficiency by activating global proteasome-mediated protein degradation to promote cell size homeostasis.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/83973">Sensory experience controls dendritic structure and behavior by distinct pathways involving degenerins</a></h4>

              
                Dendrites are crucial for receiving information into neurons. Sensory experience affects the structure of these tree-like neurites, which, it is assumed, modifies neuronal function, yet the evidence is scarce, and the mechanisms are unknown. To study whether sensory experience affects dendritic morphology, we use the <i>Caenorhabditis elegans'</i> arborized nociceptor PVD neurons, under natural mechanical stimulation induced by physical contacts between individuals. We found that mechanosensory signals induced by conspecifics and by glass beads affect the dendritic structure of the PVD. Moreover, developmentally isolated animals show a decrease in their ability to respond to harsh touch. The structural and behavioral plasticity following sensory deprivation are functionally independent of each other and are mediated by an array of evolutionarily conserved mechanosensory amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channels (degenerins). Calcium imaging of the PVD neurons in a micromechanical device revealed that controlled mechanical stimulation of the body wall produces similar calcium dynamics in both isolated and crowded animals. Our genetic results, supported by optogenetic, behavioral, and pharmacological evidence, suggest an activity-dependent homeostatic mechanism for dendritic structural plasticity, that in parallel controls escape response to noxious mechanosensory stimuli.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96600">The protective roles of eugenol on type 1 diabetes mellitus through NRF2-mediated oxidative stress pathway</a></h4>

              
                Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), known as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, is characterized by persistent hyperglycemia resulting from damage to the pancreatic β cells and an absolute deficiency of insulin, leading to multi-organ involvement and a poor prognosis. The progression of T1DM is significantly influenced by oxidative stress and apoptosis. The natural compound eugenol (EUG) possesses anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, and anti-apoptotic properties. However, the potential effects of EUG on T1DM had not been investigated. In this study, we established the streptozotocin (STZ)-induced T1DM mouse model in vivo and STZ-induced pancreatic β cell MIN6 cell model in vitro to investigate the protective effects of EUG on T1DM, and tried to elucidate its potential mechanism. Our findings demonstrated that the intervention of EUG could effectively induce the activation of nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (NRF2), leading to an up-regulation in the expressions of downstream proteins NQO1 and HMOX1, which are regulated by NRF2. Moreover, this intervention exhibited a significant amelioration in pancreatic β cell damage associated with T1DM, accompanied by an elevation in insulin secretion and a reduction in the expression levels of apoptosis and oxidative stress-related markers. Furthermore, ML385, an NRF2 inhibitor, reversed these effects of EUG. The present study suggested that EUG exerted protective effects on pancreatic β cells in T1DM by attenuating apoptosis and oxidative stress through the activation of the NRF2 signaling pathway. Consequently, EUG holds great promise as a potential therapeutic candidate for T1DM.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95135">The NeuroML ecosystem for standardized multi-scale modeling in neuroscience</a></h4>

              
                Data-driven models of neurons and circuits are important for understanding how the properties of membrane conductances, synapses, dendrites, and the anatomical connectivity between neurons generate the complex dynamical behaviors of brain circuits in health and disease. However, the inherent complexity of these biological processes makes the construction and reuse of biologically detailed models challenging. A wide range of tools have been developed to aid their construction and simulation, but differences in design and internal representation act as technical barriers to those who wish to use data-driven models in their research workflows. NeuroML, a model description language for computational neuroscience, was developed to address this fragmentation in modeling tools. Since its inception, NeuroML has evolved into a mature community standard that encompasses a wide range of model types and approaches in computational neuroscience. It has enabled the development of a large ecosystem of interoperable open-source software tools for the creation, visualization, validation, and simulation of data-driven models. Here, we describe how the NeuroML ecosystem can be incorporated into research workflows to simplify the construction, testing, and analysis of standardized models of neural systems, and supports the FAIR (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability) principles, thus promoting open, transparent and reproducible science.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92979">Surprising features of nuclear receptor interaction networks revealed by live-cell single-molecule imaging</a></h4>

              
                Type II nuclear receptors (T2NRs) require heterodimerization with a common partner, the retinoid X receptor (RXR), to bind cognate DNA recognition sites in chromatin. Based on previous biochemical and overexpression studies, binding of T2NRs to chromatin is proposed to be regulated by competition for a limiting pool of the core RXR subunit. However, this mechanism has not yet been tested for endogenous proteins in live cells. Using single-molecule tracking (SMT) and proximity-assisted photoactivation (PAPA), we monitored interactions between endogenously tagged RXR and retinoic acid receptor (RAR) in live cells. Unexpectedly, we find that higher expression of RAR, but not RXR, increases heterodimerization and chromatin binding in U2OS cells. This surprising finding indicates the limiting factor is not RXR but likely its cadre of obligate dimer binding partners. SMT and PAPA thus provide a direct way to probe which components are functionally limiting within a complex TF interaction network providing new insights into mechanisms of gene regulation in vivo with implications for drug development targeting nuclear receptors.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/101980">Valence and salience encoding in the central amygdala</a></h4>

              
                The central amygdala (CeA) has emerged as an important brain region for regulating both negative (fear and anxiety) and positive (reward) affective behaviors. The CeA has been proposed to encode affective information in the form of valence (whether the stimulus is good or bad) or salience (how significant is the stimulus), but the extent to which these two types of stimulus representation occur in the CeA is not known. Here, we used single cell calcium imaging in mice during appetitive and aversive conditioning and found that majority of CeA neurons (~65%) encode the valence of the unconditioned stimulus (US) with a smaller subset of cells (~15%) encoding the salience of the US. Valence and salience encoding of the conditioned stimulus (CS) was also observed, albeit to a lesser extent. These findings show that the CeA is a site of convergence for encoding oppositely valenced US information.
