              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14528">Incremental Attractor Neural Network Modelling of the Lifespan Retrieval Curve</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2504.14528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The human lifespan retrieval curve describes the proportion of recalled memories from each year of life. It exhibits a reminiscence bump - a tendency for aged people to better recall memories formed during their young adulthood than from other periods of life. We have modelled this using an attractor Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN) with incremental learning. We systematically studied the synaptic mechanisms underlying the reminiscence bump in this network model after introduction of an exponential decay of the synaptic learning rate and examined its sensitivity to network size and other relevant modelling mechanisms. The most influential parameters turned out to be the synaptic learning rate at birth and the time constant of its exponential decay with age, which set the bump position in the lifespan retrieval curve. The other parameters mainly influenced the general magnitude of this curve. Furthermore, we introduced the parametrization of the recency phenomenon - the tendency to better remember the most recent memories - reflected in the curve's upwards tail in the later years of the lifespan. Such recency was achieved by adding a constant baseline component to the exponentially decaying synaptic learning rate.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14865">Mapping Emotional Feeling in the Body: A Tripartite Framework for Understanding the Embodied Mind</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2504.14865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: People often speak of being "moved beyond words" when witnessing awe-inspiring natural beauty, experiencing profound moral elevation, or encountering powerful works of art and music. Such moments evoke intensely embodied sensations - a swelling in the chest, a quickened heartbeat, or a sudden stillness that floods the entire body. These experiences are difficult to articulate, yet they are vividly real and spatially anchored in bodily experience. This review examines the emerging method of body mapping, which captures how individuals subjectively localize emotional sensations across the body. Drawing on over two dozen empirical studies, we propose a tripartite framework for understanding the origins of emotional bodily maps: (1) bottom-up physiological signals, (2) top-down behavioral engagement (including motor actions), and (3) conceptual and metaphorical constructions. Crucially, we argue that bodily maps are not mere reflections of physiological monitoring, but expressive interfaces between brain, body, and conceptualization. Because they rely on introspective sensation rather than verbal articulation, bodily maps offer a promising language-independent tool for assessing emotional experience - particularly in cross-cultural research, developmental studies, and clinical contexts where verbal reporting may be limited or unreliable. Ultimately, bodily maps reveal the hidden geography of emotion-those feelings that elude precise definition or verbalization, like being moved beyond words, yet are undeniably real and embodied - offering a compelling window into how emotions are formed, shared, and lived through the body.

                arXiv:2504.14468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interpreting neural activity through meaningful latent representations remains a complex and evolving challenge at the intersection of neuroscience and artificial intelligence. We investigate the potential of multimodal foundation models to align invasive brain recordings with natural language. We present SSENSE, a contrastive learning framework that projects single-subject stereo-electroencephalography (sEEG) signals into the sentence embedding space of a frozen CLIP model, enabling sentence-level retrieval directly from brain activity. SSENSE trains a neural encoder on spectral representations of sEEG using InfoNCE loss, without fine-tuning the text encoder. We evaluate our method on time-aligned sEEG and spoken transcripts from a naturalistic movie-watching dataset. Despite limited data, SSENSE achieves promising results, demonstrating that general-purpose language representations can serve as effective priors for neural decoding.

                arXiv:2504.15197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If the behavior of a system with many degrees of freedom can be captured by a small number of collective variables, then plausibly there is an underlying mean-field theory. We show that simple versions of this idea fail to describe the patterns of activity in networks of real neurons. An extended mean-field theory that matches the distribution of collective variables is at least consistent, though shows signs that these networks are poised near a critical point, in agreement with other observations. These results suggest a path to analysis of emerging data on ever larger numbers of neurons.

                arXiv:2502.04658v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integration of human and artificial intelligence offers a powerful avenue for advancing our understanding of information processing, as each system provides unique computational insights. However, despite the promise of human-AI integration, current AI models are largely trained on massive datasets, optimized for population-level performance, lacking mechanisms to align their computations with individual users' perceptual semantics and neural dynamics. Here we show that integrating human behavioral insights and millisecond scale neural data within a fine tuned CLIP based model not only captures generalized and individualized aspects of perception but also over doubles behavioral performance compared to the unmodified CLIP baseline. By embedding human inductive biases and mirroring dynamic neural processes during training, personalized neural fine tuning improves predictions of human similarity judgments and tracks the temporal evolution of individual neural responses. Our work establishes a novel, interpretable framework for designing adaptive AI systems, with broad implications for neuroscience, personalized medicine, and human-computer interaction.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19924">EEG relative phase-based analysis unveils the complexity and universality of human brain dynamics: integrative insights from general anesthesia and ADHD</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2503.19924v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding brain wave patterns is fundamental to uncovering neural information processing mechanisms, making quantifying complexity across brain states an important line of investigation. We present a comprehensive analysis of the complexity of electroencephalography (EEG) signals, integrating data from seven distinct states experienced by participants undergoing general anesthesia, and resting-state recordings from individuals with inattentive-type ADHD alongside healthy control groups. Departing from prior studies that primarily focus on EEG amplitude dynamics, we adopt a novel relative phase approach to extract patterns of information flow directionality based on EEG phase dynamics. We quantify the complexity of these relative phase directionality patterns across various states using permutation entropy (PE) and statistical complexity measure within ordinal pattern framework. Our analysis: (i) PE is inversely correlated with the level of consciousness during general anesthesia, reflecting a dynamic interplay between anesthetic depth and shifts in directional information flow; (ii) healthy subjects consistently show higher PE than inADHD participants; (iii) when mapped onto the complexity-entropy causality plane, all brain states, regardless of condition or individual differences, align along a single curve, suggesting an underlying universal pattern in brain dynamics; and (iv) brain data consistently exhibit higher complexity than standard stochastic processes, likely due to greater multifractal scaling. These findings highlight that neural information propagation, as captured by EEG relative phase dynamics, is governed by self-organizing principles that are fundamentally more complex than the stochastic processes. Our EEG relative phase-based characterization provides new insight into the complexity of neural information flow directionality.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08201">Neural Encoding and Decoding at Scale</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2504.08201v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated that large-scale, multi-animal models are powerful tools for characterizing the relationship between neural activity and behavior. Current large-scale approaches, however, focus exclusively on either predicting neural activity from behavior (encoding) or predicting behavior from neural activity (decoding), limiting their ability to capture the bidirectional relationship between neural activity and behavior. To bridge this gap, we introduce a multimodal, multi-task model that enables simultaneous Neural Encoding and Decoding at Scale (NEDS). Central to our approach is a novel multi-task-masking strategy, which alternates between neural, behavioral, within-modality, and cross-modality masking. We pretrain our method on the International Brain Laboratory (IBL) repeated site dataset, which includes recordings from 83 animals performing the same visual decision-making task. In comparison to other large-scale models, we demonstrate that NEDS achieves state-of-the-art performance for both encoding and decoding when pretrained on multi-animal data and then fine-tuned on new animals. Surprisingly, NEDS's learned embeddings exhibit emergent properties: even without explicit training, they are highly predictive of the brain regions in each recording. Altogether, our approach is a step towards a foundation model of the brain that enables seamless translation between neural activity and behavior.

Abstract: This study explores the use of electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain wave monitoring to enable dynamic difficulty adjustment (DDA) in a virtual reality (VR) gaming environment. Using the Task Engagement Index (TEI) derived from frontal EEG electrodes, we adapt game challenge levels in real time to maintain optimal player engagement. In a within-subject design with six participants, we found that the DDA condition significantly increased engagement duration by 19.79% compared to a non-DDA control condition. These results suggest that combining EEG, DDA, and VR technologies can enhance user experience and has potential applications in adaptive learning, rehabilitation, and personalized interfaces.

                arXiv:2504.14015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel concept for spiking neural networks (SNNs) derived from the idea of "linear pieces" used to analyse the expressiveness and trainability of artificial neural networks (ANNs). We prove that the input domain of SNNs decomposes into distinct causal regions where its output spike times are locally Lipschitz continuous with respect to the input spike times and network parameters. The number of such regions - which we call "causal pieces" - is a measure of the approximation capabilities of SNNs. In particular, we demonstrate in simulation that parameter initialisations which yield a high number of causal pieces on the training set strongly correlate with SNN training success. Moreover, we find that feedforward SNNs with purely positive weights exhibit a surprisingly high number of causal pieces, allowing them to achieve competitive performance levels on benchmark tasks. We believe that causal pieces are not only a powerful and principled tool for improving SNNs, but might also open up new ways of comparing SNNs and ANNs in the future.

                arXiv:2504.14418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Local Reinforcement-Based Selection of Auxiliary Objectives (LRSAO), a novel approach that selects auxiliary objectives using reinforcement learning (RL) to support the optimization process of an evolutionary algorithm (EA) as in EA+RL framework and furthermore incorporates the ability to unlearn previously used objectives. By modifying the reward mechanism to penalize moves that do no increase the fitness value and relying on the local auxiliary objectives, LRSAO dynamically adapts its selection strategy to optimize performance according to the landscape and unlearn previous objectives when necessary.
  We analyze and evaluate LRSAO on the black-box complexity version of the non-monotonic Jump function, with gap parameter $\ell$, where each auxiliary objective is beneficial at specific stages of optimization. The Jump function is hard to optimize for evolutionary-based algorithms and the best-known complexity for reinforcement-based selection on Jump was $O(n^2 \log(n) / \ell)$. Our approach improves over this result to achieve a complexity of $\Theta(n^2 / \ell^2 + n \log(n))$ resulting in a significant improvement, which demonstrates the efficiency and adaptability of LRSAO, highlighting its potential to outperform traditional methods in complex optimization scenarios.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15082">An island-parallel ensemble metaheuristic algorithm for large graph coloring problems</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2504.15082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Coloring Problem (GCP) is an NP-Hard vertex labeling problem in graphs such that no two adjacent vertices can have the same color. Large instances of GCP cannot be solved in reasonable execution times by exact algorithms. Therefore, soft computing approaches, such as metaheuristics, have proven to be very efficient for solving large instances of GCP. In this study, we propose a new island-parallel ensemble metaheuristic algorithm (PEM-Color) to solve large GCP instances. Ensemble learning is a new machine learning approach based on combining the output of multiple models instead of using a single one. We use Message Passing Interface (MPI) parallel computation libraries to combine recent state-of-the-art metaheuristics: Harris Hawk Optimization (HHO), Artificial Bee Colony (ABC), and Teaching Learning Based (TLBO) to improve the quality of their solutions further. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that combines metaheuristics and applies to the GCP using an ensemble approach. We conducted experiments on large graph instances from the well-known DIMACS benchmark using 64 processors and achieved significant improvements in execution times. The experiments also indicate an almost linear speed-up with a strong scalability potential. The solution quality of the instances is promising, as our algorithm outperforms 13 state-of-the-art algorithms.

                arXiv:2504.15147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces the Iterative Chainlet Partitioning (ICP) algorithm and its neural acceleration for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem with Drone (TSP-D). The proposed ICP algorithm decomposes a TSP-D solution into smaller segments called chainlets, each optimized individually by a dynamic programming subroutine. The chainlet with the highest improvement is updated and the procedure is repeated until no further improvement is possible. The number of subroutine calls is bounded linearly in problem size for the first iteration and remains constant in subsequent iterations, ensuring algorithmic scalability. Empirical results show that ICP outperforms existing algorithms in both solution quality and computational time. Tested over 1,059 benchmark instances, ICP yields an average improvement of 2.75% in solution quality over the previous state-of-the-art algorithm while reducing computational time by 79.8%. The procedure is deterministic, ensuring reliability without requiring multiple runs. The subroutine is the computational bottleneck in the already efficient ICP algorithm. To reduce the necessity of subroutine calls, we integrate a graph neural network (GNN) to predict incremental improvements. We demonstrate that the resulting Neuro ICP (NICP) achieves substantial acceleration while maintaining solution quality. Compared to ICP, NICP reduces the total computational time by 49.7%, while the objective function value increase is limited to 0.12%. The framework's adaptability to various operational constraints makes it a valuable foundation for developing efficient algorithms for truck-drone synchronized routing problems.

                arXiv:2504.14596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study aims to construct an axiomatic definition of intelligence within a meta-framework that defines the method of definition, addressing intelligence as an inherently naive and polysemous concept. Initially, we formalize a set-theoretic representation of the universe as the domain wherein intelligence exists and characterize intelligence as a structure that involves temporal evolution and interaction with other sets. Starting from a naive definition of intelligence as "an entity possessing structures for externally inputting, internally processing, and externally outputting information or matter," we axiomatically reformulate it within this set-theoretical depiction of the universe. Applying this axiomatic definition, we compare and interpret three examples -- Hebbian non-optimized neural networks (NNs), backpropagation-optimized NNs, and biological reflexive systems -- in terms of their intelligence, structural properties, and biological plausibility. Furthermore, by extending our definition into a categorical framework, we introduce two categories, "Time Category" and "Intelligence Category," along with the functorial relationships between them, demonstrating the potential to represent changes and mimicry relationships among intelligent systems abstractly. Additionally, since intelligence, as defined herein, functions effectively only when accompanied by temporal interactions, we introduce the concept of "activity" and explore how activity-based conditions influence classifications and interpretations of intelligence. Finally, we suggest that our definitional methodology is not limited to intelligence alone, but can be similarly applied to other concepts, such as consciousness and emotion, advocating for their formal reinterpretation through the same procedural steps: defining a universal representation, selecting naive definitions, and axiomatic formalization.

                arXiv:2504.14963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speaker identification using voice recordings leverages unique acoustic features, but this approach fails when only textual data is available. Few approaches have attempted to tackle the problem of identifying speakers solely from text, and the existing ones have primarily relied on traditional methods. In this work, we explore the use of fuzzy fingerprints from large pre-trained models to improve text-based speaker identification. We integrate speaker-specific tokens and context-aware modeling, demonstrating that conversational context significantly boosts accuracy, reaching 70.6% on the Friends dataset and 67.7% on the Big Bang Theory dataset. Additionally, we show that fuzzy fingerprints can approximate full fine-tuning performance with fewer hidden units, offering improved interpretability. Finally, we analyze ambiguous utterances and propose a mechanism to detect speaker-agnostic lines. Our findings highlight key challenges and provide insights for future improvements in text-based speaker identification.

                arXiv:2504.15110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold superposition theorem, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have recently emerged as an improved backbone for most deep learning frameworks, promising more adaptivity than their multilayer perception (MLP) predecessor by allowing for trainable spline-based activation functions. In this paper, we probe the theoretical foundations of the KAN architecture by showing that it can optimally approximate any Besov function in $B^{s}_{p,q}(\mathcal{X})$ on a bounded open, or even fractal, domain $\mathcal{X}$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ at the optimal approximation rate with respect to any weaker Besov norm $B^{\alpha}_{p,q}(\mathcal{X})$; where $\alpha < s$. We complement our approximation guarantee with a dimension-free estimate on the sample complexity of a residual KAN model when learning a function of Besov regularity from $N$ i.i.d. noiseless samples. Our KAN architecture incorporates contemporary deep learning wisdom by leveraging residual/skip connections between layers.

                arXiv:2310.02901v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Higher order artificial neurons whose outputs are computed by applying an activation function to a higher order multinomial function of the inputs have been considered in the past, but did not gain acceptance due to the extra parameters and computational cost. However, higher order neurons have significantly greater learning capabilities since the decision boundaries of higher order neurons can be complex surfaces instead of just hyperplanes. The boundary of a single quadratic neuron can be a general hyper-quadric surface allowing it to learn many nonlinearly separable datasets. Since quadratic forms can be represented by symmetric matrices, only $\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ additional parameters are needed instead of $n^2$. A quadratic Logistic regression model is first presented. Solutions to the XOR problem with a single quadratic neuron are considered. The complete vectorized equations for both forward and backward propagation in feedforward networks composed of quadratic neurons are derived. A reduced parameter quadratic neural network model with just $ n $ additional parameters per neuron that provides a compromise between learning ability and computational cost is presented. Comparison on benchmark classification datasets are used to demonstrate that a final layer of quadratic neurons enables networks to achieve higher accuracy with significantly fewer hidden layer neurons. In particular this paper shows that any dataset composed of $\mathcal{C}$ bounded clusters can be separated with only a single layer of $\mathcal{C}$ quadratic neurons.

                arXiv:2404.07061v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The JUMP$_k$ benchmark was the first problem for which crossover was proven to give a speed-up over mutation-only evolutionary algorithms. Jansen and Wegener (2002) proved an upper bound of $O(\text{poly}(n) + 4^k/p_c)$ for the ($\mu$+1) Genetic Algorithm ($(\mu+1)$ GA), but only for unrealistically small crossover probabilities $p_c$. To this date, it remains an open problem to prove similar upper bounds for realistic $p_c$; the best known runtime bound, in terms of function evaluations, for $p_c = \Omega(1)$ is $O((n/\chi)^{k-1})$, $\chi$ a positive constant. We provide a novel approach and analyse the evolution of the population diversity, measured as sum of pairwise Hamming distances, for a variant of the $(\mu+1)$ GA on JUMP$_k$. The $(\mu+1)$-$\lambda_c$-GA creates one offspring in each generation either by applying mutation to one parent or by applying crossover $\lambda_c$ times to the same two parents (followed by mutation), to amplify the probability of creating an accepted offspring in generations with crossover. We show that population diversity in the $(\mu+1)$-$\lambda_c$-GA converges to an equilibrium of near-perfect diversity. This yields an improved time bound of $O(\mu n \log(\mu) + 4^k)$ function evaluations for a range of $k$ under the mild assumptions $p_c = O(1/k)$ and $\mu \in \Omega(kn)$. For all constant $k$, the restriction is satisfied for some $p_c = \Omega(1)$ and it implies that the expected runtime for all constant $k$ and an appropriate $\mu = \Theta(kn)$ is bounded by $O(n^2 \log n)$, irrespective of $k$. For larger $k$, the expected time of the $(\mu+1)$-$\lambda_c$-GA is $\Theta(4^k)$, which is tight for a large class of unbiased black-box algorithms and faster than the original $(\mu+1)$ GA by a factor of $\Omega(1/p_c)$. We also show that our analysis can be extended to other unitation functions such as JUMP$_{k, \delta}$ and HURDLE.

                arXiv:2406.16500v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The balance between exploration (Er) and exploitation (Ei) determines the generalization performance of the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm on different problems. Although the insufficient balance caused by global best being located near a local minimum has been widely researched, few scholars have systematically paid attention to two behaviors about personal best position (P) and global best position (G) existing in PSO. 1) P's uncontrollable-exploitation and involuntary-exploration guidance behavior. 2) G's full-time and global guidance behavior, each of which negatively affects the balance of Er and Ei. With regards to this, we firstly discuss the two behaviors, unveiling the mechanisms by which they affect the balance, and further pinpoint three key points for better balancing Er and Ei: eliminating the coupling between P and G, empowering P with controllable-exploitation and voluntary-exploration guidance behavior, controlling G's full-time and global guidance behavior. Then, we present a dual-channel PSO algorithm based on adaptive balance search (DCPSO-ABS). This algorithm entails a dual-channel framework to mitigate the interaction of P and G, aiding in regulating the behaviors of P and G, and meanwhile an adaptive balance search strategy for empowering P with voluntary-exploration and controllable-exploitation guidance behavior as well as adaptively controlling G's full-time and global guidance behavior. Finally, three kinds of experiments on 57 benchmark functions are designed to demonstrate that our proposed algorithm has stronger generalization performance than selected state-of-the-art algorithms.

Abstract: Neural networks are a group of neurons stacked together in multiple layers to mimic the biological neurons in a human brain. Neural networks have been trained using the backpropagation algorithm based on gradient descent strategy for several decades. Several variants have been developed to improve the backpropagation algorithm. The loss function for the neural network is optimized through backpropagation, but several local minima exist in the manifold of the constructed neural network. We obtain several solutions matching the minima. The gradient descent strategy cannot avoid the problem of local minima and gets stuck in the minima due to the initialization. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) was proposed to select the best local minima among the search space of the loss function. The search space is limited to the instantiated particles in the PSO algorithm, and sometimes it cannot select the best solution. In the proposed approach, we overcome the problem of gradient descent and the limitation of the PSO algorithm by training individual neurons separately, capable of collectively solving the problem as a group of neurons forming a network.

                arXiv:2412.12694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A series of modified cognitive-only particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithms effectively mitigate premature convergence by constructing distinct vectors for different particles. However, the underutilization of these constructed vectors hampers convergence accuracy. In this paper, an adaptive balance search based complementary heterogeneous PSO architecture is proposed, which consists of a complementary heterogeneous PSO (CHxPSO) framework and an adaptive balance search (ABS) strategy. The CHxPSO framework mainly includes two update channels and two subswarms. Two channels exhibit nearly heterogeneous properties while sharing a common constructed vector. This ensures that one constructed vector is utilized across both heterogeneous update mechanisms. The two subswarms work within their respective channels during the evolutionary process, preventing interference between the two channels. The ABS strategy precisely controls the proportion of particles involved in the evolution in the two channels, and thereby guarantees the flexible utilization of the constructed vectors, based on the evolutionary process and the interactions with the problem's fitness landscape. Together, our architecture ensures the effective utilization of the constructed vectors by emphasizing exploration in the early evolutionary process while exploitation in the later, enhancing the performance of a series of modified cognitive-only PSOs. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the generalization performance of our architecture.

Abstract: The rising demand for energy-efficient edge AI systems (e.g., mobile agents/robots) has increased the interest in neuromorphic computing, since it offers ultra-low power/energy AI computation through spiking neural network (SNN) algorithms on neuromorphic processors. However, their efficient implementation strategy has not been comprehensively studied, hence limiting SNN deployments for edge AI systems. Toward this, we propose a design methodology to enable efficient SNN processing on commodity neuromorphic processors. To do this, we first study the key characteristics of targeted neuromorphic hardware (e.g., memory and compute budgets), and leverage this information to perform compatibility analysis for network selection. Afterward, we employ a mapping strategy for efficient SNN implementation on the targeted processor. Furthermore, we incorporate an efficient on-chip learning mechanism to update the systems' knowledge for adapting to new input classes and dynamic environments. The experimental results show that the proposed methodology leads the system to achieve low latency of inference (i.e., less than 50ms for image classification, less than 200ms for real-time object detection in video streaming, and less than 1ms in keyword recognition) and low latency of on-chip learning (i.e., less than 2ms for keyword recognition), while incurring less than 250mW of processing power and less than 15mJ of energy consumption across the respective different applications and scenarios. These results show the potential of the proposed methodology in enabling efficient edge AI systems for diverse application use-cases.

                arXiv:2504.05347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reservoir Computing (RC) is a time-efficient computational paradigm derived from Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). The Simple Cycle Reservoir (SCR) is an RC model that stands out for its minimalistic design, offering extremely low construction complexity and proven capability of universally approximating time-invariant causal fading memory filters, even in the linear dynamics regime. This paper introduces Multiple Simple Cycle Reservoirs (MSCRs), a multi-reservoir framework that extends Echo State Networks (ESNs) by replacing a single large reservoir with multiple interconnected SCRs. We demonstrate that optimizing MSCR using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) outperforms existing multi-reservoir models, achieving competitive predictive performance with a lower-dimensional state space. By modeling interconnections as a weighted Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), our approach enables flexible, task-specific network topology adaptation. Numerical simulations on three benchmark time-series prediction tasks confirm these advantages over rival algorithms. These findings highlight the potential of MSCR-PSO as a promising framework for optimizing multi-reservoir systems, providing a foundation for further advancements and applications of interconnected SCRs for developing efficient AI devices.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09243">Learning Self-Growth Maps for Fast and Accurate Imbalanced Streaming Data Clustering</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2404.09243v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Streaming data clustering is a popular research topic in data mining and machine learning. Since streaming data is usually analyzed in data chunks, it is more susceptible to encounter the dynamic cluster imbalance issue. That is, the imbalance ratio of clusters changes over time, which can easily lead to fluctuations in either the accuracy or the efficiency of streaming data clustering. Therefore, we propose an accurate and efficient streaming data clustering approach to adapt the drifting and imbalanced cluster distributions. We first design a Self-Growth Map (SGM) that can automatically arrange neurons on demand according to local distribution, and thus achieve fast and incremental adaptation to the streaming distributions. Since SGM allocates an excess number of density-sensitive neurons to describe the global distribution, it can avoid missing small clusters among imbalanced distributions. We also propose a fast hierarchical merging strategy to combine the neurons that break up the relatively large clusters. It exploits the maintained SGM to quickly retrieve the intra-cluster distribution pairs for merging, which circumvents the most laborious global searching. It turns out that the proposed SGM can incrementally adapt to the distributions of new chunks, and the Self-grOwth map-guided Hierarchical merging for Imbalanced data clustering (SOHI) approach can quickly explore a true number of imbalanced clusters. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SOHI can efficiently and accurately explore cluster distributions for streaming data.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15318">On the Complexity of Neural Computation in Superposition</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.15318v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superposition, the ability of neural networks to represent more features than neurons, is increasingly seen as key to the efficiency of large models. This paper investigates the theoretical foundations of computing in superposition, establishing complexity bounds for explicit, provably correct algorithms.
  We present the first lower bounds for a neural network computing in superposition, showing that for a broad class of problems, including permutations and pairwise logical operations, computing $m'$ features in superposition requires at least $\Omega(\sqrt{m' \log m'})$ neurons and $\Omega(m' \log m')$ parameters. This implies the first subexponential upper bound on superposition capacity: a network with $n$ neurons can compute at most $O(n^2 / \log n)$ features. Conversely, we provide a nearly tight constructive upper bound: logical operations like pairwise AND can be computed using $O(\sqrt{m'} \log m')$ neurons and $O(m' \log^2 m')$ parameters. There is thus an exponential gap between the complexity of computing in superposition (the subject of this work) versus merely representing features, which can require as little as $O(\log m')$ neurons based on the Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma.
  Our hope is that our results open a path for using complexity theoretic techniques in neural network interpretability research.

                Protein–protein interactions are fundamental to understanding the molecular functions and regulation of proteins. Despite the availability of extensive databases, many interactions remain uncharacterized due to the labor-intensive nature of experimental validation. In this study, we utilized the AlphaFold2 program to predict interactions among proteins localized in the nuage, a germline-specific non-membrane organelle essential for piRNA biogenesis in <i>Drosophila</i>. We screened 20 nuage proteins for 1:1 interactions and predicted dimer structures. Among these, five represented novel interaction candidates. Three pairs, including Spn-E_Squ, were verified by co-immunoprecipitation. Disruption of the salt bridges at the Spn-E_Squ interface confirmed their functional importance, underscoring the predictive model’s accuracy. We extended our analysis to include interactions between three representative nuage components—Vas, Squ, and Tej—and approximately 430 oogenesis-related proteins. Co-immunoprecipitation verified interactions for three pairs: Mei-W68_Squ, CSN3_Squ, and Pka-C1_Tej. Furthermore, we screened the majority of <i>Drosophila</i> proteins (~12,000) for potential interaction with the Piwi protein, a central player in the piRNA pathway, identifying 164 pairs as potential binding partners. This in silico approach not only efficiently identifies potential interaction partners but also significantly bridges the gap by facilitating the integration of bioinformatics and experimental biology.

                Cichlid fishes inhabiting the East African Great Lakes, Victoria, Malawi, and Tanganyika, are textbook examples of parallel evolution, as they have acquired similar traits independently in each of the three lakes during the process of adaptive radiation. In particular, ‘hypertrophied lip’ has been highlighted as a prominent example of parallel evolution. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this study, we conducted an integrated comparative analysis between the hypertrophied and normal lips of cichlids across three lakes based on histology, proteomics, and transcriptomics. Histological and proteomic analyses revealed that the hypertrophied lips were characterized by enlargement of the proteoglycan-rich layer, in which versican and periostin proteins were abundant. Transcriptome analysis revealed that the expression of extracellular matrix-related genes, including collagens, glycoproteins, and proteoglycans, was higher in hypertrophied lips, regardless of their phylogenetic relationships. In addition, the genes in Wnt signaling pathway, which is involved in promoting proteoglycan expression, was highly expressed in both the juvenile and adult stages of hypertrophied lips. Our comprehensive analyses showed that hypertrophied lips of the three different phylogenetic origins can be explained by similar proteomic and transcriptomic profiles, which may provide important clues into the molecular mechanisms underlying phenotypic parallelisms in East African cichlids.

                <p>by Romain Brette</p>

The axon initial segment of principal cells of the cortex and hippocampus is contacted by GABAergic interneurons called chandelier cells. The anatomy, as well as alterations in neurological diseases such as epilepsy, suggest that chandelier cells exert an important inhibitory control on action potential initiation. However, their functional role remains unclear, including whether their effect is indeed inhibitory or excitatory. One reason is that there is a relative gap in electrophysiological theory about the electrical effect of axo-axonic synapses. This contribution uses resistive coupling theory, a simplification of cable theory based on the observation that the small initial segment is resistively coupled to the large cell body acting as a current sink, to fill this gap. The main theoretical finding is that a synaptic input at the proximal axon shifts the action potential threshold by an amount equal to the product of synaptic conductance, driving force at threshold, and axial axonal resistance between the soma and either the synapse or of the middle of the initial segment, whichever is closer. The theory produces quantitative estimates useful to interpret experimental observations, and supports the idea that axo-axonic cells can potentially exert powerful inhibitory control on action potential initiation.

                <p>by Claire Lugrin, Jie Hu, Christian C. Ruff</p>

Prosocial behaviors play a pivotal role for human societies, shaping critical domains such as healthcare, education, taxation, and welfare. Despite the ubiquity of norms that prescribe prosocial actions, individuals do not adhere to them consistently but often behave selfishly, thereby harming the collective good. Interventions to promote prosociality would therefore be beneficial but are often ineffective because we lack a thorough understanding of the various motives that govern prosocial behavior across different contexts. Here we present a computational and experimental framework to identify motives behind individual prosocial choices and to characterize how these vary across contexts with changing social norms. Using a series of experiments in which 575 participants either judge the normative appropriateness of different prosocial actions or choose between prosocial and selfish actions themselves, we first show that while most individuals are consistent in their judgements about behavior appropriateness, the actual prosocial behavior varies strongly across people. We used computational decision models to quantify the conflicting motives underlying the prosocial judgements and decisions, combined with a clustering approach to characterize different types of individuals whose judgements and choices reflect different motivational profiles. We identified four such types: Unconditionally selfish participants never behave prosocially, Cost-sensitive participants behave selfishly when prosocial actions are costly, Efficiency-sensitive participants choose actions that maximize total wealth, and Harm-sensitive participants prioritize avoiding harming others. When these four types of participants were exposed to different social environments where norms were judged or followed more or less by the group, they responded in fundamentally different ways to this change in others’ behavior. Our approach helps us better understand the origins of heterogeneity in prosocial judgments and behaviors and may have implications for policy making and the design of behavioral interventions.

                <p>by Jacob N. Stapley, Jonathan I.D. Hamley, Maria-Gloria Basáñez, Martin Walker</p>

The World Health Organization (WHO) has proposed elimination of onchocerciasis transmission (EOT) in a third of endemic countries by 2030. This requires country-wide verification of EOT. Prior to the shift from morbidity control to EOT, interventions in Africa were mostly targeted at moderate- to high-transmission settings, where morbidity was most severe. Consequently, there remain numerous low transmission (hypoendemic) settings which have hitherto not received mass drug administration (MDA) with ivermectin. The WHO has prioritised the delineation of hypoendemic settings to ascertain treatment needs. However, the stability of transmission at such low levels remains poorly understood. We use the stochastic EPIONCHO-IBM transmission model to characterise the stability of transmission dynamics in hypoendemic settings and identify a range of threshold biting rates (TBRs, the annual vector biting rates below which transmission cannot be sustained). We show how TBRs are dependent on population size, inter-individual exposure heterogeneity and simulation time. In contrast with deterministic expectations, there is no fixed TBR; instead, transmission can persist between 70 and 300 bites/person/year. Using survivorship models on data generated from model simulations, we find that multiple vector biting rates can sustain hypoendemic prevalence for several decades. These findings challenge the assumption that hypoendemic foci would naturally fade out following treatment in nearby higher-endemicity regions. Our modelling suggests that, to achieve EOT, treatment should be extended to all areas where endogenous infection is identified, emphasising the need for improved diagnostic tools suitable for detecting low-prevalence infection and for strategies that allow safe treatment of communities where MDA would not be suitable.

Cancer involves dynamic changes caused by (epi)genetic alterations such as mutations or abnormal DNA methylation patterns which occur in cancer driver genes. These driver genes are divided into oncogenes and tumor suppressors depending on their function and mechanism of action. Discovering driver genes in different cancer (sub)types is important not only for increasing current understanding of carcinogenesis but also from prognostic and therapeutic perspectives. We have previously developed a framework called Moonlight which uses a systems biology multi-omics approach for prediction of driver genes. Here, we present an important development in Moonlight2 by incorporating a DNA methylation layer which provides epigenetic evidence for deregulated expression profiles of driver genes. To this end, we present a novel functionality called Gene Methylation Analysis (GMA) which investigates abnormal DNA methylation patterns to predict driver genes. This is achieved by integrating the tool EpiMix which is designed to detect such aberrant DNA methylation patterns in a cohort of patients and further couples these patterns with gene expression changes. To showcase GMA, we applied it to three cancer (sub)types (basal-like breast cancer, lung adenocarcinoma, and thyroid carcinoma) where we discovered 33, 190, and 263 epigenetically driven genes, respectively. A subset of these driver genes had prognostic effects with expression levels significantly affecting survival of the patients. Moreover, a subset of the driver genes demonstrated therapeutic potential as drug targets. This study provides a framework for exploring the driving forces behind cancer and provides novel insights into the landscape of three cancer sub(types) by integrating gene expression and methylation data.

                <p>by Ian Roberts, Richard G. Everitt, Jere Koskela, Xavier Didelot</p>

Over the past decade, pathogen genome sequencing has become well established as a powerful approach to study infectious disease epidemiology. In particular, when multiple genomes are available from several geographical locations, comparing them is informative about the relative size of the local pathogen populations as well as past migration rates and events between locations. The structured coalescent model has a long history of being used as the underlying process for such phylogeographic analysis. However, the computational cost of using this model does not scale well to the large number of genomes frequently analysed in pathogen genomic epidemiology studies. Several approximations of the structured coalescent model have been proposed, but their effects are difficult to predict. Here we show how the exact structured coalescent model can be used to analyse a precomputed dated phylogeny, in order to perform Bayesian inference on the past migration history, the effective population sizes in each location, and the directed migration rates from any location to another. We describe an efficient reversible jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo scheme which is implemented in a new R package StructCoalescent. We use simulations to demonstrate the scalability and correctness of our method and to compare it with existing software. We also applied our new method to several state-of-the-art datasets on the population structure of real pathogens to showcase the relevance of our method to current data scales and research questions.

Biological tissues exhibit complex gene expression and multicellular patterns that are valuable to dissect. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides full coverages of genes, but lacks spatial information, whereas spatial transcriptomics (ST) measures spatial locations of individual or group of cells, with more restrictions on gene information. Here we show a transfer learning method named iSORT to decipher spatial organization of cells by integrating scRNA-seq and ST data. iSORT trains a neural network that maps gene expressions to spatial locations. iSORT can find spatial patterns at single-cell scale, identify spatial-organizing genes (SOGs) that drive the patterning, and infer pseudo-growth trajectories using a concept of SpaRNA velocity. Benchmarking on a range of biological systems, such as human cortex, mouse embryo, mouse brain, <i>Drosophila</i> embryo, and human developmental heart, demonstrates iSORT’s accuracy and practicality in reconstructing multicellular organization. We further conducted scRNA-seq and ST sequencing from normal and atherosclerotic arteries, and the functional enrichment analysis shows that SOGs found by iSORT are strongly associated with vascular structural anomalies.

The central nervous system can generate various behaviors, including motor responses, which we can observe through video recordings. Recent advances in gene manipulation, automated behavioral acquisition at scale, and machine learning enable us to causally link behaviors to their underlying neural mechanisms. Moreover, in some animals, such as the <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> larva, this mapping is possible at the unprecedented scale of single neurons, allowing us to identify the neural microcircuits generating particular behaviors. These high-throughput screening efforts, linking the activation or suppression of specific neurons to behavioral patterns in millions of animals, provide a rich dataset to explore the diversity of nervous system responses to the same stimuli. However, important challenges remain in identifying subtle behaviors, including immediate and delayed responses to neural activation or suppression, and understanding these behaviors on a large scale. We here introduce several statistically robust methods for analyzing behavioral data in response to these challenges: 1) A generative physical model that regularizes the inference of larval shapes across the entire dataset. 2) An unsupervised kernel-based method for statistical testing in learned behavioral spaces aimed at detecting subtle deviations in behavior. 3) A generative model for larval behavioral sequences, providing a benchmark for identifying higher-order behavioral changes. 4) A comprehensive analysis technique using suffix trees to categorize genetic lines into clusters based on common action sequences. We showcase these methodologies through a behavioral screen focused on responses to an air puff, analyzing data from 280 716 larvae across 569 genetic lines.

                <p>by Ihab Hashem, Jian Wang, Jan F.M. Van Impe</p>

Individual-based modeling (IbM) is an instrumental tool for simulating spatial microbial growth, with applications in both microbial ecology and biochemical engineering. Unlike Cellular Automata (CA), which use a fixed grid of cells with predefined rules for interactions, IbMs model the individual behaviors of cells, allowing complex population dynamics to emerge. IbMs require more detailed modeling of individual interactions, which introduces significant computational challenges, particularly in resolving spatial overlaps between cells. Traditionally, this is managed using arrays or kd-trees, which require numerous pairwise comparisons and become inefficient as population size increases. To address this bottleneck, we introduce the Discretized Overlap Resolution Algorithm (DORA), which employs a grid-based framework to efficiently manage overlaps. By discretizing the simulation space further and assigning circular cells to specific grid units, DORA transforms the computationally intensive pairwise comparison process into a more efficient grid-based operation. This approach significantly reduces the computational load, particularly in simulations with large cell populations. Our evaluation of DORA, through simulations of microbial colonies and biofilms under varied nutrient conditions, demonstrates its superior computational efficiency and ability to accurately capture microbial growth dynamics compared to conventional methods. DORA’s grid-based strategy enables the modeling of densely populated microbial communities within practical computational timeframes, thereby expanding the scope and applicability of individual-based modeling.

                <p>by Zach Mobille, Usama Bin Sikandar, Simon Sponberg, Hannah Choi</p>

Convergent and divergent structures in the networks that make up biological brains are found across many species and brain regions at various spatial scales. Neurons in these networks fire action potentials, or “spikes,” whose precise timing is becoming increasingly appreciated as large sources of information about both sensory input and motor output. In this work, we investigate the extent to which feedforward convergent/divergent network structure is related to the gain in information of spike timing representations over spike count representations. While previous theories on coding in convergent and divergent networks have largely neglected the role of precise spike timing, our model and analyses place this aspect at the forefront. For a suite of stimuli with different timescales, we demonstrate that structural bottlenecks–small groups of neurons post-synaptic to network convergence–have a stronger preference for spike timing codes than expansion layers created by structural divergence. We further show that this relationship can be generalized across different spike-generating models and measures of coding capacity, implying a potentially fundamental link between network structure and coding strategy using spikes. Additionally, we found that a simple network model based on convergence and divergence ratios of a hawkmoth (<i>Manduca sexta</i>) nervous system can reproduce the relative contribution of spike timing information in its motor output, providing testable predictions on optimal temporal resolutions of spike coding across the moth sensory-motor pathway at both the single-neuron and population levels.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012962">Identifying reproducible transcription regulator coexpression patterns with single cell transcriptomics</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Alexander Morin, Ching Pan Chu, Paul Pavlidis</p>

The proliferation of single cell transcriptomics has potentiated our ability to unveil patterns that reflect dynamic cellular processes such as the regulation of gene transcription. In this study, we leverage a broad collection of single cell RNA-seq data to identify the gene partners whose expression is most coordinated with each human and mouse transcription regulator (TR). We assembled 120 human and 103 mouse scRNA-seq datasets from the literature (>28 million cells), constructing a single cell coexpression network for each. We aimed to understand the consistency of TR coexpression profiles across a broad sampling of biological contexts, rather than examine the preservation of context-specific signals. Our workflow therefore explicitly prioritizes the patterns that are most reproducible across cell types. Towards this goal, we characterize the similarity of each TR’s coexpression within and across species. We create single cell coexpression rankings for each TR, demonstrating that this aggregated information recovers literature curated targets on par with ChIP-seq data. We then combine the coexpression and ChIP-seq information to identify candidate regulatory interactions supported across methods and species. Finally, we highlight interactions for the important neural TR ASCL1 to demonstrate how our compiled information can be adopted for community use.

                <p>by David J. Pascall, Christopher Jackson, Stephanie Evans, Theodore Gouliouris, Christopher J.R. Illingworth, Stefan G. Piatek, Julie V. Robotham, Oliver Stirrup, Ben Warne, Judith Breuer, Daniela De Angelis</p>

Nosocomial, or hospital-acquired, infections are a key determinant of patient health in healthcare facilities, leading to longer stays and increased mortality. In addition to the direct effects on infected patients, the burden imposed by nosocomial infections impacts both staff and other patients by increasing the load on the healthcare system. The appropriate infection control response may differ depending on whether the infection was acquired in the hospital or the community. For example, nosocomial outbreaks may require ward closures to reduce the risk of onward transmission, whilst this may not be an appropriate response to repeated importations of infections from outside the facility. Unfortunately, it is often unclear whether an infection detected in a healthcare facility is nosocomial, as the time of infection is unobserved. Given this, there is a strong case for the development of models that can integrate multiple datasets available in hospitals to assess whether an infection detected in a hospital is nosocomial. When assessing nosocomiality, it is beneficial to take into account both whether the timing of infection is consistent with hospital acquisition and whether there are any likely candidates within the hospital who could have been the source of the infection. In this work, we developed a Bayesian model which jointly estimates whether a given infection detected in hospital is nosocomial and whether it came from a set of individuals identified as candidates by hospital staff. The model coherently integrates pathogen genetic information, the timings of epidemiological events, such as symptom onset, and location data on the infected patient and candidate infectors. We illustrated this model on a real hospital dataset showing both its output and how the impact of the different data sources on the assessed probabilities are contingent on what other data has been included in the model, and validated the calibration of the predictions against simulated data.

                <p>by Yufei Wu, Morgan A. Benson, Sean X. Sun</p>

Active fluid circulation and solute transport are essential functions of living organisms, enabling the efficient delivery of oxygen and nutrients to various physiological compartments. Since fluid circulation occurs in a network, the systemic flux and pressure are not simple outcomes of individual components. Rather, they are emergent properties of network elements and network topology. Moreover, consistent pressure and osmolarity gradients are maintained across compartments such as the kidney, interstitium, and blood vessels. The mechanisms by which these gradients and network properties are established and maintained are unanswered questions in systems physiology. Previous studies have shown that epithelial cells are fluid pumps and can actively generate pressure and osmolarity gradients. The polarization and activity of solute transporters in epithelial cells, which drive fluid flux, are influenced by pressure and osmolarity gradients. Therefore, there is an unexplored coupling between pressure and osmolarity in the circulatory network. In this work, we develop a mathematical framework that integrates the influence of pressure and osmolarity on solute transport. We use this model to explore both cellular fluid transport and systemic circulation. Using a simple network featuring the kidney-vascular interface, we show that our model naturally generates pressure and osmolarity gradients across the kidney, vessels and renal interstitium. While the current model uses this interface as an example, the findings can be generalized to other physiological compartments. This model demonstrates how systemic transport properties can depend on cellular properties and, conversely, how cell states are influenced by systemic properties. When epithelial and endothelial pumps are considered together, we predict how pressures at various points in the network depend on the overall osmolarity of the system. The model can be improved by including physiological geometries and expanding solute species, and highlights the interplay of fluid properties with cell function in living organisms.

The potential diversity in the global repertoire of human antibody sequences is currently not well understood due to the limited existing paired antibody heavy-light chain sequence data that has been hindered by the low throughput and high costs of current single-cell sequencing methods. Here, we report IgHuAb, a large language model for high-throughput generation of paired human antibody sequences. Using IgHuAb, we created SynAbLib, a synthetic human antibody library that mimics population-level features of naturally occurring human antibody sequences, yet is associated with significantly greater diversity in sequence space. Further, experimental validation of a diverse set of antibodies from SynAbLib showed robust expression yields. IgHuAb and SynAbLib provide a readily expandable platform for human monoclonal antibody generation that can be efficiently mined for antibody sequences with target properties.

The design of proteins capable effectively binding to specific protein targets is crucial for developing therapies, diagnostics, and vaccine candidates for viral infections. Here, we introduce a complementarity-determining region (CDR) grafting approach for designing nanobodies (Nbs) that target specific epitopes, with the aid of computer simulation and machine learning. As a proof-of-concept, we designed, evaluated, and characterized a high-affinity Nb against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. The designed Nb, referred to as Nb Ab.2, was synthesized and displayed high-affinity for both the purified receptor-binding domain protein and to the virus-like particle, demonstrating affinities of 9 nM and 60 nM, respectively, as measured with microscale thermophoresis. Circular dichroism showed the designed protein’s structural integrity and its proper folding, whereas molecular dynamics simulations provided insights into the internal dynamics of Nb Ab.2. This study shows that our computational pipeline can be used to efficiently design high-affinity Nbs with diagnostic and prophylactic potential, which can be tailored to tackle different viral targets.

                <p>by Pascal Mamassian, Vincent de Gardelle</p>

Over the last decade, different approaches have been proposed to interpret confidence rating judgments obtained after perceptual decisions. One very popular approach is to compute meta-d’ which is a global measure of the sensibility to discriminate the confidence rating distributions for correct and incorrect perceptual decisions. Here, we propose a generative model of confidence based on two main parameters, confidence noise and confidence boost, that we call <i>CNCB model</i>. Confidence noise impairs confidence judgements above and beyond how sensory noise affects perceptual sensitivity. The confidence boost parameter reflects whether confidence uses the same information that was used for perceptual decisions, or some new information. This CNCB model offers a principled way to estimate a confidence efficiency measure that is a theory-driven alternative to the popular M-ratio. We then describe two scenarios to estimate the confidence boost parameter, one where the experiment uses more than two confidence levels, the other where the experiment uses more than two stimulus strengths. We also extend the model to experiments using continuous confidence ratings and describe how the model can be fitted without binning these ratings. The continuous confidence model includes a non-linear mapping between objective and subjective confidence probabilities that can be estimated. Altogether, the CNCB model should help interpret confidence rating data at a deeper level. This manuscript is accompanied by a toolbox that will allow researchers to estimate all the parameters of the CNCB model in confidence ratings datasets. Some examples of re-analyses of previous datasets are provided in S1 File.

                <p>by Jose A. Carrillo, Hideki Murakawa, Makoto Sato, Miaoxing Wang</p>

Cell sorting by differential adhesion is one of the basic mechanisms explaining spatial organization of neurons in early stage brain development of fruit flies. The columnar arrangements of neurons determine the large-scale patterns in the fly visual center. Experimental studies indicate that hexagonal configurations regularly appear in the fly compound eye, which is connected to the visual center by photoreceptor axons, while tetragonal configurations can be induced in mutants. We need a mathematical framework to study the mechanisms of such a transition between hexagonal and tetragonal arrangements. Here, we propose a new mathematical model based on macroscopic approximations of agent-based models that produces a similar behavior changing from hexagonal to tetragonal steady configurations when medium-range repulsion and longer-range attraction between individuals are incorporated in previous successful models for cell sorting based on adhesion and volume constraints. We analyze the angular configurations of these patterns based on angle summary statistics and compare between experimental data and parameter fitted ARA (Adhesion-Repulsion-Attraction) models showing that intermediate patterns between hexagonal and tetragonal configuration are common in experimental data as well as in our ARA mathematical model. Our studies indicate an overall qualitative agreement of ARA models in tile patterning and pave the way for their quantitative studies. Our study opens up a new avenue to explore tile pattern transitions, found not only in the column arrangement in the brain, but also in the other related biological processes.

In this study, we aimed to determine the impact of an increase in motor activity during the highly plastic period of development of the motor spinal cord and hindlimb muscles in newborn mice. A swim training regimen, consisting of two sessions per day for two days, was conducted in 1 and 2-day-old (P1, P2) pups. P3-trained pups showed a faster acquisition of a four-limb swimming pattern, accompanied by dysregulated gene expression in the lateral motor column, alterations in the intrinsic membrane properties of motoneurons (MNs) and synaptic plasticity, as well as increased axonal myelination in motor regions of the spinal cord. Network-level changes were also observed, as synaptic events in MNs and spinal noradrenaline and serotonin contents were modified by training. At the muscular level, slight changes in neuromuscular junction morphology and myosin subtype expression in hindlimb muscles were observed in trained animals. Furthermore, the temporal sequence of acquiring the adult-like swimming pattern and postural development in trained pups showed differences persisting until almost the second postnatal week. A very short motor training performed just after birth is thus able to induce functional adaptation in the developing neuromuscular system that could persist several days. This highlights the vulnerability of the neuromuscular apparatus during development and the need to evaluate carefully the impact of any given sensorimotor procedure when considering its application to improve motor development or in rehabilitation strategies.

                <p>by Alida Melissa Bouatta, Franziska Anzenberger, Lisa Riederauer, Andrea Lepper, Philipp Denninger</p>

During plant fertilization, excess male gametes compete for a limited number of female gametes. The dormant male gametophyte, encapsulated in the pollen grain, consists of two sperm cells enclosed in a vegetative cell. After reaching the stigma of a compatible flower, quick and efficient germination of the vegetative cell to a tip-growing pollen tube is crucial to ensure fertilization success. Rho of Plants (ROP) signaling and their activating ROP Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors (ROPGEFs) are essential for initiating polar growth processes in multiple cell types. However, which ROPGEFs activate pollen germination is unknown. We investigated the role of ROPGEFs in initiating pollen germination and the required cell polarity establishment. Of the five pollen-expressed ROPGEFs, we found that GEF8, GEF9, and GEF12 are required for pollen germination and male fertilization success, as <i>gef8;gef9;gef12</i> triple mutants showed almost complete loss of pollen germination <i>in vitro</i> and had a reduced allele transmission rate. Live-cell imaging and spatiotemporal analysis of subcellular protein distribution showed that GEF8, GEF9, and GEF11, but not GEF12, displayed transient polar protein accumulations at the future site of pollen germination minutes before pollen germination, demonstrating specific roles for GEF8 and GEF9 during the initiation of pollen germination. Furthermore, this novel GEF accumulation appears in a biphasic temporal manner and can shift its location laterally. We showed that the C-terminal domain of GEF8 and GEF9 confers their protein accumulation and demonstrated that GEFs locally activate ROPs and alter Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels, which is required for pollen tube germination. We demonstrated that not all GEFs act redundantly during pollen germination, and we described for the first time a polar domain with spatiotemporal flexibility, which is crucial for the <i>de novo</i> establishment of a polar growth domain within a cell and, thus, for pollen function and fertilization success.

                <p>by Annabel May, Katja Röper</p>

How tissue shape and therefore function is encoded by the genome remains in many cases unresolved. The tubes of the salivary glands in the <i>Drosophila</i> embryo start from simple epithelial placodes, specified through the homeotic factors Scr/Hth/Exd. Previous work indicated that early morphogenetic changes are prepatterned by transcriptional changes, but an exhaustive transcriptional blueprint driving physical changes was lacking. We performed single-cell-RNAseq-analysis of FACS-isolated early placodal cells, making up less than 0.4% of cells within the embryo. Differential expression analysis in comparison to epidermal cells analyzed in parallel generated a repertoire of genes highly upregulated within placodal cells prior to morphogenetic changes. Furthermore, clustering and pseudotime analysis of single-cell-sequencing data identified dynamic expression changes along the morphogenetic timeline. Our dataset provides a comprehensive resource for future studies of a simple but highly conserved morphogenetic process of tube morphogenesis. Unexpectedly, we identified a subset of genes that, although initially expressed in the very early placode, then became selectively excluded from the placode but not the surrounding epidermis, including <i>hth</i>, <i>grainyhead</i> and <i>tollo/toll-8</i>. We show that maintaining <i>tollo</i> expression severely compromised the tube morphogenesis. We propose <i>tollo</i> is switched off to not interfere with key Tolls/LRRs that are expressed and function in the tube morphogenesis.

                <p>by Jacob Francis, Caius R. Gibeily, William V. Smith, Isabel S. Petropoulos, Michael Anderson, William J. Heitler, Astrid A. Prinz, Stefan R. Pulver</p>

How do neural networks generate and regulate diversity and variability in motor outputs with finite cellular components? Here we examine this problem by exploring the role that inhibitory neuron motifs play in generating mixtures of motor programs in the segmentally organised <i>Drosophila</i> larval locomotor system. We developed a computational model that is constrained by experimental calcium imaging data. The model comprises single-compartment cells with a single voltage-gated calcium current, which are interconnected by graded excitatory and inhibitory synapses. Local excitatory and inhibitory neurons form conditional oscillators in each hemisegment. Surrounding architecture reflects key aspects of inter- and intrasegmental connectivity motifs identified in the literature. The model generates metachronal waves of activity that recapitulate key features of fictive forwards and backwards locomotion, as well as bilaterally asymmetric activity in anterior regions that represents fictive head sweeps. The statistics of inputs to competing command-like motifs, coupled with inhibitory motifs that detect activity across multiple segments generate network states that promote diversity in motor outputs, while at the same time preventing maladaptive overlap in motor programs. Overall, the model generates testable predictions for connectomics and physiological studies while providing a platform for uncovering how inhibitory circuit motifs underpin generation of diversity and variability in motor systems.

<p>Dystonia research focuses on the identification of converging biological pathways, allowing to define molecular drivers that serve as treatment targets. We summarize evidence supporting the concept that aberrations in purine metabolism intersect with dystonia pathogenesis. The recent discovery of <i>IMPDH2</i>-related dystonia introduced a gain-of-function paradigm in purinergic system defects, offering new perspectives to understand purine-pool imbalances in brain diseases. We discuss commonalities between known dystonia-linked mechanisms and mechanisms emerging from studies of purine metabolism disorders including Lesch–Nyhan disease. Together, we hypothesize that a greater appreciation of the relevance of purine perturbances in dystonia can offer fresh avenues for therapeutic intervention.

We identified a protein panel signature, in living humans, that correlates to improvement in neurocognition over a period of 5 years. Our signature is composed of complement proteins, coagulation cascade, and extracellular matrix regulators. In our cohort, SERPINF1 is associated with greater maximal oxygen uptake after an aerobic exercise intervention. Sleep quality is also a key factor in relation to inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain H2, which was associated with greater sleep efficiency. Additionally, we validate that the coagulation profile of decliners’ plasma contains procoagulant agonists, leading to greater platelet activation. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:1007–1018</p>

                <p><i>GBA1</i> variants and decreased glucocerebrosidase activity are implicated in Parkinson's disease (PD). We investigated the hypothesis that increased levels of glucosylceramide (GlcCer), a main substrate of glucocerebrosidase, are involved in PD pathogenesis. Using multiple genetic methods, we show that ATPase phospholipid transporting 10D (<i>ATP10D</i>), not <i>GBA1</i>, is the main regulator of plasma GlcCer levels, yet it is not involved in PD pathogenesis. Plasma GlcCer levels were associated with PD, but not in a causative manner, and are not predictive of disease status. These results argue against targeting GlcCer in <i>GBA1</i>-PD, and underscore the need to explore alternative mechanisms and biomarkers for PD. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:873–878</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The aim of this study was to explore the microstructural dynamics of the subventricular zone (SVZ) with aging and their associations with clinical disability and brain structural damage in pediatric-onset multiple sclerosis (MS) patients.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>One-hundred and forty-one pediatric-onset MS patients (67 pediatric and 74 adults with pediatric-onset) and 233 healthy controls (HC) underwent neurological and 3.0 T MRI assessment. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) were extracted from the SVZ and the thalamus (as control region).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In HC, SVZ FA was higher until age 40 then declined, whereas MD was lower until age 35 before rising (false discovery rate <i>p</i> value [pFDR] ≤ 0.008). Thalamic FA was higher until age 30 and then declined, whereas MD was higher until age 50 (pFDR ≤ 0.007). Pediatric MS patients showed significantly higher SVZ FA than pediatric HC (pFDR &lt; 0.001), while adult patients showed no differences compared to adult HC (pFDR ≤ 0.724). Adult patients had lower thalamic FA and higher MD (pFDR &lt; 0.001). Adults had lower SVZ FA and MD, but higher thalamic MD compared to pediatric patients (pFDR &lt; 0.001). In pediatric MS, higher SVZ FA and MD were associated with higher white matter (WM) lesion volume (LV) and choroid plexus volume and lower brain and thalamic volumes (pFDR ≤ 0.047). In adult patients, higher SVZ MD associated with higher WM LV, lower brain volumes, and lower z-SDMT (pFDR≤0.019). Thalamic microstructural abnormalities were associated with more severe disability and brain damage in both groups (pFDR ≤ 0.018).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings suggest that microstructural changes in the SVZ occur early in pediatric MS and are associated with brain structural damage but not with clinical impairment. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:979–992</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases are characterized by progressive neuronal loss. Previous studies using human postmortem tissues have shown the impact of neurodegenerative disorders on adult neurogenesis. The extent to which adult neural stem cells are activated in the subventricular zone and whether therapeutic treatments such as deep brain stimulation promote adult neurogenesis remains unclear. The goal of the present study is to assess adult neural stem cells activation and neurogenesis in the subventricular zone of patients with Huntington's and Parkinson's diseases who were treated or not by deep brain stimulation.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Postmortem brain samples from Huntington's and Parkinson's disease patients who had received or not long-term deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus were used.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Our results indicate a significant increase in the thickness of the subventricular zone and in the density of proliferating cells and activated stem cells in the brain of Huntington's disease subjects and Parkinson's disease patients treated with deep brain stimulation. We also observed an increase in the density of immature neurons in the brain of these patients.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Overall, our data indicate that long-term deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus promotes cell proliferation and neurogenesis in the subventricular zone that are reduced in Parkinson's disease. Taken together, our results also provide a detailed characterization of the cellular composition of the adult human subventricular zone and caudate nucleus in normal condition and in Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases and demonstrate the plasticity of these regions in response to neurodegeneration.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Whereas a scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) is important for diagnosing epilepsy, a single routine EEG is limited in its diagnostic value. Only a small percentage of routine EEGs show interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) and overall misdiagnosis rates of epilepsy are 20% to 30%. We aim to demonstrate how network properties in EEG recordings can be used to improve the speed and accuracy differentiating epilepsy from mimics, such as functional seizures – even in the absence of IEDs.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In this multicenter study, we analyzed routine scalp EEGs from 218 patients with suspected epilepsy and normal initial EEGs. The patients’ diagnoses were later confirmed based on an epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU) admission. About 46% ultimately being diagnosed with epilepsy and 54% with non-epileptic conditions. A logistic regression model was trained using spectral and network-derived EEG features to differentiate between epilepsy and non-epilepsy. Of the 218 patients, 90% were used for training and 10% were held out for testing. Within the training set, 10-fold cross validation was performed. The resulting tool was named “EpiScalp.”</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>EpiScalp achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.940, an accuracy of 0.904, a sensitivity of 0.835, and a specificity of 0.963 in classifying patients as having epilepsy or not.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>EpiScalp provides an accurate diagnostic aid from a single initial EEG recording, even in more challenging epilepsy cases with normal initial EEGs. This may represent a paradigm shift in epilepsy diagnosis by deriving an objective measure of epilepsy likelihood from previously uninformative EEGs. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:907–918</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Computed tomography perfusion (CTP) imaging is crucial in quantifying cerebral blood flow (CBF) and thereby making an endovascular treatment (EVT) after large vessel occlusion. However, CTP is prone to overestimating the ischemic core. We sought to delineate the optimal regional CBF (rCBF) thresholds of pre-EVT CTP.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We collected acute ischemic stroke patients due to large vessel occlusion who achieved successful recanalization with baseline CTP, immediate post-EVT diffusion-weighted image (DWI) within 3 hours, and delayed post-EVT DWI between 24 and 196 hours. Core volumes estimated by CTP at various rCBF thresholds were validated against immediate and delayed DWI lesion volumes.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>A total of 175 acute large vessel occlusion patients were included. Baseline CTP was taken in a median of 24 minutes (interquartile range [IQR] 21–31 minutes) after arrival; after the CTP, groin puncture in a median of 37 minutes (IQR 28–52 minutes), immediate post-EVT DWI scans in a median of 1.6 hours (IQR 0.8–2.1 hours), and delayed DWI scans in a median of 89 hours (IQR 69–106 hours). The correlations between the rCBF thresholds were the best at rCBF &lt;22% for immediate DWI (0.64; 95% CI 0.55–0.73) and at rCBF &lt;30% for delayed DWI (0.69; 95% CI 0.61–0.76). The interval between CTP and recanalization was inversely correlated with the overestimation of ischemic core volume compared with the subsequent DWI.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Optimal rCBF thresholds for estimating ischemic core using CTP depend significantly on the timing of DWI post-EVT and CTP to recanalization delay. The optimal rCBF thresholds for ischemic core estimation may vary depending on the clinical setting. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:919–929</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27170?af=R">Automated Detection of Isolated REM Sleep Behavior Disorder Using Computer Vision</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Isolated rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) is, in most cases, an early stage of Parkinson's disease or related disorders. Diagnosis requires an overnight video-polysomnogram (vPSG), however, even for sleep experts, interpreting vPSG data is challenging. Using a 3D camera, automated analysis of movements has yielded high accuracy. We aimed to replicate and extend prior work using a conventional 2D camera.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The dataset included 172 vPSG recordings from a clinical sleep center, 81 patients with iRBD and 91 non-RBD healthy controls (63 with a range of other sleep disorders and 28 healthy sleepers). An optical flow computer vision algorithm automatically detected movements during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, from which features of rate, ratio, magnitude and velocity of movements, and ratio of immobility were extracted.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Patients with iRBD exhibited an increased number of shorter movements and immobility periods. Accuracies for detecting iRBD ranged from 84.9% (with 2 features) to 87.2% (with 5 features). Combining all 5 features but only analyzing short (0.1–2 second duration) movements achieved the highest accuracy at 91.9%. Of the 11 patients with iRBD without noticeable movements during vPSG, 7 were correctly identified.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This work improves prior art by using a 2D camera routinely used in sleep laboratories and improving performance by adding only 3 features. This approach could be implemented in clinical sleep laboratories to facilitate and improve the diagnosis of iRBD. Coupled with automated detection of REM sleep, it should also be tested in the home environment using conventional infrared cameras to detect and/or monitor RBD.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27174?af=R">Genetic Ablation of Sarm1 Mitigates Disease Acceleration after Traumatic Brain Injury in the SOD1G93A Transgenic Mouse Model of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Approximately 20% of familial cases of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are caused by mutations in the gene encoding superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1). Epidemiological data have identified traumatic brain injury (TBI) as an exogenous risk factor for ALS; however, the mechanisms by which TBI may worsen SOD1 ALS remain largely undefined.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We sought to determine whether repetitive TBI (rTBI) accelerates disease onset and progression in the transgenic SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mouse ALS model, and whether loss of the primary regulator of axonal degeneration sterile alpha and TIR motif containing 1 (<i>Sarm1</i>) mitigates the histological and behavioral pathophysiology. We subjected wild-type (n = 23), <i>Sarm1</i> knockout (KO; n = 17), SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> (n = 19), and SOD1<sup>G93A</sup>xSarm1<sup>KO</sup> (n = 26) mice of both sexes to rTBI or sham surgery at age 64 days (62–68 days). Body weight and ALS-deficit score were serially assessed up to 17 weeks after surgery and histopathology assessed in layer V of the primary motor cortex at the study end point.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In sham injured SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice, genetic ablation of <i>Sarm1</i> did not attenuate axonal loss, improve neurological deficits, or survival. The rTBI accelerated onset of G93A-SOD1 ALS, as indicated by accentuated body weight loss, earlier onset of hindlimb tremor, and shortened survival. The rTBI also triggered TDP-43 mislocalization, enhanced axonal and neuronal loss, microgliosis, and astrocytosis. Loss of <i>Sarm1</i> significantly diminished the impact of rTBI on disease progression and rescued rTBI-associated neuropathology.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>SARM1-mediated axonal death pathway promotes pathogenesis after TBI in SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice suggesting that anti-SARM1 therapeutics are a viable approach to preserve neurological function in injury-accelerated G93A-SOD1 ALS. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:963–975</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The Clarity AD phase III trial showed that lecanemab reduced amyloid markers in early Alzheimer's disease (AD) and resulted in less decline on measures of cognition and function than placebo. Herein, we aimed to characterize amyloid-β (Aβ) protofibril (PF) captured by lecanemab in human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from living participants with different stages in AD, which enable an enhanced understanding of the dynamic changes of lecanemab-associated Aβ-PF (Lec-PF) in vivo.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We newly developed a unique and highly sensitive immunoassay method using lecanemab that selectively captures Lec-PF. The CSF level of Lec-PF, Aβ42, Aβ40, p-tau181, p-tau 217, total tau, and neurogranin were measured in Japanese participants (n = 163). The participants in this study consisted of 48 cognitively unimpaired Aβ-negative (CU–), 8 cognitively impaired diagnosed as suspected non-Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology, 9 cognitively unimpaired Aβ-positive (CU+), 34 Aβ-positive with mild cognitive impairment (MCI+), and 64 Aβ-positive with AD dementia (AD+).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The CSF Lec-PF levels significantly increased in the groups of MCI+ and AD+ compared with CU– group. Notably, CSF Lec-PF showed modest correlation with plaque-associated biomarkers in Aβ-positive participants and stronger correlation with neurodegeneration biomarkers, such as CSF total tau and neurogranin, suggesting that CSF Lec-PF levels proximally reflect neurodegeneration as well as the amount of senile amyloid plaques.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This is the first report describing Aβ-PF species captured by lecanemab in human CSF and supporting that Lec-PF is correlated with neurodegeneration in AD and may explain the mechanism of the clinical effect of lecanemab. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:993–1006</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study assesses whether longitudinal quantitative pupillometry predicts neurological deterioration after large middle cerebral artery (MCA) stroke and determines how early changes are detectable.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This prospective, single-center observational cohort study included patients with large MCA stroke admitted to Boston Medical Center's intensive care unit (2019–2024). Associations between time-to-neurologic deterioration and quantitative pupillometry, including Neurological Pupil Index (NPi), were assessed using Cox proportional hazards models with time-dependent covariates adjusted for age, sex, and Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score. Models using dilation velocity were compared with partial likelihood ratio tests. Pupillometric changes over 2-h intervals in the 12 h preceding deterioration were analyzed with linear mixed-effects modeling and Tukey's test. Matched referents (age, sex, stroke side, follow-up duration) were used for comparison. Optimal thresholds were identified using the Youden Index.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Among 71 patients (mean age 66.5 years; 59.2% women), 32 (45.1%) experienced deterioration. A 1-unit decrease in NPi was associated with a higher hazard of deterioration (hazard ratio 2.46; 95% confidence interval 1.68–3.61). Dilation velocity improved model performance compared to NPi alone. NPi was significantly lower at 0–2 h (3.81 vs. 4.38, p = 0.001) and 2–4 h (3.71 vs. 4.38, p &lt; 0.001) before deterioration compared to 10–12 h prior. Optimal thresholds were 4.01 for NPi, 0.49 mm/s for dilation velocity, and −0.15 change in NPi over 12 h.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Quantitative pupillometry predicts neurological deterioration in MCA stroke, with declines detectable up to 12 h prior. Dilation velocity shows promise as a novel biomarker. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:930–941</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of this study was to delineate synaptic density alterations in multiple system atrophy (MSA) and explore its potential role as a biomarker for MSA diagnosis and disease severity monitoring using [<sup>18</sup>F]SynVesT-1 positron emission tomography / computed tomography (PET CT).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In this prospective study, 60 patients with MSA (30 patients with MSA-parkinsonian [MSA-P] subtype and 30 patients with MSA-cerebellar [MSA-C] subtype), 30 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), and 30 age-matched healthy controls (HCs) underwent [<sup>18</sup>F]SynVesT-1 PET/CT for synaptic density assessment. Visual, voxel, and volumetric region of interest (VOI) analyses were used to elucidate synaptic density patterns in the MSA brain and establish diagnostic criteria. The diagnostic performances of both visual and VOI-based diagnostics were evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Spearman correlation analyses were conducted to investigate the relationship between brain synaptic density and disease severity</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Patients with MSA displayed extensive reductions in synaptic density throughout the brain, notably affecting both primary VOIs (the cerebellum and putamen) and secondary VOIs including the medulla oblongata, ventral tegmental area, and pons. Notably, patients with MSA-C exhibited a remarkable decrease in cerebellar synaptic density, whereas patients with MSA-P demonstrated significant synaptic loss within the posterior putamen. Compared with patients with PD, the patients with MSA show a more pronounced reduction in synaptic density in infratentorial brain regions. VOI-based diagnosis significantly outperformed visual analysis in diagnosing and differentiating MSA and its subtypes. Synaptic density in primary and multiple secondary VOIs correlated significantly with motor scales in patients with MSA.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our study identified widespread synaptic density reductions in MSA, particularly in the basal ganglia and infratentorial region, suggesting [<sup>18</sup>F]SynVesT-1 PET as a potential biomarker for diagnosing and evaluating the disease, and guiding synaptic restoration trials.

<p>
</p>
<br/>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) is a severe neurodegenerative disease characterized by tangles of hyperphosphorylated tau protein and tufted astrocytes. Developing treatments for PSP is challenging due to the lack of disease models reproducing its key pathological features. This study aimed to model sporadic PSP-Richardson's syndrome (PSP-RS) using multi-donor midbrain organoids (MOs).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The MOs were generated by pooling induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from 4 patients with sporadic probable PSP-RS and compared them with MOs from 3 healthy control (HC) subjects. We performed comprehensive analyses of MOs over 120 days to assess neuronal death, reactive gliosis, and the accumulation of 4R-tau and hyperphosphorylated tau forms (pThr231, pSer396, pThr181, and pSer202/pThr205 [AT8]) using immunofluorescence microscopy and Western blot. On day 90, immunohistochemical analysis using pSer396 and AT8 antibodies was conducted to assess disease pathology.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>PSP-derived MOs showed progressive size reduction compared with HC-derived MOs, linked to upregulated apoptosis-related mRNA markers. Dopaminergic neuron degeneration was marked by decreased tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and increased neurofilament light chain (NfL). Immunofluorescence and Western blot revealed accumulation of all investigated tau forms with a peak at 90 days, along with a significant rise in GFAP-positive cells in PSP-derived MOs. Immunochemistry confirmed typical PSP histological alterations, such as neurofibrillary tangles and tufted-shaped astrocytes, absent in HC-derived organoids.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We developed a robust in vitro PSP model reproducing the key molecular and histologic features of the disease. This result holds promise for advancing basic and clinical research in PSP, paving the way for in vitro molecular diagnosis and identification of novel therapeutic targets.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>After a recent small subcortical infarct (RSSI), some patients develop perilesional or remote hyperintensities (‘caps/tracks’) to the index infarct on T2/FLAIR MRI. However, their clinical relevance remains unclear. We investigated the clinicoradiological correlates of ‘caps/tracks’, and their impact on long-term outcomes following RSSI.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We identified participants with lacunar stroke and MRI-confirmed RSSI from 3 prospective studies. At baseline, we collected risk factors, RSSI characteristics, small vessel disease (SVD) features, and microstructural integrity on diffusion imaging. Over 1-year, we repeated MRI and recorded ‘caps/tracks’ blinded to other data. We evaluated predictors of ‘caps/tracks’, and their association with 1-year functional (modified Rankin Scale score ≥2), mobility (Timed Up-and-Go), cognitive outcomes (Montreal Cognitive Assessment [MoCA] score &lt;26), and recurrent cerebrovascular events (stroke/transient ischemic attack/incident infarct) using multivariable regression.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Among 185 participants, 93 (50.3%) developed ‘caps/tracks’ first detected at median 198 days after stroke. ‘Caps/tracks’ were independently predicted by baseline factors: larger RSSI, RSSI located in white matter, higher SVD score, and higher mean diffusivity in normal-appearing white matter (odds ratio [OR] [95% confidence interval {CI}], 1.15 [1.07–1.25], 6.01 [2.80–13.57], 1.77 [1.31–2.44], 1.42 [1.01–2.03]). At 1 year, ‘cap/track’ formation was associated with worse functional outcome (OR: 3.17, 95% CI: 1.28–8.22), slower gait speed (β: 0.13, 95% CI: 0.01–0.25), and recurrent cerebrovascular events (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.05, 95% CI: 1.05–4.02), but not with cognitive impairment.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>‘Caps/tracks’ after RSSI are associated with worse clinical outcomes, and may reflect vulnerability to progressive SVD-related injury. Reducing ‘caps/tracks’ may offer early efficacy markers in trials aiming to improve outcome after lacunar stroke. ANN NEUROL 2025;97:942–955</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Genetic dystonia is a complex movement disorder with diverse clinical manifestations resulting from pathogenic mutations in associated genes. A recent paradigm shift emphasizes the functional convergence among dystonia genes, hinting at a shared pathomechanism. However, the neural dynamics supporting this convergence remain largely unexplored.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Herein, we analyzed microelectrode recordings acquired during pallidal deep brain stimulation surgery from 31 dystonia patients with pathogenic mutations in the <i>AOPEP</i>, <i>GNAL</i>, <i>KMT2B</i>, <i>PANK2</i>, <i>PLA2G6</i>, <i>SGCE</i>, <i>THAP1</i>, <i>TOR1A</i>, and <i>VPS16</i> genes. We identified 1,694 single units whose activity was characterized by a broad set of neural features.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p><i>AOPEP</i>, <i>PANK2</i>, and <i>THAP1</i> displayed higher firing regularity, whereas <i>GNAL</i>, <i>PLA2G6</i>, <i>KMT2B</i>, and <i>SGCE</i> shared a large fraction of bursting neurons (&gt; 26.6%), significantly exceeding the rate in other genes. <i>TOR1A</i> and <i>VPS16</i> genes constituted an intermediate group, bridging these 2 groups, due to having the highest degree of spiking irregularity. Hierarchical clustering algorithms based on these dynamics confirmed the results obtained with first-order comparisons.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Despite lacking common molecular pathways, dystonia genes share largely overlapping structures of neural patterns, in particular the degree of pallidal spiking regularity and bursting activity. We propose that the degree of desynchronization facilitated by pallidal neural bursts may explain the variability in deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the globus pallidus internus (GPi) surgery outcomes across genetic dystonia syndromes. Lastly, investigating the effects of genetic mutations on low-frequency pallidal activity could optimize personalized adaptive DBS treatments in patients with genetic dystonia.

                Son et al. describe how Parkinson’s disease mutations in alpha-synuclein compromise autophagy, a major route for alpha-synuclein degradation. A53T and triplication α-Syn mutations activate ACLY, which enhances cytoplasmic p300 activity. This stimulates mTORC1 to inhibit autophagy. Importantly, ACLY inhibitors rescue pathology in neuronal, zebrafish, and mouse α-synucleinopathy models.

                Zhao et al. establish an AAV-reporter-based in vivo transcriptional enhancer reconstruction (ARBITER) workflow to dissect enhancers of hearing loss genes. Using ARBITER, they decode the Slc26a5 enhancers and engineer a highly efficient, outer hair cell (OHC)-specific enhancer. Gene therapy with this enhancer restores hearing function in Slc26a5 KO mice.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/100490">Cell crowding activates pro-invasive mechanotransduction pathway in high-grade DCIS via TRPV4 inhibition and cell volume reduction</a></h4>

              
                Cell crowding is a common microenvironmental factor influencing various disease processes, but its role in promoting cell invasiveness remains unclear. This study investigates the biomechanical changes induced by cell crowding, focusing on pro-invasive cell volume reduction in ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Crowding specifically enhanced invasiveness in high-grade DCIS cells through significant volume reduction compared to hyperplasia-mimicking or normal cells. Mass spectrometry revealed that crowding selectively relocated ion channels, including TRPV4, to the plasma membrane in high-grade DCIS cells. TRPV4 inhibition triggered by crowding decreased intracellular calcium levels, reduced cell volume, and increased invasion and motility. During this process, TRPV4 membrane relocation primed the channel for later activation, compensating for calcium loss. Analyses of patient-derived breast cancer tissues confirmed that plasma membrane-associated TRPV4 is specific to high-grade DCIS and indicates the presence of a pro-invasive cell volume reduction mechanotransduction pathway. Hyperosmotic conditions and pharmacologic TRPV4 inhibition mimicked crowding-induced effects, while TRPV4 activation reversed them. Silencing TRPV4 diminished mechanotransduction in high-grade DCIS cells, reducing calcium depletion, volume reduction, and motility. This study uncovers a novel pro-invasive mechanotransduction pathway driven by cell crowding and identifies TRPV4 as a potential biomarker for predicting invasion risk in DCIS patients.

                The ADARG1007R mutation is one of the most frequent mutations found in type six Aicardi-Goutieres Syndrome (AGS), a severe inflammatory encephalopathy in pediatric patients. We report here a mouse model bearing an human equivalent ADARG1007R mutation, and the heterozygous mice recapitulated some pathologic features of ADARG1007R AGS patients, including early-onset brain inflammation in heterozygous individuals and interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression within deep brain areas. Furthermore, we demonstrated that brain inflammation could be reversed by deletion of the cellular RNA receptor MDA5, which blocks the cellular RNA sensing signaling pathway. This model provides a unique tool for studying the molecular mechanisms underlying the heterozygous ADARWT/G1007R mutation in AGS brain pathogenesis. It may also be a valuable platform for developing personalized therapies for patients with this specific mutation.

">Cannabis use in humans is associated with impaired implicit motor learning and supranormal baseline cortical activity</a></h4>

              
                Chronic cannabis use is associated with cognitive impairment, but its impact on implicit motor learning is unclear. Implicit learning of movement sequences (i.e., their specific ordinal and temporal structure) is vital for performing complex motor behavior and lays the foundation for performing daily activities and interacting socially. We collected data from 32 individuals who used cannabis regularly and 30 individuals who did not use cannabis. We utilized the serial reaction time task to assess implicit motor sequence learning and the Corsi block-tapping test to assess visuospatial short-term and working memory. We also recorded resting state electroencephalography (EEG) to measure baseline cortical activity. While implicit motor learning was evident at the group level, cannabis use measures were associated with a smaller index of motor learning and increased activity in beta and gamma EEG frequencies during resting state. The cannabis group also had a significantly shorter Corsi span (in both forward and backward conditions). These findings indicate that chronic cannabis use is associated with impaired implicit motor learning that may be a function of increased baseline neural oscillatory activity, resulting in increased cortical noise, and reduced visuospatial short-term and working memory. These findings suggest that chronic cannabis use may disrupt corticostriatal pathways that underlie implicit motor sequence learning, indicating a more extensive effect of cannabis on the motor system.

">Control of two-pathway signal integration in a model neocortical pyramidal cell</a></h4>

              
                We demonstrate how neuromodulation and spatially targetted inhibition can alter the integration of the two streams of excitatory input in a thick-tufted layer 5 pyramidal cell, using a computational reduced-compartmental cell models. Choosing suitable ranges of brief current stimulus amplitudes, applied basally to either the soma or basal dendrites (basal stimulation) and to the apical tuft (apical stimulation) results in burst firing due to either stimulus alone, if strong enough, or by a combination of the stimuli at lower amplitudes. Applying tonic inhibition to the apical tuft removes the ability of apical input alone to generate a burst over the chosen amplitude range. A similar effect is achieved by reducing the tuft calcium channel conductance as an outcome of neuromodulation. Similarly, tonic inhibition to the basal dendrites removes the ability of basal stimulation alone to generate a burst, without blocking bursts resulting from apical calcium spikes. HCN channels in the apical dendrites may amplify or reduce bursting probability, depending on other active and passive properties of dendrites. So neuromodulation that decreases the conductance of these channels may act to reduce or increase bursting probability across the across the ranges of basal and apical inputs, depending on cell properties. These effects mimic those found previously by simply limiting the range of stimulus amplitudes (Graham et al, 2025) but now show that such changes in two-stream signal integration can happen through network inhibition and neuromodulation with no change in the excitatory driving stimulus strengths. These changes in signal integration also lead to changes in information transmitted by the cell's bursting probability about the two input streams, as shown in Graham et al (2025). Changes in cell morphology are also investigated by reducing the apical trunk length and are revealed to alter this two-stream signal integration through differential effects on passive and active interaction between the soma and apical tuft.

">The role of inhibitory neurons in novelty sound detection in regular and random statistical contexts.</a></h4>

              
                Detecting statistical regularities in sound and responding to violations of these patterns, termed novelty detection, is a core function of the auditory system. Human studies have shown that novelty responses are enhanced in regular compared to random auditory contexts, but the underlying circuit mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we examined how inhibitory neurons contribute to context-dependent novelty responses in mouse auditory cortex. Using two-photon calcium imaging in the auditory cortex of awake head-fixed male and female mice, we recorded neuronal activity during presentation of spectro-temporally rich ripple sounds, with novel ripples embedded in either regular or random ripple sequences. AC neurons exhibited enhanced responses to novel sounds in regular contexts compared to random ones. To identify circuit mechanisms, we selectively inactivated parvalbumin (PV), somatostatin (SST), or vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) inhibitory neurons using optogenetics during imaging. Inactivation of PV and SST neurons broadly increased novelty responses in both contexts. In contrast, VIP inactivation selectively reduced responses to novel stimuli in the regular context, abolishing the context-dependent enhancement. At the population level, inactivating all three neuronal subtypes increased detectability of the novel stimulus, but with VIP inactivation, the shift was stronger for regular than random context. These findings reveal a distinct role for VIP neurons in modulating prediction error signals based on temporal structure, suggesting that VIP circuits are critical for context-sensitive auditory processing.

">Kinocilia of Vestibular Hair Cells: Bridging Structural and Functional Traits of Primary and Motile Cilia</a></h4>

              
                Vestibular hair cells (HCs) detect head motion and orientation by transducing mechanical forces generated by gravity and acceleration into neural signals. This mechanotransduction is mediated by the hair bundle, which comprises stereocilia and a single kinocilium - the latter considered a specialized form of primary cilium. To investigate the characteristics of the kinocilium, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing on 1,522 adult vestibular and cochlear HCs. Our analysis revealed an enrichment of genes associated with motile cilia in vestibular HCs, particularly those linked to the axonemal repeat complex, a defining structural feature of motile cilia. Orthologous axonemal-related genes were also identified in zebrafish and human vestibular HCs, highlighting a conserved molecular architecture of kinocilia across vertebrate species. Immunostaining confirmed the expression of key motile cilia markers - including CCDC39, CCDC40, DNAH5, and DNAH6 - in vestibular kinocilia. Live imaging of bullfrog saccular and mouse crista HCs revealed spontaneous kinociliary motion that drove oscillations of the hair bundle. Together, these findings establish the kinocilium as a distinct organelle with molecular hallmarks of motile cilia and suggest it functions as an active, force-generating hair bundle component, potentially influencing the mechanosensitivity of the kinocilium-bearing HCs across nonmammalian and mammalian species.

">Unsupervised feature computation-based feature selection robustly extracted resting-state functional connectivity patterns related to mental disorders</a></h4>

              
                Research on biomarkers for predicting psychiatric disorders from resting-state functional connectivity (FC) is advancing. While the focus has primarily been on the discriminative performance of biomarkers by machine learning, identification of abnormal FCs in psychiatric disorders has often been treated as a secondary goal. However, it is crucial to investigate the effect size and robustness of the selected FCs because they can be used as potential targets of neurofeedback training or transcranial magnetic stimulation therapy. Here, we incorporated approximately 5,000 runs of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging from six datasets, including individuals with three different psychiatric disorders (major depressive disorder [MDD], schizophrenia [SCZ], and autism spectrum disorder [ASD]). We demonstrated that an unsupervised feature-computation-based feature selection method can robustly extract FCs related to psychiatric disorders compared to other conventional supervised feature selection methods. We found that our proposed method robustly extracted FCs with larger effect sizes from the validation dataset compared to different types of feature selection methods based on supervised learning for MDD (Cohens d = 0.40 vs. 0.25), SCZ (0.37 vs. 0.28), and ASD (0.17 vs. 0.16). We found 78, 69, and 81 essential FCs for MDD, SCZ, and ASD, respectively, and these FCs were mainly thalamic and motor network FCs. The current study showed that the unsupervised feature-computation-based feature selection method robustly identified abnormal FCs in psychiatric disorders consistently across datasets. The discovery of such robust FCs will contribute to understanding neural mechanisms as abnormal brain signatures in psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, this finding can aid in developing precise therapeutic interventions, such as neurofeedback training or transcranial magnetic stimulation therapy.

">HIF-1α/STOML2 mediated PINK1-dependent mitophagy activation against hypoxia-induced neuronal injury</a></h4>

              
                Hypoxia contributes to brain disorders by causing neuronal injury. However, in the early stage of stress, neurons initiate a series of compensatory pathways to resist cell damage, but the underlying mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. In this study, we found that hypoxia transiently activates PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1)-dependent mitophagy in the early stage before cell damage and neurological dysfunction. PINK1 overexpression protects neurons and it knockdown exacerbates neuronal damage, highlighting the key role of PINK1-dependent mitophagy in hypoxic adaptation. Mechanistically, hypoxia promotes HIF-1 nuclear translocation, inducing transcription of stomatin like 2 (STOML2). STOML2 relocates to the mitochondrial membrane, aiding phosphoglycerate mutase 5 (PGAM5) cleavage, which triggers PINK1-dependent mitophagy. Silencing HIF-1, STOML2, or PGAM5 inhibits PINK1-dependent mitophagy and worsens neurological function under hypoxia. Notably, intermittent hypoxia, a hypoxic conditioning strategy for improving hypoxic tolerance, enhances PINK1-dependent mitophagy by activating HIF-1/STOML2 axis, and protects neurons against hypoxia. In conclusion, our study reveals a new "self-protection" mechanism of neurons against hypoxic stress and discovers that intermittent hypoxia is a potential therapeutic strategy against hypoxia-induced injury.

">Arcuate Fasciculus: Evolutionary Convergence in Marmosets and Humans</a></h4>

              
                The marmoset is a highly vocal platyrrhine monkey that shares key anatomical and functional features with humans, providing a unique opportunity to illuminate the phylogenetic origins of diverging connectivity profiles and their transformations throughout evolution. Although the similarity of vocalization features between humans has been reported, whether marmosets possess an arcuate fasciculus homolog is not known. In this study, we delineated the white matter tracts in marmosets, establishing homologies with those observed in other primates, including macaques, chimpanzees, and humans. The presence of an arcuate fasciculus homolog in marmosets was confirmed by tracer and ultra-high-resolution diffusion magnetic resonance imaging datasets. Using a connectivity blueprint approach, we compared cortical connectivity patterns across these species and found the arcuate fasciculus in marmosets terminates in the ventral frontal cortex, with a similarity to humans that exceeds that observed in macaques, something corroborated by quantitative analyses after transforming all brains into a common space. To explore arcuate fasciculus' support for species-specific vocalizations, the activation patterns of vocal communications in marmosets and humans were associated with arcuate fasciculus connectivity. Collectively, our findings suggest that a dorsal pathway, which emerged early in marmoset evolution, has evolved convergently with humans, despite their distant phylogenetic kindship.

">ER fusogens maintain membrane reservoir to ensure brain function</a></h4>

              
                How the morphological dynamics of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are linked to its functions is unclear. Atlastins (ATLs), a class of GTPases, mediate ER fusion, and human mutations in ATL1 cause hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP). Here, we show that ATL2-knockout mice are embryonic lethal with compromised development, particularly of the cerebellum. ATL2 is highly expressed in neuroglia, though ATL1 is dominant in the brain. Lack of ATL2 disorganizes the positioning of Bergmann glia, which in turn interferes with granule cell migration. These cells have significant shrinkage in the intracellular membrane area, which is associated with decreased phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol synthesis. When tested in calyx-type synapses in ATL-deleted mice, a reduced membrane reservoir, represented by fewer presynaptic vesicles, leads to defective synaptic function and deafness. Collectively, these findings suggest that ER-shaping activity by ATL is essential for sustained lipid synthesis, and boosted lipid uptake is potentially beneficial for HSP patients.

                Nutrient deprivation induces adaptive behavioral and physiological changes that are critical for survival. Here, we demonstrate that fasting ameliorates locomotion defects in Caenorhabditis elegans mutants lacking UNC-31/CAPS, a protein essential for dense-core vesicle (DCV)-mediated neuromodulation. Through forward genetic screening, we identified a gain-of-function mutation in egl-30, which encodes the heterotrimeric G protein  subunit Gq, that suppresses the locomotion defects of unc-31 mutants under fed conditions. Transcriptomic analyses revealed that fasting induces upregulation of egl-30 and its downstream effectors in unc-31 mutants. Remarkably, exogenous octopamine treatment, which activates EGL-30/Gq signaling, mimicked the fasting response and restored locomotion in an EGL-30-dependent manner. Our findings uncover a mechanism of neuromodulatory plasticity, in which metabolic stress activates a compensatory octopamine-Gq signaling cascade to bypass impaired DCV-mediated neuromodulation, and suggest potential therapeutic strategies for CAPS-related neuropsychiatric disorders.

">IL-17 sensitises sensory neurons and colonic afferents to noxious stimuli in a PI3K dependent manner</a></h4>

              
                Managing visceral pain associated with gastrointestinal (GI) disease remains a significant challenge due to the gut-related side effects and contraindicated use of many commonly used painkillers in people with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Consequently, it is crucial to deepen our understanding of the mediators and mechanisms underlying inflammatory pain in people with IBD. To do this, we compared bulk RNA sequencing data from colonic biopsy samples from people with IBD with single-cell RNA sequencing data from colon projecting dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons in mice to generate an interactome of putative pro-nociceptive cytokine signalling pathways. This in silico analysis revealed a 10-fold increase in IL17A expression in samples from people with ulcerative colitis (UC) alongside marked co-expression of Il17ra with Trpv1 in colon-projecting DRG neurons in mice, highlighting a likely role for interleukin-17 (IL-17) in colonic nociceptor signalling in people with UC. In support of this, Ca2+ imaging studies demonstrated that IL-17 stimulates DRG sensory neurons co-sensitive to capsaicin with a similar proportion responding in neuron-enriched cultures generated by magnetic-activated cell sorting, thus confirming that IL-17 directly activates DRG neurons. IL-17-evoked Ca2+ signals were attenuated by TRPV1 inhibition, consistent with nociceptor activation, and blocked by inhibition of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) activity, consistent with the known role for PI3K as a downstream effector of IL-17 receptor signalling. In keeping with these observations, IL-17 enhanced murine colonic afferent responses to colorectal distension at noxious distension pressures, an effect also blocked by PI3K inhibition. Overall, these findings demonstrate a pro-nociceptive effect of IL-17 in the GI tract, thus highlighting the potential utility of IL-17-targeting therapies to reduce pain in people with UC.

">Whole-gut spatial genomic analysis reveals molecular regionalization of the differentiating zebrafish enteric nervous system</a></h4>

              
                The enteric nervous system (ENS) is the intrinsic nervous system of the gut and controls essential functions, such as gut motility, intestinal barrier function, and water balance. The ENS displays a complex 3D architecture within the context of the gut and specific transcriptional states needed to control gut homeostasis. During development, the ENS develops from enteric neural progenitor cells (ENPs) that migrate into the gut and differentiate into functionally diverse neuron types. Incorrect ENS development can disrupt ENS function and induce various gut disorders, including the congenital disease Hirschsprung disease, or various other functional gut neurological disorders, such as esophageal achalasia. In this study, we used the zebrafish larval model and performed whole gut spatial genomic analysis (SGA) of the differentiating ENS at cellular resolution. To that end, a pipeline was developed that integrated early and late developmental ENS stages by linking various spatial and transcriptional dimensions to discover regionalized cellular groups and their co-expression similarity. We identified 3D networks of intact ENS surrounding the gut and predicted cellular connectivity properties based on the stage. Spatial variable genes, such as hoxb5b, hoxa4a, etv1, and ret, were regionalized along gut axes, suggesting they may have a precise spatiotemporal control of ENS development. The application of SGA to ENS development provides new insights into its cellular transcriptional networks and interactions, and provides a baseline data set to further advance our understanding of gut neurodevelopmental disorders such as Hirschsprung disease and congenital enteric neuropathies.

">Nonlinear modulation of human exploration by distinct sources of uncertainty</a></h4>

              
                Decision-making in uncertain environments requires balancing exploration and exploitation, with exploration typically assumed to increase monotonically with uncertainty. Challenging this prevailing assumption, we demonstrate a more complex relationship by decomposing environmental uncertainty into volatility (systematic change in reward contingencies, learnable) and stochasticity (random noise in observations, unlearnable). Across two behavioral experiments (N=1001, N=747) using a probabilistic reward task, we find a robust U-shaped relationship between the volatility-to-stochasticity (v/s) ratio and exploratory behavior, with participants exploring more when either stochasticity or volatility dominates. Remarkably, this pattern extends to real-world financial behavior, as demonstrated through analysis of five years of S&P 500 stock market data, where portfolio diversity (a proxy for exploration) shows the same U-shaped relationship with market volatility (systematic price movements driven by fundamental factors, e.g., economic shifts) relative to trading noise (random fluctuations from trading activity unrelated to fundamentals). These findings reveal how humans adaptively modulate exploration strategies based on the qualitative composition of uncertainty, with optimal performance occurring at intermediate uncertainty ratios. This nonlinear relationship has important implications for understanding decision-making across domains where uncertainty arises from multiple sources.

">Egocentric body-axis-related and allocentric clover-like tuning of object vector representations supports human spatial cognition</a></h4>

              
                Vector-based spatial representation is key for navigation, mapping direction and distance between self and environment. Though observed in rodents, its neural basis in humans remains unclear. Using high-resolution imaging and a novel spatial updating task, we found vectorial representations in retrosplenial and parahippocampal cortex, extending to parietal and entorhinal areas in self- and object-centered coordinates, respectively. Egocentric directional signals peaked when the object was behind the navigator, while distance signals emerged only when the object was out of view, suggesting these signals might act as mnemonic buffers for vision-independent spatial mapping. Allocentric directional signals formed a clover-shaped four-axis pattern aligned to a common visual feature, with improved navigation accuracy along these axes, highlighting their functional relevance for human navigation. Rodent parallel single unit recordings indicated the clover pattern resulted from the average activity of neurons with allocentric vectorial properties, suggesting a shared, cross-species mechanism. Collectively, our findings demonstrate a vector-based population code detectable via fMRI, potentially serving as a neural reference axis that anchors objects to internal maps, supporting flexible navigation and perhaps broader cognition.

">Thalamic Nuclei Volumes Across Psychiatric and Neurological Disorders: A Multi-Site Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study</a></h4>

              
                The human thalamus is an integrative hub for multiple cortical and subcortical circuits involved in both sensory processing and higher cognitive functions. Group-level thalamic volume differences have been reported for multiple psychiatric and neurological disorders, but previous studies have relied on small samples, covered few disorders, or only investigated the whole thalamus without considering subdivisions. In this multi-site study, we compared thalamic nuclei volumes across several psychiatric and neurological disorders (N = 5 094) and healthy controls (N = 4 552). Using structural MRI scans, we segmented 25 bilateral thalamic nuclei, corresponding to six anatomical groups. We included patients covering 11 clinical conditions including mild cognitive impairment (MCI), dementia (DEM), major depressive disorder, schizophrenia spectrum disorder (SCZ), clinical high risk for schizophrenia, bipolar spectrum disorder, autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis (MS). Linear models revealed that some regions of the thalamus were significantly smaller in several conditions, with largest effects observed for MCI, DEM, SCZ and MS. The thalamic nuclei groups most affected across conditions were the medial and lateral thalamic groups, while the ventral and intralaminar groups were relatively spared. This pattern of effects largely corresponds with the canonical functional subdivision of the thalamus into higher-order and sensory thalamus. Clinical conditions differed when looking at the level of individual nuclei. The results highlight a role for the higher-order thalamus in common brain disorders and a differential involvement at the level of individual nuclei, contributing towards a mechanistic understanding of pathophysiological alteration in the thalamus.

">Trait reward sensitivity and behavioral motivation shape connectivity between the default mode network and the striatum during reward anticipation</a></h4>

              
                Individuals vary substantially in their responses to rewarding events and their motivation to pursue rewards. The ventral striatum (VS) plays a key role in reward anticipation, and connectivity between the VS and the default mode network (DMN)-a network associated with self-referential and evaluative processes-has been implicated in reward processing. However, the relationship between these neural mechanisms and reward-related individual differences remains unclear. In the present study, we examined how trait reward sensitivity and behavioral motivation shape connectivity between the default mode network (DMN) and the ventral striatum (VS) during reward anticipation. Forty-six participants completed the Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) task while undergoing fMRI, with trial types reflecting varying levels of reward and loss salience. Behavioral measures of motivation were derived from reaction time contrasts between large and neutral trials, and self-reported anhedonia and reward sensitivity were assessed. We found that individuals with higher reward sensitivity exhibited greater striatal connectivity with DMN during reward-salient trials, highlighting the VS's role in incentive processing. However, this relationship was moderated by behavioral motivation. Specifically, in individuals with high behavioral motivation, reward sensitivity was associated with reduced DMN-VS connectivity during reward anticipation. In contrast, for those with lower behavioral motivation, the relationship between reward sensitivity and DMN-VS connectivity was attenuated. These results provide novel insights into the neural correlates of individual differences in reward processing, demonstrating that behavioral motivation is crucial in understanding DMN-striatal interactions during reward anticipation. These findings highlight the importance of considering motivational context when investigating reward-related neural mechanisms.

">Excitatory drive to the globus pallidus external segment facilitates action initiation in non-human primates</a></h4>

              
                The external segment of the globus pallidus (GPe) has conventionally been regarded as a key relay in the indirect pathway of the basal ganglia, primarily mediating movement suppression; however, recent studies in rodents suggest a more complex role, including active facilitation of actions. Therefore, we investigated whether the primate GPe exhibits similar functional diversity by recording single-unit activity in two macaque monkeys performing a sequential choice task. This task separated processes of action initiation and suppression by requiring the monkeys to either accept a good object for reward or reject a bad object using one of multiple strategies. We identified three distinct neuronal clusters based on their firing patterns. Clusters 1 and 2 displayed elevated activity preceding contralateral saccades toward good objects, strongly correlating with shorter reaction times, suggesting a facilitative contribution. In contrast, Clusters 2 and 3 showed decreased activity during rejection of bad objects, reflecting proactive inhibition. Local pharmacological blockade of glutamate receptors within the caudodorsal GPe prolonged saccade latencies and reduced the frequency of rejection saccades, suggesting a causal role for excitatory drive in saccade facilitation. These findings expand the traditional view of the GPe beyond a purely inhibitory station, indicating that in primates it may simultaneously mediate both motor facilitation and proactive suppression. Our results emphasize the importance of characterizing circuit-specific and cell-type-specific roles of the GPe within basal ganglia networks, with implications for normal motor function and movement disorder pathophysiology under complex reward-based decision processes in non-human primates.

">Evidence for an active handoff between cerebral hemispheres during target tracking</a></h4>

              
                The brain has somewhat separate cognitive resources for the left and right sides of our visual field. Despite this lateralization, we have a smooth and unified perception of our environment. This raises the question of how the cerebral hemispheres are coordinated to transfer information between them. We recorded neural activity in the lateral prefrontal cortex, bilaterally, as non-human primates covertly tracked a target that moved from one visual hemifield (i.e., from one hemisphere) to the other. Beta (15 to 30 Hz) power, gamma (30 to 80 Hz) power, and spiking information reflected sensory processing of the target. By contrast, alpha (10 to15 Hz) power, theta (4 to10 Hz) power, and spiking information seemed to reflect an active handoff of attention as target information was transferred between hemispheres. Specifically, alpha power and spiking information ramped up in anticipation of the hemifield cross. Theta power peaked after the cross, signaling its completion. Our results support an active hand-off of information between hemispheres. This handshaking operation may be critical for minimizing information loss, much like how mobile towers handshake when transferring calls between them.

">Opponent regulation of striatal output pathways by dopamine and serotonin</a></h4>

              
                Classic theories propose opponent functions for striatal dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5HT), with DA promoting approach and 5HT promoting patience or avoidance. How these neuromodulators regulate downstream circuits to achieve such antagonistic effects remains mysterious. Here, we mapped striatal 5HT receptor expression and recorded from genetically-identified striatal neurons to demonstrate that DA and 5HT selectively activate distinct populations of striatal neurons to exert opponent control over striatal output.

">How infant brains fold: Sulcal deepening is linked to development of sulcal span, thickness, curvature, and microstructure</a></h4>

              
                Cortical folding begins in utero as sulci emerge and continues postnatally as sulci deepen. However, the timeline and mechanisms underlying postnatal sulcal development remain unknown. Using structural and quantitative magnetic resonance imaging in infants from birth to one year of age, we longitudinally measured macroanatomical and microstructural development in major sulci that emerge in utero between the 16th and 31st gestational weeks. We find that sulci that emerge earlier in utero are deeper at birth and deepen at a slower rate postnatally than later emerging sulci. Sulci also become wider, thicker, and microstructurally denser, while their curvature decreases. Notably, mean sulcal depth is predicted by a weighted sum of sulcal span, thickness, curvature, and tissue microstructure, with differential weights across sulci. Analysis of local depth along the sulcus also reveals that deeper portions of sulci (fundi) have higher curvature and higher microstructural density than the surrounding sulcal walls. These data reveal that postnatal sulcal deepening is nonuniform and depends on the time of emergence in utero, tissue microstructure, and multiple macroanatomical factors. Together, these findings have important ramifications for theories of cortical folding and elucidating neurodevelopmental disorders and delays.

                INTRODUCTION: Dual cognitive-motor impairment in aging is a strong predictor of dementia, yet its effects on vulnerable gray matter regions microstructure remain unexplored. METHODS: This study classified 582 individuals aged 36-90 into cognitive-motor impairment, isolated cognitive or motor impairment, and control groups. Microstructural differences in 27 temporal and motor-related gray matter regions and white matter tracts were assessed using DTI and mean apparent propagator (MAP-MRI), a technique well-suited for gray matter analysis. RESULTS: We found widespread microstructural alterations in gray and white matter among individuals with dual cognitive-motor impairment. These changes were not observed in isolated cognitive or motor impairment after multiple comparisons correction. DISCUSSION: Dual cognitive-motor impairment is associated with reduced cellular density in temporal gray matter, decreased fiber coherence, and potential demyelination in white matter tracts, suggesting widespread microstructural disruption. These findings could help understand brain aging and facilitate interventions to slow neurodegeneration and delay dementia onset.

">Cerebellum instructs plasticity in the mouse primary somatosensory cortex</a></h4>

              
                Sensory experiences map onto distributed neural networks and may activate plasticity processes that in some brain areas are supervised by instructive signals. What remains unknown, however, is if such instructive signals influence plasticity beyond local circuits. Here, we show that optogenetic activation of climbing fibers, which provide instructive signals in cerebellar plasticity, suppresses whisker response potentiation in L2/3 pyramidal cells of the primary somatosensory cortex of mice. Using two-photon imaging and chemogenetics, we find that plasticity is controlled by modulating activity levels of VIP- and SST- positive interneurons. Transsynaptic labeling identifies zona incerta to thalamic posterior medial nucleus projections as the main pathway for cerebellar output reaching cortex. Our findings show that neocortical plasticity is not self-organized but depends on supervision by the olivo-cerebellar system.

                Midbrain organoids are advanced in vitro cellular models for disease modelling. They have been used successfully over the past decade for Parkinsons disease (PD) research and drug development. The three-dimensional structure and multicellular composition allow disease research under more physiological conditions than is possible with conventional 2D cellular models. However, there are concerns in the field regarding the organoid batch-to-batch variability and thus the reproducibility of the results. In this manuscript, we generate multiple independent midbrain organoid batches derived from healthy individuals or GBA-N370S mutation-carrying PD patients to evaluate the reproducibility of the GBA-N370S mutation-associated PD transcriptomic and metabolic signature as well as selected protein abundance. Our analysis shows that GBA-PD-associated phenotypes are reproducible across organoid generation batches and time points. This proves that midbrain organoids are not only suitable for PD in vitro modelling, but also represent robust and highly reproducible cellular models.

">Infralimbic prefrontal cortical projections to the autonomic brainstem: Quantification of inputs to cholinergic and adrenergic/noradrenergic nuclei</a></h4>

              
                The ventromedial prefrontal cortex regulates both emotional and physiological processes. The infralimbic cortex (IL), a prefrontal subregion in rodents, integrates behavioral, neuroendocrine, and autonomic responses to stress. However, the organization of cortical inputs to brainstem nuclei that regulate homeostatic responses are not well defined. We hypothesized that IL projections differentially target pre-ganglionic parasympathetic neurons and adrenergic/noradrenergic nuclei. To quantify IL projections to autonomic brainstem nuclei in male rats, we utilized viral-mediated gene transfer to express yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) in IL glutamatergic neurons. YFP-positive projections to cholinergic and adrenergic/noradrenergic nuclei were then imaged and quantified. Cholinergic neurons were visualized by immunohistochemistry for choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), the enzyme responsible for the synthesis of acetylcholine. Adrenergic/noradrenergic neurons were visualized with immunohistochemistry for dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH) which converts dopamine to norepinephrine. Our results indicate that IL glutamate neurons innervated the cholinergic dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus with greater density than the nucleus ambiguus. Furthermore, numerous DBH-positive cell groups received IL inputs. The greatest density was to the C2 and A2 regions of the nucleus of the solitary tract with intermediate levels of input to A6 locus coeruleus and throughout the C1 and A1 regions of the ventrolateral medulla. Minimal input was present in the pontine A5. Additionally, IL projections targeted the local GABAergic neurons that regulate activity within preautonomic nuclei. Collectively, our results indicate that IL pyramidal neurons project to vagal preganglionic parasympathetic neurons, presympathetic neurons of the ventrolateral medulla, as well as diffuse homeostatic modulators the nucleus of the solitary tract and locus coeruleus. Ultimately, these findings provide a roadmap for determining circuit-level mechanisms for neural control of homeostasis and autonomic balance.

">When Melodies Cue Memories: Electrophysiological Correlates of Autobiographically Salient Music Listening in Older Adults</a></h4>

              
                Autobiographical memory is essential for older adults, providing a foundation for self-identity. Healthy aging is accompanied by changes in memory retrieval. However, musical memory remains relatively preserved, suggesting it may serve as an effective cue for autobiographical memory recall. Autobiographically salient (ABS) music (i.e., deeply encoded songs associated to important people, places, and events) is posited to engage distinct memory processes than familiar (FAM) music (i.e., songs that are recognized but lack personal significance). We tested this in 36 older adults (70.6 +/- 6.6 years, 20 females) who listened to music of varying degrees of personal significance, including ABS, FAM, and unfamiliar (UFAM) music. In Experiment 1, participants pressed a button as quickly as possible when they recognized the excerpt as ABS, FAM, or UFAM. In Experiment 2, we measured event-related potentials and time-frequency responses while participants listened to the same stimuli and rated familiarity and memory at the end of each excerpt. Participants had the fastest reaction times for ABS, followed by FAM, then UFAM music. We observed a sustained evoked response from 2238 to 5000 ms post-stimulus onset that was largest in amplitude for ABS music, compared to FAM and UFAM music, over right frontal-central regions. We also observed less beta power suppression for ABS than FAM music between 1300 and 5000 ms over bilateral frontal-central-parietal areas. Our behavioral and neurophysiological findings show that ABS music is associated with faster and stronger memory-related activity distinct from FAM music.

">Association between Cortical Thickness and Functional Response to Linguistic Processing in the Occipital Cortex of Early Blind Individuals</a></h4>

              
                Blindness has been shown to induce changes in the structural and functional organization of the brain. However, few studies have investigated the relationship between these structural and functional changes. In this study, we examined cortical thickness within occipital regions of interest in 38 early blind individuals and explored its relationship to functional activation during linguistic processing. Participants engaged in tactile Braille reading and auditory processing tasks involving words, pseudowords, and control conditions to assess various aspects of linguistic processing. Linear mixed models revealed a significant association between cortical thickness and functional activation in the occipital cortex during linguistic tasks. Specifically, lower cortical thickness in the middle occipital gyrus, the calcarine sulcus, and the parieto-occipital sulcus were linked to increased activation during orthographic processing in blind participants (Braille pseudowords vs. Braille nonsense-symbols). Similarly, lower cortical thickness in the calcarine sulcus and parieto-occipital sulcus was associated with greater functional activation during phonological processing (auditory pseudowords vs. auditory control). These findings align with prior research suggesting that structural and functional adaptations in the visual cortex of blind individuals may be influenced by developmental mechanisms such as pruning or myelination. This study highlights the interplay between cortical structure and functional reorganization in the blind brain.

">Stroke Shifts Brain Dynamics Toward Criticality: Evidence from Intrinsic Neural Timescales</a></h4>

              
                Stroke induces widespread disruptions to brain function, extending beyond focal lesions to alter the multiscale temporal dynamics that govern neural processing. These dynamics-operating across milliseconds to months-form a hierarchical architecture essential for communication, integration, and adaptive plasticity. While stroke is known to impair local neural activity, its effects on this temporal hierarchy and their consequences for functional recovery remain poorly understood. We conducted a comprehensive investigation of intrinsic neural timescales (INT) in 15 ischemic stroke patients using longitudinal fMRI at five time points over six months, comparing them to age-matched healthy controls. INT quantifies how long neural populations retain information, providing a quantitative measure of fundamental processing dynamics. To further elucidate the mechanistic basis of stroke-induced changes, we performed computational modelling of parsimonious excitable neuronal network dynamics, offering insights into alterations in brain activity from a dynamical systems perspective. Our analyses revealed some key findings: Stroke patients exhibited significantly prolonged INT across multiple cortical regions, indicating slowed temporal dynamics that persisted throughout recovery. The typical hierarchical organization of INT, where sensory areas have shorter timescales than higher-order association areas, was disrupted, particularly in the early post-stroke period. Recovery trajectories diverged at two months post-stroke: patients with poor outcomes maintained abnormally long INT in cognitive control networks (dorsal attention, language, and salience systems), whereas those with better recovery showed progressive normalization toward healthy INT patterns, restoring the brains dynamic balance across multiple timescales. Stroke-induced INT prolongation can be modelled as a critical slowing down driven by a shift in the distance to criticality caused by increased neuronal excitability. Within the framework of criticality, where neural systems operate near the boundary between order and disorder to optimize information processing, stroke-induced changes in neural excitability appear to push brain dynamics toward the critical regime and potentially into a supercritical state. This shift, characterized by excessive temporal persistence and reduced flexibility, may underlie both the observed INT prolongation and its association with poor recovery outcomes. Our findings highlight the importance of temporal dynamics in stroke recovery and suggest that INT may serve as a biomarker for predicting long-term functional outcomes. This perspective provides a novel way to conceptualize stroke-induced changes in brain dynamics, framing them within the broader context of brain self-organization and adaptive processes. By integrating these insights with neurorehabilitation strategies, such as non-invasive brain stimulation, INT could inform targeted interventions to restore neural excitability and intrinsic timescales, thereby improving recovery trajectories.

">Updated neuronal numbers of the rat hippocampal formation: redesigning the hippocampal model.</a></h4>

              
                The hippocampal formation is a functional entity that includes the hippocampus, subicular complex and the entorhinal cortex, and has an essential role in learning and memory, emotional processing and spatial coding. The well-defined structure of hippocampal fields and the segregation of the connections has made this structure a favorite candidate for functional models, that rely on fundamental information such the number of neurons populating the hippocampal fields. Existing models on the rat rely on neuronal populations obtained from single studies, so we aimed to obtain more representative estimates by analyzing all available data. We found 68 studies that overall contained 293 stereological estimates of neuronal numbers. The resulting averages for males showed 1,000,000 neurons for the granule cell layer (GCL); 50,000 for the hilus; 220,000 for CA3; 25,000 for CA2; 350,000 for CA1 and 280,000 for the Subiculum. Entorhinal cortex (EC) averages came from females: 100,000 neurons in layer II and 250,000 in layer III. Most of those estimates are significantly different from those traditionally used in hippocampal models (e.g.: 2-fold difference in EC layer II), revealing a new architecture of the rat hippocampal formation that might help build more realistic models of hippocampal connectivity and function. In addition, analysis of the data by age, sex or strain showed a trend of sexual dimorphism in the number of neurons in the GCL and EC, with higher neuronal number in males. Across strains, Wistar males showed consistently higher number of neurons than Sprague-Dawley. And, unexpectedly, adolescent animals typically showed lower numbers of neurons than adults. Although not statistically significant, those differences by sex, strain or age were consistent across fields, suggesting they might reflect actual biological features.

">Plasticity of interhemispheric motor cortex connectivity induced by brain state-dependent cortico-cortical paired-associative stimulation</a></h4>

              
                Transcallosal connectivity between the hand areas of the two primary motor cortices (M1) is important for coordination of unimanual and bimanual hand motor function. Effective connectivity of this M1-M1 pathway can be tested in the form of short-interval interhemispheric inhibition (SIHI) using dual-coil transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Recently, we and others have demonstrated that the phase of the ongoing sensorimotor -rhythm has significant impact on corticospinal excitability as measured by motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitude, and repetitive TMS of the high-excitability state (trough of the -rhythm) but not other states resulted in long-term potentiation-like MEP increase. Here, we tested to what extent the phase of the ongoing -rhythm in the two M1 cortices affects long-term change in SIHI. In healthy subjects we applied cortico-cortical paired associative stimulation (ccPAS) in four different -phase conditions in the left conditioning M1 and right test M1 (trough-trough, trough-positive peak, positive peak-trough, random phase). We found long-term strengthening of SIHI but no differential effect of phase conditions. Findings point to a distinct regulation of plasticity of corticospinal vs. M1-M1 connectivity. The observed ccPAS-induced strengthening of effective M1-M1 connectivity (SIHI) may be utilized for therapeutic applications that potentially benefit from modification of interhemispheric excitation/inhibition balance.

">Biophysical mechanisms of default mode network function and dysfunction</a></h4>

              
                The default mode network (DMN) plays a fundamental role in internal cognitive function as well as dysfunction across numerous brain disorders. While human and rodent neuroimaging has revealed DMN suppression by salient external stimuli, the cellular mechanisms orchestrating this process remain unknown. Using whole-brain computational modeling informed by neuronal biophysics and retrograde tracer-derived directional mouse brain connectomics, we demonstrate that stimulation of the insula, involved in salience processing, suppresses DMN activity while within-DMN cingulate stimulation enhances it. Manipulating excitatory-inhibitory balance revealed how localized DMN disruptions propagate to cause distinct patterns of network dysfunction, with both reversals and paradoxical enhancements of normal suppression patterns. Brain-wide response analysis uncovered a functionally segregated frontal network and revealed a hierarchical organization with the DMN distinct from frontal regions. These findings provide a unified framework linking cellular mechanisms to large-scale network dynamics and demonstrate how region-specific disruptions might lead to the patterns of DMN dysfunction observed in brain disorders.

However, how age-related changes in effective connectivity within the prefrontoparietal-thalamo-hippocampal circuit affect cognition remains unclear. This study included 143 healthy older adults (60 to 88 yrs) and 124 young adults (18 to 44 yrs), using regression dynamic causal modeling to analyze resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data. Compared to young adults, older adults showed increased reciprocal effective connectivity within the ventromedial prefrontal cortex–lateral thalamic nuclei–right caudal hippocampus circuit. Enhanced bidirectional connectivity was also observed within the frontoparietal network, between the pregenual cingulate gyrus and superior frontal gyrus, and between lateral thalamic nuclei (LTN) and frontal pole. Additionally, heightened connectivity between thalamus and hippocampus negatively correlated with cognitive performance. Our findings reveal significant age-related increases in effective connectivity within the prefrontoparietal-thalamo-hippocampal circuit, linked to cognitive performance levels. Increased connectivity may indicate compensatory mechanisms helping preserve cognitive function in healthy aging. These results advance our understanding of neural dynamics underlying cognitive aging and potential adaptive mechanisms in older adults.</span>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27247?af=R">Effectiveness of Autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation versus Alemtuzumab and Ocrelizumab in Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis: A Single Center Cohort Study</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To compare clinical and radiological outcomes among relapsing multiple sclerosis patients treated with autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT), alemtuzumab (ATZ), and ocrelizumab (OCR).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>From a London (UK) hospital-based observational cohort, modeled data were obtained from 621 relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis patients, who were treated with AHSCT (n = 103), ATZ (n = 204), and OCR (n = 314), and were followed up for 43, 43, and 32 median months, respectively. The annualized relapse rate, new magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) lesions, and disability progression on Expanded Disability Status Scale were assessed.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>AHSCT showed superior efficacy compared with ATZ and OCR. After 5-year follow up, the mean annualized relapse rate (0.026 vs 0.087; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), the risk of relapses (HR 0.29, 95% CI 0.13–0.63; <i>p</i> = 0.002), and of MRI activity (HR 0.33, 95% CI 0.15–0.72; <i>p</i> = 0.006) were significantly lower in AHSCT versus ATZ group. Compared with OCR, after 3-year follow-up AHSCT showed a significantly lower annualized relapse rate (0.028 vs 0.073; <i>p</i> = 0.02) and a trend to reduced risk of relapse (HR 0.45, 95% CI 0.18–1.14; <i>p</i> = 0.09), but similar low rates (6%) of new MRI activity (HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.28–2.67; <i>p</i> = 0.80). In addition, there was a similar risk of Expanded Disability Status Scale progression in AHSCT, and both ATZ (HR 1.19, 95% CI 0.71–2.00; <i>p</i> = 0.50) and OCR (HR 1.08, 95% CI 0.57–2.04; <i>p</i> = 0.82) groups.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>AHSCT was followed by greater prevention of relapses compared with ATZ and OCR, and suppressed more profoundly MRI activity than ATZ, but similarly to OCR, albeit with shorter follow up. The risk of accumulating disability was similar among the treated groups. Studies with larger sample sizes and longer follow up may enable confirmation of these findings or detection of any additional differential effects. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                Bresesti et al. show that the overexpression of miR-342-3p promotes a pro-inflammatory phenotype in macrophages, partially linked to the downregulation of Slc7a11, a cysteine-glutamate antiporter targeted by miR-342-3p. Systemic delivery of lentiviral vectors enforcing miR-342-3p expression to tumor-bearing mice induces a pro-inflammatory phenotype in liver macrophages, reducing liver metastasis growth.

                Metabolic reprogramming and telomere maintenance are hallmarks of cancer. Udutha et al. demonstrate that TERT, which drives telomere maintenance, also upregulates glutathione synthesis in glioblastoma. Targeting glutathione synthesis, however, rewires metabolism to augment nucleotide biosynthesis. Importantly, combined inhibition of glutathione and nucleotide synthesis is synthetically lethal in preclinical glioblastoma models.

                Wang et al. report a diagnostic marker KIF26B for bladder cancer. Mechanistically, KIF26B activates Wnt/β-catenin pathway through maintaining TRAF2 protein stability via OTUB2 and enabling its translocation into nucleus via IPO11. Then, TRAF2 facilitates TCF4/β-catenin complex formation and induces pd-l1 transcription.

                Ku et al. reveal the amplification of antiviral signaling by SLIRP. The innate immune activation results in increased expression and mitochondrial localization of SLIRP. It then stabilizes mt-dsRNAs, which serve as non-self signatures to activate antiviral signaling further. Such regulation is involved in autoimmune disease and defense against viral infection.

                Adaptation in reaching is a fundamental topic in motor neuroscience, yet the origins of error signals driving this process remain unclear. In this study, Inoue and Kitazawa demonstrate that error signals encoded by the parvocellular division of the red nucleus are crucial for driving reaching adaptation.

     alt="Sex and Strain Differences in Analgesic and Hyperlocomotor Effects of Morphine and μ-Opioid Receptor Expression in Mice"/>
<p>Morphine dose-dependently increased analgesia in both CD-1 and C57BL/6 mice, with no observed sex differences. However, C57BL/6 mice of both sexes exhibited greater morphine-induced locomotor activity compared to CD-1 mice. These behavioral differences were paralleled by strain-specific patterns of μ-opioid receptor (MOR) expression: CD-1 mice showed elevated MOR levels in the spinal cord and periaqueductal gray, whereas C57BL/6 mice had increased MOR expression in the caudoputamen.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Sex and gender differences in the analgesic efficacy and side effects of opioids have been widely reported, but their underlying neurobiological mechanisms remain poorly understood. Preclinical animal models are essential tools for investigating these differences and providing insights into the neurobiology of opioid effects. Although studies in rats have revealed sex-specific effects of opioids, the sex-dependent behavioral profiles of opioids in mice, particularly across strains, remain largely unexplored. In this study, we characterized sex and strain differences in the antinociceptive and hyperlocomotor effects of morphine in the two most widely used mouse strains—CD1 and C57BL/6—and quantified regional expression of the μ-opioid receptor (MOR) in key brain and spinal cord regions. Both strains exhibited clear, dose-dependent antinociceptive and hyperlocomotor responses to morphine. While no significant sex or strain differences were observed in antinociceptive effects, C57BL/6 mice displayed significantly greater hyperlocomotor activity than CD1 mice. Western blot analyses revealed strain-specific MOR expression, with CD1 mice showing higher spinal cord and periaqueductal gray MOR levels, particularly in females, while C57BL/6 mice exhibited elevated MOR expression in the caudoputamen. Morphine treatment increased spinal MOR expression in CD1 mice but not C57BL/6, suggesting strain-dependent regulation of MOR. These findings highlight strain-specific behavioral and molecular responses to morphine, emphasizing the importance of strain and sex considerations in preclinical opioid research.</p>

                Meyerolbersleben et al. investigate how the mouse thalamocortical system processes complex visual input through the lens of fast neural oscillations. Local visual features in naturalistic stimuli induce V1 oscillatory bursts with retinotopic, spectral, and laminar specificity, accompanied by translaminar patterns of phase-coupled spiking. This might serve differential and multiplexed visual coding.

                In this study, He et al. find that there is a balance between conventional and unconventional T helper cells and that this influences autoreactive B cell responses. They find that when iNKTfh cells are activated, they limit the expansion of Tfh cells, but the resulting autoreactive B cell response is increased.

                <p>One pending question in social neuroscience is whether interpersonal interactions are processed differently by the brain depending on the bodily characteristics of the interactor, i.e., their physical appearance. To address this issue, we engaged participants in a minimally interactive task with an avatar either showing bodily features or not while recording their brain activity using electroencephalography (EEG) in order to investigate indices of action observation and action monitoring processing. Multivariate results showed that bodily compared with nonbodily appearance modulated parieto-occipital neural patterns throughout the entire duration of the observed movement and that, importantly, such patterns differ from the ones related to initial shape processing. Furthermore, among the electrocortical indices of action monitoring, only the early observational positivity (oPe) was responsive to the bodily appearance of the observed agent under the specific task requirement to predict the partner movement. Taken together, these findings broaden the understanding of how bodily appearance shapes the spatiotemporal processing of an interactor's movements. This holds particular relevance in our modern society, where human&ndash;artificial (virtual or robotic) agent interactions are rapidly becoming ubiquitous.</p>

                Introduction Sharenting involves parents sharing photos, videos, or other information about their children on their social media profiles via online platforms. Research indicated the rising prevalence of parental sharenting behaviour among various countries. Objective The main aim of this article was to explore the role of motivations, perceptions, attitudes, and impression management on parental sharenting behaviours. Methods A systematic review examined empirical studies published from 2019 to 2024 regarding parental motivations, attitudes, perceptions, and impression management associated with sharenting. Relevant studies were identified via Scopus and manual reference searches, with data extraction concentrating on study characteristics, demographics, objectives, design, and principal findings. Findings Parental sharenting is motivated by intrinsic desires, social validation, and impression management, as parents curate content to improve their social image. While children value favourable representations, many object to sharing without consent. Notwithstanding privacy concerns, parents frequently prioritise advantages, raising ethical enquiries regarding children’s autonomy, privacy, and digital identity in digital self-representation. Conclusion Parental sharenting, motivated by emotional satisfaction, social validation, and impression management, frequently neglects privacy risks and ethical considerations. Such practices may compromise children’s autonomy, privacy, and digital identity, resulting in conflicts with their rights. Children’s varied responses underscore these dilemmas, highlighting the necessity of reconciling parental intentions with safeguarding children’s digital futures and overall well-being. Recommendation Parents should engage in mindful sharenting, policymakers must safeguard children’s digital rights, professionals should enhance awareness, and researchers should investigate methods to reconcile parental desires with children’s welfare.
