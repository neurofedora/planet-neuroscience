              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">pubassistant.ch: consolidating publication profiles of researchers [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Online accounts to keep track of scientific publications, such as Open Researcher and Contributor ID (ORCID) or Google Scholar, can be time consuming to maintain and synchronize. Furthermore, the open access status of publications is often not easily accessible, hindering potential opening of closed publications. To lessen the burden of managing personal profiles, we developed a R shiny app that allows publication lists from multiple platforms to be retrieved and consolidated, as well as interactive exploration and comparison of publication profiles. A live version can be found at pubassistant.ch.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Utilizing data sampling techniques on algorithmic fairness for customer churn prediction with data imbalance problems [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Customer churn prediction (CCP) refers to detecting which customers are likely to cancel the services provided by a service provider, for example, internet services. The class imbalance problem (CIP) in machine learning occurs when there is a huge difference in the samples of positive class compared to the negative class. It is one of the major obstacles in CCP as it deteriorates performance in the classification process. Utilizing data sampling techniques (DSTs) helps to resolve the CIP to some extent. Methods: In this paper, we review the effect of using DSTs on algorithmic fairness, i.e., to investigate whether the results pose any discrimination between male and female groups and compare the results before and after using DSTs. Three real-world datasets with unequal balancing rates were prepared and four ubiquitous DSTs were applied to them. Six popular classification techniques were utilized in the classification process. Both classifier’s performance and algorithmic fairness are evaluated with notable metrics. Results: The results indicated that Random Forest classifier outperforms other classifiers in all three datasets and, using SMOTE and ADASYN techniques cause more discrimination in the female group. The rate of unintentional discrimination seems to be higher in the original data of extremely unbalanced datasets under the following classifiers: Logistics Regression, LightGBM, and XGBoost. Conclusions: Algorithmic fairness has become a broadly studied area in recent years, yet there is a very little systematic study on the effect of using DSTs on algorithmic fairness. This study presents important findings to further the use of algorithmic fairness in CCP research.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Integrating augmented reality technology in education: vector personal computer augmented reality [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Educators often face difficulties in explaining abstract concepts such as vectors. During the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, fully online classes have also caused additional challenges to using conventional teaching methods. To explain a vector concept of more than 2 dimensions, visualization becomes a problem. Although Microsoft PowerPoint can integrate animation, the illustration is still in 2-dimensions. Augmented reality (AR) technology is recommended to aid educators and students in teaching-learning vectors, namely via a vector personal computer augmented reality system (VPCAR), to fulfil the demand for tools to support the learning and teaching of vectors. Methods: A PC learning module for vectors was developed in a 3-dimensional coordinate system by using AR technology. Purposive sampling was applied to get feedback from educators and students in Malaysia through an online survey. The supportiveness of using VPCAR based on six items (attractiveness, easiness, visualization, conceptual understanding, inspiration and helpfulness) was recorded on 5-points Likert-type scales. Findings are presented descriptively and graphically. Results: Surprisingly, both students and educators adapted to the new technology easily and provided significant positive feedback that showed a left-skewed and J-shaped distribution for each measurement item, respectively. The distributions were proven significantly different among the students and educators, where supportive level result of educators was higher than students. This study introduced a PC learning module other than mobile apps as students mostly use laptops to attend online class and educators also engage other IT tools in their teaching. Conclusions: Based on these findings, VPCAR provides a good prospect in supporting educators and students during their online teaching-learning process. However, the findings may not be generalizable to all students and educators in Malaysia as purposive sampling was applied. Further studies may focus on government-funded schools using the newly developed VPCAR system, which is the novelty of this study.

	<p>The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is involved in the pathophysiology of many neuropsychiatric disorders. Increased HPA axis activity can be observed during chronic stress, which plays a key role in the pathophysiology of depression. Overactivity of the HPA axis occurs in major depressive disorder (MDD), leading to cognitive dysfunction and reduced mood. There is also a correlation between the HPA axis activation and gut microbiota, which has a significant impact on the development of MDD. It is believed that the gut microbiota can influence the HPA axis function through the activity of cytokines, prostaglandins, or bacterial antigens of various microbial species. The activity of the HPA axis in schizophrenia varies and depends mainly on the severity of the disease. This review summarizes the involvement of the HPA axis in the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric disorders, focusing on major depression and schizophrenia, and highlights a possible correlation between these conditions. Although many effective antidepressants are available, a large proportion of patients do not respond to initial treatment. This review also discusses new therapeutic strategies that affect the HPA axis, such as glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonists, vasopressin V1B receptor antagonists and non-psychoactive CB1 receptor agonists in depression and/or schizophrenia.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Both birds and mammals have relatively large forebrains and cerebella. In mammals, there are extensive sensori-motor projections to the cerebellum through the pontine nuclei originating from several parts of the cerebral cortex. Similar forebrain-to-cerebellum pathways exist in birds but the organization of this circuitry has not been studied extensively. Birds have two nuclei at the base of the brainstem thought to be homologous to the pontine nuclei of mammals, the medial and lateral pontine nuclei (PM, PL). Additionally, birds are unique in that they have a pretectal nucleus called the medial spiriform nucleus (SpM) that, like the pontine nuclei, also receives projections from the forebrain and projects to the oculomotor cerebellum (OCb; folia VI to VIII). The OCb also receives input from the pretectal nucleus lentiformis mesencephali (LM), which analyzes visual optic flow information resulting from self-movement. In this study, we used single or double injections of fluorescent tracers to study the organization of these inputs from PM, PL, SpM and LM to the OCb in pigeons. We found that these inputs follow a zonal organization. The most medial zone in the OCb, zone A1, receives bilateral inputs from the lateral SpM, PL and LM. Zones A2 and C receive a bilateral projection from the medial SpM, and a mostly contralateral projection from PM and LM. We discuss how the pathway to zone A1 processes mainly visuo-motor information to spinal premotor areas, whereas the pathways to zone A2/C processes somato-motor and visuo-motor information and may have a feedback/modulatory role.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Previous Motor Actions Outweigh Sensory Information in Sensorimotor Statistical Learning</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Humans can use their previous experience in form of statistical priors to improve decisions. It is, however, unclear how such priors are learned and represented. Importantly, it has remained elusive whether prior learning is independent of the sensorimotor system involved in the learning process or not, as both modality-specific and modality-general learning have been reported in the past. Here, we used a saccadic eye movement task to probe the learning and representation of a spatial prior across a few trials. In this task, learning occurs in an unsupervised manner and through encountering trial-by-trial visual hints drawn from a distribution centered on the target location. Using a model-comparison approach, we found that participants&rsquo; prior knowledge is largely represented in the form of their previous motor actions, with minimal influence from the previously seen visual hints. By using two different motor contexts for response (looking either at the estimated target location, or exactly opposite to it), we could further compare whether prior experience obtained in one motor context can be transferred to the other. Although learning curves were highly similar, and participants seemed to use the same strategy for both response types, they could not fully transfer their knowledge between contexts, as performance and confidence ratings dropped after a switch of the required response. Together, our results suggest that humans preferably use the internal representations of their previous motor actions, rather than past incoming sensory information, to form statistical sensorimotor priors on the timescale of a few trials.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Task- and Intensity-Dependent Modulation of Arm-Trunk Neural Interactions in the Corticospinal Pathway in Humans</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Most human movements require coordinated activation of multiple muscles. Although many studies reported associations between arm, leg, and trunk muscles during functional tasks, their neural interaction mechanisms still remain unclear. Therefore, the aim of our study was to investigate arm-trunk or arm-leg neural interactions in the corticospinal tract during different arm muscle contractions. Specifically, we examined corticospinal excitability of the erector spinae (ES; trunk extensor), rectus abdominis (RA; trunk flexor), and tibialis anterior (TA; leg) muscles while participants exerted: (1) wrist flexion and (2) wrist extension isometric contraction at various contraction intensity levels ranging from rest to 50% of maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) effort. Corticospinal excitability was assessed using motor evoked potentials (MEPs) elicited through motor cortex transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Results showed that ES MEPs were facilitated even at low contractions (&gt;5% MVC) during wrist flexion and extension, while stronger contractions (&gt;25% MVC) were required to facilitate RA MEPs. The extent of facilitation of ES MEPs depended on contraction intensity of wrist extension, but not flexion. Moreover, TA MEPs were facilitated at low contractions (&gt;5% MVC) during wrist flexion and extension, but contraction intensity dependence was only shown during stronger wrist extension contractions (&gt;25% MVC). In conclusion, trunk extensor corticospinal excitability seems to depend on the task and the intensity of arm contraction, while this is not true for trunk flexor and leg muscles. Our study therefore demonstrated task- and intensity-dependent neural interactions of arm-trunk connections, which may underlie anatomic and/or functional substrates of these muscle pairs.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Somatostatin Interneurons of the Insula Mediate QR2-Dependent Novel Taste Memory Enhancement</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Forming long-term memories is crucial for adaptive behavior and survival in changing environments. The molecular consolidation processes which underlie the formation of these long-term memories are dependent on protein synthesis in excitatory and SST-expressing neurons. A centrally important, parallel process to this involves the removal of the memory constraint quinone reductase 2 (QR2), which has been recently shown to enhance memory consolidation for novel experiences in the cortex and hippocampus, via redox modulation. However, it is unknown within which cell type in the cortex removal of QR2 occurs, nor how this affects neuronal function. Here, we use novel taste learning in the mouse anterior insular cortex (aIC) to show that similarly to mRNA translation, QR2 removal occurs in excitatory and SST-expressing neurons. Interestingly, both novel taste and QR2 inhibition reduce excitability specifically within SST, but not excitatory neurons. Furthermore, reducing QR2 expression in SST, but not in PV or excitatory neurons, is sufficient to enhance taste memory. Thus, QR2 mediated intrinsic property changes of SST interneurons in the aIC is a central removable factor to allow novel taste memory formation. This previously unknown involvement of QR2 and SST interneurons in resetting aIC activity hours following learning, describes a molecular mechanism to define cell circuits for novel information. Therefore, the QR2 pathway in SST interneurons provides a fresh new avenue by which to tackle age-related cognitive deficits, while shedding new light onto the functional machinations of long-term memory formation for novel information.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Transient Oxygen-Glucose Deprivation Causes Region- and Cell Type-Dependent Functional Deficits in the Mouse Hippocampus In Vitro</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Neurons are highly vulnerable to conditions of hypoxia-ischemia (HI) such as stroke or transient ischemic attacks. Recovery of cognitive and behavioral functions requires re-emergence of coordinated network activity, which, in turn, relies on the well-orchestrated interaction of pyramidal cells (PYRs) and interneurons. We therefore modelled HI in the mouse hippocampus, a particularly vulnerable region showing marked loss of PYR and fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs) after hypoxic-ischemic insults. Transient oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) in <I>ex vivo</I> hippocampal slices led to a rapid loss of neuronal activity and spontaneous network oscillations (sharp wave-ripple complexes; SPW-Rs), and to the occurrence of a spreading depolarization. Following reperfusion, both SPW-R and neuronal spiking resumed, but FSI activity remained strongly reduced compared with PYR. Whole-cell recordings in CA1 PYR revealed, however, a similar reduction of both EPSCs and IPSCs, leaving inhibition-excitation (I/E) balance unaltered. At the network level, SPW-R incidence was strongly reduced and the remaining network events showed region-specific changes including reduced ripple energy in CA3 and increased ripple frequency in CA1. Together, our data show that transient hippocampal energy depletion results in severe functional alterations at the cellular and network level. While I/E balance is maintained, synaptic activity, interneuron spiking and coordinated network patterns remain reduced. Such alterations may be network-level correlates of cognitive and functional deficits after cerebral HI.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">The Hedgehog Signaling Pathway is Expressed in the Adult Mouse Hypothalamus and Modulated by Fasting</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The hedgehog signaling pathway is best known for its role in developmental patterning of the neural tube and limb bud. More recently, hedgehog signaling has been recognized for its roles in growth of adult tissues and maintenance of progenitor cell niches. However, the role of hedgehog signaling in fully differentiated cells like neurons in the adult brain is less clear. In mammals, coordination of hedgehog pathway activity relies on primary cilia and patients with ciliopathies such as Bardet&ndash;Biedl and Alstro&#x0308;m syndrome exhibit clinical features clearly attributable to errant hedgehog such as polydactyly. However, these ciliopathies also present with features not clearly associated with hedgehog signaling such as hyperphagia-associated obesity. How hedgehog signaling may contribute to feeding behavior is complex and unclear, but cilia are critical for proper energy homeostasis. Here, we provide a detailed analysis of the expression of core components of the hedgehog signaling pathway in the adult mouse hypothalamus with an emphasis on feeding centers. We show that hedgehog pathway genes continue to be expressed in differentiated neurons important for the regulation of feeding behavior. Furthermore, we demonstrate for the first time that pathway activity is regulated at the transcriptional level by fasting. These data suggest that hedgehog signaling is involved in the proper functioning of brain regions that regulate feeding behavior and that hedgehog pathway dysfunction may play a role in the obesity observed in certain ciliopathies.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Prenatal Androgen Treatment Does Not Alter the Firing Activity of Hypothalamic Arcuate Kisspeptin Neurons in Female Mice</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Neuroendocrine control of reproduction is disrupted in many individuals with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), who present with increased luteinizing hormone (LH), and presumably gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), release frequency, and high androgen levels. Prenatal androgenization (PNA) recapitulates these phenotypes in primates and rodents. Female offspring of mice injected with dihydrotestosterone (DHT) on gestational days 16&ndash;18 exhibit disrupted estrous cyclicity, increased LH and testosterone, and increased GnRH neuron firing rate as adults. PNA also alters the developmental trajectory of GnRH neuron firing rates, markedly blunting the prepubertal peak in firing that occurs in three-week (3wk)-old controls. GnRH neurons do not express detectable androgen receptors and are thus probably not the direct target of DHT. Rather, PNA likely alters GnRH neuronal activity by modulating upstream neurons, such as hypothalamic arcuate neurons co-expressing kisspeptin, neurokinin B (gene Tac2), and dynorphin, also known as KNDy neurons. We hypothesized PNA treatment changes firing rates of KNDy neurons in a similar age-dependent manner as GnRH neurons. We conducted targeted extracellular recordings (0.5&ndash;2 h) of Tac2-identified KNDy neurons from control and PNA mice at 3wks of age and in adulthood. About half of neurons were quiescent (&lt;0.005 Hz). Long-term firing rates of active cells varied, suggestive of episodic activity, but were not different among groups. Short-term burst firing was also similar. We thus reject the hypothesis that PNA alters the firing rate of KNDy neurons. This does not preclude altered neurosecretory output of KNDy neurons, involvement of other neuronal populations, or <I>in vivo</I> networks as critical drivers of altered GnRH firing rates in PNA mice.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Frequency-Dependent Synaptic Dynamics Differentially Tune CA1 and CA2 Pyramidal Neuron Responses to Cortical Input</a></h4>

              
                <p>Entorhinal cortex neurons make monosynaptic connections onto distal apical dendrites of CA1 and CA2 pyramidal neurons through the perforant path (PP) projection. Previous studies show that differences in dendritic properties and synaptic input density enable the PP inputs to produce a much stronger excitation of CA2 compared with CA1 pyramidal neurons. Here, using mice of both sexes, we report that the difference in PP efficacy varies substantially as a function of presynaptic firing rate. Although a single PP stimulus evokes a 5- to 6-fold greater EPSP in CA2 compared with CA1, a brief high-frequency train of PP stimuli evokes a strongly facilitating postsynaptic response in CA1, with relatively little change in CA2. Furthermore, we demonstrate that blockade of NMDARs significantly reduces strong temporal summation in CA1 but has little impact on that in CA2. As a result of the differences in the frequency- and NMDAR-dependent temporal summation, naturalistic patterns of presynaptic activity evoke CA1 and CA2 responses with distinct dynamics, differentially tuning CA1 and CA2 responses to bursts of presynaptic firing versus single presynaptic spikes, respectively.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Recent studies have demonstrated that abundant entorhinal cortical innervation and efficient dendritic propagation enable hippocampal CA2 pyramidal neurons to produce robust excitation evoked by single cortical stimuli, compared with CA1. Here we uncovered, unexpectedly, that the difference in efficacy of cortical excitation varies substantially as a function of presynaptic firing rate. A burst of stimuli evokes a strongly facilitating response in CA1, but not in CA2. As a result, the postsynaptic response of CA1 and CA2 to presynaptic naturalistic firing displays contrasting temporal dynamics, which depends on the activation of NMDARs. Thus, whereas CA2 responds to single stimuli, CA1 is selectively recruited by bursts of cortical input.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Ste20-like Kinase Is Critical for Inhibitory Synapse Maintenance and Its Deficiency Confers a Developmental Dendritopathy</a></h4>

              
                <p>The size and structure of the dendritic arbor play important roles in determining how synaptic inputs of neurons are converted to action potential output. The regulatory mechanisms governing the development of dendrites, however, are insufficiently understood. The evolutionary conserved Ste20/Hippo kinase pathway has been proposed to play an important role in regulating the formation and maintenance of dendritic architecture. A key element of this pathway, Ste20-like kinase (SLK), regulates cytoskeletal dynamics in non-neuronal cells and is strongly expressed throughout neuronal development. However, its function in neurons is unknown. We show that, during development of mouse cortical neurons, SLK has a surprisingly specific role for proper elaboration of higher, &ge; third-order dendrites both in male and in female mice. Moreover, we demonstrate that SLK is required to maintain excitation-inhibition balance. Specifically, SLK knockdown caused a selective loss of inhibitory synapses and functional inhibition after postnatal day 15, whereas excitatory neurotransmission was unaffected. Finally, we show that this mechanism may be relevant for human disease, as dysmorphic neurons within human cortical malformations revealed significant loss of SLK expression. Overall, the present data identify SLK as a key regulator of both dendritic complexity during development and inhibitory synapse maintenance.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We show that dysmorphic neurons of human epileptogenic brain lesions have decreased levels of the Ste20-like kinase (SLK). Decreasing SLK expression in mouse neurons revealed that SLK has essential functions in forming the neuronal dendritic tree and in maintaining inhibitory connections with neighboring neurons.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Climbing Fiber-Mediated Spillover Transmission to Interneurons Is Regulated by EAAT4</a></h4>

              
                <p>Neurotransmitter spillover is a form of communication not readily predicted by anatomic structure. In the cerebellum, glutamate spillover from climbing fibers recruits molecular layer interneurons in the absence of conventional synaptic connections. Spillover-mediated signaling is typically limited by transporters that bind and reuptake glutamate. Here, we show that patterned expression of the excitatory amino acid transporter 4 (EAAT4) in Purkinje cells regulates glutamate spillover to molecular layer interneurons. Using male and female Aldolase C-Venus knock-in mice to visualize zebrin microzones, we find larger climbing fiber-evoked spillover EPSCs in regions with low levels of EAAT4 compared with regions with high EAAT4. This difference is not explained by presynaptic glutamate release properties or postsynaptic receptor density but rather by differences in the glutamate concentration reaching receptors on interneurons. Inhibiting glutamate transport normalizes the differences between microzones, suggesting that heterogeneity in EAAT4 expression is a primary determinant of differential spillover. These results show that neuronal glutamate transporters limit extrasynaptic transmission in a non&ndash;cell-autonomous manner and provide new insight into the functional specialization of cerebellar microzones.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs) help maintain the fidelity and independence of point-to-point synaptic transmission. Whereas glial transporters are critical to maintain low ambient levels of extracellular glutamate to prevent excitotoxicity, neuronal transporters have more subtle roles in shaping excitatory synaptic transmission. Here we show that the patterned expression of neuronal EAAT4 in cerebellar microzones controls glutamate spillover from cerebellar climbing fibers to nearby interneurons. These results contribute to fundamental understanding of neuronal transporter functions and specialization of cerebellar microzones.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) Inactivation Increases Neuronal Network Activity by Enhancing Ca2+ Influx via L-Type Ca2+ Channels</a></h4>

              
                <p>Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a multisystem developmental disorder characterized by hamartomas in various organs, such as the brain, lungs, and kidneys. Epilepsy, along with autism and intellectual disability, is one of the neurologic impairments associated with TSC that has an intimate relationship with developmental outcomes and quality of life. Sustained activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) via <I>TSC1</I> or <I>TSC2</I> mutations is known to be involved in the onset of epilepsy in TSC. However, the mechanism by which mTOR causes seizures remains unknown. In this study, we showed that, human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived <I>TSC2-</I>deficient (<I>TSC2</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup>) neurons exhibited elevated neuronal activity with highly synchronized Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes. Notably, <I>TSC2</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> neurons presented enhanced Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx via L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (LTCCs), which contributed to the abnormal neurite extension and sustained activation of cAMP response element binding protein (CREB), a critical mediator of synaptic plasticity. Expression of Cav1.3, a subtype of LTCCs, was increased in <I>TSC2</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> neurons, but long-term rapamycin treatment suppressed this increase and reversed the altered neuronal activity and neurite extensions. Thus, we identified Cav1.3 LTCC as a critical downstream component of TSC-mTOR signaling that would trigger enhanced neuronal network activity of <I>TSC2</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> neurons. We suggest that LTCCs could be potential novel targets for the treatment of epilepsy in TSC.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> There is a close relationship between elevated mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activity and epilepsy in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). However, the underlying mechanism by which mTOR causes epilepsy remains unknown. In this study, using human <I>TSC2</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> neurons, we identified elevated Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx via L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels as a critical downstream component of TSC-mTOR signaling and a potential cause of both elevated neuronal activity and neurite extension in <I>TSC2</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> neurons. Our findings demonstrate a previously unrecognized connection between sustained mTOR activation and elevated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling via L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels in human TSC neurons, which could cause epilepsy in TSC.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Postmitotic Prox1 Expression Controls the Final Specification of Cortical VIP Interneuron Subtypes</a></h4>

              
                <p>Throughout development, neuronal identity is controlled by key transcription factors that determine the unique properties of a cell. During embryogenesis, the transcription factor Prox1 regulates VIP-positive cortical interneuron migration, survival, and connectivity. Here, we explore the role of Prox1 as a regulator of genetic programs that guide the final specification of VIP interneuron subtypes in early postnatal life. Synaptic <I>in vitro</I> electrophysiology in male and female mice shows that postnatal Prox1 removal differentially affects the dynamics of excitatory inputs onto VIP bipolar and multipolar subtypes. RNA sequencing reveals that one of the downstream targets of Prox1 is the postsynaptic protein Elfn1, a constitutive regulator of presynaptic release probability. Further genetic, pharmacological, and electrophysiological experiments demonstrate that removing Prox1 reduces Elfn1 function in VIP multipolar but not in bipolar cells. Finally, overexpression experiments and analysis of native <I>Elfn1</I> mRNA expression reveal that Elfn1 levels are differentially controlled at the post-transcriptional stage. Thus, in addition to activity-dependent processes that contribute to the developmental trajectory of VIP cells, genetic programs engaged by Prox1 control the final differentiation of multipolar and bipolar subtypes.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The transcription factor Prox1 generates functional diversification of cortical VIP interneuron subtypes in early postnatal life, thus expanding the inhibitory repertoire of the cortex.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Akt Regulates Sox10 Expression to Control Oligodendrocyte Differentiation via Phosphorylating FoxO1</a></h4>

              
                <p>Sox10 is a well known factor to control oligodendrocyte (OL) differentiation, and its expression is regulated by Olig2. As an important protein kinase, Akt has been implicated in diseases with white matter abnormalities. To study whether and how Akt may regulate OL development, we generated OL lineage cell-specific <I>Akt1</I>/<I>Akt2</I>/<I>Akt3</I> triple conditional knock-out (<I>Akt</I> cTKO) mice. Both male and female mice were used. These mutants exhibit a complete loss of mature OLs and unchanged apoptotic cell death in the CNS. We show that the deletion of Akt three isoforms causes downregulation of Sox10 and decreased levels of phosphorylated FoxO1 in the brain. <I>In vitro</I> analysis reveals that the expression of FoxO1 with mutations on phosphorylation sites for Akt significantly represses the <I>Sox10</I> promoter activity, suggesting that phosphorylation of FoxO1 by Akt is important for Sox10 expression. We further demonstrate that mutant FoxO1 without Akt phosphorylation epitopes is enriched in the Sox10 promoter. Together, this study identifies a novel FoxO1 phosphorylation-dependent mechanism for Sox10 expression and OL differentiation.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Dysfunction of Akt is associated with white matter diseases including the agenesis of the corpus callosum. However, it remains unknown whether Akt plays an important role in oligodendrocyte differentiation. To address this question, we generated oligodendrocyte lineage cell-specific <I>Akt1</I>/<I>Akt2</I>/<I>Akt3</I> triple-conditional knock-out mice. Akt mutants exhibit deficient white matter development, loss of mature oligodendrocytes, absence of myelination, and unchanged apoptotic cell death in the CNS. We demonstrate that deletion of Akt three isoforms leads to downregulation of Sox10, and that phosphorylation of FoxO1 by Akt is critical for Sox10 expression. Together, these findings reveal a novel mechanism to regulate Sox10 expression. This study may provide insights into molecular mechanisms for neurodevelopmental diseases caused by dysfunction of protein kinases.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Hypothalamic Glutamate/GABA Cotransmission Modulates Hippocampal Circuits and Supports Long-Term Potentiation</a></h4>

              
                <p>Subcortical input engages in cortico-hippocampal information processing. Neurons of the hypothalamic supramammillary nucleus (SuM) innervate the dentate gyrus (DG) by coreleasing two contrasting fast neurotransmitters, glutamate and GABA, and thereby support spatial navigation and contextual memory. However, the synaptic mechanisms by which SuM neurons regulate the DG activity and synaptic plasticity are not well understood. The DG comprises excitatory granule cells (GCs) as well as inhibitory interneurons (INs). Combining optogenetic, electrophysiological, and pharmacological approaches, we demonstrate that the SuM input differentially regulates the activities of different DG neurons in mice of either sex via distinct synaptic mechanisms. Although SuM activation results in synaptic excitation and inhibition in all postsynaptic cells, the ratio of these two components is variable and cell type-dependent. Specifically, dendrite-targeting INs receive predominantly synaptic excitation, whereas soma-targeting INs and GCs receive primarily synaptic inhibition. Although SuM excitation alone is insufficient to excite GCs, it enhances the GC spiking precision and reduces the latencies in response to excitatory drives. Furthermore, SuM excitation enhances the GC spiking in response to the cortical input, thereby promoting induction of long-term potentiation at cortical-GC synapses. Collectively, these findings provide physiological significance of the cotransmission of glutamate/GABA by SuM neurons in the DG network.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The cortical-hippocampal pathways transfer mnemonic information during memory acquisition and retrieval, whereas subcortical input engages in modulation of communication between the cortex and hippocampus. The supramammillary nucleus (SuM) neurons of the hypothalamus innervate the dentate gyrus (DG) by coreleasing glutamate and GABA onto granule cells (GCs) and interneurons and support memories. However, how the SuM input regulates the activity of various DG cell types and thereby contributes to synaptic plasticity remains unexplored. Combining optogenetic and electrophysiological approaches, we demonstrate that the SuM input differentially regulates DG cell dynamics and consequently enhances GC excitability as well as synaptic plasticity at cortical input-GC synapses. Our findings highlight a significant role of glutamate/GABA cotransmission in regulating the input-output dynamics of DG circuits.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Visual Cortical Area MT Is Required for Development of the Dorsal Stream and Associated Visuomotor Behaviors</a></h4>

              
                <p>The middle temporal (MT) area of the extrastriate visual cortex has long been studied in adulthood for its distinctive physiological properties and function as a part of the dorsal stream, yet interestingly it possesses a similar maturation profile as the primary visual cortex (V1). Here, we examined whether an early-life lesion in MT of marmoset monkeys (six female, two male) altered the dorsal stream development and the behavioral precision of reaching-to-grasp sequences. We observed permanent changes in the anatomy of cortices associated with both reaching (parietal and medial intraparietal areas) and grasping (anterior intraparietal area), as well as in reaching-and-grasping behaviors. In addition, we observed a significant impact on the anatomy of V1 and the direction sensitivity of V1 neurons in the lesion projection zone. These findings indicate that area MT is a crucial node in the development of primate vision, affecting both V1 and areas in the dorsal visual pathway known to mediate visually guided manual behaviors.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Previous studies have identified a role for the MT area of the visual cortex in perceiving motion, yet none have examined its central role in the development of the visual cortex and in the establishment of visuomotor behaviors. To address this, we used a unilateral MT lesion model in neonatal marmosets before examining the anatomic, physiological, and behavioral consequences. In adulthood, we observed perturbations in goal-orientated reach-and-grasp behavior, altered direction selectivity of V1 neurons, and changes in the cytoarchitecture throughout dorsal stream areas. This study highlights the importance of MT as a central node in visual system development and consequential visuomotor activity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Modality-Specific Modulation of Temperature Representations in the Spinal Cord after Injury</a></h4>

              
                <p>Different types of tissue injury, such as inflammatory and neuropathic conditions, cause modality-specific alternations on temperature perception. There are profound changes in peripheral sensory neurons after injury, but how patterned neuronal activities in the CNS encode injury-induced sensitization to temperature stimuli is largely unknown. Using <I>in vivo</I> calcium imaging and mouse genetics, we show that formalin- and prostaglandin E<SUB>2</SUB>-induced inflammation dramatically increase spinal responses to heating and decrease responses to cooling in male and female mice. The reduction of cold response is largely eliminated on ablation of TRPV1-expressing primary sensory neurons, indicating a crossover inhibition of cold response from the hyperactive heat inputs in the spinal cord. Interestingly, chemotherapy medication oxaliplatin can rapidly increase spinal responses to cooling and suppress responses to heating. Together, our results suggest a push&ndash;pull mechanism in processing cold and heat inputs and reveal a synergic mechanism to shift thermosensation after injury.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In this paper, we combine our novel <I>in vivo</I> spinal cord two-photon calcium imaging, mouse genetics, and persistent pain models to study how tissue injury alters the sensation of temperature. We discover modality-specific changes of spinal temperature responses in different models of injury. Chemotherapy medication oxaliplatin leads to cold hypersensitivity and heat hyposensitivity. By contrast, inflammation increases heat sensitivity and decreases cold sensitivity. This decrease in cold sensitivity results from the stronger crossover inhibition from the hyperactive heat inputs. Our work reveals the bidirectional change of thermosensitivity by injury and suggests that the crossover inhibitory circuit underlies the shifted thermosensation, providing a mechanism to the biased perception toward a unique thermal modality that was observed clinically in chronic pain patients.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Dynamic Representation of the Subjective Value of Information</a></h4>

              
                <p>To improve future decisions, people should seek information based on the value of information (VOI), which depends on the current evidence and the reward structure of the upcoming decision. When additional evidence is supplied, people should update the VOI to adjust subsequent information seeking, but the neurocognitive mechanisms of this updating process remain unknown. We used a modified beads task to examine how the VOI is represented and updated in the human brain of both sexes. We theoretically derived, and empirically verified, a normative prediction that the VOI depends on decision evidence and is biased by reward asymmetry. Using fMRI, we found that the subjective VOI is represented in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Critically, this VOI representation was updated when additional evidence was supplied, showing that the DLPFC dynamically tracks the up-to-date VOI over time. These results provide new insights into how humans adaptively seek information in the service of decision-making.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> For adaptive decision-making, people should seek information based on what they currently know and the extent to which additional information could improve the decision outcome, formalized as the VOI. Doing so requires dynamic updating of VOI according to outcome values and newly arriving evidence. We formalize these principles using a normative model and show that information seeking in people adheres to them. Using fMRI, we show that the underlying subjective VOI is represented in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and, critically, that it is updated in real time according to newly arriving evidence. Our results reveal the computational and neural dynamics through which evidence and values are combined to inform constantly evolving information-seeking decisions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Implicit Neurofeedback Training of Feature-Based Attention Promotes Biased Sensory Processing during Integrative Decision-Making</a></h4>

              
                <p>Complex perceptual decisions, in which information must be integrated across multiple sources of evidence, are ubiquitous but are not well understood. Such decisions rely on sensory processing of each individual source of evidence, and are therefore vulnerable to bias if sensory processing resources are disproportionately allocated among visual inputs. To investigate this, we developed an implicit neurofeedback protocol embedded within a complex decision-making task to bias sensory processing in favor of one source of evidence over another. Human participants of both sexes (<I>N</I> = 30) were asked to report the average motion direction across two fields of oriented moving bars. Bars of different orientations flickered at different frequencies, thus inducing steady-state visual evoked potentials. Unbeknownst to participants, neurofeedback was implemented to implicitly reward attention to a specific "trained" orientation (rather than any particular motion direction). As attentional selectivity for this orientation increased, the motion coherence of both fields of bars increased, making the task easier without altering the relative reliability of the two sources of evidence. Critically, these neurofeedback trials were alternated with "test" trials in which motion coherence was not contingent on attentional selectivity, allowing us to assess the training efficacy. The protocol successfully biased sensory processing, resulting in earlier and stronger encoding of the trained evidence source. In turn, this evidence was weighted more heavily in behavioral and neural representations of the integrated average, although the two sources of evidence were always matched in reliability. These results demonstrate how biases in sensory processing can impact integrative decision-making processes.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Many everyday decisions require active integration of different sources of sensory information, such as deciding when it is safe to cross a road, yet little is known about how the brain prioritizes sensory sources in the service of adaptive behavior, or whether such decisions can be altered through learning. Here we addressed these questions using a novel behavioral protocol that provided observers with real-time feedback of their own brain activity patterns in which sensory processing was implicitly biased toward a subset of the available information. We show that, while such biases are a normal and adaptive mechanism for humans to process complex visual information, they can also contribute to suboptimal decision-making.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Dorsal Root Ganglia Macrophages Maintain Osteoarthritis Pain</a></h4>

              
                <p>Pain is the major debilitating symptom of osteoarthritis (OA), which is difficult to treat. In OA patients joint tissue damage only poorly associates with pain, indicating other mechanisms contribute to OA pain. Immune cells regulate the sensory system, but little is known about the involvement of immune cells in OA pain. Here, we report that macrophages accumulate in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) distant from the site of injury in two rodent models of OA. DRG macrophages acquired an M1-like phenotype, and depletion of DRG macrophages resolved OA pain in male and female mice. Sensory neurons innervating the damaged knee joint shape DRG macrophages into an M1-like phenotype. Persisting OA pain, accumulation of DRG macrophages, and programming of DRG macrophages into an M1-like phenotype were independent of Na<SUB>v</SUB>1.8 nociceptors. Inhibition of M1-like macrophages in the DRG by intrathecal injection of an IL4-IL10 fusion protein or M2-like macrophages resolved persistent OA pain. In conclusion, these findings reveal a crucial role for macrophages in maintaining OA pain independent of the joint damage and suggest a new direction to treat OA pain.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> In OA patients pain poorly correlates with joint tissue changes indicating mechanisms other than only tissue damage that cause pain in OA. We identified that DRG containing the somata of sensory neurons innervating the damaged knee are infiltrated with macrophages that are shaped into an M1-like phenotype by sensory neurons. We show that these DRG macrophages actively maintain OA pain remotely and independent of joint damage. The phenotype of these macrophages is crucial for a pain-promoting role. Targeting the phenotype of DRG macrophages with either M2-like macrophages or a cytokine fusion protein that skews macrophages into an M2-like phenotype resolves OA pain. Our work reveals a mechanism that contributes to the maintenance of OA pain distant from the affected knee joint and suggests that dorsal root ganglia macrophages are a target to treat osteoarthritis chronic pain.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">GluN3-Containing NMDA Receptors in the Rat Nucleus Accumbens Core Contribute to Incubation of Cocaine Craving</a></h4>

              
                <p>Cue-induced cocaine craving progressively intensifies (incubates) after withdrawal from cocaine self-administration in rats and humans. In rats, the expression of incubation ultimately depends on Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable AMPARs that accumulate in synapses onto medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the NAc core. However, the delay in their accumulation (~1 month after drug self-administration ceases) suggests earlier waves of plasticity. This prompted us to conduct the first study of NMDAR transmission in NAc core during incubation, focusing on the GluN3 subunit, which confers atypical properties when incorporated into NMDARs, including insensitivity to Mg<sup>2+</sup> block and Ca<sup>2+</sup> impermeability. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were conducted in MSNs of adult male rats 1-68 d after discontinuing extended-access saline or cocaine self-administration. NMDAR transmission was enhanced after 5 d of cocaine withdrawal, and this persisted for at least 68 d of withdrawal. The earliest functional alterations were mediated through increased contributions of GluN2B-containing NMDARs, followed by increased contributions of GluN3-containing NMDARs. As predicted by GluN3-NMDAR incorporation, fewer MSN spines exhibited NMDAR-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry. GluN3A knockdown in NAc core was sufficient to prevent incubation of craving, consistent with biotinylation studies showing increased GluN3A surface expression, although array tomography studies suggested that adaptations involving GluN3B also occur. Collectively, our data show that a complex cascade of NMDAR and AMPAR plasticity occurs in NAc core, potentially through a homeostatic mechanism, leading to persistent increases in cocaine cue reactivity and relapse vulnerability. This is a remarkable example of experience-dependent glutamatergic plasticity evolving over a protracted window in the adult brain.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> "Incubation of craving" is an animal model for the persistence of vulnerability to cue-induced relapse after prolonged drug abstinence. Incubation also occurs in human drug users. AMPAR plasticity in medium spiny neurons (MSNs) of the NAc core is critical for incubation of cocaine craving but occurs only after a delay. Here we found that AMPAR plasticity is preceded by NMDAR plasticity that is essential for incubation and involves GluN3, an atypical NMDAR subunit that markedly alters NMDAR transmission. Together with AMPAR plasticity, this represents profound remodeling of excitatory synaptic transmission onto MSNs. Given the importance of MSNs for translating motivation into action, this plasticity may explain, at least in part, the profound shifts in motivated behavior that characterize addiction.</p>

                Background: Multiple long-term care (LTC) reports have issued similar recommendations for improvement across Canadian LTC homes. Our primary objective was to identify the most common recommendations made over the past 10 years. Our secondary objective was to estimate the total cost of studying LTC issues repeatedly from 1998 to 2020. Methods: The qualitative and cost analyses were conducted in Canada from July to October 2020. Using a list of reports, inquiries and commissions from The Royal Society of Canada Working Group on Long-Term Care, we coded recurrent recommendations in LTC reports. We contacted the sponsoring organizations for a cost estimate, including direct and indirect costs. All costs were adjusted to 2020 Canadian dollar values. Results: Of the 80 Canadian LTC reports spanning the years of 1998 to 2020, 24 (30%) were based on a national level and 56 (70%) were focused on provinces or municipalities. Report length ranged from 4 to 1491 pages and the median number of contributors was 14 (interquartile range, IQR, 5–26) per report. The most common recommendation was to increase funding to LTC to improve staffing, direct care and capacity (67% of reports). A median of 8 (IQR 3.25–18) recommendations were made per report. The total cost for all 80 reports was estimated to be $23,626,442.78. Conclusions: Problems in Canadian LTC homes and their solutions have been known for decades. Despite this, governments and non-governmental agencies continue to produce more reports at a monetary and societal cost to Canadians.

Methods: A virtual classroom was developed in a three-dimensional space, and 10 university students were tested to understand color vision variations.  Results: Most participants noted that the virtual classroom was an excellent educational tool, which could help teachers understand the problems associated with [visual analog scale (VAS): mean ± standard deviation (SD), 9.55 ± 1.57] and obtain a better understanding of (VAS: mean ± SD, 9.04 ± 1.0) color vision variations.  Conclusions: Our results show that this approach enhanced the participants' understanding of color vision variations; thus, it may assist children who suffer from this variation. It is necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of this approach for teachers.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the prevalent inhibitory neurotransmitter in nervous systems promoting sleep in both mammals and insects. In the Madeira cockroach sleep-wake cycles are controlled by a circadian clock network in the brain's optic lobes, centered in the accessory medulla (AME) with its innervating pigment-dispersing factor (PDF) expressing clock neurons at the anterior-ventral rim of the medulla. GABA is present in cell clusters that innervate different circuits of the cockroach's AME clock, without colocalizing in PDF clock neurons. Physiological, immunohistochemical, and behavioral assays provided evidence for a role of GABA in light entrainment, possibly via the distal tract that connects the AME's glomeruli to the medulla. Furthermore, GABA was implemented in clock outputs to multiple effector systems in optic lobe and midbrain. Here, GABAergic brain circuits were analyzed further, focusing on the circadian system in search for sleep/wake controlling brain circuits. Consistently, GABA-immunoreactive neurons of the cockroach brain were also stained with an antiserum against the GABA-synthesizing enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase. We found strong overlap of the distribution of GABA-immunoreactive networks with PDF clock networks in optic lobes and midbrain. Neurons in five of the six soma groups that innervate the clock exhibited GABA immunoreactivity. As predicted, the intensity of GABA immunoreactivity in the distal tract showed daily fluctuations with maximum staining intensity in the middle of the day and weakest staining at the end of the day. Quantification via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and quantitative liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry, likewise, hinted higher GABA levels in the optic lobe during the inactivity phase of the cockroach during the day and lower levels during its activity phase at dusk. Our data further support the hypothesis that light- and PDF-dependently the circadian clock network of the cockroach controls GABA levels and thereby promotes sleep during the day.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">High-integrity human intervention in ecosystems: Tracking self-organization modes</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Yuval R. Zelnik, Yair Mau, Moshe Shachak, Ehud Meron</p>

Humans play major roles in shaping and transforming the ecology of Earth. Unlike natural drivers of ecosystem change, which are erratic and unpredictable, human intervention in ecosystems generally involves planning and management, but often results in detrimental outcomes. Using model studies and aerial-image analysis, we argue that the design of a successful human intervention form calls for the identification of the self-organization modes that drive ecosystem change, and for studying their dynamics. We demonstrate this approach with two examples: grazing management in drought-prone ecosystems, and rehabilitation of degraded vegetation by water harvesting. We show that grazing can increase the resilience to droughts, rather than imposing an additional stress, if managed in a spatially non-uniform manner, and that fragmental restoration along contour bunds is more resilient than the common practice of continuous restoration in vegetation stripes. We conclude by discussing the need for additional studies of self-organization modes and their dynamics.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Genome‐Wide Association Study Identifies First Locus Associated with Susceptibility to Cerebral Venous Thrombosis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) is an uncommon form of stroke affecting mostly young individuals. Although genetic factors are thought to play a role in this cerebrovascular condition, its genetic etiology is not well understood.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A genome-wide association study was performed to identify genetic variants influencing susceptibility to CVT. A 2-stage genome-wide study was undertaken in 882 Europeans diagnosed with CVT and 1,205 ethnicity-matched control subjects divided into discovery and independent replication datasets.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In the overall case–control cohort, we identified highly significant associations with 37 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the 9q34.2 region. The strongest association was with rs8176645 (combined <i>p</i> = 9.15 × 10<sup>−24</sup>; odds ratio [OR] = 2.01, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.76–2.31). The discovery set findings were validated across an independent European cohort. Genetic risk score for this 9q34.2 region increases CVT risk by a pooled estimate OR = 2.65 (95% CI = 2.21–3.20, <i>p</i> = 2.00 × 10<sup>−16</sup>). SNPs within this region were in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) with coding regions of the <i>ABO</i> gene. The <i>ABO</i> blood group was determined using allele combination of SNPs rs8176746 and rs8176645. Blood groups A, B, or AB, were at 2.85 times (95% CI = 2.32–3.52, <i>p</i> = 2.00 × 10<sup>−16</sup>) increased risk of CVT compared with individuals with blood group O.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>We present the first chromosomal region to robustly associate with a genetic susceptibility to CVT. This region more than doubles the likelihood of CVT, a risk greater than any previously identified thrombophilia genetic risk marker. That the identified variant is in strong LD with the coding region of the <i>ABO</i> gene with differences in blood group prevalence provides important new insights into the pathophysiology of CVT.

                Background: Oxidative stress from exercise can contribute to damaging cells, increasing heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) and suppressing the immune system in the body. This research aimed to determine the antioxidant potential of red-fleshed pitaya extract on HSP70 and cortisol expression in rats which were subjected to strenuous exercise. Methods: The subjects of this research were 32 Sprague Dawley male rats, aged 3 months, with an average weight of 200 g. Red-fleshed pitaya extract was obtained from methanol extraction process; a maceration technique was performed and the extract was concentrated using an air-drying method. Rats were randomly divided into four groups. Group 1 were subjected to strenuous exercise and treated with distilled water only; while Groups 2, 3 and 4 were subjected to strenuous exercise and treated with 100 mg/kg body weight, 200 mg/kg body weight and 300 mg/kg body weight of red-fleshed pitaya extract, respectively. Strenuous exercises in rats was performed by intense swimming of 20 min/day, 3 days a week for 3 weeks. HSP70 expression and cortisol were measured with Enzyme-Linked Immune Sorbent Assay (ELISA) method. Results: There was a significant reduction of HSP70 (p=0.000) and cortisol expression (p=0.000) between the groups. Also, there was a significant difference in the average decreasing of HSP70 expression between group 4 and either groups 1 or 2 (p=0.000). However, a significant difference between groups 4 and 3 was not observed (p=0.813). Lastly, a significant difference was found in the average decrease of cortisol expression between groups 4 and 1 (p=0.000), 2 (p=0.000), and 3 (p=0.000) respectively. Conclusion: Red-fleshed pitaya is potential to be utilized as antioxidant to decrease the HSP70 and cortisol expression.

     alt="Sub-second transient activated patterns to sad expressions in major depressive disorders discovered via hidden Markov model"/>
<p>We explored the comprehensive processing framework of negative emotional stimuli in patients with major depressive disorders. With a well-established hidden Markov model, the whole processing was segmented into three dynamic states via brain functions, and temporal–spatial dynamic dysfunction was found during different task stages in depression.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The pathological mechanisms of major depressive disorders (MDDs) is associated with the overexpression of negative emotions, and the fast transient-activated patterns underlying overrepresentation in depression still remain to be revealed to date. We hypothesized that the aberrant spatiotemporal attributes of the process of sad expressions are related to the neuropathology of MDD and help to detect the depression severity. We enrolled a total of 96 subjects including 47 patients with MDD and 49 healthy controls (HCs), and recorded their magnetoencephalography data under a sad expression recognition task. A hidden Markov model (HMM) was applied to separate the whole neural activity into several brain states, then to characterize the dynamics. To find the disrupted temporal–spatial characteristics, power estimations and fractional occupancy (FO) of each state were estimated and contrasted between MDDs and HCs. Three states were found over the period of emotional stimuli processing procedure. The early visual stage (0–270 ms) was mainly manifested by state 1, and the emotional information processing stage (270–600 ms) was manifested by state 2, while the state 3 remained a steady proportion across the whole period. MDDs activated statistically more in limbic system during state 2 (<i>p</i> = 0.0045) and less in frontoparietal control network during state 3 (<i>p =</i> 5.38 × 10<sup>–5</sup>) relative to HCs. Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores were significantly correlated with the predicted disorder severity using FO values (<i>p</i> = 0.0062, <i>r</i> = 0.3933). Relative to HCs, MDDs perceived the sad contents quickly and spent more time overexpressing the negative emotions. These phenomena indicated MDD patients might easily indulge in negative emotion and neglect other things. Furthermore, temporal descriptors built by HMM could be potential biomarkers for identifying the severity of depression disorders.</p>

                Background: Drug resistance and multi drugs tuberculosis (DR/MDR-TB) are associated with patients' low adherence to undergoing complex treatment. Driven by the increasing use and penetration of a smartphone and the End of TB Strategy that seeks for digital health solution, Center for Tropical Medicine Universitas Gadjah Mada has developed TOMO, an Android-based app for improving medication adherence in MDR-TB. Objective: This paper aims to present the sequential steps to develop the app, its general architecture, and its functionalities. Methods: It is a design thinking process involving two MDR-TB referral centers, district health offices, primary health centers, and MDR-TB patients in Central Java and Yogyakarta, Indonesia. We adopted the Principles for Digital Development to develop and design the app. MDR-TB treatment guideline from the Indonesian Ministry of Health was used to develop functionalities of the app for improving adherence.    Results: TOMO app could be used by patients, primary health centers, clinical teams, and case managers. The app prototype features include adverse event records and reports, medication-taking reminders, and communication between the patient and the TB-MDR case manager. We have successfully tested the functionalities based on four use cases: patients with high adherence, patients with low adherence, patients with adverse events, and patients following treatment in the primary health center without any visit to the MDR-TB center.        Conclusion: TOMO app has contributed to the limited body of literature on improving TB-MDR adherence with digital health intervention, especially using a health app. The app has been tested using four scenarios. We will follow up with usability testing before implementing the app in a real setting.

                Introduction: Serologic studies are crucial for clarifying the regional dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus pandemic as well as the success of a vaccination campaign against COVID-19. We describe a cohort study investigating the seroprevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in Magdeburg (Saxony-Anhalt, Germany). Protocol and study design: The SeMaCo study (Serologische Untersuchungen bei Blutspendern des Großraums Magdeburg auf Antikörper gegen SARS-CoV-2) is a longitudinal, regional cohort study to assess the seroprevalence of COVID-19 in blood donors from Magdeburg (Capital of Saxony-Anhalt) and surrounding areas. We consider blood donors as a surrogate for the healthy, working-age population of Saxony-Anhalt. The study primarily aims to measure the prevalence and kinetics of IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in first time and repeat blood donors over a period of 21 months. The study explores four survey periods of three to four months each (January–April 21, July–October 21, February–April 22, July–October 22). At each visit, we will assess the attitude towards vaccination, the antibody response following vaccination, as well as undesired vaccination effects. Furthermore, we will collect data on occupational activities, housing conditions and the frequency of family and other social contacts. Discussion: The SeMaCo study extends the spectrum of seroepidemiological investigations in Germany. A longitudinal observation with repeated testing and serial interviews can provide a more accurate view on the dynamics of COVID-19 prevalence and spread than repeated cross-sectional studies. Based on interim results from similar studies, we expect a seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies below 5% in the first survey period. SeMaCo will influence policy decisions and preventative measures.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10969861/most-recent">Running exercise protects spinophilin‐immunoreactive puncta and neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex of APP/PS1 transgenic mice</a></h4>

              
                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is thought to be closely associated with emotional processes, decision making and memory. Previous studies have identified the prefrontal cortex (PFC) as one of the most vulnerable brain regions in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Running exercise has widely been recognized as a simple and effective method of physical activity that enhances brain function and slows the progression of AD. However, the effect of exercise on the mPFC of AD is unclear. To address these issues, we investigated the effects of four months of exercise on the numbers of spinophilin-immunoreactive puncta and neurons in the mPFC of 12-month-old APPswe/PSEN1dE9 (APP/PS1) transgenic AD model mice using stereological methods. The spatial learning and memory abilities of mice were tested using the Morris water maze. Four months of running exercise delayed declines in spatial learning and memory abilities. The stereological results showed significantly lower numbers of spinophilin-immunoreactive puncta and neurons in the mPFC of APP/PS1 mice than in the wild-type (WT) control group. The numbers of spinophilin-immunoreactive puncta and neurons in the mPFC of running APP/PS1 mice were significantly greater than those in the APP/PS1 control mice. In addition, running-induced improvements in spatial learning and memory were significantly associated with running-induced increases in spinophilin-immunoreactive puncta and neurons numbers in the mPFC. Running exercise could delay the loss of spinophilin-immunoreactive puncta and neurons in the mPFC of APP/PS1 mice. This finding might provide an important structural basis for exercise-induced improvements in the spatial learning and memory abilities of individuals with AD.</p>

                The coronavirus Nsp1 protein binds the 40S ribosomal subunit to induce host translational suppression and mRNA cleavage. Mendez et al. reveal that mutation of specific residues in the Nsp1 N-terminus destabilizes its interaction with the 40S subunit and eliminates protection of viral leader sequence-containing transcripts from translational repression.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Quantitative proteomics reveals the selectivity of ubiquitin-binding autophagy receptors in the turnover of damaged lysosomes by lysophagy</a></h4>

              
                Removal of damaged organelles via the process of selective autophagy constitutes a major form of cellular quality control. Damaged organelles are recognized by a dedicated surveillance machinery, leading to the assembly of an autophagosome around the damaged organelle, prior to fusion with the degradative lysosomal compartment. Lysosomes themselves are also prone to damage and are degraded through the process of lysophagy. While early steps involve recognition of ruptured lysosomal membranes by glycan-binding Galectins and ubiquitylation of transmembrane lysosomal proteins, many steps in the process, and their inter-relationships, remain poorly understood, including the role and identity of cargo receptors required for completion of lysophagy. Here, we employ quantitative organelle capture and proximity biotinylation proteomics of autophagy adaptors, cargo receptors, and Galectins in response to acute lysosomal damage, thereby revealing the landscape of lysosome-associated proteome remodeling during lysophagy. Among proteins dynamically recruited to damaged lysosomes were ubiquitin-binding autophagic cargo receptors. Using newly developed lysophagic flux reporters including Lyso-Keima, we demonstrate that TAX1BP1, together with its associated kinase TBK1, are both necessary and sufficient to promote lysophagic flux in both HeLa cells and induced neurons (iNeurons). While the related receptor OPTN can drive damage-dependent lysophagy when overexpressed, cells lacking either OPTN or CALCOCO2 still maintain significant lysophagic flux in HeLa cells. Mechanistically, TAX1BP1-driven lysophagy requires its N-terminal SKICH domain, which binds both TBK1 and the autophagy regulatory factor RB1CC1, and requires upstream ubiquitylation events for efficient recruitment and lysophagic flux. These results identify TAX1BP1 as a central component in the lysophagy pathway and provide a proteomic resource for future studies of the lysophagy process.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A morphological transformation in respiratory syncytial virus leads to enhanced complement deposition</a></h4>

              
                The complement system is a critical host defense against infection, playing a protective role that can also enhance disease if dysregulated. Although many consequences of complement activation during viral infection are well established, mechanisms that determine the extent to which viruses activate complement remain elusive. Here, we investigate complement activation by human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a filamentous respiratory pathogen that causes significant morbidity and mortality. By engineering a strain of RSV harboring tags on the surface glycoproteins F and G, we are able to monitor opsonization of single RSV particles using fluorescence microscopy. These experiments reveal an antigenic hierarchy, where antibodies that bind toward the apex of F in either the pre- or postfusion conformation activate the classical pathway whereas other antibodies do not. Additionally, we identify an important role for virus morphology in complement activation: as viral filaments age, they undergo a morphological transformation which lowers the threshold for complement deposition through changes in surface curvature. Collectively, these results identify antigenic and biophysical characteristics of virus particles that contribute to the formation of viral immune complexes, and suggest models for how these factors may shape disease severity and adaptive immune responses to RSV.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Total parasite biomass but not peripheral parasitaemia is associated with endothelial and haematological perturbations in Plasmodium vivax patients</a></h4>

              
                <i>Plasmodium vivax</i> is the major cause of human malaria in the Americas. How <i>P. vivax</i> infection can lead to poor clinical outcomes, despite low peripheral parasitaemia remains a matter of intense debate. Estimation of total <i>P. vivax</i> biomass based on circulating markers indicates existence of a predominant parasite population outside of circulation. In this study we investigate associations between both peripheral and total parasite biomass and host response in vivax malaria. We analysed parasite and host signatures in a cohort of uncomplicated vivax malaria patients from Manaus, Brazil, combining clinical and parasite parameters, multiplexed analysis of host responses and <i>ex vivo</i> assays. Patterns of clinical features, parasite burden and host signatures measured in plasma across the patient cohort were highly heterogenous. Further data deconvolution revealed two patient clusters, here termed Vivax<sup>low</sup> and Vivax<sup>high</sup>. These patient subgroups were defined based on differences in total parasite biomass but not peripheral parasitaemia. Overall Vivax<sup>low</sup> patients clustered with healthy donors and Vivax<sup>high</sup> patients showed more profound alterations in haematological parameters, endothelial cell (EC) activation and glycocalyx breakdown and levels of cytokines regulating different haematopoiesis pathways compared to Vivax<sup>low</sup>. Vivax<sup>high</sup> patients presented more severe thrombocytopenia and lymphopenia, along with enrichment of neutrophils in the peripheral blood and increased neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLCR). When patients' signatures were combined, high association of total parasite biomass with a subset of markers of EC activation, thrombocytopenia and lymphopenia severity was observed. Finally, machine learning models defined a combination of host parameters measured in the circulation that could predict the extent of parasite infection outside of circulation. Altogether, our data show that total parasite biomass is a better predictor of perturbations in host homeostasis in <i>P. vivax</i> patients than peripheral parasitaemia. This supports the emerging paradigm of a <i>P. vivax </i>tissue reservoir, in particular in the hematopoietic niche of bone marrow and spleen.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">APOE4 is associated with elevated blood lipids and lower levels of innate immune biomarkers in a tropical Amerindian subsistence population</a></h4>

              
                In post-industrial settings, apolipoprotein <i>E4</i> (<i>APOE4</i>) is associated with increased cardiovascular and neurological disease risk. However, the majority of human evolutionary history occurred in environments with higher pathogenic diversity and low cardiovascular risk. We hypothesize that in high-pathogen and energy-limited contexts, the <i>APOE4</i> allele confers benefits by reducing innate inflammation when uninfected, while maintaining higher lipid levels that buffer costs of immune activation during infection. Among Tsimane forager-farmers of Bolivia (<i>N</i> = 1266, 50% female), <i>APOE4</i> is associated with 30% lower C-reactive protein, and higher total cholesterol and oxidized LDL. Blood lipids were either not associated, or negatively associated with inflammatory biomarkers, except for associations of oxidized LDL and inflammation which were limited to obese adults. Further, <i>APOE4</i> carriers maintain higher levels of total and LDL cholesterol at low body mass indices (BMIs). These results suggest that the relationship between <i>APOE4</i> and lipids may be beneficial for pathogen-driven immune responses and unlikely to increase cardiovascular risk in an active subsistence population.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Profiling sensory neuron microenvironment after peripheral and central axon injury reveals key pathways for neural repair</a></h4>

              
                Sensory neurons with cell bodies in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) represent a useful model to study axon regeneration. Whereas regeneration and functional recovery occurs after peripheral nerve injury, spinal cord injury or dorsal root injury is not followed by regenerative outcomes. Regeneration of sensory axons in peripheral nerves is not entirely cell autonomous. Whether the DRG microenvironment influences the different regenerative capacities after injury to peripheral or central axons remains largely unknown. To answer this question, we performed a single-cell transcriptional profiling of mouse DRG in response to peripheral (sciatic nerve crush) and central axon injuries (dorsal root crush and spinal cord injury). Each cell type responded differently to the three types of injuries. All injuries increased the proportion of a cell type that shares features of both immune cells and glial cells. A distinct subset of satellite glial cells (SGC) appeared specifically in response to peripheral nerve injury. Activation of the PPARα signaling pathway in SGC, which promotes axon regeneration after peripheral nerve injury, failed to occur after central axon injuries. Treatment with the FDA-approved PPARα agonist fenofibrate increased axon regeneration after dorsal root injury. This study provides a map of the distinct DRG microenvironment responses to peripheral and central injuries at the single-cell level and highlights that manipulating non-neuronal cells could lead to avenues to promote functional recovery after CNS injuries or disease.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Phosphorylation of luminal region of the SUN-domain protein Mps3 promotes nuclear envelope localization during meiosis</a></h4>

              
                During meiosis, protein ensembles in the nuclear envelope (NE) containing SUN- and KASH-domain proteins, called linker nucleocytoskeleton and cytoskeleton (LINC) complex, promote the chromosome motion. Yeast SUN-domain protein, Mps3, forms multiple meiosis-specific ensembles on NE, which show dynamic localisation for chromosome motion; however, the mechanism by which these Mps3 ensembles are formed during meiosis remains largely unknown. Here, we showed that the cyclin-dependent protein kinase (CDK) and Dbf4-dependent Cdc7 protein kinase (DDK) regulate meiosis-specific dynamics of Mps3 on NE, particularly by mediating the resolution of Mps3 clusters and telomere clustering. We also found that the luminal region of Mps3 juxtaposed to the inner nuclear membrane is required for meiosis-specific localisation of Mps3 on NE. Negative charges introduced by meiosis-specific phosphorylation in the luminal region of Mps3 alter its interaction with negatively charged lipids by electric repulsion in reconstituted liposomes. Phospho-mimetic substitution in the luminal region suppresses the localisation of Mps3 via the inactivation of CDK or DDK. Our study revealed multi-layered phosphorylation-dependent regulation of the localisation of Mps3 on NE for meiotic chromosome motion and NE remodelling.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Neural basis for regulation of vasopressin secretion by anticipated disturbances in osmolality</a></h4>

              
                Water balance, tracked by extracellular osmolality, is regulated by feedback and feedforward mechanisms. Feedback regulation is reactive, occurring as deviations in osmolality are <i>detected</i>. Feedforward or presystemic regulation is proactive, occurring when disturbances in osmolality are <i>anticipated</i>. Vasopressin (AVP) is a key hormone regulating water balance and is released during hyperosmolality to limit renal water excretion. AVP neurons are under feedback and feedforward regulation. Not only do they respond to disturbances in blood osmolality, but they are also rapidly suppressed and stimulated, respectively, by drinking and eating, which will ultimately decrease and increase osmolality. Here, we demonstrate that AVP neuron activity is regulated by multiple anatomically- and functionally-distinct neural circuits. Notably, presystemic regulation during drinking and eating are mediated by non-overlapping circuits that involve the lamina terminalis and hypothalamic arcuate nucleus, respectively. These findings reveal neural mechanisms that support differential regulation of AVP release by diverse behavioral and physiological stimuli.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">mRNA vaccination in people over 80 years of age induces strong humoral immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 with cross neutralisation of P.1 Brazilian variant</a></h4>

              
                Age is the major risk factor for mortality after SARS-CoV-2 infection and older people have received priority consideration for COVID-19 vaccination. However vaccine responses are often suboptimal in this age group and few people over the age of 80 years were included in vaccine registration trials. We determined the serological and cellular response to spike protein in 100 people aged 80-96 years at 2 weeks after second vaccination with the Pfizer BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine. Antibody responses were seen in every donor with high titres in 98%. Spike-specific cellular immune responses were detectable in only 63% and correlated with humoral response. Previous SARS-CoV-2 infection substantially increased antibody responses after one vaccine and antibody and cellular responses remained 28-fold and 3-fold higher respectively after dual vaccination. Post-vaccine sera mediated strong neutralisation of live Victoria infection and although neutralisation titres were reduced 14-fold against the P.1 variant first discovered in Brazil they remained largely effective. These data demonstrate that the mRNA vaccine platform delivers strong humoral immunity in people up to 96 years of age and retains broad efficacy against the P.1 Variant of Concern.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Differentiation of mouse fetal lung alveolar progenitors in serum-free organotypic cultures</a></h4>

              
                Lung epithelial progenitors differentiate into alveolar type 1 (AT1) and type 2 (AT2) cells. These cells form the air-blood interface and secrete surfactant, respectively, and are essential for lung maturation and function. Current protocols to derive and culture alveolar cells do not faithfully recapitulate the architecture of the distal lung, which influences cell fate patterns in vivo. Here, we report serum-free conditions that allow for growth and differentiation of mouse distal lung epithelial progenitors. We find that Collagen I promotes the differentiation of flattened, polarized AT1 cells. Using these organoids, we performed a chemical screen to investigate WNT signaling in epithelial differentiation. We identify an association between Casein Kinase activity and maintenance of an AT2 expression signature; Casein Kinase inhibition leads to an increase in AT1/progenitor cell ratio. These organoids provide a simplified model of alveolar differentiation and constitute a scalable screening platform to identify and analyze cell differentiation mechanisms.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">3'HS1 CTCF binding site in human β-globin locus regulates fetal hemoglobin expression</a></h4>

              
                Mutations in the adult β-globin gene can lead to a variety of hemoglobinopathies, including sickle cell disease and β-thalassemia. An increase in fetal hemoglobin expression throughout adulthood, a condition named Hereditary Persistence of Fetal Hemoglobin (HPFH), has been found to ameliorate hemoglobinopathies. Deletional HPFH occurs through the excision of a significant portion of the 3' end of the β-globin locus, including a CTCF binding site termed 3'HS1. Here, we show that the deletion of this CTCF site alone induces fetal hemoglobin expression in both adult CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and HUDEP-2 erythroid progenitor cells. This induction is driven by the ectopic access of a previously postulated distal enhancer located in the <i>OR52A1</i> gene downstream of the locus, which can also be insulated by the inversion of the 3'HS1 CTCF site. This suggests that genetic editing of this binding site can have therapeutic implications to treat hemoglobinopathies.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Exposure to landscape fire smoke reduced birthweight in low- and middle-income countries: findings from a siblings-matched case-control study</a></h4>

              
                Landscape fire smoke (LFS) has been associated with reduced birthweight, but evidence from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is rare. Here, we present a sibling-matched case-control study of 227,948 newborns to identify an association between fire-sourced fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) and birthweight in 54 LMICs from 2000 to 2014. We selected mothers from the geocoded Demographic and Health Survey with at least two children and valid birthweight records. Newborns affiliated with the same mother were defined as a family group. Gestational exposure to LFS was assessed in each newborn using the concentration of fire-sourced PM<sub>2.5</sub>. We determined the associations of the within-group variations in LFS exposure with birthweight differences between matched siblings using a fixed-effects regression model. Additionally, we analyzed the binary outcomes of low birthweight (LBW) or very low birthweight (VLBW). According to fully adjusted models, a 1 µg/m<sup>3</sup> increase in the concentration of fire-sourced PM<sub>2.5</sub> was significantly associated with a 2.17 g (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.56-3.77) reduction in birthweight, a 2.80% (95% CI: 0.97-4.66) increase in LBW risk, and an 11.68% (95% CI: 3.59-20.40) increase in VLBW risk. Our findings indicate that gestational exposure to LFS harms fetal health.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Autonomous clocks that regulate organelle biogenesis, cytoskeletal organization, and intracellular dynamics</a></h4>

              
                How do cells perceive time? Do cells use temporal information to regulate the production/degradation of their enzymes, membranes, and organelles? Does controlling biological time influence cytoskeletal organization and cellular architecture in ways that confer evolutionary and physiological advantages? Potential answers to these fundamental questions of cell biology have historically revolved around the discussion of ‘master’ temporal programs, such as the principal cyclin-dependent kinase/cyclin cell division oscillator and the circadian clock. In this review, we provide an overview of the recent evidence supporting an emerging concept of ‘autonomous clocks,’ which under normal conditions can be <i>entrained</i> by the cell cycle and/or the circadian clock to run at their pace, but can also run independently to serve their functions if/when these major temporal programs are halted/abrupted. We begin the discussion by introducing recent developments in the study of such clocks and their roles at different scales and complexities. We then use current advances to elucidate the logic and molecular architecture of temporal networks that comprise autonomous clocks, providing important clues as to how these clocks may have evolved to run independently and, sometimes at the cost of redundancy, have strongly coupled to run under the full command of the cell cycle and/or the circadian clock. Next, we review a list of important recent findings that have shed new light onto potential hallmarks of autonomous clocks, suggestive of prospective theoretical and experimental approaches to further accelerate their discovery. Finally, we discuss their roles in health and disease, as well as possible therapeutic opportunities that targeting the autonomous clocks may offer.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Lying in a 3T MRI scanner induces neglect-like spatial attention bias</a></h4>

              
                The static magnetic field of MRI scanners can induce a magneto-hydrodynamic stimulation of the vestibular organ (MVS). In common fMRI settings, this MVS effect leads to a vestibular ocular reflex (VOR). We asked whether – beyond inducing a VOR – putting a healthy subject in a 3T MRI scanner would also alter goal-directed spatial behavior, as is known from other types of vestibular stimulation. We investigated 17 healthy volunteers, all of which exhibited a rightward VOR inside the MRI-scanner as compared to outside-MRI conditions. More importantly, when probing the distribution of overt spatial attention inside the MRI using a visual search task, subjects scanned a region of space that was significantly shifted toward the right. An additional estimate of subjective straight-ahead orientation likewise exhibited a rightward shift. Hence, putting subjects in a 3T MRI-scanner elicits MVS-induced horizontal biases of spatial orienting and exploration, which closely mimic that of stroke patients with spatial neglect.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Competitive binding of MatP and topoisomerase IV to the MukB hinge domain</a></h4>

              
                Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes (SMC) complexes have ubiquitous roles in compacting DNA linearly, thereby promoting chromosome organization-segregation. Interaction between the <i>Escherichia coli</i> SMC complex, MukBEF, and <i>matS</i>-bound MatP in the chromosome replication termination region, <i>ter</i>, results in depletion of MukBEF from <i>ter</i>, a process essential for efficient daughter chromosome individualisation and for preferential association of MukBEF with the replication origin region. Chromosome-associated MukBEF complexes also interact with topoisomerase IV (ParC<sub>2</sub>E<sub>2</sub>), so that their chromosome distribution mirrors that of MukBEF. We demonstrate that MatP and ParC have an overlapping binding interface on the MukB hinge, leading to their mutually exclusive binding, which occurs with the same dimer to dimer stoichiometry. Furthermore, we show that <i>matS</i> DNA competes with the MukB hinge for MatP binding. Cells expressing MukBEF complexes that are mutated at the ParC/MatP binding interface are impaired in ParC binding and have a mild defect in MukBEF function. The data highlight competitive binding as a means of globally regulating MukBEF-topoisomerase IV activity in space and time.

                BACKGROUND: Synucleinopathies are a group of neurodegenerative disorders that are pathologically characterized by the accumulation of protein aggregates called Lewy Bodies. Lewy bodies are primarily composed of -synuclein (asyn) protein, which is phosphorylated at serine 129 (pS129) when aggregated. Currently available commercial antibodies used to stain for pS129 asyn can cross react with other proteins, thus making it difficult to specifically detect endogenous pS129 asyn and to interpret pS129 asyn staining. OBJECTIVE: To develop a staining procedure that detects pS129 asyn with high specificity and low background. METHODS: We use the fluorescent and brightfield in situ Proximity Ligation Assay (PLA) to specifically detect pS129 asyn in cell culture, mouse brain sections, and fixed human brain tissue. RESULTS: The pS129 asyn PLA specifically stained for endogenous, soluble pS129 asyn in cell culture, mouse brain sections, and human brain tissue without significant cross-reactivity or background signal. CONCLUSIONS: This PLA method can be used to specifically detect pS129 asyn in order to further explore and understand its role in health and disease.

                Although much is known about how single neurons in the hippocampus represent an animal's position, how cell-cell interactions contribute to spatial coding remains poorly understood. Using a novel statistical estimator and theoretical modeling, both developed in the framework of maximum entropy models, we reveal highly structured cell-to-cell interactions whose statistics depend on familiar vs. novel environment. In both conditions the circuit interactions optimize the encoding of spatial information, but for regimes that differ in the signal-to-noise ratio of their spatial inputs. Moreover, the topology of the interactions facilitates linear decodability, making the information easy to read out by downstream circuits. These findings suggest that the efficient coding hypothesis is not applicable only to individual neuron properties in the sensory periphery, but also to neural interactions in the central brain.

The majority of cerebellar enhancers have dynamic activity between embryonic and postnatal development. Cerebellar enhancers were enriched for neural transcription factor binding sites with temporally specific expression. Putative gene targets displayed spatially restricted expression patterns, indicating cell-type specific expression regulation. Functional analysis of target genes indicated that enhancers regulate processes spanning several developmental epochs such as specification, differentiation and maturation. We use these analyses to discover one novel regulator and one novel marker of cerebellar development: Bhlhe22 and Pax3, respectively. We identified an enrichment of de novo mutations and variants associated with autism spectrum disorder in cerebellar enhancers. Our study provides insight into the dynamics of gene expression regulation by enhancers in the developing brain and delivers a rich resource of novel gene-enhancer associations providing a basis for future in-depth studies in the cerebellum.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Mapping Spatial Frequency Preferences Across Human Primary Visual Cortex</a></h4>

              
                Neurons in primate visual cortex (area V1) are tuned for spatial frequency, in a manner that depends on their position in the visual field. Several studies have examined this dependency using fMRI, reporting preferred spatial frequencies (tuning curve peaks) of V1 voxels as a function of eccentricity, but their results differ by as much as two octaves, presumably due to differences in stimuli, measurements, and analysis methodology. Here, we characterize spatial frequency tuning at a millimeter resolution within human primary visual cortex, across stimulus orientation and visual field locations. We measured fMRI responses to a novel set of stimuli, constructed as sinusoidal gratings in log-polar coordinates, which include circular, radial, and spiral geometries. For each individual stimulus, the local spatial frequency varies inversely with eccentricity, and for any given location in the visual field, the full set of stimuli span a broad range of spatial frequencies and orientations. Over the measured range of eccentricities, the preferred spatial frequency is well-fit by a function that varies as the inverse of the eccentricity plus a small constant. We also find small but systematic effects of local stimulus orientation, defined in both absolute coordinates and relative to visual field location. Specifically, peak spatial frequency is higher for tangential than radial orientations and for horizontal than vertical orientations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Blind cavefish retain functional connectivity in the tectum despite loss of retinal input</a></h4>

              
                Sensory systems display remarkable plasticity and are under strong evolutionary selection. The Mexican cavefish, Astyanax mexicanus, consists of eyed river-dwelling surface populations, and multiple independent cave populations which have converged on eye loss, providing the opportunity to examine the evolution of sensory circuits in response to environmental perturbation. Functional analysis across multiple transgenic populations expressing GCaMP6s showed the total activity and predicted functional connectivity of the optic tectum largely did not differ between populations, revealing the maintenance of neural connectivity in the absence of retinal inputs. The correlation between activity events in the tectum revealed the selective loss of negatively correlated activity in cavefish that are suggestive of differences in selective pressure on excitatory and inhibitory connections within the tectum. Further, analysis of surface-cave hybrid fish reveals that changes in the tectum are genetically distinct from those encoding eye-loss. Together, these findings uncover the independent evolution of multiple components of the visual system and establish the use of functional imaging in A. mexicanus to study neural circuit evolution.

                Lip movements facilitate speech comprehension, especially under adverse listening conditions, but the neural mechanisms of this perceptual benefit at the phonemic and feature levels remain unclear. This fMRI study addresses this question by quantifying regional multivariate representation and network organization underlying audiovisual speech-in-noise perception. We found that valid lip movements enhanced neural representations of phoneme, place of articulation, or voicing feature of speech differentially in dorsal stream regions, including frontal speech motor areas and supramarginal gyrus. Such local changes were accompanied by strengthened dorsal stream effective connectivity. Moreover, the neurite orientation dispersion of left arcuate fasciculus, a structural basis of speech dorsal stream, predicted the visual enhancements of neural representations and effective connectivity. Our findings provide novel insight to speech science that lip movements promote both local phonemic and feature encoding and network connectivity in speech dorsal pathway and the functional enhancement is mediated by the microstructural architecture of the circuit.

	<p>During the COVID-19 pandemic and the related lockdowns, outpatient follow-up visits for patients with chronic neurological diseases have been suspended. Managing people affected by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) has become highly complicated, leaving patients without the standard multidisciplinary follow-up. This study aimed to analyze the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on ALS disease progression. We compared the clinical data and progression in the first year following diagnosis for patients who received ALS diagnosis during 2020 (G20, N = 34), comparing it with a group of diagnosed in 2018 (G18, N = 31). Both groups received a comparable multidisciplinary model of care in our Tertiary Expert ALS Centre, Novara, Italy. The monthly rate of ALSFRS-R decline during the lockdown was significantly increased in G20 compared to G18 (1.52 ± 2.69 vs. 0.76 ± 0.56; p-value: 0.005). In G20, 47% required non-invasive ventilation (vs. 32% of G18). Similarly, in G20, 35% of patients died vs. 19% of patients in G18 (p-value: 0.01). All results were corrected for gender, age, site of onset, and diagnostic delay. Several factors can be implicated in making ALS more severe, with a faster progression, such as reduced medical evaluations and the possibility of therapeutic changes, social isolation, and rehabilitation therapy suspension.</p>

	<p>Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a chronic disease. No treatment stops its progression, and it presents symptoms in multiple areas. One way to understand the PD population is to investigate the clustering of patients by demographic and clinical similarities. Previous PD cluster studies included scores from clinical surveys, which provide a numerical but ordinal, non-linear value. In addition, these studies did not include categorical variables, as the clustering method utilized was not applicable to categorical variables. It was discovered that the numerical values of patient age and disease duration were similar among past cluster results, pointing to the need to exclude these values. This paper proposes a novel and automatic discovery method to cluster PD patients by incorporating categorical variables. No estimate of the number of clusters is required as input, whereas the previous cluster methods require a guess from the end user in order for the method to be initiated. Using a patient dataset from the Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) website to demonstrate the new clustering technique, our results showed that this method provided an accurate separation of the patients. In addition, this method provides an explainable process and an easy way to interpret clusters and describe patient subtypes.</p>

	<p>This review is extensively focused on the enhancement of cognitive functions while performing physical exercises categorized into cardiovascular exercises, resistance training, martial arts, racquet sports, dancing and mind-body exercises. Imaging modalities, viz. functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and electroencephalography (EEG), have been included in this review. This review indicates that differences are present in cognitive functioning while changing the type of physical activity performed. This study concludes that employing fNIRS helps overcome certain limitations of fMRI. Further, the effects of physical activity on a diverse variety of the population, from active children to the old people, are discussed.</p>

	<p>Conventional means of Parkinson’s Disease (PD) screening rely on qualitative tests typically administered by trained neurologists. Tablet technologies that enable data collection during handwriting and drawing tasks may provide low-cost, portable, and instantaneous quantitative methods for high-throughput PD screening. However, past efforts to use data from tablet-based drawing processes to distinguish between PD and control populations have demonstrated only moderate classification ability. Focusing on digitized drawings of Archimedean spirals, the present study utilized data from the open-access ParkinsonHW dataset to improve existing PD drawing diagnostic pipelines. Random forest classifiers were constructed using previously documented features and highly-predictive, newly-proposed features that leverage the many unique mathematical characteristics of the Archimedean spiral. This approach yielded an AUC of 0.999 on the particular dataset we tested on, and more importantly identified interpretable features with good promise for generalization across diverse patient cohorts. It demonstrated the potency of mathematical relationships inherent to the drawing shape and the usefulness of sparse feature sets and simple models, which further enhance interpretability, in the face of limited sample size. The results of this study also inform suggestions for future drawing task design and data analytics (feature extraction, shape selection, task diversity, drawing templates, and data sharing).</p>

	<p>Adult neurogenesis represents a mature brain’s capacity to integrate newly generated neurons into functional circuits. Impairment of neurogenesis contributes to the pathophysiology of various mood and cognitive disorders such as depression and Alzheimer’s Disease. The hippocampal neurogenic niche hosts neural progenitors, glia, and vasculature, which all respond to intrinsic and environmental cues, helping determine their current state and ultimate fate. In this article we focus on the major immune communication pathways and mechanisms through which glial cells sense, interact with, and modulate the neurogenic niche. We pay particular attention to those related to the sensing of and response to innate immune danger signals. Receptors for danger signals were first discovered as a critical component of the innate immune system response to pathogens but are now also recognized to play a crucial role in modulating non-pathogenic sterile inflammation. In the neurogenic niche, viable, stressed, apoptotic, and dying cells can activate danger responses in neuroimmune cells, resulting in neuroprotection or neurotoxicity. Through these mechanisms glial cells can influence hippocampal stem cell fate, survival, neuronal maturation, and integration. Depending on the context, such responses may be appropriate and on-target, as in the case of learning-associated synaptic pruning, or excessive and off-target, as in neurodegenerative disorders.</p>

	<p>Multiple associations between impaired olfactory performance and regional cortical and deep gray matter atrophy have been reported in separate studies of patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), and of the healthy elderly. We aimed to evaluate such possible associations among these populations in a unified manner. Twenty AD, twenty PD patients’ and twenty healthy age- and sex-matched controls’ odor identification performance was assessed with the Lithuanian adaptation of the Sniffin’ Sticks 12 odor identification test, followed by morphometric gray matter analysis by MRI using FreeSurfer. AD patients had significantly lower cognitive performance than both PD patients and the healthy elderly, as evaluated with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Odor identification performance was significantly worse in AD and PD patients compared with the healthy elderly; AD patients performed slightly worse than PD patients, but the difference was not statistically significant. Among patients with AD, worse odor identification performance was initially correlated with atrophy of multiple cortical and deep gray matter regions known to be involved in olfactory processing, however, only two measures—decreased thicknesses of the right medial and left lateral orbitofrontal cortices—remained significant after adjustment for possible confounders (age, MMSE score, and global cortical thickness). Among patients with PD and the healthy elderly we found no similar statistically significant correlations. Our findings support the key role of the orbitofrontal cortex in odor identification among patients with AD, and suggest that correlations between impaired odor identification performance and regional gray matter atrophy may be relatively more pronounced in AD rather than in PD.</p>

	<p>Seizures are the most frequent neurological clinical symptoms of the central nervous system (CNS) during the neonatal period. Neonatal seizures may be ascribed to an acute event or symptomatic conditions determined by genetic, metabolic or structural causes, outlining the so-called ‘Neonatal Epilepsies’. To date, three main groups of neonatal epilepsies are recognised during the neonatal period: benign familial neonatal epilepsy (BFNE), early myoclonic encephalopathy (EME) and ‘Ohtahara syndrome’ (OS). Recent advances showed the role of several genes in the pathogenesis of these conditions, such as KCNQ2, KCNQ3, ARX, STXBP1, SLC25A22, CDKL5, KCNT1, SCN2A and SCN8A. Herein, we reviewed the current knowledge regarding the pathogenic variants most frequently associated with neonatal seizures, which should be considered when approaching newborns affected by these disorders. In addition, we considered the new possible therapeutic strategies reported in these conditions.</p>

	<p>Studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging assume that hemodynamic responses have roughly linear relationships with underlying neural activity. However, to accurately investigate the neurovascular transfer function and compare its variability across brain regions, it is necessary to obtain full-field imaging of both electrophysiological and hemodynamic responses under various stimulus conditions with superior spatiotemporal resolution. Optical imaging combined with voltage-sensitive dye (VSD) and intrinsic signals (IS) is a powerful tool to address this issue. We performed VSD and IS imaging in the primary (S1) and secondary (S2) somatosensory cortices of rats to obtain optical maps of whisker-evoked responses. There were characteristic differences in sensory responses between the S1 and S2 cortices: VSD imaging revealed more localized excitatory and stronger inhibitory neural activity in S1 than in S2. IS imaging revealed stronger metabolic responses in S1 than in S2. We calculated the degree of response to compare the sensory responses between cortical regions and found that the ratio of the degree of response of S2 to S1 was similar, irrespective of whether the ratio was determined by VSD or IS imaging. These results suggest that neurovascular coupling does not vary between the S1 and S2 cortices.</p>

	<p>Background: Neurofeedback has been proposed as a treatment for Parkinson’s disease (PD) motor symptoms by changing the neural network activity directly linked with movement. However, the effectiveness of neurofeedback as a treatment for PD motor symptoms is unclear. Aim: To systematically review the literature to identify the effects of neurofeedback in people with idiopathic PD; as defined by measurement of brain activity; motor function; and performance. Design: A systematic review. Included Sources and Articles: PubMed; MEDLINE; Cinhal; PsychoInfo; Prospero; Cochrane; ClinicalTrials.gov; EMBASE; Web of Science; PEDro; OpenGrey; Conference Paper Index; Google Scholar; and eThos; searched using the Population-Intervention-Comparison-Outcome (PICO) framework. Primary studies with the following designs were included: randomized controlled trials (RCTs), non-RCTs; quasi-experimental; pre/post studies; and case studies. Results: This review included 11 studies out of 6197 studies that were identified from the literature search. Neuroimaging methods used were fMRI; scalp EEG; surface brain EEG; and deep brain EEG; where 10–15 Hz and the supplementary motor area were the most commonly targeted signatures for EEG and fMRI, respectively. Success rates for changing one’s brain activity ranged from 47% to 100%; however, both sample sizes and success criteria differed considerably between studies. While six studies included a clinical outcome; a lack of consistent assessments prevented a reliable conclusion on neurofeedback’s effectiveness. Narratively, fMRI neurofeedback has the greatest potential to improve PD motor symptoms. Two main limitations were found in the studies that contributed to the lack of a confident conclusion: (1) insufficient clinical information and perspectives (e.g., no reporting of adverse events), and (2) limitations in numerical data reporting (e.g., lack of explicit statistics) that prevented a meta-analysis. Conclusions: While fMRI neurofeedback was narratively the most effective treatment; the omission of clinical outcome measures in studies using other neurofeedback approaches limits comparison. Therefore, no single neurofeedback type can currently be identified as an optimal treatment for PD motor symptoms. This systematic review highlights the need to improve the inclusion of clinical information and more robust reporting of numerical data in future work. Neurofeedback appears to hold great potential as a treatment for PD motor symptoms. However, this field is still in its infancy and needs high quality RCTs to establish its effectiveness.

	<p>Antipsychotics (APDs) represent the main pharmacological strategy in the treatment of schizophrenia; however, their administration often may result in severe adverse effects, such as extrapyramidal symptoms. Typically, dystonic movements are considered the result of impaired function and/or abnormalities of dopaminergic neurotransmission/signaling in the basal ganglia. The catechol O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene is located within the 22q11.2 region, and its product is an enzyme involved in transferring a methyl group from S-adenosylmethionine to catecholamines, including dopamine. Studies showed that COMT Val158Met polymorphism modifies enzymatic activity and, consequently, synaptic dopamine concentration in specific brain areas. We identified a patient with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome presenting with cervical and trunk dystonia after paliperidone administration, which persisted even after drug discontinuation. Given the patient’s genetic condition, we hypothesized that the dopaminergic dysfunction had been aggravated by COMT involvement, thus causing dystonia. In line with this hypothesis, we carried out a study on psychiatric patients in chronic treatment with APD to evaluate the distribution of the COMT Val158Met polymorphism and its role in the onset of adverse extrapyramidal symptoms. The study included four patients with dystonia after administration of APDs compared to 17 patients who never presented adverse drug reactions. Our data suggest that the Val/Val and Met/Met polymorphisms of the COMT gene are associated with a protective effect for the development of collateral extrapyramidal symptoms in patients treated with APDs, while the Val/Met genotype could be considered a risk factor for the development of dystonia after APDs administration.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Enhancement of pyocyanin production by subinhibitory concentration of royal jelly in Pseudomonas aeruginosa [version 3; peer review: 2 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacterium, produces pyocyanin, a virulence factor associated with antibiotic tolerance. High concentrations of royal jelly have an antibacterial effect, which may potentially overcome antibacterial resistance. However, in some cases, antibiotic tolerance can occur due to prolonged stress of low-dose antibacterial agents. This study aimed to investigate the effect of subinhibitory concentrations of royal jelly on bacterial growth, pyocyanin production, and biofilm formation of P. aeruginosa. Methods: Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 10145 and clinical isolates were cultured in a royal jelly-containing medium to test the antibacterial activity. Pyocyanin production was observed by measuring the absorbance at 690 nm after 36 h culture and determined using extinction coefficient 4310 M-1 cm-1. Static microtiter plate biofilm assay performed to detect the biofilm formation, followed by scanning electron microscopy. Results: Royal jelly effectively inhibited the viability of both strains from a concentration of 25%. The highest production of pyocyanin was observed in the subinhibitory concentration group 6.25%, which gradually decreased along with the decrease of royal jelly concentration. Results of one-way ANOVA tests differed significantly in pyocyanin production of the two strains between the royal jelly groups. Tukey HSD test showed concentrations of 12.5%, 6.25%, and 3.125% significantly increased pyocyanin production of ATCC 10145, and the concentrations of 12.5% and 6.25% significantly increased production of the clinical isolates. Concentrations of 12.5% and 6.125% significantly induced biofilm formation of P. aeruginosa ATCC 10145, in line with the results of the SEM analysis. Conclusions: The royal jelly concentration of 25% or higher inhibits bacterial growth; however, the subinhibitory concentration increases pyocyanin production and biofilm formation in P. aeruginosa. It is advisable to determine the appropriate concentration of royal jelly to obtain beneficial virulence inhibiting activity.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Cooperating elephants mitigate competition until the stakes get too high</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Li-Li Li, Joshua M. Plotnik, Shang-Wen Xia, Estelle Meaux, Rui-Chang Quan</p>

Cooperation is ubiquitous in the animal kingdom as it aims to maximize benefits through joint action. Selection, however, may also favor competitive behaviors that could violate cooperation. How animals mitigate competition is hotly debated, with particular interest in primates and little attention paid thus far to nonprimates. Using a loose-string pulling apparatus, we explored cooperative and competitive behavior, as well as mitigation of the latter, in semi-wild Asian elephants (<i>Elephas maximus</i>). Our results showed that elephants first maintained a very high cooperation rate (average = 80.8% across 45 sessions). Elephants applied “block,” “fight back,” “leave,” “move side,” and “submission” as mitigation strategies and adjusted these strategies according to their affiliation and rank difference with competition initiators. They usually applied a “fight back” mitigation strategy as a sanction when competition initiators were low ranking or when they had a close affiliation, but were submissive if the initiators were high ranking or when they were not closely affiliated. However, when the food reward was limited, the costly competitive behaviors (“monopoly” and “fight”) increased significantly, leading to a rapid breakdown in cooperation. The instability of elephant cooperation as a result of benefit reduction mirrors that of human society, suggesting that similar fundamental principles may underlie the evolution of cooperation across species.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Identifying and prioritizing potential human-infecting viruses from their genome sequences</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Nardus Mollentze, Simon A. Babayan, Daniel G. Streicker</p>

Determining which animal viruses may be capable of infecting humans is currently intractable at the time of their discovery, precluding prioritization of high-risk viruses for early investigation and outbreak preparedness. Given the increasing use of genomics in virus discovery and the otherwise sparse knowledge of the biology of newly discovered viruses, we developed machine learning models that identify candidate zoonoses solely using signatures of host range encoded in viral genomes. Within a dataset of 861 viral species with known zoonotic status, our approach outperformed models based on the phylogenetic relatedness of viruses to known human-infecting viruses (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] = 0.773), distinguishing high-risk viruses within families that contain a minority of human-infecting species and identifying putatively undetected or so far unrealized zoonoses. Analyses of the underpinnings of model predictions suggested the existence of generalizable features of viral genomes that are independent of virus taxonomic relationships and that may preadapt viruses to infect humans. Our model reduced a second set of 645 animal-associated viruses that were excluded from training to 272 high and 41 very high-risk candidate zoonoses and showed significantly elevated predicted zoonotic risk in viruses from nonhuman primates, but not other mammalian or avian host groups. A second application showed that our models could have identified Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) as a relatively high-risk coronavirus strain and that this prediction required no prior knowledge of zoonotic Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses. Genome-based zoonotic risk assessment provides a rapid, low-cost approach to enable evidence-driven virus surveillance and increases the feasibility of downstream biological and ecological characterization of viruses.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Stimulation of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex with slow rTMS enhances verbal memory formation</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Mircea van der Plas, Verena Braun, Benjamin Johannes Stauch, Simon Hanslmayr</p>

Encoding of episodic memories relies on stimulus-specific information processing and involves the left prefrontal cortex. We here present an incidental finding from a simultaneous EEG-TMS experiment as well as a replication of this unexpected effect. Our results reveal that stimulating the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) with slow repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) leads to enhanced word memory performance. A total of 40 healthy human participants engaged in a list learning paradigm. Half of the participants (<i>N =</i> 20) received 1 Hz rTMS to the left DLPFC, while the other half (<i>N</i> = 20) received 1 Hz rTMS to the vertex and served as a control group. Participants receiving left DLPFC stimulation demonstrated enhanced memory performance compared to the control group. This effect was replicated in a within-subjects experiment where 24 participants received 1 Hz rTMS to the left DLPFC and vertex. In this second experiment, DLPFC stimulation also induced better memory performance compared to vertex stimulation. In addition to these behavioural effects, we found that 1 Hz rTMS to DLPFC induced stronger beta power modulation in posterior areas, a state that is known to be beneficial for memory encoding. Further analysis indicated that beta modulations did not have an oscillatory origin. Instead, the observed beta modulations were a result of a spectral tilt, suggesting inhibition of these parietal regions. These results show that applying 1 Hz rTMS to DLPFC, an area involved in episodic memory formation, improves memory performance via modulating neural activity in parietal regions.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Doublet identification in single-cell sequencing data using scDblFinder [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Doublets are prevalent in single-cell sequencing data and can lead to artifactual findings. A number of strategies have therefore been proposed to detect them. Building on the strengths of existing approaches, we developed scDblFinder, a fast, flexible and accurate Bioconductor-based doublet detection method. Here we present the method, justify its design choices, demonstrate its performance on both single-cell RNA and accessibility sequencing data, and provide some observations on doublet formation, detection, and enrichment analysis. Even in complex datasets, scDblFinder can accurately identify most heterotypic doublets, and was already found by an independent benchmark to outcompete alternatives.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">Deep entorhinal cortex: from circuit organization to spatial cognition and memory</a></h4>

              
                The deep layers of the entorhinal cortex are important for spatial cognition, as well as memory storage, consolidation and retrieval. A long-standing hypothesis is that deep-layer neurons relay spatial and memory-related signals between the hippocampus and telencephalon. We review the implications of recent circuit-level analyses that suggest more complex roles. The organization of deep entorhinal layers is consistent with multi-stage processing by specialized cell populations; in this framework, hippocampal, neocortical, and subcortical inputs are integrated to generate representations for use by targets in the telencephalon and for feedback to the superficial entorhinal cortex and hippocampus.

NANOG functions as a HIF-1 coactivator to induce TERT expression in hypoxic breast cancer stem cells. These findings suggest a mechanism in which HIF-1 and NANOG cooperatively mediate breast cancer stem cell self-renewal.
