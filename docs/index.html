              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-336/v2?src=rss">Evaluation of the effect of two conventional and one herbal mouthwash on the modulus of elasticity of three orthodontic wires: an in vitro study. [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background During fixed appliance therapy, maintaining good oral hygiene is crucial; however, certain mouthwashes can negatively impact orthodontic treatment by altering the mechanical properties of archwires. The study investigated the impact of conventional mouthwashes on orthodontic archwires’ Modulus of Elasticity (MoE). Methods It was an in vitro study that tested MoE of stainless steel (SS), nickel-titanium (NiTi), and β-titanium (β-Ti) archwires after immersing them in chlorhexidine (CHX), sodium fluoride (NaF), and HiORA mouthwashes along with distilled water (control) for one minute daily over three months. The wires were then subjected to a three-point bending test to measure their flexural modulus of elasticity (MoE) while applying loading and unloading forces at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, and 2.5 mm deflections. Statistical analysis included two-way ANOVA and Tukey’s Post Hoc test at significant α≤0.05. Results NaF reduced MoE for SS (loading 172.99 ± 7.71 GPa, unloading 148.88 ± 14.65 GPa), NiTi (Loading: 48.42 ± 6.13 GPa, unloading 30.60 ± 4.29 GPa), β-Ti wires (unloading 79.51 ± 1.62 GPa) than Control (loading 185.35 ± 8.06 GPa, unloading 199.78 ± 9.49 GPa) with p<0.05. CHX mouthwash reduced SS (loading -158.58 ± 4.47 GPa, unloading-138.54 ± 6.12 GPa), NiTi (unloading 37.05 ± 2.58 GPa), β-Ti (unloading 81.58 ± 7.94 GPa) with p<0.05. HiORA showed no significant differences in MoE for SS (loading 190.28 ± 7.54 GPa, unloading 185.58 ± 5.35 GPa), NiTi (loading 58.85 ± 2.39, unloading 37.05 ± 2.58), or β-Ti archwire (loading 89.92 ± 2.20, unloading 104.22 ± 5.00) compared to the controls with p<0.05. Conclusion HiORA herbal mouthwash is safe for NiTi, SS, and β-Ti archwires at all stages. Chlorhexidine (CHX) mouthwash should be prescribed briefly to prevent MoE degradation in NiTi and β-Ti archwires. NaF-based rinses should be cautiously used and monitored in SS, NiTi, and β-Ti archwires patients.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1203/v2?src=rss">Navigating Barriers and Building Pathways: Inclusive Education for Children with Special Needs [version 2; peer review: 3 approved]</a></h4>

              
                This quantitative study investigates the current landscape of inclusive education for children with special needs in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, with a focus on identifying perceived barriers, assessing institutional support, and quantifying the attitudes of key stakeholders, including teachers, special educators, school administrators, and parents. Drawing on a sample of 550 participants across three major districts of Jeddah, the research utilized a structured questionnaire incorporating Likert-scale items to capture perceptions of inclusion, obstacles to implementation, and the systemic support available in schools. Descriptive analysis revealed generally positive attitudes toward inclusive education (M = 3.85), though moderate levels of perceived barriers (M = 2.90) and institutional support (M = 3.23) suggest significant implementation challenges remain. ANOVA and t-tests showed no statistically significant differences in attitudes across gender or professional roles, indicating a shared understanding of inclusive values across stakeholder groups. However, regression analysis showed no significant predictors of attitudes in a linear model, whereas path analysis revealed that institutional support had a strong positive effect (β = 0.431, p < 0.0001), and perceived barriers had a significant negative effect (β = -0.270, p < 0.0001). These findings underscore the importance of structural and systemic factors in shaping inclusive education outcomes. The study concludes with recommendations for improving institutional support, enhancing teacher training, and fostering inclusive infrastructure, while also noting limitations related to geography and self-reporting. The research contributes to Saudi Arabia’s broader Vision 2030 goals by offering evidence-based insights for creating a more inclusive and equitable education system.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18057">The Hydraulic Brain: Understanding as Constraint-Release Phase Transition in Whole-Body Resonance</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.18057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current models treat physiological signals as noise corrupting neural computation. Previously, we showed that removing these "artifacts" eliminates 70% of predictive correlation, suggesting body signals functionally drive cognition. Here, we investigate the mechanism using high-density EEG (64 channels, 10 subjects, 500+ trials) during P300 target recognition.
  Phase Slope Index revealed zero-lag synchrony (PSI=0.000044, p=0.061) with high coherence (0.316, p<0.0001). Ridge-regularized Granger causality showed massive bidirectional coupling (F=100.53 brain-to-body, F=62.76 body-to-brain) peaking simultaneously at 78.1ms, consistent with mutually coupled resonance pairs.
  Time-resolved entropy analysis (200ms windows, 25ms steps) revealed triphasic dynamics: (1) constraint accumulation (0-78ms) building causal drive without entropy change (delta-S=-0.002 bits, p=0.75); (2) supercritical transition (100-600ms) triggering state expansion (58% directional increase, binomial p=0.002); (3) sustained metastability. Critically, transition magnitude was uncorrelated with resonance strength (r=-0.044, p=0.327), indicating binary threshold dynamics.
  Understanding emerges through a thermodynamic sequence: brain-body resonance acts as a discrete gate triggering non-linear information integration. This architecture may fundamentally distinguish biological from artificial intelligence.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18325">Brain-MGF: Multimodal Graph Fusion Network for EEG-fMRI Brain Connectivity Analysis Under Psilocybin</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.18325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Psychedelics, such as psilocybin, reorganise large-scale brain connectivity, yet how these changes are reflected across electrophysiological (electroencephalogram, EEG) and haemodynamic (functional magnetic resonance imaging, fMRI) networks remains unclear. We present Brain-MGF, a multimodal graph fusion network for joint EEG-fMRI connectivity analysis. For each modality, we construct graphs with partial-correlation edges and Pearson-profile node features, and learn subject-level embeddings via graph convolution. An adaptive softmax gate then fuses modalities with sample-specific weights to capture context-dependent contributions. Using the world's largest single-site psilocybin dataset, PsiConnect, Brain-MGF distinguishes psilocybin from no-psilocybin conditions in meditation and rest. Fusion improves over unimodal and non-adaptive variants, achieving 74.0% accuracy and 76.5% F1 score on meditation, and 76.0% accuracy with 85.8% ROC-AUC on rest. UMAP visualisations reveal clearer class separation for fused embeddings. These results indicate that adaptive graph fusion effectively integrates complementary EEG-fMRI information, providing an interpretable framework for characterising psilocybin-induced alterations in large-scale neural organisation.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18853">Decoding the science behind antioxidant -antiinflammatory nutraceuticals in stroke</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.18853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stroke is a leading cause of disability and death worldwide, with ischemic strokes accounting for nearly 80% of cases. Fewer than 5% of patients receive the sole validated pharmacotherapy, intravenous thrombolysis, highlighting the urgent need for novel therapies. Within this landscape, the exploration of natural molecules emerges as a promising avenue, particularly as a means to address limitations associated with conventional drugs. Nutraceuticals, bioactive compounds derived from food sources, offer a compelling prospect for health and wellness. The term nutraceutical reflects their dual potential in nutrition and pharmacotherapy, emphasizing their relevance to both disease prevention and treatment. Interestingly, many were initially recognized as ''natural preconditioners'', substances that prime the body for protection against stress or damage. In fact, numerous nutraceuticals have been shown to activate protective pathways similar to those triggered by preconditioning across various organs. Among nutraceuticals, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids sourced from plants or fish, along with polyphenols, have emerged as particularly promising. Their consumption has been associated with a reduced risk of ischemic stroke, supported by numerous preclinical studies demonstrating their beneficial effects on cellular components within the neurovascular unit. This review explores the shared protective mechanisms of various nutraceuticals against key drivers of ischemic injury, including excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and inflammation. By delineating these actions, the review highlights the potential of nutraceuticals as brain preconditioners that enhance neuroprotection, thereby mitigating the impact of cerebral ischemia in both preventive and therapeutic contexts.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18294">MultiDiffNet: A Multi-Objective Diffusion Framework for Generalizable Brain Decoding</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.18294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural decoding from electroencephalography (EEG) remains fundamentally limited by poor generalization to unseen subjects, driven by high inter-subject variability and the lack of large-scale datasets to model it effectively. Existing methods often rely on synthetic subject generation or simplistic data augmentation, but these strategies fail to scale or generalize reliably. We introduce \textit{MultiDiffNet}, a diffusion-based framework that bypasses generative augmentation entirely by learning a compact latent space optimized for multiple objectives. We decode directly from this space and achieve state-of-the-art generalization across various neural decoding tasks using subject and session disjoint evaluation. We also curate and release a unified benchmark suite spanning four EEG decoding tasks of increasing complexity (SSVEP, Motor Imagery, P300, and Imagined Speech) and an evaluation protocol that addresses inconsistent split practices in prior EEG research. Finally, we develop a statistical reporting framework tailored for low-trial EEG settings. Our work provides a reproducible and open-source foundation for subject-agnostic EEG decoding in real-world BCI systems.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13515">Robust Core-Periphery Constrained Transformer for Domain Adaptation</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2308.13515v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to learn transferable representation across domains. Recently a few UDA works have successfully applied Transformer-based methods and achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) results. However, it remains challenging when there exists a large domain gap between the source and target domain. Inspired by humans' exceptional transferability abilities to adapt knowledge from familiar to uncharted domains, we try to apply the universally existing organizational structure in the human functional brain networks, i.e., the core-periphery principle to design the Transformer and improve its UDA performance. In this paper, we propose a novel brain-inspired robust core-periphery constrained transformer (RCCT) for unsupervised domain adaptation, which brings a large margin of performance improvement on various datasets. Specifically, in RCCT, the self-attention operation across image patches is rescheduled by an adaptively learned weighted graph with the Core-Periphery structure (CP graph), where the information communication and exchange between images patches are manipulated and controlled by the connection strength, i.e., edge weight of the learned weighted CP graph. Besides, since the data in domain adaptation tasks can be noisy, to improve the model robustness, we intentionally add perturbations to the patches in the latent space to ensure generating robust learned weighted core-periphery graphs. Extensive evaluations are conducted on several widely tested UDA benchmarks. Our proposed RCCT consistently performs best compared to existing works, including 88.3\% on Office-Home, 95.0\% on Office-31, 90.7\% on VisDA-2017, and 46.0\% on DomainNet.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01250">Perceptogram: Reconstructing Visual Percepts and Presumptive Electrode Preference from EEG</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2404.01250v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Visual neural decoding from EEG has improved significantly due to diffusion models that can reconstruct high-quality images from decoded latents. While recent works have focused on relatively complex architectures to achieve good reconstruction performance from EEG, less attention has been paid to the source of this information. We present a unified framework that not only enables image reconstruction from EEG using a simple linear decoder, but also isolates interpretable EEG feature maps that support visual perception. Unlike prior approaches that rely on deep, opaque models, our method leverages the inherent structure of CLIP embeddings to keep the mapping linear. We show that training a simple linear decoder from EEG to CLIP latent space, followed by a frozen pre-trained diffusion model, is sufficient to decode images with state-of-the-art reconstruction performance. Beyond reconstruction, Perceptogram enables the visualization of presumptive electrode preference and EEG patterns, revealing interpretable EEG feature maps that correspond to distinct visual attributes, such as semantic class, texture, and hue. We thus use our framework, Perceptogram, to probe EEG signals at various levels of the visual information hierarchy.

                arXiv:2511.11480v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many properties of perceptual decision making are well-modeled by deep neural networks. However, such architectures typically treat decisions as instantaneous readouts, overlooking the temporal dynamics of the decision process. We present an image-computable model of perceptual decision making in which choices and response times arise from efficient sensory encoding and Bayesian decoding of neural spiking activity. We use a Poisson variational autoencoder to learn unsupervised representations of visual stimuli in a population of rate-coded neurons, modeled as independent homogeneous Poisson processes. A task-optimized decoder then continually infers an approximate posterior over actions conditioned on incoming spiking activity. Combining these components with an entropy-based stopping rule yields a principled and image-computable model of perceptual decisions capable of generating trial-by-trial patterns of choices and response times. Applied to MNIST digit classification, the model reproduces key empirical signatures of perceptual decision making, including stochastic variability, right-skewed response time distributions, logarithmic scaling of response times with the number of alternatives (Hick's law), and speed-accuracy trade-offs.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17516">Functional Classification of Spiking Signal Data Using Artificial Intelligence Techniques: A Review</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.17516v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human brain neuron activities are incredibly significant nowadays. Neuronal behavior is assessed by analyzing signal data such as electroencephalography (EEG), which can offer scientists valuable information about diseases and human-computer interaction. One of the difficulties researchers confront while evaluating these signals is the existence of large volumes of spike data. Spikes are some considerable parts of signal data that can happen as a consequence of vital biomarkers or physical issues such as electrode movements. Hence, distinguishing types of spikes is important. From this spot, the spike classification concept commences. Previously, researchers classified spikes manually. The manual classification was not precise enough as it involves extensive analysis. Consequently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) was introduced into neuroscience to assist clinicians in classifying spikes correctly. This review discusses the importance and use of AI in spike classification, focusing on the recognition of neural activity noises. The task is divided into three main components: preprocessing, classification, and evaluation. Existing methods are introduced and their importance is determined. The review also highlights the need for more efficient algorithms. The primary goal is to provide a perspective on spike classification for future research and provide a comprehensive understanding of the methodologies and issues involved. The review organizes materials in the spike classification field for future studies. In this work, numerous studies were extracted from different databases. The PRISMA-related research guidelines were then used to choose papers. Then, research studies based on spike classification using machine learning and deep learning approaches with effective preprocessing were selected.

                arXiv:2511.04047v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The reductionist approach commonly employed in scientific methods presupposes that both macro and micro phenomena can be explained by micro-level laws alone. This assumption implies intra-level causal closure, rendering all macro phenomena epiphenomenal. However, the integrative nature of consciousness suggests that it is a macro phenomenon. To ensure scientific testability and reject epiphenomenalism, the reductionist assumption of intra-level causal closure must be rejected. This implies that even neural-level behavior cannot be explained by observable neural-level laws alone. Therefore, a new methodology is necessary to acknowledge the causal efficacy of macro-level phenomena. We model the brain as operating under dual laws at different levels. This model includes hypothetical macro-level psychological laws that are not determined solely by micro-level neural laws, as well as the causal effects from macro to micro levels. In this study, we propose a constructive approach that explains both mental and physical phenomena through the interaction between these two sets of laws.

                arXiv:2511.17535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fantasy football leagues involve strategic player trades to optimize team performance. However, identifying optimal trades is complex due to varying player projections, positional needs, and league-specific scoring. Existing approaches focus on team selection or lineup optimization, but automated trade generation remains underexplored. In this paper, an algorithm that generates optimal trades, biasing toward improved playoff performance while maintaining apparent fairness for negotiation is explored. We introduce a genetic algorithm for fantasy football trade optimization, building on existing frameworks for team selection and lineup generation. The algorithm initializes with single-player trades, evolves through custom mutations (add/remove players, combine trades, exchange players, add from other trades, and spawn new trades), and uses team-specific elitism to preserve diversity. The cost function incorporates a playoff-weighted gain for the user's team (while maintaining apparent fairness), opponent gain, and fairness penalty. Integration with ESPN data sources enables real-time projections for all positions, including kickers and defenses. On a 12-team ESPN league (Week 8, 2025), the algorithm generated trades that upgraded the projected point totals of both the trade initiator and trade partner by nearly 3 fantasy points per week ensuring positive gains for both teams. The algorithm demonstrates effective trade optimization, with potential extensions to other fantasy sports or combinatorial problems requiring temporal biasing. Open-source implementation enables practical use and further research.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17550">Gate-level boolean evolutionary geometric attention neural networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.17550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a gate-level Boolean evolutionary geometric attention neural network that models images as Boolean fields governed by logic gates. Each pixel is a Boolean variable (0 or 1) embedded on a two-dimensional geometric manifold (for example, a discrete toroidal lattice), which defines adjacency and information propagation among pixels. The network updates image states through a Boolean reaction-diffusion mechanism: pixels receive Boolean diffusion from neighboring pixels (diffusion process) and perform local logic updates via trainable gate-level logic kernels (reaction process), forming a reaction-diffusion logic network.
  A Boolean self-attention mechanism is introduced, using XNOR-based Boolean Query-Key (Q-K) attention to modulate neighborhood diffusion pathways and realize logic attention. We also propose Boolean Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE), which encodes relative distances by parity-bit flipping to simulate Boolean ``phase'' offsets.
  The overall structure resembles a Transformer but operates entirely in the Boolean domain. Trainable parameters include Q-K pattern bits and gate-level kernel configurations. Because outputs are discrete, continuous relaxation methods (such as sigmoid approximation or soft-logic operators) ensure differentiable training.
  Theoretical analysis shows that the network achieves universal expressivity, interpretability, and hardware efficiency, capable of reproducing convolutional and attention mechanisms. Applications include high-speed image processing, interpretable artificial intelligence, and digital hardware acceleration, offering promising future research directions.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17556">Further Commentary on the Sooty Tern Optimization Algorithm and Tunicate Swarm Algorithm</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.17556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the article (Kudela, 2022), experimental demonstrations indicated that two Bio-/Nature inspired optimization algorithms (BNIOAs), Sooty Tern Optimization Algorithm (STOA) and Tunicate Swarm Algorithm (TSA), exhibit a zero-bias, leading to the conclusion that the claims made in the original papers were overstated. In this work, we extend the analysis by investigating the source of this bias from a probabilistic perspective. Our findings suggest that operations involving exponentiation, trigonometric functions, and divisions between random numbers are the primary causes of design flaws. These operations result in probability density distributions with a noticeable shift toward zero. Therefore, the application of these two algorithms should be approached with due caution.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17557">On the Structural and Statistical Flaws of the Exponential-Trigonometric Optimizer</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.17557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of metaphor-based metaheuristics has often been accompanied by issues of symbolic inflation, benchmarking opacity, and statistical misuse. This study presents a diagnostic critique of the recently proposed Exponential Trigonometric Optimizer (ETO), exposing fundamental flaws in its algorithmic structure and the statistical reporting of its performance. Through a stripped mathematical reconstruction, we identify inert symbolic constructs, ill-defined recurrence schedules, and ineffective update mechanisms that collectively undermine the algorithm's purported balance and effectiveness. A principled benchmarking comparison against nine established metaheuristics on the CEC 2017 and 2021 suites reveals that ETO's performance claims are inflated. While it demonstrates mid-tier competitiveness, it consistently fails against top-tier algorithms, especially under high-dimensional and shift-rotated landscapes. Our statistical framework, employing rank-based non-parametric tests and effect size diagnostics, quantifies these limitations and highlights ETO's structural fragility and lack of scalability. The paper concludes by advocating for a reformist framework in metaheuristic research, emphasizing symbolic hygiene, operator attribution, and statistical transparency to mitigate misleading narratives and foster a more robust and reproducible optimization literature.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17563">Dynamic Weight Adaptation in Spiking Neural Networks Inspired by Biological Homeostasis</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2511.17563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Homeostatic mechanisms play a crucial role in maintaining optimal functionality within the neural circuits of the brain. By regulating physiological and biochemical processes, these mechanisms ensure the stability of an organism's internal environment, enabling it to better adapt to external changes. Among these mechanisms, the Bienenstock, Cooper, and Munro (BCM) theory has been extensively studied as a key principle for maintaining the balance of synaptic strengths in biological systems. Despite the extensive development of spiking neural networks (SNNs) as a model for bionic neural networks, no prior work in the machine learning community has integrated biologically plausible BCM formulations into SNNs to provide homeostasis. In this study, we propose a Dynamic Weight Adaptation Mechanism (DWAM) for SNNs, inspired by the BCM theory. DWAM can be integrated into the host SNN, dynamically adjusting network weights in real time to regulate neuronal activity, providing homeostasis to the host SNN without any fine-tuning. We validated our method through dynamic obstacle avoidance and continuous control tasks under both normal and specifically designed degraded conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that DWAM not only enhances the performance of SNNs without existing homeostatic mechanisms under various degraded conditions but also further improves the performance of SNNs that already incorporate homeostatic mechanisms.

                arXiv:2511.17567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weight quantization in spiking neural networks (SNNs) could further reduce energy consumption. However, quantizing weights without sacrificing accuracy remains challenging. In this study, inspired by astrocyte-mediated synaptic modulation in the biological nervous systems, we propose Temporal-adaptive Weight Quantization (TaWQ), which incorporates weight quantization with temporal dynamics to adaptively allocate ultra-low-bit weights along the temporal dimension. Extensive experiments on static (e.g., ImageNet) and neuromorphic (e.g., CIFAR10-DVS) datasets demonstrate that our TaWQ maintains high energy efficiency (4.12M, 0.63mJ) while incurring a negligible quantization loss of only 0.22% on ImageNet.

                arXiv:2511.17571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-swarm particle optimisation algorithms are gaining popularity due to their ability to locate multiple optimum points concurrently. In this family of algorithms, clustering-based multi-swarm algorithms are among the most effective techniques that join the closest particles together to form independent niche swarms that exploit potential promising regions. However, most clustering-based multi-swarms are Euclidean distance-based and only inquire about the potential of one peak within a cluster and thus can lose multiple peaks due to poor resolution. In a bid to improve the peak detection ratio, the current study proposes two enhancements. First, a preliminary local search across initial particles is proposed to ensure that each local region is sufficiently scouted prior to particle collaboration. Secondly, an investigative clustering approach that performs concavity analysis is proposed to evaluate the potential for several sub-niches within a single cluster. An improved clustering-based multi-swarm PSO (TImPSO) has resulted from these enhancements and has been tested against three competing algorithms in the same family using the IEEE CEC2013 niching datasets, resulting in an improved peak ratio for almost all the test functions.

                arXiv:2511.17592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in LLM-guided evolutionary computation, particularly AlphaEvolve (Novikov et al., 2025; Georgiev et al., 2025), have demonstrated remarkable success in discovering novel mathematical constructions and solving challenging optimization problems. However, the high-level descriptions in published work leave many implementation details unspecified, hindering reproducibility and further research. In this report we present GigaEvo, an extensible open-source framework that enables researchers to study and experiment with hybrid LLM-evolution approaches inspired by AlphaEvolve. Our system provides modular implementations of key components: MAP-Elites quality-diversity algorithms, asynchronous DAG-based evaluation pipelines, LLM-driven mutation operators with insight generation and bidirectional lineage tracking, and flexible multi-island evolutionary strategies. In order to assess reproducibility and validate our implementation we evaluate GigaEvo on challenging problems from the AlphaEvolve paper: Heilbronn triangle placement, circle packing in squares, and high-dimensional kissing numbers.

                arXiv:2511.18429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study is motivated by a robustness issue in numerical optimization of bound-constrained problems: many algorithms that perform well on a particular benchmark suite, such as the IEEE CEC2017 problems, struggle to maintain the same level of performance when applied to other suites that differ in dimensionality, landscape complexity, or the maximum number of function evaluations ($N_{\text{max}}$). To address this, we propose the Adaptive Restart-Refine Differential Evolution (ARRDE) algorithm, a new variant of Differential Evolution (DE). ARRDE builds upon the LSHADE algorithm, incorporates key mechanisms from jSO, and introduces a nonlinear population-size reduction strategy combined with an adaptive restart-refine mechanism.
  We evaluate ARRDE on five benchmark suites (CEC2011, CEC2017, CEC2019, CEC2020, and CEC2022) which, to the best of our knowledge, constitutes the most extensive experimental study to date in the context of algorithmic comparison, as most prior works consider only one or two suites. This broad evaluation enables a rigorous assessment of generalization across markedly different problem characteristics. To further support fair cross-suite comparisons, we also introduce a bounded accuracy-based scoring metric derived from relative error. Using both rank-based and accuracy-based metrics, and comparing against algorithms that perform strongly on CEC2017 (e.g., jSO and LSHADE-cnEpSin) as well as those that excel on CEC2020 (e.g., j2020 and NLSHADE-RSP), ARRDE consistently demonstrates top-tier performance, ranking first across all benchmark suites considered. These results highlight ARRDE's robustness and its superior generalization capability.

                arXiv:2511.19089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A suitable choice of the representation of candidate solutions is crucial for the efficiency of evolutionary algorithms and related metaheuristics. We focus on problems in permutation spaces, which are at the core of numerous practical applications of such algorithms, e.g. in scheduling and transportation. Inversion vectors (also called Lehmer codes) are an alternative representation of the permutation space $S_n$ compared to the classical encoding as a vector of $n$ unique entries. In particular, they do not require any constraint handling. Using rigorous mathematical runtime analyses, we compare the efficiency of inversion vector encodings to the classical representation and give theory-guided advice on their choice. Moreover, we link the effect of local changes in the inversion code space to classical measures on permutations like the number of inversions. Finally, through experimental studies on linear ordering and quadratic assignment problems, we demonstrate the practical efficiency of inversion vector encodings.

                arXiv:2511.17687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The brain's Path Integration (PI) mechanism offers substantial guidance and inspiration for Brain-Inspired Navigation (BIN). However, the PI capability constructed by the Continuous Attractor Neural Networks (CANNs) in most existing BIN studies exhibits significant computational redundancy, and its operational efficiency needs to be improved; otherwise, it will not be conducive to the practicality of BIN technology. To address this, this paper proposes an efficient PI approach using representation learning models to replicate CANN neurodynamic patterns. This method successfully replicates the neurodynamic patterns of CANN-modeled Head Direction Cells (HDCs) and Grid Cells (GCs) using lightweight Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). These ANN-reconstructed HDC and GC models are then integrated to achieve brain-inspired PI for Dead Reckoning (DR). Benchmark tests in various environments, compared with the well-known NeuroSLAM system, demonstrate that this work not only accurately replicates the neurodynamic patterns of navigation cells but also matches NeuroSLAM in positioning accuracy. Moreover, efficiency improvements of approximately 17.5% on the general-purpose device and 40~50% on the edge device were observed, compared with NeuroSLAM. This work offers a novel implementation strategy to enhance the practicality of BIN technology and holds potential for further extension.

                arXiv:2511.19246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, machine learning and deep learning have driven advances in domains such as image classification, speech recognition, and anomaly detection by leveraging multi-layer neural networks to model complex data. Simultaneously, quantum computing (QC) promises to address classically intractable problems via quantum parallelism, motivating research in quantum machine learning (QML). Among QML techniques, quantum autoencoders show promise for compressing high-dimensional quantum and classical data. However, designing effective quantum circuit architectures for quantum autoencoders remains challenging due to the complexity of selecting gates, arranging circuit layers, and tuning parameters.
  This paper proposes a neural architecture search (NAS) framework that automates the design of quantum autoencoders using a genetic algorithm (GA). By systematically evolving variational quantum circuit (VQC) configurations, our method seeks to identify high-performing hybrid quantum-classical autoencoders for data reconstruction without becoming trapped in local minima. We demonstrate effectiveness on image datasets, highlighting the potential of quantum autoencoders for efficient feature extraction within a noise-prone, near-term quantum era. Our approach lays a foundation for broader application of genetic algorithms to quantum architecture search, aiming for a robust, automated method that can adapt to varied data and hardware constraints.

                arXiv:2410.07968v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Navigating vast, rugged biological fitness landscapes to discover high-value functional patterns-such as optimal protein sequences-is a central challenge in health informatics. However, conventional algorithms often struggle with the exploration-exploitation dilemma, failing to synergize global search with deep local refinement, which leads to entrapment in suboptimal solutions. To overcome this barrier, we introduce Octopus Inspired Optimization (OIO), a novel hierarchical metaheuristic that mimics the octopus's unique neural architecture to intrinsically unify centralized global exploration and parallelized local exploitation. We validated OIO on a real-world protein engineering benchmark, where it surpassed 15 competing metaheuristics. This success is underpinned by OIO's architectural suitability for protein-like landscapes, confirmed by its top ranking on the NK-Landscape benchmark, and its powerful optimization engine, demonstrated by its first-place performance on the gold-standard CEC2022 benchmark. OIO thus provides a robust, nature-inspired computational tool for complex optimization problems in drug discovery and personalized medicine.

                arXiv:2412.17629v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) simulate natural selection but have two main limitations: (1) they rarely update individuals based on global correlations, limiting comprehensive learning; (2) they struggle with balancing exploration and exploitation, where excessive exploitation causes premature convergence, and excessive exploration slows down the search. Moreover, EAs often depend on manual parameter settings, which can disrupt the exploration-exploitation balance. To address these issues, we propose Graph Neural Evolution (GNE), a novel EA framework. GNE represents the population as a graph, where nodes represent individuals, and edges capture their relationships, enabling global information usage. GNE utilizes spectral graph neural networks (GNNs) to decompose evolutionary signals into frequency components, applying a filtering function to fuse these components. High-frequency components capture diverse global information, while low-frequency ones capture more consistent information. This explicit frequency filtering strategy directly controls global-scale features through frequency components, overcoming the limitations of manual parameter settings and making the exploration-exploitation control more interpretable and manageable. Tests on nine benchmark functions (e.g., Sphere, Rastrigin, Rosenbrock) show that GNE outperforms classical (GA, DE, CMA-ES) and advanced algorithms (SDAES, RL-SHADE) under various conditions, including noise-corrupted and optimal solution deviation scenarios. GNE achieves solutions several orders of magnitude better (e.g., 3.07e-20 mean on Sphere vs. 1.51e-07).

                arXiv:2506.03172v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The inventory routing problem (IRP) focuses on jointly optimizing inventory and distribution operations from a supplier to retailers over multiple days. Compared to other problems from the vehicle routing family, the interrelations between inventory and routing decisions render IRP optimization more challenging and call for advanced solution techniques. A few studies have focused on developing large neighborhood search approaches for this class of problems, but this remains a research area with vast possibilities due to the challenges related to the integration of inventory and routing decisions. In this study, we advance this research area by developing a new large neighborhood search operator tailored for the IRP. Specifically, the operator optimally removes and reinserts all visits to a specific retailer while minimizing routing and inventory costs. We propose an efficient tailored dynamic programming algorithm that exploits preprocessing and acceleration strategies. The operator is used to build an effective local search routine, and included in a state-of-the-art routing algorithm, i.e., Hybrid Genetic Search (HGS). Through extensive computational experiments, we demonstrate that the resulting heuristic algorithm leads to solutions of unmatched quality up to this date, especially on large-scale benchmark instances.

                arXiv:2508.02995v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite their success, modern convolutional neural networks (CNNs) exhibit fundamental limitations, including data inefficiency, poor out-of-distribution generalization, and vulnerability to adversarial perturbations. These shortcomings can be traced to a lack of inductive biases that reflect the inherent geometric structure of the visual world. The primate visual system, in contrast, demonstrates superior efficiency and robustness, suggesting that its architectural and computational principles,which evolved to internalize these structures,may offer a blueprint for more capable artificial vision. This paper introduces Visual Cortex Network (VCNet), a novel neural network architecture whose design is informed by the macro-scale organization of the primate visual cortex. VCNet is framed as a geometric framework that emulates key biological mechanisms, including hierarchical processing across distinct cortical areas, dual-stream information segregation for learning disentangled representations, and top-down predictive feedback for representation refinement. We interpret these mechanisms through the lens of geometry and dynamical systems, positing that they guide the learning of structured, low-dimensional neural manifolds. We evaluate VCNet on two specialized benchmarks: the Spots-10 animal pattern dataset, which probes sensitivity to natural textures, and a light field image classification task, which requires processing higher-dimensional visual data. Our results show that VCNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy of 92.1\% on Spots-10 and 74.4\% on the light field dataset, surpassing contemporary models of comparable size. This work demonstrates that integrating high-level neuroscientific principles, viewed through a geometric lens, can lead to more efficient and robust models, providing a promising direction for addressing long-standing challenges in machine learning.

                arXiv:2509.23253v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have garnered significant attention as a central paradigm in neuromorphic computing, owing to their energy efficiency and biological plausibility. However, training deep SNNs has critically depended on explicit normalization schemes, leading to a trade-off between performance and biological realism. To resolve this conflict, we propose a normalization-free learning framework that incorporates lateral inhibition inspired by cortical circuits. Our framework replaces the traditional feedforward SNN layer with a circuit of distinct excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) neurons that captures the features of the canonical architecture of cortical E-I circuits. The circuit dynamically regulates neuronal activity through subtractive and divisive inhibition, which respectively control the activity and the gain of excitatory neurons. To enable and stabilize end-to-end training of the biologically constrained SNN, we propose two key techniques: E-I Init and E-I Prop. E-I Init is a dynamic parameter initialization scheme that balances excitatory and inhibitory inputs while performing gain control. E-I Prop decouples the backpropagation of the E-I circuits from the forward pass and regulates gradient flow. Experiments across multiple datasets and network architectures demonstrate that our framework enables stable training of deep normalization-free SNNs with biological realism and achieves competitive performance without resorting to explicit normalization schemes. Therefore, our work not only provides a solution to training deep SNNs but also serves as a computational platform for further exploring the functions of E-I interactions in large-scale cortical computation.

Abstract: While crossover is a critical and often indispensable component in other forms of Genetic Programming, such as Linear- and Tree-based, it has consistently been claimed that it deteriorates search performance in CGP. As a result, a mutation-alone $(1+\lambda)$ evolutionary strategy has become the canonical approach for CGP. Although several operators have been developed that demonstrate an increased performance over the canonical method, a general solution to the problem is still lacking. In this paper, we compare basic crossover methods, namely one-point and uniform, to variants in which nodes are ``preserved,'' including the subgraph crossover developed by Roman Kalkreuth, the difference being that when ``node preservation'' is active, crossover is not allowed to break apart instructions. We also compare a node mutation operator to the traditional point mutation; the former simply replaces an entire node with a new one. We find that node preservation in both mutation and crossover improves search using symbolic regression benchmark problems, moving the field towards a general solution to CGP crossover.

Abstract: Spiking neural network (SNN) has emerged as a promising paradigm in computational neuroscience and artificial intelligence, offering advantages such as low energy consumption and small memory footprint. However, their practical adoption is constrained by several challenges, prominently among them being performance optimization. In this study, we present a novel approach to enhance the performance of SNN for images through a new coding method that exploits bit plane representation. Our proposed technique is designed to improve the accuracy of SNN without increasing model size. Also, we investigate the impacts of color models of the proposed coding process. Through extensive experimental validation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our coding strategy in achieving performance gain across multiple datasets. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first research that considers bit planes and color models in the context of SNN. By leveraging the unique characteristics of bit planes, we hope to unlock new potentials in SNNs performance, potentially paving the way for more efficient and effective SNNs models in future researches and applications.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05509">Do Spikes Protect Privacy? Investigating Black-Box Model Inversion Attacks in Spiking Neural Networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.05509v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As machine learning models become integral to security-sensitive applications, concerns over data leakage from adversarial attacks continue to rise. Model Inversion (MI) attacks pose a significant privacy threat by enabling adversaries to reconstruct training data from model outputs. While MI attacks on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have been widely studied, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) remain largely unexplored in this context. Due to their event-driven and discrete computations, SNNs introduce fundamental differences in information processing that may offer inherent resistance to such attacks. A critical yet underexplored aspect of this threat lies in black-box settings, where attackers operate through queries without direct access to model parameters or gradients-representing a more realistic adversarial scenario in deployed systems. This work presents the first study of black-box MI attacks on SNNs. We adapt a generative adversarial MI framework to the spiking domain by incorporating rate-based encoding for input transformation and decoding mechanisms for output interpretation. Our results show that SNNs exhibit significantly greater resistance to MI attacks than ANNs, as demonstrated by degraded reconstructions, increased instability in attack convergence, and overall reduced attack effectiveness across multiple evaluation metrics. Further analysis suggests that the discrete and temporally distributed nature of SNN decision boundaries disrupts surrogate modeling, limiting the attacker's ability to approximate the target model.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15938">Straight to Zero: Why Linearly Decaying the Learning Rate to Zero Works Best for LLMs</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2502.15938v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: LLMs are commonly trained with a learning rate (LR) warmup, followed by cosine decay to 10% of the maximum (10x decay). In a large-scale empirical study, we show that under an optimal peak LR, a simple linear decay-to-zero (D2Z) schedule consistently outperforms other schedules when training at compute-optimal dataset sizes. D2Z is superior across a range of model sizes, batch sizes, datasets, and vocabularies. Benefits increase as dataset size increases. Leveraging a novel interpretation of AdamW as an exponential moving average of weight updates, we show how linear D2Z optimally balances the demands of early training (moving away from initial conditions) and late training (averaging over more updates in order to mitigate gradient noise). In experiments, a 610M-parameter model trained for 80 tokens-per-parameter (TPP) using D2Z achieves lower loss than when trained for 200 TPP using 10x decay, corresponding to an astonishing 60% compute savings. Models such as Llama2-7B, trained for 286 TPP with 10x decay, could likely have saved a majority of compute by training with D2Z.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01218">Quantitative Attractor Analysis of High-Capacity Kernel Logistic Regression Hopfield Networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2505.01218v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kernel-based learning methods such as Kernel Logistic Regression (KLR) can substantially increase the storage capacity of Hopfield networks, but the principles governing their performance and stability remain largely uncharacterized. This paper presents a comprehensive quantitative analysis of the attractor landscape in KLR-trained networks to establish a solid foundation for their design and application. Through extensive, statistically validated simulations, we address critical questions of generality, scalability, and robustness. Our comparative analysis shows that KLR and Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR) exhibit similarly high storage capacities and clean attractor landscapes under typical operating conditions, suggesting that this behavior is a general property of kernel regression methods, although KRR is computationally much faster. We identify a non-trivial, scale-dependent law for the kernel width $\gamma$, demonstrating that optimal capacity requires $\gamma$ to be scaled such that $\gamma N$ increases with network size $N$. This finding implies that larger networks require more localized kernels, in which each pattern's influence is more spatially confined, to mitigate inter-pattern interference. Under this optimized scaling, we provide clear evidence that storage capacity scales linearly with network size~($P \propto N$). Furthermore, our sensitivity analysis shows that performance is remarkably robust with respect to the choice of the regularization parameter $\lambda$. Collectively, these findings provide a concise set of empirical principles for designing high-capacity and robust associative memories and clarify the mechanisms that enable kernel methods to overcome the classical limitations of Hopfield-type models.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/107309">Evolution of gene expression in seasonal environments</a></h4>

              
                The biological activities of organisms are closely linked to seasonality. Phenology, the temporal orchestration of biological activities, is governed by gene expression, yet the evolutionary dynamics underlying seasonal gene expression remain unclear. To investigate these dynamics, we compared genome-wide expression dynamics (molecular phenology) in four dominant evergreen Fagaceae species in Asia (<i>Quercus glauca</i>, <i>Q. acuta</i>, <i>Lithocarpus edulis</i>, and <i>L. glaber</i>), using leaf and bud tissues over two seasonal cycles. We assembled high-quality reference genomes, identifying 11749 single-copy orthologous genes. Seasonal transcriptomic profiling of these orthologous genes revealed highly conserved gene expression across species in winter when temperatures fall below ~10 °C. Rhythmic gene expression with significant periodic oscillations was more prevalent in buds (51.9%) than in leaves (40.6%), with most rhythmic genes (78.4–92.0%) exhibiting annual periodicity, while a smaller fraction (1.2–11.9%) followed half-annual cycles. The seasonal peaks of rhythmic genes were highly synchronized across species in winter but diverged during the growing season, reflecting species-specific timing of leaf flushing and flowering. These findings suggest that the four species share a common molecular calendar in winter, which constrains the evolution of gene expression under seasonal environments.

                Background Effective learning strategies are essential for inclusive elementary classrooms, particularly in Indonesian language education, where students have diverse learning needs and digital access levels. Although social media has become a common educational tool, its structured use as a pedagogical model for inclusive learning in Indonesian schools is limited. Previous studies have largely focused on general online learning, leaving a gap in understanding how social media can foster inclusion and language skill development. This study addresses that gap by exploring how social media can be systematically integrated into Indonesian language learning and by developing a strategy that promotes inclusivity, collaboration, and student engagement. Methods A qualitative case study approach was employed to capture in-depth insights from classroom practices. Data were collected from 15 elementary school teachers across five Indonesian provinces (West Java, Central Java, East Java, Yogyakarta, and South Kalimantan) using semi-structured interviews and open-ended questionnaires. Data were coded and analyzed thematically using NVivo 14 to identify emerging categories, patterns, and interconnections among teachers’ experiences and perceptions. Results The findings indicate that social media effectively supports both collaborative and independent learning, enhances digital literacy, and increases motivation among students. Teachers reported that platforms such as WhatsApp and YouTube foster communication, creativity, and resource sharing. However, they also highlighted challenges related to unequal internet access, data privacy, and managing online behavior. Three key themes emerged: (1) social media as a catalyst for collaboration, (2) digital literacy development through authentic media interaction, and (3) the need for clear guidelines to maintain safety and equity. Conclusions This study proposes the Social Media Networking (SMN) framework, offering practical steps for teachers to integrate social media into inclusive pedagogy. The SMN framework demonstrates that social media can function as a structured, participatory, and equitable learning strategy that strengthens inclusivity and engagement in Indonesian language classrooms.

                Streptomyces sp. BTA 1-131 was isolated from the marine sponge Melophlus sarasinorum collected in Indonesia. The crude extracts of this strain displayed antibacterial and cytotoxic activity, and therefore, to further investigate the bioactive potential of the strain, whole genome sequencing was performed in this study. The whole genome sequencing of Streptomyces sp. BTA 1-131 was conducted using both Illumina NextSeq and Oxford Nanopore platforms with a de novo hybrid assembly approach. The high-quality genome obtained is 10.23 Mbp with a GC content of 71.57%. It is organised into a single chromosomal contig, two linear plasmids, and one circular plasmid. Interestingly, a long-terminal inverted repeat (L-TIR) sequence of 1.5 Mbp has been confirmed in the strain genome. Phylogenomic analysis suggested that the strain BTA 1-131 likely represents a new species within the genus Streptomyces. To the best of our knowledge, the genome data described here would be the first report on the hybrid genome sequence of Streptomyces associated with the rarely reported sponge Melophlus sarasinorum from Indonesia, with a unique feature of L-TIR. The complete genome data generated here will provide compelling information for further analysis of the biosynthetic potential of the strain BTA 1-131 to produce new bioactive compounds.

                Background Endocrine-disrupting chemical (EDCs) is an artificial or naturally occurring any compound that is capable of interfering with endocrine system and it presents a threat not only to the environment but also to the health of human being. These xenobiotics are becoming more widespread in the environment and can cause a whole spectrum of metabolic and developmental disorders. They can be long-term with many of their effects being dependent on the time and associated exposure time and some of them are irreversible. Methods The review summarizes existing evergreen publications about the classification, origin, and biological effects that EDCs have. It discusses how various organisms are vulnerable to being exposed to EDCs and how the latter interfere with endocrine action. The review also considers different bioassays that are applied in toxicological testing in evaluation of EDC activity. Results All EDCs can be classified into industrial chemicals, pesticides, plasticizers, pharmaceuticals and heavy metals. Lipophilic EDCs have the potential of bioaccumulation that gives rise to long-term biological impacts. Reproductive and developmental abnormalities have been found their way into wildlife studies; infertility, obesity, diabetes, and hormone-related cancers linked in humans being exposed to it. Mechanistically, EDCs act as mimics or antagonists to naturally produced hormones, change the expression of receptor in cells, hormone synthesis and metabolism. Bioassays like the in vitro receptor binding, reporter gene and in vivo animal model are also very useful in assessing EDC toxicity. Conclusions The tendency of even greater persistence of EDC in the environment poses as testimony to the dire necessity of intensified monitoring, regulation, and spread of sensitivity among general public. There is a strong need to research further to learn about the long term effects to health, improve methods of detection, and make certain chemical alternatives that are safe. The issue of EDC exposure is of importance when it comes to protecting the natural balance of the environment and human health.

                Introduction The quality of robusta coffee beans (Coffea canephora var. Robusta) can be modulated by using a specific fermentation method. Fermentation is an important process in coffee bean processing because it greatly determines the final quality of coffee beans, especially their taste. A starter culture is one way to perform a particular process of fermentation. Methods In this study, fermentation was carried out at different temperatures (35°C and 40°C) and times (24 h and 48 h) using kefir as a specific starter culture and the Controlled Semi-Carbonic Maceration Method. Research parameters are: population number of lactic acid bacteria, caffeine content, reducing sugar content, pH, lightness value, the density, and titrated acid value. Results The results of this study indicate that the lactic acid bacteria population showed optimum growth at 24 h of fermentation, which was around 7.67-7.72 log10 cfu/mL. Changes in the chemical and physical characteristics of Robusta coffee beans fermented with a kefir starter were that the caffeine content decreased from 1.41% to 0.46%, the reducing sugar content decreased from 2.42% to 0.29%, the pH decreased from 6.12 to 4.43, the lightness value decreased from 41.68 to 30.54, and the density decreased from 0.50 g/mL to 0.39 g/mL. Still, the total titrated acid value increased from 0.40% to 0.99%. Conclusion This indicates that the addition of kefir as a starter in semi-carbonic coffee fermentation maceration has been successful, as evidenced by the results of data in the form of a decrease in caffeine, reducing sugar, pH, and a decrease in density and lightness. Meanwhile, the total titrated acid increased.

                Abstract* Against the backdrop of the digital economy, government subsidies, as a key macroeconomic regulation tool, interact with enterprises’ digital marketing investment and consumer behavior, yet relevant in-depth research remains scarce. This study aims to explore the complex relationships between national subsidy policies, enterprises’ digital marketing strategies, and consumer purchase intentions, with a focus on the second-hand product market. Based on a review of existing literature, five core hypotheses are proposed: national subsidy policies significantly enhance enterprises’ digital marketing investment; enterprises’ digital marketing strategies under subsidies positively impact consumer purchase intentions; consumers’ awareness of subsidy policies strengthens their purchase intentions; consumers’ trust in digital marketing platforms moderates the impact of digital marketing on purchase intentions; and national subsidy policies reduce consumers’ willingness to purchase second-hand products. This research bridges the existing research gap, constructs a comprehensive theoretical framework for the interaction between government, enterprises, and consumers in the digital age, and provides theoretical basis and practical guidance for policy makers and business decision-makers.

                The application of digital literacy in elementary schools is a curriculum-driven approach to create independent and student-centered learning through the effective and efficient use of digital technology. This study explores teachers’ perceptions of the application of digital literacy in the curriculum to improve the quality of elementary schools. The research uses a quasi-qualitative approach. Data was collected through structured interviews with 48 teachers from 26 elementary schools, while data analysis used thematic analysis. The results of the study summarize the statements of elementary school teachers that revealed three main themes: the urgency, strategy, and positive and negative impacts of implementing digital literacy in the curriculum in elementary schools. The teachers stated that implementing digital literacy is critical because it impacts the efficiency and effectiveness of the use of school resources, improves the quality of schools, and helps develop 21st-century skills. This study concludes that school principals need to manage the curriculum and prepare regulations that regulate the availability of infrastructure for implementing digital literacy in elementary schools. This study also recommends that the Indonesian government make policies on the rules for implementing digital literacy in elementary schools and elementary schools can implement digital literacy in a sustainable manner and be prepared based on the curriculum according to the potential and culture of the school.

                Background Periodontal disease is a significant complication in patients with type-2 diabetes mellitus, further complicated by impaired immune response and increased susceptibility to infections. Effective management is essential as it influences both oral health and glycemic control. Traditional therapies frequently prove inadequate, necessitating the exploration of adjunctive treatments. Chitosan, known for its antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and regenerative properties, offers potential benefits due to its non-toxicity, biodegradability, and biocompatibility. This study aims to systematically compare and evaluate the clinical outcomes and antimicrobial efficacy of 2mg resorbable Chitosan membranes versus 2mg resorbable tetracycline fibers (suspended in 25mg collagen) when used as adjuncts to scaling and root planing in patients with type-2 diabetes mellitus undergoing periodontal maintenance. Materials and methodology In parallel study design, 26 patients with type II diabetes mellitus, undergoing maintenance therapy and diagnosed with periodontitis, were treated with scaling and root planing. Test group was given chitosan membranes, while control group received tetracycline fibers as local drug delivery agents in residual pockets with depth of 5mm or more. Clinical evaluations, including Plaque Index, Modified Sulcus Bleeding Index, probing pocket depth, attachment loss, and microbiological analysis, were conducted at baseline and again at 3 months. This trial was prospectively registered with Clinical Trials Registry – India (Trial REF/2022/04/053476; Registration number: CTRI/2023/10/058766). Results Both groups showed significant improvements in plaque index (PI), sulcus bleeding index (SBI), probing pocket depth (PD), and clinical attachment level (CAL) from baseline to three months, with no significant intergroup differences. The presence of Streptococcus mitis/oralis did not differ significantly between groups at any point. Actinomyces israelii and Fusobacterium nucleatum showed significant differences at baseline but not at three months. Conclusion Within the limits of the study, chitosan membrane showed similar results to tetracycline fibers at 3 months, making it a promising alternate modality in maintenance patients with chronic periodontitis.

                Background Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) is an important nosocomial pathogen with high biofilm-forming ability and multidrug resistance. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of the pgaABCD locus in clinical CRAB isolates and its relationship with biofilm production and antimicrobial resistance. Methods A total of 150 non-duplicate clinical A. baumannii isolates were collected from healthcare facilities in Shahrekord, Iran. Identification was performed by PCR and biochemical tests. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined using disk diffusion, and biofilm formation was assessed by the crystal violet method. PCR was used to detect pgaABCD genes. Hemolytic and proteolytic activities were evaluated on blood and skim milk agar. Statistical analyses included chi-square tests and heatmap clustering of resistance profiles. Results Results showed that all isolates were multidrug-resistant, showing the highest resistance to ciprofloxacin (100%), ceftazidime (90%), and cefepime (86.66%). Of these, 90 (60%) were CRAB, all forming biofilms, with 55.5% producing strong biofilms. Hemolytic activity occurred in 14% of isolates and was significantly associated with strong biofilm formation (p < 0.0001). Proteolytic activity was observed in all isolates without significant association. The pgaA and pgaD genes were detected in 100% of isolates, while pgaB and pgaC were found in 84.4% and 93.3%, respectively. Strong biofilm formation correlated significantly with pgaB (p < 0.0001) and pgaC (p = 0.0002). Heatmap analysis showed higher antibiotic resistance in strong biofilm producers. Conclusion Strong biofilm formation in CRAB is associated with pgaB/pgaC genes and hemolysin production, highlighting the importance of anti-biofilm strategies and molecular monitoring in clinical settings.

                <p>by Fatemeh Keikha, Chuanyuan Wang, Zhixia Yang, Zhi-Ping Liu</p>

The identification of state specific biomarkers that reflect dynamic changes in gene regulatory networks is critical for understanding cancer progression and enhancing diagnostic precision. While multilayer network models have been proposed for analyzing disease evolution, most existing methods rely solely on topological features, neglecting structural rewiring and expression variability across disease states. In this study, we introduce TransMarker, a framework designed to detect genes with regulatory role transitions, those with meaningful shifts in regulatory roles during disease progression, as dynamic biomarkers via cross-state alignment of multi-state single-cell data. TransMarker encodes each disease state as a distinct layer in a multilayer graph, integrating prior interaction data with state-specific expression to construct attributed gene networks. Contextualized embeddings for each stage are generated for each state using Graph Attention Networks (GATs), and structural shifts are quantified via Gromov-Wasserstein optimal transport. Genes with significant changes are ranked using a Dynamic Network Index (DNI), which captures their regulatory variability. These prioritized biomarkers are then applied in a deep neural network for disease state classification. We validate our approach on synthetic simulated and real world dataset of gastric adenocarcinoma (GAC), to evaluate performance across diverse scenarios and assess generalizability. TransMarker outperforms existing multilayer network ranking techniques in classification accuracy, robustness, and biomarker relevance. Ablation studies confirm the contribution of each step to overall performance. Our findings suggest that combining regulatory rewiring, temporal expression dynamics, and cross-state alignment provides a powerful strategy for identifying biologically meaningful biomarkers and modeling disease progression at single cell resolution.

                <p>by Raiki Yoshimura, Naotoshi Nakamura, Takeru Matsuura, Takeo Toshima, Takasuke Fukuhara, Kazuyuki Aihara, Katsuhito Fujiu, Shingo Iwami, Tomoharu Yoshizumi</p>

Liver transplantation is almost the only way to save patients with end-stage liver disease. Particularly, living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) has gained importance in recent years thanks to the shorter waiting times and better graft quality than with deceased donor liver transplantation (DDLT). However, some patients experience graft loss due to unexpected infections, sepsis, or immune-mediated rejection of the transplanted organ. An urgent need exists to clarify which patients experience graft loss. Several models have been proposed, but most analyze the classic DDLT, and knowledge about LDLT is lacking. In this study, we retrospectively analyzed clinical data from 748 patients who underwent LDLT. By adapting machine learning methods, we predicted early graft loss (within 180 days postoperatively) with better performance than conventional models. The model enabled us to stratify a highly heterogeneous sample of patients into five groups. By focusing on survival time, we next categorized the patients into three groups with early, intermediate, and late or no graft loss. Notably, we identified the intermediate-loss group as a distinct population similar to the early-loss population but with different survival times. Additionally, by proposing a hierarchical prediction method, we developed an approach to distinguish these populations using data up to 30 days postoperatively. Our findings will enable the early identification of individuals at risk of graft loss, particularly those in the early- and intermediate-loss groups. This will allow for appropriate patient care, such as switching to DDLT, identifying other living donors for LDLT, or preparing for re-transplantation, leading to a bottom-up improvement in transplant success rates.

                <p>by Roberta Moreira Wichmann, Murilo Afonso Robiati Bigoto, Alexandre Dias Porto Chiavegatto Filho</p>

We evaluated Federated Learning (FL) strategies for predicting COVID-19 mortality using a multicenter sample of 17,022 patients from 21 diverse Brazilian hospitals. We tested horizontal FL architectures employing Logistic Regression (LR) and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) via parameter aggregation, alongside a novel Federated Random Forest (RF) using ensemble aggregation. Performance gain (<i>Δ</i>AUC, calculated as AUC federated minus AUC local) was quantified using bootstrap analysis to determine 95% confidence intervals. FL models demonstrated a beneficial collaborative effect. The average <i>Δ</i>AUC across the network was +0.0018 for LR, +0.0599 for MLP, and +0.0528 for RF. Crucially, the gain’s magnitude and statistical significance showed a strong inverse correlation with local patient volume (N). Substantial and statistically significant gains concentrated in data-limited institutions (N < 500). For example, the smallest hospital (N=86) achieved a remarkable <i>Δ</i>AUC of 0.3682 (95% CI [0.0908, 0.6307]) with the RF model. However, interpreting these benefits requires caution because the 95% CIs for <i>Δ</i>AUC crossed zero for the majority of hospitals, suggesting the collaborative model’s statistical advantage is not universally certain at every site. This trade-off was particularly evident with the MLP model which, despite achieving the highest average <i>Δ</i>AUC, was the most volatile algorithm, registering the maximum performance degradation in the network (<i>Δ</i>AUC = –0.0884, 95% CI [–0.1527, –0.0273]) due to its high sensitivity to local data distribution disparities (non-IID). This study validates FL as an equity-enabling mechanism that effectively enhances predictive capacity where local data scarcity is highest. Our findings underscore that maximizing the most statistically certain benefits of FL requires continuous monitoring and local validation for successful clinical deployment across diverse settings.

                <p>by Daniel Suárez-Barrera, Lucas Bayones, Norberto Encinas-Rodríguez, Sergio Parra, Viktor Monroy, Sebastián Pujalte, Bernardo Andrade-Ortega, Héctor Díaz, Manuel Alvarez, Antonio Zainos, Alessio Franci, Román Rossi-Pool</p>

Spike sorting is one of the cornerstones of extracellular electrophysiology. By leveraging advanced signal processing and data analysis techniques, spike sorting makes it possible to detect, isolate, and map single neuron spiking activity from both in vivo and in vitro extracellular electrophysiological recordings. A crucial step of any spike sorting pipeline is to reduce the dimensionality of the recorded spike waveform data. Reducing the dimensionality of the processed data is a near-universal practice, fundamentally motivated by the use of clustering algorithms responsible to detect, isolate, and sort the recorded putative neurons. In this paper, we propose and illustrate on both synthetic and experimental data that employing the nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) can drastically improve the performance, efficiency, robustness, and scalability of spike sorting pipelines without increasing their computational cost. We show how replacing the linear or ad hoc, expert-defined, supervised nonlinear dimensionality reduction methods commonly used in spike sorting pipelines by the unsupervised, mathematically grounded, nonlinear dimensionality reduction method provided by UMAP drastically increases the number of correctly sorted neurons, makes the identification of quieter, seldom spiking neurons more reliable, enables deeper and more precise explorations and analysis of the neural code, and paves new ways toward more efficient and end-to-end automatable spike sorting pipelines of large-scale extracellular neural recording as those produced by high-density multielectrode arrays.

Amyloid precursor protein (APP)-null mice exhibit significant deficits in motor performance, including reduced grip strength and impaired locomotion; however, the underlying neurophysiological mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we show that conditional knockdown of APP selectively in Purkinje cells (PCs) recapitulates these motor deficits, while exogenous expression of APP in APP-null mice rescues motor function. Electrophysiological analysis revealed that APP deficiency leads to aberrant firing patterns in PCs and reduces inhibitory synaptic transmission onto neurons of the deep cerebellar nucleus (DCN). We identified a marked reduction in Nav1.6-mediated sodium currents as the key mechanism underlying abnormal action potential firing and propagation in APP-deficient PCs. Importantly, all electrophysiological and behavioral deficits were rescued by PC-specific APP reconstitution. These findings reveal a novel and essential role for APP in cerebellar motor control by regulating Nav1.6 channel activity and PC excitability.

                <p>by Romuald Haase, Bingjian Ren, Albert Tell i Puig, Alessandro Bonavoglia, Jean-Baptiste Marq, Rémy Visentin, Nicolas Dos Santos Pacheco, Bohumil Maco, Ricardo Mondragón-Flores, Oscar Vadas, Dominique Soldati-Favre</p>

The conoid is a dynamic, tubulin-based structure conserved across the Apicomplexa that undergoes extrusion during egress, gliding motility, and invasion in <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i>. This organelle traverses the apical polar ring (APR) in response to calcium waves and plays a critical role in controlling parasite motility. While the actomyosin-dependent extrusion of the conoid is beginning to be elucidated, the mechanism by which it remains apically anchored to the APR is still unclear. RNG2, a protein localized to both the conoid and the APR, has emerged as a strong candidate for mediating this connection. Biochemical analysis revealed that RNG2 is an unstable protein, undergoing extensive proteolytic cleavage both in the parasite and in heterologous expression systems. Its biochemical properties, with the presence of large coiled-coil domains, likely facilitate the formation of concatenated assemblies, enabling RNG2 to serve as a dynamic and resilient bridge between the conoid and the APR. Using a combination of iterative ultrastructure expansion microscopy and immunoelectron microscopy, we confirmed the localization of RNG2 to the 22 tethering elements bridging the APR and the conoid. Conditional depletion of RNG2 led to the striking detachment of the intact conoid organelle from the APR, supporting an essential role for RNG2 as a tether. Cryo-electron tomography of conoid-less parasites revealed that, in the absence of RNG2, the apical vesicle remains anchored to the plasma membrane, while the rhoptries follow the detached conoid. Although RNG2 depletion only mildly reduces microneme secretion, the parasites are immotile and exhibit impaired rhoptry discharge, highlighting the critical role of proper conoid anchorage in motility and host cell invasion. Comprehensive mutagenesis of RNG2 identified distinct regions responsible for binding to the conoid and the APR, and demonstrated that the full-length, intact protein is essential for bridging these two structures and for its functional activity. Altogether, RNG2 emerges as a pivotal protein that ensures conoid functionality and coordination in Coccidia.

Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), a critical cell cycle regulator, is associated with cancer progression and negatively correlates with patient survival in cutaneous melanoma based on clinical database analysis. In a melanoma mouse model induced by <i>BRaf</i><sup>CA</sup> mutation and <i>Pten</i>-deficiency, we observed that PLK1 overexpression mediated metabolic reprogramming to markedly accelerate tumor growth, promote metastasis, and shortened mice survival. Mechanistically, PLK1 stabilizes BTB domain and CNC homolog 1 (BACH1), which serves as a crucial transcription factor for genes involved in cancer metabolism and metastasis. Moreover, the PLK1/BACH1 axis confers resistance to Vemurafenib, a BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> inhibitor, in melanoma. In light of this finding, we attempted an innovative pharmacological combination targeting both BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> and PLK1, identifying a synergistic efficiency to this approach to suppress tumor growth. Overall, we have discovered a novel function of PLK1 that is independent of the cell cycle, which could pave new ways for melanoma therapies.

                <p>by Lin Xie, Lijuan Gao, Weihong Fu, Gangyun Wu, Hua Li, Wenxiu Ning</p>

Decoding the complexities of signaling pathways is fundamental for deciphering the mechanisms underlying tissue development, homeostasis, and disease pathogenesis. Proximity labeling tools have been instrumental in identifying upstream or downstream effectors of specific proteins within signaling pathways. However, currently, there are no tools available to directly label and capture intermediary proteins that bridge two non-interacting proteins. Here, we developed Split-TurboID and PUP-IT based Protein Identification Tool (STUPPIT), a novel method combining split-TurboID and PUP-IT to biotinylate intermediary proteins of two non-interacting proteins through a two-step enzymatic reaction. STUPPIT was validated using three well-characterized protein triads, including YAP1/AMOT/β-actin, YAP1/LATS1/MOB1A, and β-catenin/α-catenin/β-actin using HEK293T human cell lines. Combining STUPPIT and proteomics, we identified novel intermediary proteins including ERC1 and USP7, which interacted both with β-catenin and SMAD4, key components of the Wnt and BMP signaling pathways. In conclusion, STUPPIT represents a powerful tool for labeling and capturing intermediary proteins between non-interacting partners, offering new insights into protein-protein interactions and advancing signal transduction research.

                The visual system can function across variable scene statistics and behavioral contexts. This flexibility arises in part from neural feedback, which shapes visual processing to align with prevailing stimulus conditions and behavioral goals. In the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, extensive genetic and connectome resources allow feedback connections of identified cells to be linked to their functions in the visual system. Here, we review key mechanisms and functions of feedback in the Drosophila visual system, drawing parallels to vertebrate models, where feedback also plays an important role in visual processing. We conclude by arguing that connectomes are critical in this task and that cracking feedback circuits in flies can help guide our understanding of feedback in larger brains.

                Brodin and Shupliakov demonstrate that synaptic activity triggers the formation of an actin cage that encapsulates the synaptic vesicle cluster. Disruption of this cage leads to the detachment of the cluster from the release site. These findings explain how the synaptic vesicle liquid phase can remain in place during activity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/95607">Generation of biophysical neuron model parameters from recorded electrophysiological responses</a></h4>

              
                Recent advances in connectomics, biophysics, and neuronal electrophysiology warrant modeling of neurons with further details in both network interaction and cellular dynamics. Such models may be referred to as ElectroPhysiome, as they incorporate the connectome and individual neuron electrophysiology to simulate neuronal activities. The nervous system of <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> is considered a viable framework for such ElectroPhysiome studies due to advances in connectomics of its somatic nervous system and electrophysiological recordings of neuron responses. In order to achieve a simulated ElectroPhysiome, the set of parameters involved in modeling individual neurons needs to be estimated from electrophysiological recordings. Here, we address this challenge by developing a deep generative estimation method called ElectroPhysiomeGAN (EP-GAN), which, once trained, can instantly generate parameters associated with the Hodgkin–Huxley neuron model (HH-model) for multiple neurons with graded potential response. The method combines generative adversarial network (GAN) architecture with recurrent neural network encoder and can generate an extensive number of parameters (&gt;170) given the neuron’s membrane potential responses and steady-state current profiles. We validate our method by estimating HH-model parameters for 200 simulated neurons with graded membrane potential followed by nine experimentally recorded neurons (where six of them are newly recorded) in the nervous system of <i>C. elegans</i>. Comparison of EP-GAN with existing estimation methods shows EP-GAN's advantage in the accuracy of estimated parameters and inference speed for both small and large numbers of parameters being inferred. In addition, the architecture of EP-GAN permits input with arbitrary clamping protocols, allowing inference of parameters even when partial membrane potential and steady-state currents profiles are given as inputs. EP-GAN is designed to leverage the generative capability of GAN to align with the dynamical structure of the HH-model and thus is able to achieve such performance.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/107132">RBMX2 links Mycobacterium bovis infection to epithelial–mesenchymal transition and lung cancer progression</a></h4>

              
                Tuberculosis (TB) is a complex disease caused by the interaction of pathogen, host, and environmental factors. In 2022, TB affected 10.6 million people and caused 1.3 million deaths globally. In high-burden zoonotic TB regions, <i>Mycobacterium bovis</i> accounts for ~10% of human TB cases. The immune evasion and latency of <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> hinder understanding of host responses. Here, we identify RNA-binding motif protein X-linked 2 (RBMX2) as a novel host factor facilitating <i>M. bovis</i> infection. RBMX2 expression is significantly upregulated in multiple cell types, including EBL, BoMac, bovine alveolar primary cells, and human A549 cells. Multi-omics analyses, cell adhesion assays, and ChIP-PCR demonstrate that RBMX2 suppresses cell adhesion and tight junctions while enhancing <i>M. bovis</i> adhesion and invasion via p65 signaling. Integrated transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic data reveal that RBMX2 regulates epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process linked to cancer progression. TIMER2.0 analysis shows elevated RBMX2 expression in lung adenocarcinoma and lung squamous cell carcinoma tissues, validated by immunofluorescence. Using an <i>M. bovis</i>-induced BoMac-EBL EMT model and H1299 cells, we show that RBMX2 promotes EMT through p65/MMP-9 pathway activation. Collectively, RBMX2 is a novel host factor that enhances <i>M. bovis</i> infection and drives infection-induced EMT. These findings provide new insight into TB pathogenesis and highlight RBMX2 as a potential target for TB vaccine and therapeutic development.

Using whole blood RNAseq, we sought to identify gene expression associated with plasma pTau217 and to determine whether APOE{epsilon}4, sex, and neocortical A{beta}-PET burden further amplify these associations in 724 participants from the Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic Alzheimer's (A4) and Longitudinal Evaluation of Amyloid Risk and Neurodegeneration (LEARN) Studies. 1,540 genes were moderated by A{beta}-PET, and 772 genes were moderated by both A{beta}-PET and sex. Our findings include genes previously associated with AD (e.g., TREML2) and implicate biological functions such as chromatin remodeling, lipid signaling, and RNA processing that interact with A{beta}-PET and sex to impact plasma pTau217. Our results underscore the complexity of molecular mechanisms that can be linked to plasma pTau217, particularly in the context of elevated A{beta}-PET.

">Visual perceptual learning enhances functional connectivity in retinotopic space</a></h4>

              
                Repeated exposure to perceptual tasks improves behavioral performance. Several neural mechanisms have been proposed to account for such perceptual learning. Computational modeling suggests that plasticity in the connectivity between cortical sites may be responsible, by increasing the fidelity with which task-relevant information is transmitted through sensory hierarchies. Here we explore this theory in humans using fMRI, testing the hypothesis that perceptual learning at one location in space will increase functional connectivity between voxels in visual areas that are tuned to that retinotopic location. Participants learned to detect one of two novel visual shape contours embedded in a noisy background in different visual quadrants. At baseline, there was no difference in behavioral sensitivity for the two shapes, nor a difference in functional connectivity between voxels in V1 and V4 responsive to the retinotopic locations of the two shapes. After training, there was a robust and selective improvement in perceptual detection of the trained shape relative to the control shape, along with increased functional connectivity between V1 and V4 voxels coding for the location of the trained shape in retinotopic space. Moreover, this increase in functional connectivity for the trained versus control shape predicted the improvement in behavioral sensitivity across participants. These results are consistent with the proposal that perceptual learning alters network dynamics so as to enhance the processing of behaviorally relevant information.

">Negative-Valence Neurons in the Larval Zebrafish Pallium</a></h4>

              
                An organism's survival depends on the rapid classification of sensory events as either harmful or beneficial. In mammals, this computation is partially performed by neurons in the amygdala that respond to signals with negative or positive valence. The larval zebrafish pallium is thought to contain homologs of the mammalian amygdala, isocortex, and hippocampus; however, the signals encoded by pallial neurons remain largely uncharacterized. Using two-photon light sheet microscopy to image 7-9 day old zebrafish that express pan-neuronal GCaMP6s, we recorded calcium dynamics throughout the brain while presenting a panel of strongly aversive stimuli, infrared heat, electric shock, and a whole-field looming shadow, together with milder threats including vibration, loud sound, light transitions, and a partial looming stimulus. A compact cluster of neurons in the rostrolateral dorsal pallium (Rl) responded vigorously to strongly noxious and fully looming stimuli, but not to the milder cues. In contrast, neurons in the ventromedial pallium and habenula responded to all stimuli tested. Rl neurons are marked by high expression of tiam2a, suggesting that they could be accessed genetically. Our results identify a dedicated negative valence locus in the teleost pallium and underscore evolutionary conservation of valence coding circuits.

">TDP-43 suppression of ATP8A2 cryptic splicing implicates phosphatidylserine-driven neuroinflammation in ALS/FTD</a></h4>

              
                Inappropriate externalization of phosphatidylserine (PS) is a candidate mechanism of pathogenic neuroinflammation, a critical driver of neurodegenerative disease. ATP8A2, a flippase that maintains PS on the plasma membrane inner leaflet, is mutated in both Wabbler- lethal mice and patients with the ataxia syndrome CAMRQ4. Here, we identify ATP8A2 as a target of TDP-43 cryptic exon suppression, and demonstrate that ATP8A2 loss leads to immune-mediated neurodegeneration. ATP8A2 splicing is significantly dysregulated following TDP-43 depletion in human neurons and in brains of patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis-Frontotemporal Dementia (ALS-FTD). In mice, Atp8a2 loss increases PS exposure and promotes neuroinflammation. Depletion of peripheral macrophages rescues motor axon degeneration and doubles Atp8a2 knockout mouse lifespan, while depletion of both peripheral macrophages and central microglia quadruples lifespan and improves coordination. Hence, ATP8A2 is a pathologically relevant TDP-43 target and inhibition of phagocytic immune cell attack against neurons is a potential treatment for patients with CAMRQ4 and ALS-FTD.

">Characterization of hippocampal subfields using histology-based annotated postmortem MRI: Lessons for in vivo segmentation II</a></h4>

              
                High-resolution in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of hippocampal subfields is a rapidly advancing field due to their implication in cognition, disorder, and disease. Hippocampal subfield segmentation on in vivo MRI is generally guided by postmortem reference material, which has been limited by small sample sizes that preclude comprehensive characterization of subfield border locations and their variability. Addressing this, we characterized hippocampal subfield border variability in two ultra-high-resolution postmortem MRI datasets with combined annotated histological sections, including cases with and without dementia. We examined: 1) the order of appearance and disappearance of subfields along the long axis of the hippocampus; 2) the order of appearance and disappearance of subicular subregions; 3) the medial-lateral position of subicular subregional boundaries along the hippocampal body; 4) the location of the CA3 relative to hippocampal head digitations; 5) the subfield borders in the hippocampal body relative to a volume proportion of the dark band; and 6) the association of hippocampal length and subiculum-CA1 border location with diagnosis, demographic factors, and factors related to postmortem imaging. Our findings reaffirmed that there is a consistent order of appearance and disappearance of subfields in the hippocampal head and tail, respectively. The subicular subregions exhibited a "first in, last out" order of appearance and disappearance, and pre/parasubiculum consistently occupied half of the subicular complex in coronal slices throughout the hippocampal body. Hippocampal head digitations were not a reliable landmark for CA3 appearance, but SRLM proportionality did offer a potentially consistent approach for estimating CA2 and CA3 subfield borders in relation to the hippocampal border. No clear relationship was found between the anatomical features and diagnosis, demographic factors, and factors related to postmortem imaging. These findings have implications for the development and harmonization of hippocampal subfield segmentation protocols and interpretation of high-resolution functional MRI studies of the human hippocampus.

">Less is more: uncompensated gravity torques for intuitive EMG-based assistance with a robotic exoskeleton</a></h4>

              
                Despite extensive investigation on the use of electromyographic (EMG) activity to control active exoskeletons over the past decade, designing intuitive assistive controllers that seamlessly integrate with natural human motor control have yet to be realized. While existing EMG-based controllers often achieve substantial reduction in muscle effort, they frequently incur increased cognitive and attentional load for the user, thereby compromising the overall efficacy of the assistance. Here we introduce a novel EMG-based assistive controller founded upon neuroscience principles, specifically the observation that humans naturally exploit gravity torque to facilitate movement control. Therefore, deviating from conventional compensation strategies, our approach purposely leaves a fraction of the predicted human gravity torque uncompensated so that users can still take advantage of gravity as they would without assistance. Through a load-carrying arm movement task, we show that enabling gravity exploitation improves traditional EMG-based assistance by achieving a significant reduction in muscle effort, while concurrently yielding superior kinematic performance (i.e., faster, smoother movements) and enhanced subjective user experience. These findings demonstrate that integrating principles from neural motor control into assistive controllers allows to implement a favorable tradeoff between muscle effort reduction and functional usability.

">Learning dynamically regulates stimulus discrimination of ventral striatal D1 receptor expressing neurons</a></h4>

              
                Animals encounter a barrage of sensory stimuli, but only a subset of these are associated with appetitive outcomes, highlighting the importance of neural mechanisms for learning to distinguish reward-paired from unpaired cues. The ventral striatum plays a critical role in both reinforcement learning and stimulus discrimination, but the effect of learning on the selectivity of different cell types remains unclear. Here we examined ventral striatal D1 and D2 medium spiny neuron (MSN) firing properties as mice learned to distinguish between reward-paired and unpaired cues. As learning progressed within a single session, D1 MSN selectivity increased linearly with behavioral selectivity, while D2 MSNs exhibited only modest, behaviorally uncorrelated changes in activity. Altered D1 MSN selectivity was primarily attributed to attenuated excitatory responses to the unrewarded cue, and increasing D1 MSN activity during the unrewarded cue impaired behavioral selectivity. Together, these findings reveal significantly more dynamic contributions of D1 MSNs to stimulus discrimination learning.

                Mammalian brain cell identity is shaped by intrinsic factors and external context. We present a spatially resolved transcriptomic and gene regulatory atlas of cell types found across all subcortical brain regions in a primate - the marmoset monkey. Dense sampling and cross-species integrations revealed spatially precise neuronal assemblies, including in complex structures such as hypothalamus. We find chromatin accessibility and transcriptional identity are spatially tuned within and across subcortical structures. Spatial gradients within subfields of the hippocampal formation are predominantly orchestrated by graded transcription factors coupled with graded enhancers. The primate-expanded population of GABAergic neurons in the thalamus shares transcriptional and regulatory syntax with neurons in superior colliculus, reflecting an evolutionary adaptation compared with rodents. We show that unexpected transcriptional convergence, such as between striatal GABAergic medium spiny neurons and telencephalic glutamatergic neurons, can arise when distinct gene regulatory networks impinge on the same downstream genes.

                The basal ganglia are interconnected subcortical nuclei with complex topographical organization that orchestrate goal-directed behaviors and are implicated in neurodegenerative movement disorders. We generated a cellular-resolution, spatial transcriptomic atlas of the basal ganglia in human, rhesus macaque, and common marmoset, sampling over one million cells in each species. By integrating spatial data with a cross-species, consensus snRNA-seq cell type taxonomy, this atlas reveals conserved principles of molecular organization within and across structures. The cellular architecture is complex but highly stereotyped, with gene expression gradients superimposed onto discrete compartments. Extensive spatial sampling illuminates 3D gradients of molecular organization in the striatum and reveals cell type-specific core and shell compartments in the primate internal globus pallidus, which is conserved with mouse. This unified, cross-species spatial transcriptomic atlas will be a foundational resource for characterizing the molecular and functional organization of the basal ganglia and their roles in health and disease.

">Localized mRNAs and protein synthesis in cortical layer 1</a></h4>

              
                Cortical layer 1 plays an essential role for brain function, integrating many streams of information and undergoing synaptic plasticity during learning. Yet, we understand little of the underlying molecular processes, and whether they are specialized to achieve layer-specific functions. Here, we show that layer 1 and its synapses are metabolically active. Using laser capture RNA-sequencing and fluorescence in situ hybridization, we report an abundance of synaptic transcripts localized to layer 1. We purified layer 1 excitatory and inhibitory synapses and characterized their enriched transcriptomes, identifying candidate proteins that can be locally synthesized to maintain and regulate synaptic transmission in layer 1. Furthermore, we find significant differences between the transcriptome of synapses in layer 1 and in deeper, somatic layers, suggesting that local translation might confer specialized function. Finally, by comparing our tissue data with the transcriptome from the hippocampal CA1 strata, we discover a strong similarity between cortical layer 1 and stratum lacunosum moleculare, suggesting that these distal layers share a common molecular environment. Together, our results establish that local protein synthesis is an important mechanism for layer 1, and provide the first comprehensive characterization of the transcripts localized to layer 1 and its synapses.

">Independent Lateralization of Language, Attention, and Numerical Cognition Across Task and Rest</a></h4>

              
                Hemispheric functional complementarity is a core organizational principle of the human brain, yet the extent to which lateralization in one domain constrains that of others remains unclear. Two main accounts have been proposed: the causal hypothesis, in which dominance for one function drives complementary dominance in another, and the statistical hypothesis, in which each function lateralizes independently. Using multimodal fMRI in 287 participants from the BIL&GIN cohort, we examined whether language lateralization phenotypes, defined as typical (left-dominant) or atypical (right-dominant), predict hemispheric asymmetries in visuospatial attention and numerical cognition. Task-based activation was measured during line bisection, mental calculation, and numerical interval comparison, and analyzed within domain-specific, functionally defined network atlases. Resting-state functional connectivity metrics were also assessed in the same networks. Across both attention and numerical domains, typical individuals for language showed stronger asymmetries, whereas atypical individuals exhibited weaker, more bilateral patterns. Critically, atypical participants did not show mirror-reversed asymmetries, and language phenotype did not influence intrinsic connectivity metrics in non-language networks. These findings challenge the notion that atypical lateralization represents an inversion of the canonical template and argue against a universal reciprocal link between language dominance and other cognitive domains. Instead, our results support a domain-specific model in which lateralization profiles are shaped by distinct developmental and functional constraints, highlighting the need for multimodal, multi-domain approaches to brain asymmetry.

">WWOX deficiency uncovers a cell-autonomous mechanism impairing myelin repair</a></h4>

              
                Remyelination is essential for neuronal function and plasticity, and its failure contributes to multiple sclerosis (MS) and other neurodegenerative disorders. Yet, the molecular programs governing oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) differentiation and remyelination remain incompletely defined. Here, we identify the WW domain-containing oxidoreductase (WWOX) as a critical cell-autonomous regulator of oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelin repair. Reanalysis of single-nucleus RNA sequencing from MS lesions revealed WWOX as one of the most significantly dysregulated oligodendroglial genes. Conditional deletion of Wwox in oligodendroglia impaired OPC differentiation, favouring aberrant proliferation and blocking myelin regeneration after cuprizone-induced demyelination. Single-nucleus transcriptomics confirmed profound transcriptional reprogramming in WWOX-deficient oligodendroglia during remyelination, with enrichment of WNT and TGFb; signalling and cell cycle programs. Mechanistically, WWOX physically interacts with the master transcription factor SOX10 via its WW1 domain, stabilising SOX10 protein and sustaining its downstream myelin gene network. Loss of WWOX reduced SOX10 stability and activity, providing a direct mechanistic link to defective OPC differentiation. Together, our findings uncover WWOX as an essential orchestrator of remyelination and position the WWOX-SOX10 axis as a promising therapeutic target for enhancing myelin repair in MS and related demyelinating disorders.

">Comparative Analysis of FOXP2 Expression in the Thalamus of Mice, Rats, and Macaques: Implications for the Evolution of Language Circuits.</a></h4>

              
                FOXP2 is a transcription factor essential for the development and function of neural circuits involved in language. Although its expression has been extensively characterized in the cortex and basal ganglia, its organization within the adult thalamus remains poorly understood. In this study, we present a comparative analysis of FoxP2 protein expression across thalamic nuclei in mice, rats, and macaques, with a focus on nuclei associated with higher-order cognitive functions and language-related circuits in humans. We found that FoxP2 is expressed in most thalamic nuclei across species, with a consistent absence in the reticular nucleus and zona incerta. Expression was highest in midline and intralaminar nuclei, whereas the anterior group showed low and variable expression among species. Macaques exhibited broader and, in some nuclei, more intense FoxP2 expression, particularly in associative regions such as the pulvinar, lateral geniculate, and parts of the ventral group, indicating increased specialization of thalamocortical pathways. This distribution suggests a conserved role for FoxP2 in shaping thalamic circuits supporting sensorimotor integration, attention, memory, and linguistic processing. Phylogenetic comparisons further indicate that enhanced FoxP2 expression in associative thalamic territories in primates, likely intensified in humans, may have contributed to the evolution of neural circuits required for speech and language. These findings provide molecular and anatomical insights into how FoxP2 helps organize thalamocortical networks relevant both to language function and to neuropsychiatric disorders involving thalamocortical dysconnectivity.

">Dynamic methylation changes in Alzheimers disease-related genes during mindfulness practice - a proof-of-concept study</a></h4>

              
                Background: Mindfulness meditation has gained significant attention in the context of Alzheimer's disease (AD) due to its potential effects on the prevention of cognitive decline and overall psychological well-being. The epigenetic landscape of this complex neurodegenerative disorder can be influenced by environmental factors. Mindfulness practices could actively shape the biological response to AD by modifying the underlying molecular mechanisms through epigenetic regulation. Methods: A group of 17 long-term mindfulness meditators (MMs) and 17 sex- and age-matched controls were recruited. Experienced MMs participated in a 1-month Vipassana meditation retreat. Blood DNA methylation levels of differentially methylated genes (ABCA7, ADAM10, APOE, HOXA3, NXN, TREM2 and TREML2) previously validated in a predictive AD-model found analyzed by bisulfite pyrosequencing. Results: An increase in DNA methylation was observed for ADAM10, APOE, HOXA3 and TREM2 in MMs with respect to controls. Furthermore, significant differences were found for ABCA7, ADAM10, APOE and HOXA3 in MMs after retreat. Conclusions: DNA methylation changes identified for ADAM10 and HOXA3 in MMs are in the opposite direction to those occurring in AD and may constitute a protective epigenetic alteration. Mindfulness practice could counteract DNA methylation of key AD genes as a possible preventive strategy or non-pharmacological intervention in AD patients.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Visual perceptual decoding of facial expressions is a key focus in affective neuroscience. Developing a mapping model between visual content and signals is crucial for decoding. Most previous visual decoding models focused on brain responses to static images, neglecting temporal-dynamic feature modeling. Additionally, they input all visual cortices as a whole into the model, overlooking that visual information flows bidirectionally between the lower and higher visual cortices based on bottom-up and top-down visual mechanisms, thus hard to capture bidirectional information between visual regions located in different spatial positions. Here, we present a spatio-temporal bidirectional long short-term memory-based model to decode 3 categories of facial expressions from multi-time functional magnetic resonance imaging data. Specifically, we used the spatio-temporal bidirectional long short-term memory module with the ability to simulate time series to grasp the temporal-dependence from visual cortices, and its forward and backward directions simulate bidirectional information flow between visual cortices to capture the bidirectional spatial information. Experimental outcomes indicate that the mean decoding accuracy employing beta estimates of multi-time response signals (Repetition Times（TR）1-6 1 to 6) from 5 participants is significantly higher than that of other time points signals, unidirectional connections, and publicly available models. These results reveal that our model captures temporal-dependencies and bidirectional spatial information from the visual cortices, enhancing decoding performance.</span>

Repetitive Transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a safe and potent strategy for altering brain connectivity. However, it remains unclear if rTMS modulates ISP. With pretreatment of baclofen, a GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor agonist, this study characterized rTMS effects on ISP and the influence of GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor neurotransmission. ISP was measured with TMS and electroencephalography co-registration (TMS-EEG). Excitatory rTMS (&gt; 5 Hz) was found to increase interhemispheric inhibition indexed by ISP. This effect was reduced by baclofen pretreatment, potentially reflecting competition for GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors neurotransmission between baclofen and rTMS. Beyond evoked potentials, our data also identified TMS-evoked gamma oscillation as a reliable indicator of intracortical inhibition. These novel findings help to clarify the effects of rTMS on interhemispheric connectivity, which may help to optimize rTMS treatments for various psychiatric disorders.</span>

Mounting evidence suggests that subtle variations in respiratory patterns—including their neural underpinnings—may serve as sensitive indicators of affective processes, yet the specific phases of spontaneous breathing have rarely been studied in detail. Here, we present a cross-sectional, exploratory investigation combining high-temporal-resolution respiratory measures, resting-state magnetoencephalography data, and psychological assessments in 46 healthy adults. Our analysis distinguishes three distinct phases—inspiration, expiration, and the brief but functionally significant post-expiratory pause (PEP). By correlating time-averaged Salience Network connectivity with aggregate respiratory metrics, we identify trait-level associations specific to the PEP in beta and gamma frequencies. Individuals with longer and more variable PEPs show distinct connectivity patterns associated with heightened depression and reduced life satisfaction. Connectivity patterns involving the right insula, bilateral anterior cingulate cortex, and left amygdala show robust correlations with these affective parameters, suggesting that this brief respiratory interval may serve as a window into interoceptive and emotional processing.

Scientific investigations of goal-directed action have emphasized either of two different aspects of this capacity.

Meanwhile, research on voluntary action has emphasized the processes of endogenous generation and autonomy, which are essential for many complex problems, particularly those involving creativity and insight. Because many complex problems can be solved in several ways, choosing and generating a path through the problem space requires a convergence of executive intelligence and volitional control. Here we use fMRI to explore the links between volition and problem-solving in the human brain. Participants performed the Tower of London task (a classical neuropsychological problem-solving challenge) either by generating their own solutions or by following stepwise instructions for each move. We showed behavioral signatures of action planning, associated with a distributed network of frontal and parietal activations, when participants generated their own solutions. We also showed the crucial role of medial frontal cortex, traditionally associated with endogenous generation of very simple willed actions, in goal-directed problem-solving, based on its connectivity with a wider prefrontal network.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Insomnia disorder is the most common sleep disorder affecting millions of people. Brain research has linked insomnia to dysfunction in large-scale brain networks, not only during sleep but also in wakeful rest. Yet, the underlying brain dynamics remain little understood. In the present study, we directly addressed this using a data-driven framework for evaluating time-varying large-scale brain activity. We used functional magnetic imaging to compare participants with insomnia disorder to matched controls with no sleep complaints. Using Hidden Markov modeling (HMM) for a completely data-driven characterization of the brain dynamics of whole-brain activity, we found that insomnia disorder is characterized by significantly reduced switching rates between large-scale brain states. In particular, HMM was used to compare insomnia patients to controls, which showed that their brains spent significantly less time in two whole-brain states—the default mode network and a fronto-parietal network—complemented by increased time spent in a global activation state. Overall, the findings reveal the brain dynamics of insomnia to show that insomnia disorder is characterized by less flexible transitions between brain states at wakeful rest. This highlights the importance of evaluating the spatiotemporal dynamics of brain activity to advance the understanding of the neural underpinnings of insomnia disorder.</span>

">Lipid Nanoparticles Enable mRNA Delivery to Diverse Cell Types of the Inner Retina</a></h4>

              
                Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have emerged as a promising platform for retinal genetic therapy, offering a non-viral alternative to adeno-associated viruses (AAVs). While LNPs can transfect outer retinal cells, their tropism for inner retinal cell types remains insufficiently characterized. Here, we systematically assessed cellular tropism of conventional LNPs encapsulating chemically modified mRNA encoding mCherry in murine retinal explants and dissociated retinal cells. We compared quasi-subretinal and quasi-intravitreal administrations and evaluated how retinal degeneration and inner limiting membrane (ILM) integrity influence LNP-mediated transfections. We observed that LNPs efficiently transfected Muller glia under all experimental conditions. In addition, LNPs transfected several other retinal cell types, including neurons in dissociated cells and explants, and vascular cells exclusively in explants. Subretinal delivery resulted in significantly higher transfection rates than intravitreal administration, and overall efficiency was higher in degenerate as compared to non-degenerate healthy retinas. In healthy retinas, removal of ILM-associated barriers significantly increased transfection efficiency following intravitreal administration. Together, these findings demonstrate that conventional LNPs can transfect a broader range of retinal cell types than previously recognized and highlight LNPs as a versatile tool for mRNA delivery to the retina, with applications in gene supplementation, gene editing, and regenerative therapies for inner retinal disorders.

">From Syllables to Words: EEG Evidence of Different Age Trajectories in Speech Tracking and Statistical Learning in Infants at High and Low Likelihood for Autism</a></h4>

              
                Delayed onset of canonical babbling and first words is often reported in infants later diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Identifying the neural mechanisms underlying language acquisition in ASD is therefore critical to inform early diagnosis, prognosis, and intervention strategies. In this study, we investigated two speech processing mechanisms previously identified as atypical in children and adults with ASD: the neural ability to track syllables; and statistical learning (SL), the capacity to detect speech regularities beneath surface variability. We recorded 83 longitudinal high-density EEGs from 44 infants (2.5-22.6 months) at high (HL) and low (LL) likelihood for ASD and assessed their verbal outcomes at 20 months. Neural entrainment was measured at syllable and word frequencies during exposure to a multi-speaker stream of concatenated tri-syllabic words, followed by a word recognition test using ERP recording. Our findings revealed reduced tracking abilities at the syllabic level in HL infants, a measure that correlated with verbal outcomes. While HL infants did not exhibit deficits in SL itself, they displayed reduced novelty orientation during the word recognition test, indicated by a reduced late ERP. By contrast, multi-talker variability temporarily disrupted word segmentation around 12 months in LL infants, but not in HL infants, potentially reflecting decreased sensitivity to human voices in the HL group. These results emphasize the importance of longitudinal protocols employing online, implicit measures to track the hierarchical stages of speech processing in both HL and LL infants.

                Background Complications during the puerperium present abnormal conditions that can jeopardize the health and well-being of both mother and newborn. These complications are significant contributors to maternal morbidity and mortality worldwide. This systematic review aims to identify and synthesize evidence on the factors associated with postpartum disease complications. Methods This systematic review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD420251013692). A comprehensive search was performed using electronic databases, including Scopus and PubMed, to identify relevant studies published between 2014 and 2024. Eligible studies included full-text, peer-reviewed articles that used quantitative or qualitative designs and addressed postpartum complications in accordance with the PEO framework. Descriptive analysis was used to synthesize findings. Results A total of 907 records were identified, and 13 studies met the inclusion criteria. The findings highlight a range of factors significantly associated with postpartum complications, including postpartum hemorrhage, maternal age >35 years, depressive and anxiety disorders, preeclampsia, multiple pregnancies, type of vaginal delivery, infant-related health concerns, childhood trauma, low social support, low educational attainment of both mothers and husbands, perceived social isolation, and marital dissatisfaction. While early detection and intervention were not directly evaluated in these studies, the identification of these risk factors suggests that targeted screening and supportive strategies may be beneficial in mitigating postpartum complications. Conclusions This review identifies multiple psychosocial, demographic, and clinical factors associated with postpartum complications. These findings underscore the importance of early detection and comprehensive postpartum care to mitigate risks and improve maternal health outcomes.

                Background Mutations in the viral genome of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can enhance its pathogenicity by affecting its transmissibility, disease severity, and overall mortality in human populations. In addition to mutations within the coding region of SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins, there have been reports of mutations in other SARS-CoV-2 proteins that affect virulence, such as open reading frame 3a (ORF3a), which is involved in viral replication. The expression of ORF3a in host cells activates cell death signaling, leading to tissue damage, which affects the severity of COVID-19. The ORF3a-Q57H variant is the most frequent and recurrent variant of ORF3a and is likely associated with increased transmissibility but lower mortality in the 4th epidemic wave of COVID-19 in Hong Kong. Computational structural modeling predicted that the Q57H variant destabilizes the protein structure of ORF3a, which may result in reduced protein expression in human cells. However, it is still unknown how this mutation affects ORF3a protein function and, if so, whether it can change the severity of host cell damage. Methods Plasmids carrying SARS-CoV-2-ORF3a from Wuhan-Hu-1 strain (i.e., wild-type; WT) and its variant Q57H were transiently transfected into HEK293T cells and used for biochemical and cell biological assays. Results SARS-CoV-2-ORF3a-Q57H variant exhibits similar protein expression in whole cell lysates compared to WT, but less expression at the plasma membrane. ORF3a-Q57H expression results in less apoptosis in host cells compared to WT via lower activation of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. Conclusion The relatively mild phenotype of the SARS-CoV-2-ORF3a-Q57H variant may result from alterations to ORF3a function by this mutation, rather than its protein expression levels in host cells.

">Dissociating the neural codes for multiple pitch perception in humans</a></h4>

              
                Pitch is crucial for speech and music perception, yet its neural code remains contested. The classic "rate-place" theory suggests that pitch is computed from spatial patterns of average neural firing rates along the cochlear tonotopic axis. These cues are thought to be robust for isolated harmonic complex tones (HCTs) but degraded for spectrally dense mixtures of simultaneous HCTs (e.g., musical chords) due to auditory filtering. In many cases, pitch perception remains feasible for HCT mixtures, but it is unclear whether listeners utilize residual rate-place cues or alternative neural codes. To adjudicate between these possibilities, we generated rate-place metamers (META), which are synthetic stimuli with simulated auditory-nerve average-rate responses that are nearly identical to those of original pitch-evoking stimuli (ORIG). Using these stimuli, listeners completed four psychophysical experiments that spanned a wide range of acoustic and cognitive complexity, from single-HCT pitch discrimination to harmonic-expectation judgments. Combining the behavioral data with predictive models of listener performance, we found that listener performance on single pitch discrimination tasks could be adequately explained by a rate-place model, with or without simultaneous pitch maskers (Experiments 1 and 2). More complex tasks involving attention to all pitches in a three-pitch mixture (Experiments 3 and 4) showed a pattern of results more difficult to account for with a rate-place model, perhaps suggesting a role for integration of temporal cues.

">Inter-areal coupling for cognition through coincident oscillatory transients</a></h4>

              
                How do large-scale brain networks interact to enable cognition? Correlated oscillations, a mechanism for inter-areal interactions, can be expressed as phase coherence or amplitude co-fluctuations. While considerable work has investigated the functional roles of phase coherence, little is known about whether and how the coincidence of high-amplitude oscillations across the cortex can impact cognition. Here, we demonstrate that inter-areal amplitude-coupling related to cognitive dynamics mainly reflects coincident oscillatory transients, rather than sustained oscillations. Capitalizing on the spatio-temporal resolution of brain-wide magnetoencephalography (MEG) during a behavioral task probing attention and decision-making our findings reveal behaviorally relevant transient oscillatory networks: First, coincidences of oscillatory transients in the alpha and beta frequency range increase prior to correct decisions in a parieto-frontal network. Second, during attention allocation coincident oscillatory transients increase in visual, medial parietal and lateral prefrontal networks in the theta/alpha frequency range. We propose that brain-wide coincident oscillatory events are a key signature of inter-areal interactions during cognition.

                The human oral microbiome is increasingly recognized as a contributor to brain health, yet its mechanisms remain unclear. Our previous work revealed that oral Actinomyces species was enriched in chronic cannabis smokers. Here, we show oral inoculation of cannabis use-associated Actinomyces species, especially A. meyeri, to wildtype C57BL/6 mice leads to anxiety-like behaviors, non-region-specific microglia activation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and reduced GABAergic neurotransmission, without evidence of bacterial translocation to the brain, neuroinflammation, and memory decline. Notably, Actinomyces species producing metabolites, i.e., arginine and argininosuccinate, were increased in both oral swabs and brain following inoculation in vivo. These Actinomyces species-producing metabolites induced mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress in neurons in vitro, indicating a neuropathogenic role and aligning with reduced GABAergic neurotransmission in vivo. Together, these results suggest that oral cannabis-associated dysbiosis impacts behavior through mitochondrial stress and impaired inhibitory signaling, indicating the oral to brain metabolic axis is potentially consequential in neuropsychiatric disorders.

">A gene expression atlas of a juvenile nervous system</a></h4>

              
                Although the fundamental architecture of metazoan nervous systems is typically established in the embryo, substantial numbers of neurons are added during post-natal development while existing neurons expand in size, refine connectivity, and undergo additional differentiation. To reveal the underlying molecular determinants of post-embryonic neurogenesis and maturation, we have produced gene expression profiles of all neuron types and their progenitors in the first larval stage (L1) of C. elegans. Comparisons of the L1 profile to the embryo and to the later L4 larval stage identified thousands of differentially expressed genes across individual neurons throughout the nervous system. Key neuropeptide signaling networks, for example, are remodeled during larval development. Gene regulatory network analysis revealed potential transcription factors driving the temporal changes in gene expression across the nervous system, including a broad role for the heterochronic gene lin-14. We utilized available connectomic data of juvenile animals in combination with our neuron-specific atlas to identify potential molecular determinants of membrane contact and synaptic connectivity. These expression data are available through a user-friendly interface at CeNGEN.org for independent investigations of the maturation, connectivity and function of a developing nervous system.

">Risky Choices After Frontal Brain Injury: Differential Effects in Self vs Other-Decision Contexts</a></h4>

              
                Frontal lobe integrity is crucial for assessing risk and making informed decisions. This study investigated how frontal lobe lesions affect the computational mechanisms underlying risky choice, particularly when decisions impact oneself versus another person. A Patient Group of 20 individuals with frontal cortex damage and a Control Group of 20 matched individuals performed a gambling task, making accept/reject decisions on mixed-outcome gambles for themselves ("Self") or an anonymous other ("Other"). We provide a mechanistic account of choice behavior using Prospect Theory, the leading behavioral model of decision-making under risk, to quantify parameters for utility curvature, loss aversion, and probability weighting. Behaviorally, the Patient Group accepted significantly more disadvantageous gambles for themselves than did the Control Group yet showed a trend toward greater caution when choosing for others. Prospect Theory modeling revealed a specific computational phenotype for this behavior. Compared to the Control Group, the Patient Group exhibited significantly more pronounced utility curvature (lower , {beta}) and more linear, less distorted probability weighting (higher {gamma}). While patients also showed a trend toward lower loss aversion ({lambda}), this difference was not statistically significant. This combination of altered utility and probability processing explains their paradoxical risk-seeking. These findings suggest that frontal cortex damage disrupts the computation of subjective value, leading to a distinctive decision-making profile marked by altered utility curvature and reduced sensitivity to outcome magnitudes. This computational characterization deepens our understanding of frontal lobe contributions to decision-making and can inform targeted rehabilitation strategies.

">Observations of anisotropic paramagnetic and diamagnetic susceptibility in the primate brain</a></h4>

              
                Bulk magnetic susceptibility in the brain white matter is known to be diamagnetic and anisotropic due to the ordered myelin lipids. While paramagnetic iron is widely present in the brain, it is typically not considered to contribute to anisotropy. Using experimental MRI and computational techniques, this study explores the competing contribution of diamagnetic and paramagnetic substances to the susceptibility anisotropy. Multi-echo gradient-echo imaging and diffusion-weighted imaging data from a paraformaldehyde-fixed post-mortem chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes verus) brain was analyzed. A computational method, DECOMPOSE-QSM, was used to separate paramagnetic susceptibility and diamagnetic susceptibility components. As expected, diamagnetic components showed significant anisotropy; unexpectedly, paramagnetic components also exhibited strong anisotropy in deep gray matter and parts of white matter. This may arise from the geometric arrangement of iron-rich cellular compartments, such as oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and microglia, along nerve fibers. This method enables further exploration of tissue-specific contributions to susceptibility anisotropy.

">The unexpected dual role of S100A9 amyloid protein on neurodegeneration in progressive multiple sclerosis motor cortex</a></h4>

              
                Motor cortical inflammation and neurodegeneration are key features of progressive multiple sclerosis (MS), contributing to irreversible motor disability. However, the precise mechanisms leading to neuronal loss remain poorly understood. While chronic inflammation is a hallmark of MS and contributes to disease progression, the factors linking inflammation to neuronal loss in the cortex are not well defined. One candidate is the calcium-binding protein S100A9, a damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) protein, thought to be released by stressed cells and infiltrating monocytes. Through its ability to modulate immune responses and influence neuronal survival, S100A9 may sustain chronic inflammation and participate in neurodegenerative processes. Although its role has been explored in other neurological disorders, its contribution to progressive MS remains largely uncharacterised. Here, we investigated S100A9 expression in the motor cortex of a large post-mortem cohort of MS cases (n=67) and controls (n=9), focusing on its cellular localisation and its relationship with neuronal density and vascular pathology. S100A9 expression was increased in progressive MS cases compared to controls, predominantly localised to intravascular monocytes and as amyloid-like extracellular plaques surrounding blood vessels. These patterns were associated with neurodegeneration and blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, as evidenced by correlations with reduced brain weight, decreased neuronal density, and increased fibrin(ogen) deposition. In contrast, S100A9 was also expressed in microglia, where it correlated with increased neuronal density and reduced fibrin(ogen) deposition. Notably, the phosphorylated form of S100A9, linked to pro-inflammatory signaling, was reduced in microglia but enriched in perivascular regions. These findings reveal a dual, compartment-specific role for S100A9 in progressive MS, whereby extracellular aggregates may drive neurotoxicity, while microglial S100A9 may confer neuroprotection. Therapeutic strategies targeting extracellular S100A9 while preserving its intracellular functions may offer new opportunities for treating progressive MS.

">Multiple longitudinal tracts in the cephalopod arm sensorimotor system</a></h4>

              
                Octopuses have an incredibly rich behavioral repertoire, exhibiting complex motor acts that require the coordination of eight highly flexible arms, each with hundreds of suckers. These movements are controlled by an axial nerve cord (ANC), equivalent to the spinal cord, situated in the center of the arm musculature. The ANC has a cell body layer which forms a U-shape around its neuropil and is capped aborally, or opposite the sucker, by the cerebrobrachial tract (CBT), a massive fiber bundle known to interconnect the arms and the brain. In vertebrate spinal cords, in addition to the major fiber tracts that interconnect the brain and spinal cord, there are spinospinal connectives that coordinate complex motor behaviors across the appendages. Here, we asked with tract-tracing and immunohistochemistry, whether an octopus arm's ANC might also have intrinsic longitudinal connections for coordinated arm and sucker movements. We found that the ANC neuropil is enriched in longitudinal fibers. These fibers form distinct tracts, two within the oral (sucker-side) neuropil and two in the aboral (brachial-side) neuropil. In addition, CBT itself demonstrates four major subtracts, and DiI labeling and dextran tracing suggests that (1) the CBT also carries arm-intrinsic longitudinal connections and (2) the CBT and the neuropil tracts can be subcategorized into those that primarily connect with the sucker and those that serve the arm musculature. We also examined the organization of fiber-tracts in the ANC of the arms and tentacles of two species of squid, establishing that an aboral, extra-neuropil tract is a shared feature across all cephalopod species studied. In addition, the squids also had an oral longitudinal tract, though its positioning and size varied with species and appendage. In sum, these findings describe the neural substrate for coordinating motor behaviors across the length of a cephalopod appendage.

">High extraversion enhances attentional control through dynamic network reorganization</a></h4>

              
                The extraversion-introversion dimension of personality is hypothesized to differ based on low or high cortical arousal, respectively. Notably, high cortical arousal in introverts is thought to underlie increased distractibility. Here, we assess fMRI while participants meditate (focused attention to their breath) under three levels of auditory distraction: no, low and high. Whereas introverts exhibited worsening attentional focus on their breath with increasing distraction, extraverts retained their ability to focus attention despite distraction. Dynamic functional connectivity analysis indicated that extraverts exhibited less globally efficient and less modular networks, which may prevent distracting stimuli from creating interference. Furthermore, connectivity strengths amongst the default mode, central executive, and salience networks were increased for extraverts and decreased in introverts during high focused attention; potentially indicating distinct cognitive processes that support attentional control. These findings support the hypothesis regarding differing levels of cortical arousal in extraverts and introverts and extend personality theory by linking the extraversion dimension to attentional control and functional connectivity dynamics.

">Neural dynamics outside task-coding dimensions drive decision trajectories through transient amplification</a></h4>

              
                Most behaviors involve neural dynamics in high-dimensional activity spaces. A common approach is to extract dimensions that capture task-related variability, such as those separating stimuli or choices, yielding low-dimensional, task-aligned neural activity subspaces ("coding dimensions"). However, whether these dimensions actively drive decisions or merely reflect underlying computations remains unclear. Moreover, neural activity outside these coding subspaces ("residual dimensions") is often ignored, though it could also causally shape neural dynamics driving behavior. We developed a recurrent neural network model that fits population activity and uncovers the dynamic interactions between coding and residual subspaces on single trials. Applied to electrophysiological recordings from the anterior lateral motor cortex (ALM) and motor thalamus in mice performing a delayed response task, our model demonstrates that perturbations of residual dimensions reliably alter behavioral choices, whereas perturbations of the choice dimension, which strongly encodes the animal's upcoming decision, are largely ineffective. These perturbation effects arise because residual dimensions drive transient amplification across an intermediate number of coding and residual dimensions (~10), before the dynamics collapse into discrete attractor states corresponding to the animal's choice. By dissecting the low-dimensional variability underlying error trials, we find that it primarily shifts trajectories along residual dimensions, biasing single decisions. Residual activity in thalamus shapes cortical decision dynamics, implicating weakly selective thalamic populations in the emergence of cortical selectivity. Our findings challenge the conventional focus on low-dimensional coding subspaces as sufficient framework for understanding neural computations, demonstrating that dimensions previously considered task-irrelevant and accounting for little variance can have a critical role in driving behavior.

                Background The construction industry faces systemic inefficiencies and cost overrun. Many of these issues result from demand amplification, known as the Bullwhip Effect (BWE), within supply chains. Aim To investigate the root causes and impacts of the Bullwhip Effect during construction. Establish a foundation for mitigation strategies using a conceptual framework. This framework was validated using a real-world case study to support effective mitigation. Methods This study systematically identified and analyzed twenty-one underlying causes of the Bullwhip Effect in the supply chain. The effect was calculated for the selected construction materials using data from Mostashar United Company-Kuwait. Results The Bullwhip Effect in the construction industry emerges not from a single cause but from a complex interaction of factors that significantly influence the phenomenon and are deeply embedded within the industry’s structural and operational practices. These causes are grouped into three main dimensions: informational, operational, and behavioral factors. BWE can be quantitatively measured and directly escalates production costs and intensifies over time if mitigating strategies are not implemented. Research has identified several strategies that can effectively prevent the occurrence or reduce the bullwhip effect in the construction industry, such as collaboration and teamwork enhanced strategies between SCM partners, optimizing information exchange and communications among SCM partners, Building SCM Resilience Against Component Shortages, and Strategic Planning for Resource Utilization. Conclusion The causes of Bullwhip Effects and impacts are interconnected rather than segregated or isolated, creating a reinforcing feedback loop where informational opacity sparks behavioral reactions, further intensifying operational instability. A bullwhip mitigation policy should include addressing data transparency, supply chain process coordination, and contractual early incentives, instead of focusing on isolated symptom management, instead of systemic resolution.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1295/v1?src=rss">Study Protocol: Intrafamily Communication on Mental Disorders (IFACOM) [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Our study deals with intra-family communication on mental disorders. We plan to develop a questionnaire, which can be used to measure the functionality of intra-family communication. Previous studies have shown that certain forms of communication in families affected by mental disorders impact the further course of the disease. Derogatory or taboo communication content are known to be disease-promoting, while open and positive communication has a preventive effect on the occurrence of further mental disorders. The functionality of communication therefore describes the potential of a health-promoting effect of intra-family communication styles. On the other hand, dysfunctional communication styles might be associated with a higher risk of the new emergence or recurrence of mental health problems in other family members. Following a systematic literature search on data containing information on intra-family communication patterns on mental disorders we plan to collect further data suing qualitative interviews (n=10). Interviewees include family members of individuals affected by mental disorders. We then plan to create a questionnaire with approximately 30 factors and items. This questionnaire will be tested in a large cohort of family members of individuals affected by mental disorders (n=300) and consequently validated by a confirmatory factor analysis. With the help of the planned questionnaire, risk factors of patients could be recognized earlier and taken into account for therapeutic interventions.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1294/v1?src=rss">Barriers and Strategies for Antiretroviral Therapy Appointment Adherence in Rural South Africa: A Narrative Review with a Focus on the Vhembe District [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background and Objective Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is the cornerstone of HIV treatment, but its effectiveness depends heavily on consistent patient adherence to scheduled appointments. Rural regions, such as the Vhembe district in South Africa, face persistent structural, economic, and psychosocial challenges that hinder ART adherence and continuity of care. This narrative review synthesizes evidence on the multifaceted barriers affecting ART appointment adherence in rural settings and evaluates intervention strategies that have demonstrated success across sub-Saharan Africa. It emphasizes the relevance of these findings to the Vhembe district context. Methods The review draws on three key evidence sources: a doctoral study evaluating home delivery models for ART, a systematic review on treatment supporter interventions (TSIs), and a meta-analysis on adherence among pregnant women using digital and educational tools. The selected studies were critically examined for their applicability to rural service delivery and adherence outcomes. Results The review identifies major adherence barriers, including poor transport infrastructure, high indirect costs, clinic overcrowding, limited refill durations, stigma, and the impact of public health emergencies. Strategies such as home delivery, multi-month dispensing (MMD), mHealth device reminders, and community-based support programs (TSIs) are shown to mitigate these challenges effectively. Combined socio-structural interventions yield the most substantial improvements in adherence outcomes. Conclusions Improving ART appointment adherence in Vhembe requires an integrated model tailored to local realities. Combining decentralized care, social support structures, mHealth solutions, and financial incentives offers a sustainable path forward. However, research gaps in implementation science, cost-effectiveness, and context-specific interventions must be addressed to scale these solutions effectively.

                Introduction Noise pollution has become one of the most frequent urban environmental problems, with negative effects on public health, social well-being, and quality of life in high population density contexts. Within this framework, the present study was developed with the purpose of characterizing environmental noise levels in the Historic Center of Lima, integrating objective measurements and citizens’ perceptions. Methodology The research adopted a quantitative approach, applied type, with a non-experimental and cross-sectional design. Measurements were carried out at thirteen strategic points along Abancay Avenue using a type I integrating sound level meter, while population perception was collected through a structured survey applied to 392 participants selected by non-probabilistic sampling. Data were processed through descriptive and comparative analysis between instrumental records and population responses. Results The findings showed that equivalent noise levels consistently exceeded environmental quality standards for commercial zones, reaching maximum values above 90 dB(A). Vehicular traffic and informal commercial activity were identified as the main noise sources, and most respondents perceived noise as intense and disturbing, especially during the evening-nighttime period. Conclusion Noise pollution in the studied area constitutes a persistent problem that affects environmental quality and the daily lives of the population. Furthermore, the need to design urban management and acoustic control strategies is recognized, aiming to reduce exposure in heritage and commercial corridors

                Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) is a disease of the respiratory system caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The severity of Covid-19 can be affected by the presence of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in certain genes, such as IFNAR2 and SERPINE-1. This study aimed to identify and analyze the presence of SNP rs6092 in the SERPINE1 gene and rs1051393 and rs2229207 in the IFNAR2 gene relation in Covid-19 respiratory syndrome in Indonesia. Methods DNA was isolated from saliva samples of all patients, and a TaqMan Genotyping Assay with a real-time PCR instrument was used to run the samples. The output data were analyzed for demographic data, allele frequency, genotype frequency, and the association of all SNPs with the Covid-19 respiratory syndrome (case) and control subjects. We also analyzed blood laboratory results, blood gas analyses, coagulation factors, and inflammatory factors using SPSS. Results This study included 85 subjects comprise with Covid-19 respiratory syndrome and control subjects. Our study found no association between subjects with Covid-19 respiratory syndrome and any of the variants. However, based on the symptoms caused by rs1051393, we found that it had an effect on fever symptoms. In addition, a significant relationship between rs2229207 and chest pain symptoms was observed in patients with case group. Furthermore, our study found significant differences (p < 0.05) in several blood laboratory analyses, such as the level of basophils and eGFR for rs6092 and the potassium level for rs2229207. Furthermore, arterial blood gas analysis showed that pCO2 and pH levels were significantly different for rs2229207. Conclusion Our study found an association between rs1051393 and fever and between rs2229207 and chest pain in patients with post Covid-19 respiratory syndrome.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1291/v1?src=rss">Are We Truly Preparing Students for Financial Success? Insights from Economic Education Curricula in Indonesia [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Financial literacy is an essential competency for university students, especially those in economics education programs, as it supports effective money management and responsible decision-making. However, higher education curricula in Indonesia still emphasize theoretical aspects over practical financial skills, raising concerns about whether graduates are adequately prepared for financial challenges. Methods This study employed a qualitative content analysis to evaluate the integration of financial literacy within economics education curricula in Indonesia. Data were collected through curriculum document reviews, semi-structured interviews with economics educators, and student surveys. The analysis focused on identifying the extent of financial literacy integration and perceptions of curriculum effectiveness. Results The findings indicate that while fundamental topics such as budgeting and savings are covered, critical elements including investment diversification, risk management, and digital financial tools remain underdeveloped. Students expressed a strong demand for more experiential learning approaches, such as case studies, financial simulations, and collaboration with industry partners. The results highlight a gap between theoretical instruction and the practical competencies required for effective financial decision-making. Conclusions The study concludes that strengthening economics education curricula requires the integration of applied financial literacy training, digital financial education, and industry collaboration to better prepare students for personal and professional financial challenges. While this research provides valuable insights, its qualitative scope presents limitations. Future studies with broader institutional coverage and quantitative approaches are recommended to generate more generalizable findings.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1290/v1?src=rss">A Systematic Literature Review and Bibliometric Analysis of Workplace Coaching [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Workplace Coaching has evolved significantly over the last two decades and has become a mainstream global activity in business organizations. The concept has been recognized for its potential in enhancing the well-being and performance of individuals, groups, and leaders, making it a popular intervention in modern organizations. Therefore, this study provides a comprehensive understanding of workplace coaching research from 2000 to 2025 by examining global trends in terms of publications, contributors, keyword co-occurrences, and thematic clusters, utilizing a systematic literature review with bibliometric analysis. The review was conducted to synthesise the available literature on workplace coaching to suggest future trends. The Scopus and Web of Science databases were used to explore and analyze published works using the PRISMA framework and VOSviewer software. A total of 343 published journal articles were considered in the analysis, eliminating duplication and minimizing potential risks during the screening process. The findings reveal a significant growth in academic interest in coaching in workplace research, with four key thematic clusters emerging: Coaching for Workplace Learning and Development, Multifaceted advantages of Executive and Leadership Coaching, Dimensions of Workplace Coaching, and Employee Coaching for Human Resource Management and Development. The study findings serve as a foundation for future studies that explore under-researched areas, such as the application of artificial intelligence in coaching practices, ethical considerations, digital transformation, sustainability in leadership, and employee well-being practices. Moreover, this study reveals the potential of meta-analyses and systematic reviews that incorporate grey literature to provide a more comprehensive understanding of coaching effectiveness. Comparative studies across different sectors, countries, and regions can help consolidate the existing findings and uncover new insights. These limitations and opportunities present avenues for future research, motivating researchers to advance and refine existing literature.

                <p>by Nayim González-Rodríguez, Carlos Chacón-Sánchez, Oscar Llorca, Rafael Fernández-Leiro</p>

Deep learning has revolutionised <i>de novo</i> protein design, with new models achieving unprecedented success in creating novel proteins with specific functions, including artificial protein binders. However, current workflows remain computationally demanding and challenging to operate without dedicated infrastructure and expertise. To overcome these limitations, we present BinderFlow, an open, structured, and parallelised pipeline that automates end-to-end protein binder design. Its batch-based architecture enables live monitoring of design campaigns, seamless coexistence with other GPU-intensive processes, and minimal user intervention. BinderFlow’s modular design facilitates the integration of new tools, allowing rapid adaptation to emerging methods. We demonstrate its utility by running automated design campaigns that rapidly generate diverse, high-confidence candidates suitable for experimental validation. To complement the pipeline, we developed BFmonitor, a web-based dashboard for real-time campaign monitoring, design evaluation, and hit selection. Together, BinderFlow and BFmonitor make generative protein design more accessible, scalable, and reproducible, streamlining both exploratory and production-level research. The software is freely available at https://github.com/cryoEM-CNIO/BinderFlow under the GNU LGPL v3.0 license.

                <p>by Miriam B. Goodman</p>

Whether hosted by colleges, universities, stand-alone research institutions, federal research labs, or private companies, immersive summer (6–12 weeks) research experiences build students’ confidence in their scientific capabilities and help to refine their professional trajectories. Such internships are an important tool to introduce students to STEM careers and energize participants, each of whom realizes a powerful benefit. The student gains hands-on research experience, insight into the research process, and clarity regarding their educational and career aspirations. The bench mentor, typically an advanced graduate student, postdoctoral researcher, or staff scientist, acquires essential skills in training and mentoring while incorporating fresh perspectives from an inquisitive novice into their research project. The principal investigator (PI) promotes the professional development of the bench mentor, expands interest in STEM careers, while exploring a focused and compact research question. This set of <i>Ten Simple Rules</i> is a guide for PIs, bench mentors, and research groups and seeks to foster excellence in the design of short-term research experiences for students. They emphasize projects co-created by PIs and bench mentors, accessible techniques that can be mastered in a few weeks, and strategies enabling interns to develop their own mental model of the research question and approach. Although tailored primarily to full-time summer internships for individual students in an academic research setting, this advice may be applicable to short-term, mentored research experiences in multiple settings.

                <p>by Hiroyuki Ichijo, Yuichiro Kawamura, Tomoya Nakamura</p>

How animals process information, compute, and execute behaviors is a central question in neuroscience and computational biology. Predators attack prey by chasing or ambushing them, while prey respond with escaping or freezing. These behaviors are fundamental for survival. Uncovering functions of such behaviors requires an understanding not only of the implementation of neuronal circuits but also of the underlying algorithms and computation. However, how animals respond to predators or prey depending on whether they can detect them from a distance remains unclear. Here, we modeled and analyzed attack and defense behaviors with game theory. Using encounter probabilities to construct payoff matrices under a sensory–motor algorithm that lacked directional information, we identified the corresponding equilibrium behaviors for the agents (predators and prey). Different detection distances yielded distinct Nash equilibrium behaviors, representing a computational mechanism that can account for diverse attack and defense behaviors. The games based on interactions among multiple predators and prey were, in most cases, non-constant-sum and positive-sum games. Measured payoffs of Nash equilibrium behaviors indicated that the predators were able to increase their payoffs by attacking, and the prey were also able to increase their payoffs even in the presence of predators. These results suggest that each of the agents initiates attack and defense behaviors. Moreover, Nash equilibrium behaviors were also identified under a simpler non-sensory motor algorithm. Despite the similarity, the non-sensory motor algorithm and the sensory–motor algorithm had distinct adaptive significance. The sensory–motor algorithm produced substantially greater prey payoffs. By implementing these algorithms, agents interact in ways that give rise to payoff matrices from which various Nash equilibrium behaviors can be mathematically derived under different conditions. Furthermore, this approach offers an experimental framework for understanding behavioral evolution and suggests a possible difference in evolutionary mechanisms of attack and defense behaviors.

                <p>by Mengqi Hu, Syed Bilal Jilani, Daniel G. Olson, Costas D. Maranas</p>

Kinetic models mechanistically link enzyme levels, metabolite concentrations, and allosteric regulation to metabolic reaction fluxes. This coupling allows for the quantitative elucidation of the dynamics of the evolution of metabolite concentrations and metabolic fluxes as a function of time. So far, most large-scale kinetic model parameterizations are carried out using mostly steady-state flux measurements supplemented with metabolomics and/or proteomics data when available. Even though the parameterized kinetic model can trace a temporal evolution of the system, lack of anchoring to temporal data reduces confidence in the dynamics predictions. Notably, the simulation of enzymatic cascade reactions requires a full description of the dynamics of the system as a steady-state is not applicable given that all measured metabolite concentrations vary with time. Here we describe how kinetic parameters fitted to the dynamics of single-enzyme assays remain accurate for the simulation of multi-enzyme cell-free systems. Herein, we demonstrate two extensions for the Kinetic Estimation Tool Capturing Heterogeneous datasets Using Pyomo (KETCHUP) software tool for parameterizing a kinetic model of the cell-free kinetics of formate dehydrogenase (FDH) and 2,3-butanediol dehydrogenase (BDH) through the use of time-course data across various initial conditions. An implemented extension of KETCHUP allowing for the reconciliation of measurement time-lag errors present in datasets was used to parameterize kinetic models using multiple datasets. By combining the kinetic parameters identified by the FDH and BDH assays, accurate simulation of the binary FDH-BDH system was achieved.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013714">Universal scale-free representations in human visual cortex</a></h4>

How does the human brain encode complex visual information? While previous research has characterized individual dimensions of visual representation in cortex, we still lack a comprehensive understanding of how visual information is organized across the full range of neural population activity. Here, analyzing fMRI responses to natural scenes across multiple individuals, we discover that neural representations in human visual cortex follow a remarkably consistent scale-free organization—their variance decay is consistent with a power-law distribution, detected across four orders of magnitude of latent dimensions. This scale-free structure appears consistently across multiple visual regions and across individuals, suggesting it reflects a fundamental organizing principle of visual processing. Critically, when we align neural responses across individuals using hyperalignment, we find that these representational dimensions are largely shared between people, revealing a universal high-dimensional spectrum of visual information that emerges despite individual differences in brain anatomy and visual experience. Traditional analysis approaches in cognitive neuroscience have focused primarily on a small number of high-variance dimensions, potentially missing crucial aspects of visual representation. Our results demonstrate that visual information is distributed across the full dimensionality of cortical activity in a systematic way, thus revealing a key property of neural coding in visual cortex. These findings suggest that we need to move beyond low-dimensional characterizations to fully understand how the brain represents the visual world.

                <p>by Dev Jasuja, Paul J. Atzberger</p>

We investigate proteins within heterogeneous cell membranes where non-equilibrium phenomena arises from spatial variations in concentration and temperature. We develop simulation methods building on non-equilibrium statistical mechanics to obtain stochastic hybrid continuum-discrete descriptions which track individual protein dynamics, spatially varying concentration fluctuations, and thermal exchanges. We investigate biological mechanisms for protein positioning and patterning within membranes and factors in thermal gradient sensing. We also study the kinetics of Brownian motion of particles with temperature variations within energy landscapes arising from heterogeneous microstructures within membranes. The introduced approaches provide self-consistent models for studying biophysical mechanisms involving the drift-diffusion dynamics of individual proteins and energy exchanges and fluctuations between the thermal and mechanical parts of the system. The methods also can be used for studying related non-equilibrium effects in other biological systems and soft materials.

                <p>by Marko A. Ruslim, Martin J. Spencer, Hinze Hogendoorn, Hamish Meffin, Yanbo Lian, Anthony N. Burkitt</p>

Many experimental and computational studies deal with sparseness, balance, and decorrelation in neural networks and explain the presence of these properties as fulfilling requirements related to optimum energy efficiency, network stability, and information representation. These studies leave the question of <i>how</i> these properties arise in the brain unanswered. The present study attempts to address this question using a model built upon the experimentally observed properties of neural responses, homeostasis, and synaptic plasticity. The experimentally observed properties of sparseness, balance, and decorrelation are then expected to emerge from this substrate. A spiking neural model of the primary visual cortex (V1) was investigated. Populations of both inhibitory and excitatory leaky integrate-and-fire neurons with recurrent connections were provided with spiking input from simulated ON and OFF neurons of the lateral geniculate nucleus. This network was provided with natural image stimuli as input. All synapses underwent learning using spike-timing-dependent plasticity learning rules. A homeostatic rule adjusted the weights and thresholds of each neuron based on target homeostatic spiking rates and mean synaptic input values. These experimentally grounded rules resulted in a number of the expected properties of information representation. The network showed a temporally sparse spike <i>response</i> to inputs and this was associated with a sparse <i>code</i> with Gabor-like receptive fields. The network was balanced at both slow and fast time scales; increased excitatory input was balanced by increased inhibition. This balance was associated with decorrelated firing that was observed as population sparseness. This population sparseness was both the cause and result of the decorrelation of receptive fields. These observed emergent properties (balance, temporal sparseness, population sparseness, and decorrelation) indicate that the network is implementing expected principles of information processing: efficient coding, information maximization (’infomax’), and a lateral or single-layer form of predictive coding. These emergent features of the network were shown to be robust to randomized jitter of the values of key simulation parameters.

Geroscience aims to target the aging process to extend healthspan. However, even isogenic individuals show heterogeneity in natural aging rate and responsiveness to pro-longevity interventions, limiting translational potential. Using RNAseq analysis of young, isogenic, subpopulations of <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> selected solely on the basis of the splicing pattern of an in vivo minigene reporter that is predictive of future life expectancy, we find a strong correlation in young animals between predicted life span and alternative splicing of mRNAs related to lipid metabolism. The activity of two RNA splicing factors, Reversed Polarity-1 (REPO-1) and Splicing Factor 1 (SFA-1), early in life is necessary for <i>C. elegans</i> response to specific longevity interventions and leads to context-specific changes to fat content that is mirrored by knockdown of their direct target POD-2/ACC1. Moreover, POD-2/ACC1 is required for the same longevity interventions as REPO-1/SFA-1. In addition, early inhibition of REPO-1 renders animals refractory to late onset suppression of the TORC1 pathway. Together, we propose that splicing factor activity establishes a cellular landscape early in life that enables responsiveness to specific longevity interventions and may explain variance in efficacy between individuals.

                <p>by Eliana Nicolaisen-Sobesky, Somayeh Maleki Balajoo, Mostafa Mahdipour, Agoston Mihalik, Mahnaz Olfati, Felix Hoffstaedter, Janaina Mourao-Miranda, Masoud Tahmasian, Simon B. Eickhoff, Sarah Genon</p>

The link between brain health and risk/protective factors for non-communicable diseases (such as high blood pressure, high body mass index, diet, smoking, physical activity, etc.) is increasingly acknowledged. However, the specific effects that these factors have on brain health are still poorly understood, delaying their implementation in precision brain health. Here, we studied the multivariate relationships between risk factors for non-communicable diseases and brain structure, including cortical thickness (CT) and gray matter volume (GMV). Furthermore, we adopted a systems-level perspective to understand such relationships, by characterizing the cortical patterns (yielded in association to risk factors) with regards to brain morphological and functional features, as well as with neurotransmitter systems. Similarly, we related the pattern of risk/protective factors dimensions with a peripheral marker of inflammation. First, we identified latent dimensions linking a broad set of risk factors for non-communicable diseases to parcel-wise CT and GMV across the whole cortex. Data was obtained from the UK Biobank (<i>n</i> = 7,370, age range = 46–81 years). We used regularized canonical correlation analysis (RCCA) embedded in a machine learning framework. This approach allows us to capture inter-individual variability in a multivariate association and to assess the generalizability of the model. The brain patterns (captured in association with risk/protective factors) were characterized from a multi-level perspective, by performing correlations (spin tests) between them and different brain patterns of structure, function, and neurotransmitter systems. The association between the risk/protective factors pattern and C-reactive protein (CRP, a marker of inflammation) was examined using Spearman correlation. We found two significant and partly replicable latent dimensions. One latent dimension linked cardiometabolic health to brain patterns of CT and GMV and was consistent across sexes. The other latent dimension linked physical robustness (including non-fat mass and strength) to patterns of CT and GMV, with the association to GMV being consistent across sexes and the association to CT appearing only in men. The CT and GMV patterns of both latent dimensions were associated to the binding potentials of several neurotransmitter systems. Finally, the cardiometabolic health dimension was correlated to CRP, while physical robustness was only very weakly associated to it. We observed robust, multi-level and multivariate links between both cardiometabolic health and physical robustness with respect to CT, GMV, and neurotransmitter systems. Interestingly, we found that cardiometabolic health and physical robustness are associated with not only increases in CT or GMV, but also with decreases of CT or GMV in some brain regions. Our results also suggested a role for low-grade chronic inflammation in the association between cardiometabolic health and brain structural health. These findings support the relevance of adopting a holistic perspective in health, by integrating neurocognitive and physical health. Moreover, our findings contribute to the challenge to the classical conceptualization of neuropsychiatric and physical illnesses as categorical entities. In this perspective, future studies should further examine the effects of risk/protective factors on different brain regions in order to deepen our understanding of the clinical significance of such increased and decreased CT and GMV.

                Objective This study aimed to evaluate the effect of root canal preparation size on isthmus cleaning efficiency and periapical extrusion using high-frequency sonic agitation with the EDDY irrigation system. Materials and Methods Thirty custom-made epoxy split models were used to simulate a root canal system with two curved canals merging at the apical 1 mm and an isthmus extending along their length. A periapical lesion was simulated to assess the extrusion tendency. Canals were prepared using the WaveOne Gold system in small, primary, and medium sizes. The isthmuses were filled with bovine dentin debris, while dyed gelatin was used in the periapical lesion to quantify extruded irrigant volume. EDDY irrigation efficiency was evaluated based on the total cleared surface area (mm2) using ImageJ software. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA and post hoc multiple comparisons, with a significance level of P ≤ 0.05. Results Isthmus cleaning efficiency remained consistent across all canal sizes, with no significant differences among groups (P > 0.05). However, periapical extrusion increased significantly with larger canal preparation sizes, with medium-sized preparations showing significantly higher extrusion than small (P = 0.001) and primary (P = 0.026) sizes. Conclusion EDDY irrigation was effective in achieving isthmus cleanliness regardless of canal preparation size. However, larger instrumentation increased the risk of apical extrusion, underscoring the need for careful irrigation management in clinical applications.

                Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused substantial morbidity and mortality on a global scale. A strong correlation has been found between COVID-19 treatment outcomes and noncommunicable diseases such as cancers. However, there is limited information on the outcomes of cancer patients who were hospitalised for COVID-19. Methods We conducted an analysis on data collected in a large prospective cohort study set-up by the World Health Organisation (WHO) International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium (ISARIC). All patients with laboratory-confirmed or clinically-diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included. Cancer was defined as having a current solid organ or haematological malignancy. The following outcomes were assessed; The hazard ratio of 30-day in-hospital mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, length of hospitalization and receipt of higher-level care. Results Of the 560,547 hospitalised individuals who were analysed, 27,243 (4.9%) had cancer. Overall, cancer patients were older and had more comorbidities than non-cancer patients. Patients with cancer had a higher hazard ratio of 30-day in-hospital mortality than non-cancer patients (29.1.3% vs 18.0%) and longer hospital stays (median of 12 days vs 8 days). However, patients with cancer were admitted less often to intensive care units than non-cancer patients (12.6% vs 17.1%) and received less invasive mechanical ventilation than non-cancer patients (4.5% vs 7.6%). The hazard ratio of dying from cancer, adjusted for age, sex and country income level was 1.18 (95%CI: 1.15-1.2). Conclusions This study’s findings underscore the heightened vulnerability of hospitalized COVID-19 patients with cancer, revealing a higher mortality rate, longer hospital stays, and an unstructured pattern of care that reflects the complexity of managing severely ill patients during a public health crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic.

                Phyllanthus acidus (L.) Skeels (Phyllanthaceae) is a potential medicinal plant recognized for its sour and tart-tasting fruits. In this study, the chloroplast genome of P. acidus was sequenced, assembled, and characterized. The chloroplast genome size was 156,331 bp, and the overall GC content was 36.9%. Additionally, the chloroplast genome had a quadripartite structure consisting of a large single copy (LSC; 85,807 bp in length; GC content: 34.6%), a small single copy (SSC; 19,262 bp in length; GC content: 30.6%), and two inverted repeat regions (IR; 25,631 bp in length; GC content: 43.1%). A total of 113 unique genes were annotated in the chloroplast genome, including 79 protein-coding genes, 30 tRNAs, and four rRNAs. The phylogenetic analysis based on 79 protein-coding genes revealed the paraphyly of the Phyllanthus genus. These findings provided additional genetic information for further research on P. acidus and the cp genome in the Phyllanthaceae family.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.78099?af=R">Anatomical Associations Between Focal Mitochondrial Metabolism and Patterns of Neurodegeneration in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) has a very specific neuroimaging signature, but the molecular underpinnings of the strikingly selective anatomic involvement have not elucidated to date. Accordingly, a large neuroimaging study was conducted with 258 participants to evaluate associations between patterns of neurodegeneration and focal metabolic metrics.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Structural and diffusivity alterations were systematically evaluated in a genetically stratified cohort. Voxelwise associations between neurodegeneration and physiological mitochondrial indices were systematically evaluated over the entire brain and also examined in specific regions.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Significant topological associations were identified between physiological mitochondria tissue density, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH)–ubiquinone oxidoreductase, succinate dehydrogenase, cytochrome c oxidase (COX), mitochondrial respiratory capacity (MRC), tissue respiratory capacity (TRC), and propensity to focal atrophy in ALS. Anatomic correlations between mitochondrial metrics and morphometric change were particularly strong in GGGGCC hexanucleotide repeat carriers in <i>C9orf72</i>. Diffusivity analyses also confirmed associations between brain metabolism and microstructural degeneration. Higher focal mitochondria tissue density was associated with higher likelihood of frontal, temporal, cerebellar, opercular, thalamic, cingulum, putamen, corpus callosum, and corona radiata degeneration. Uncinate fasciculus degeneration was associated with higher Complex I, II, COX, and TRC activity. Topological associations were readily replicated in an external validation cohort.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our data indicate that brain regions with high metabolic activity are particularly vulnerable to neurodegeneration in ALS. Anatomic associations between physiological cerebral metabolism and patterns of neurodegeneration implicate mitochondrial dysfunction in the pathophysiology of ALS. Although mitochondrial dysfunction may not be the primary etiological factor, it may represent a shared bottleneck of multiple converging molecular and genetic pathways, offering a potential opportunity for meaningful pharmacological intervention.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To evaluate whether white matter hyperintensities (WMH) and apolipoprotein E (<i>APOE)</i> ε4 status have an additive or multiplicative effect on the risk of incident all-cause dementia.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We conducted a prospective cohort study in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study and confirmed findings in the UK Biobank (UKB). The exposures were <i>APOE</i> ε4 status (0 vs. ≥1 allele) and WMH on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The primary outcome was incident all-cause dementia. After confirming an additive interaction, we created combined exposure groups: WMH−/ε4−, WMH+/ε4−, WMH−/ε4+, and WMH+/ε4+. Cox proportional hazards models were adjusted for age, sex, race, education, cognition (ARIC only), hypertension, diabetes, and prior stroke.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In ARIC (n = 1,736, mean age 63, 58.8% female, 48.7% non-Hispanic White individuals, median follow-up 18.6 years), the dementia incidence rate was 10.4 (95% CI, 9.2–11.6) per 1,000 person-years. Compared to WMH−/ε4–, adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for dementia were: WMH−<i>/</i>ε4+, 1.5 (95% CI, 1.1–2.1); WMH+/ε4–, 2.0 (95% CI, 1.4–2.7); and WMH+<i>/</i>ε4<i>+</i>, 3.2 (95% CI, 2.2–4.6). In UKB (n = 40,307, mean age 55, 52.7% female, 97.1% non-Hispanic White individuals, median follow-up 3.2 years), the dementia incidence rate was 0.42 (95% CI, 0.32–0.55) per 1,000 person-years. Adjusted HRs were: WMH−<i>/</i>ε4+, 2.3 (95% CI, 1.2–4.5); WMH+/ε4–, 2.1 (95% CI, 1.0–4.6); and WMH+<i>/</i>ε4<i>+</i>, 6.7 (95% CI, 3.2–13.9).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>WMH burden and <i>APOE</i> ε4 status additively increase dementia risk. These findings support the potential benefit of vascular risk management to reduce WMH and delay dementia onset, even among genetically at-risk individuals. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.78110?af=R">Frailty across Neurological Diseases: Why Sex and Gender Matter</a></h4>

              
                <p>Frailty is increasingly recognized as a critical factor in neurology, influencing disease susceptibility, progression, and outcomes. Emerging evidence highlights the pivotal role of sex and gender in shaping frailty trajectories across major neurological disorders, including stroke, Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia, and multiple sclerosis. This systematic review synthesizes current knowledge on the interplay between frailty and neurological disease, with a focus on sex-specific patterns. Recognizing sex- and gender-related differences in frailty expression is critical to advancing a more personalized and equitable model of neurological care, and reducing disparities in a growing population affected by age-related neurological conditions.
