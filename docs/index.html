<p>In this work, we report the preliminary analysis of the electrophysiological
behavior of in vitro neuronal networks to identify when the networks are in a
critical state based on the size distribution of network-wide avalanches of
activity. The results presented here demonstrate the importance of selecting
appropriate parameters in the evaluation of the size distribution and indicate
that it is possible to perturb networks showing highly synchronized---or
supercritical---behavior into the critical state by increasing the level of
inhibition in the network. The classification of critical versus non-critical
networks is valuable in identifying networks that can be expected to perform
well on computational tasks, as criticality is widely considered to be the
state in which a system is best suited for computation. This type of analysis
is expected to enable the identification of networks that are well-suited for
computation and the classification of networks as perturbed or healthy. This
study is part of a larger research project, the overarching aim of which is to
develop computational models that are able to reproduce target behaviors
observed in in vitro neuronal networks. These models will ultimately be used to
aid in the realization of these behaviors in nanomagnet arrays to be used in
novel computing hardwares.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.13046">Visual Information flow in Wilson-Cowan networks. (arXiv:1907.13046v1 [q-bio.NC])</a></h4>

<p>In this work we study the communication efficiency of a
psychophysically-tuned cascade of Wilson-Cowan and Divisive Normalization
layers that simulate the retina-V1 pathway. This is the first analysis of
Wilson-Cowan networks in terms of multivariate total correlation. The
parameters of the cortical model have been derived through the relation between
the steady state of the Wilson-Cowan model and the Divisive Normalization
model.
</p>
<p>The communication efficiency has been analyzed in two ways: First, we provide
an analytical expression for the reduction of the total correlation among the
responses of a V1-like population after the application of the Wilson-Cowan
interaction. Second, we empirically study the efficiency with visual stimuli
and statistical tools that were not available before: (1) we use a recent,
radiometrically calibrated, set of natural scenes, and (2) we use a recent
technique to estimate the multivariate total correlation in bits from sets of
visual responses which only involves univariate operations, thus giving better
estimates of the redundancy.
</p>
<p>The theoretical and the empirical results show that although this cascade of
layers was not optimized for statistical independence in any way, the
redundancy between the responses gets substantially reduced along the neural
pathway. Specifically, we show that (1)~the efficiency of a Wilson-Cowan
network is similar to its equivalent Divisive Normalization model, (2) while
initial layers (Von-Kries adaptation and Weber-like brightness) contribute to
univariate equalization, the bigger contributions to the reduction in total
correlation come from the computation of nonlinear local contrast and the
application of local oriented filters, and (3)~psychophysically-tuned models
are more efficient (reduce more total correlation) in the more populated
regions of the luminance-contrast plane.

<p>In this work we have aimed to reproduce supra-threshold perception phenomena,
specifically visual illusions, with Wilson-Cowan-type models of neuronal
dynamics. We have found that it is indeed possible to do so, but that the
ability to replicate visual illusions is related to how well the neural
activity equations comply with the efficient representation principle. Our
first contribution is to show that the Wilson-Cowan equations can reproduce a
number of brightness and orientation-dependent illusions, and that the latter
type of illusions require that the neuronal dynamics equations consider
explicitly the orientation, as expected. Then, we formally prove that there
can't be an energy functional that the Wilson-Cowan equations are minimizing,
but that a slight modification makes them variational and yields a model that
is consistent with the efficient representation principle. Finally, we show
that this new model provides a better reproduction of visual illusions than the
original Wilson-Cowan formulation.

<p>Currently self-report pain ratings are the gold standard in clinical pain
assessment. However, the development of objective automatic measures of pain
could substantially aid pain diagnosis and therapy. Recent neuroimaging studies
have shown the potential of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) for
pain detection. This is a brain-imaging technique that provides non-invasive,
long-term measurements of cortical hemoglobin concentration changes. In this
study, we focused on fNIRS signals acquired exclusively from the prefrontal
cortex, which can be accessed unobtrusively, and derived an algorithm for the
detection of the presence of pain using Bayesian hierarchical modelling with
wavelet features. This approach allows personalization of the inference process
by accounting for inter-participant variability in pain responses. Our work
highlights the importance of adopting a personalized approach and supports the
use of fNIRS for pain assessment.

<p>Network inference algorithms are valuable tools for the study of large-scale
neuroimaging datasets. Multivariate transfer entropy is well suited for this
task, being a model-free measure that captures nonlinear and lagged
dependencies between time series to infer a minimal directed network model.
Greedy algorithms have been proposed to efficiently deal with high-dimensional
datasets while avoiding redundant inferences and capturing synergistic effects.
However, multiple statistical comparisons may inflate the false positive rate
and are computationally demanding, which limited the size of previous
validation studies. The algorithm we present---as implemented in the IDTxl
open-source software---addresses these challenges by employing hierarchical
statistical tests to control the family-wise error rate and to allow for
efficient parallelisation. The method was validated on synthetic datasets
involving random networks of increasing size (up to 100 nodes), for both linear
and nonlinear dynamics. The performance increased with the length of the time
series, reaching consistently high precision, recall, and specificity (&gt;98% on
average) for 10000 time samples. Varying the statistical significance threshold
showed a more favourable precision-recall trade-off for longer time series.
Both the network size and the sample size are one order of magnitude larger
than previously demonstrated, showing feasibility for typical EEG and MEG
experiments.

The N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) hypofunction hypothesis has been proposed to help understand the etiology and pathophysiology of schizophrenia. This hypothesis was based on early observations that NMDAR antagonists could induce a full range of symptoms of schizophrenia in normal human subjects. Accumulating evidence in humans and animal studies points to NMDAR hypofunctionality as a convergence point for various symptoms of schizophrenia. Here we review animal models of NMDAR hypofunction generated by pharmacological and genetic approaches, and how they relate to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. In addition, we discuss the limitations of animal models of NMDAR hypofunction and their potential utility for therapeutic applications.

Lgr5+ cochlear supporting cells have been reported to be hair cell (HC) progenitor cells that have the ability to regenerate HCs in the neonatal mouse cochlea, and these cells are regulated by Wnt signaling. Frizzled-9 (Fzd9), one of the Wnt receptors, has been reported to be used to mark neuronal stem cells in the brain together with other markers and mesenchymal stem cells from human placenta and bone marrow. Here we used Fzd9-CreER mice to lineage label and trace Fzd9+ cells in the postnatal cochlea in order to investigate the progenitor characteristic of Fzd9+ cells. Lineage labeling showed that inner phalangeal cells, inner border cells, and third-row Deiters’ cells were Fzd9+ cells, but not inner pillar cells or GER cells at postnatal day (P)3, which suggests that Fzd9+ cells are a much smaller cell population than Lgr5+ progenitors. The expression of Fzd9 progressively decreased and was too low to allow lineage tracing after P14. Lineage tracing for 6 days in vivo showed that Fzd9+ cells could also generate similar numbers of new HCs compared to Lgr5+ progenitors. A sphere-forming assay showed that Fzd9+ cells could form spheres after sorting by flow cytometry, and when we compared the isolated Fzd9+ cells and Lgr5+ progenitors there were no significant differences in sphere number or sphere diameter. In a differentiation assay, the same number of Fzd9+ cells could produce similar amounts of Myo7a+ cells compared to Lgr5+ progenitors after 10 days of differentiation. All these data suggest that the Fzd9+ cells have a similar capacity for proliferation, differentiation, and HC generation as Lgr5+ progenitors and that Fzd9 can be used as a more restricted marker of HC progenitors.

Background: A fundamental question in Alzheimer’s disease is whether amyloid-β peptides and their deposition in the brain signify a direct pathological role, or they are mere outcome of the disease pathophysiological events affecting neuronal function. It is therefore important to decipher their physiological role in the brain. So far, the overwhelming focus has been on the potential toxicity of amyloid-β, often studied outside the crucial Alzheimer’s disease characteristics, i.e. i) the slow, decades-long disease progression that precedes clinical symptoms; ii) the link to apolipoprotein-E ε4 allele as major risk factor; iii) the selective early degeneration of cholinergic neurons. Previous studies, in vitro and CSF only, indicated one possible native function of amyloid-β peptides is the allosteric modulation of acetylcholine homeostasis, via molecular interactions between amyloid-β, apolipoprotein-E, and the acetylcholine-degrading enzymes, cholinesterases, resulting in formation of acetylcholine-hydrolyzing complexes (BaβACs).
Methods: Here, by combining sucrose-density gradient fractionation of post-mortem brain and in-house developed sensitive ELISA assays on the obtained fractions, we investigated presence, levels and molecular interactions between amyloid-β, apolipoprotein-E and cholinesterases for the first time in brain tissues. We examined three distinct brain regions of Alzheimer and non-demented subjects, plus a large number of Alzheimer CSF samples.
Results: We report that both monomeric and oligomeric (homomeric and heteromeric) forms of amyloid-β peptides are present in the brain of Alzheimer and non-demented individuals. Heteromeric amyloid-β was found in stable complexes with apolipoprotein-E and/or cholinesterases, irrespective of APOE genotype or disease status, arguing in favor of a physiological dynamic formation and function for these complexes in the brain. The patterns and molecular sizes of the detected soluble amyloid-β forms were closely matched between CSF and brain samples. This evinces that the detected amyloid-β-apolipoprotein-E complexes and BAβACs in CSF most likely originate from the interstitial fluids of the brain.
Conclusions: In conclusion, both light homomeric amyloid-β oligomers and heteromeric amyloid-β -ApoE and BAβACs are present and readily detectable in the brain, regardless of disease status and APOE4 genotype. Deeper knowledge of the physiological function of amyloid-β is crucial for better understanding the early pathological events that decades later lead to manifestation of Alzheimer’s disease.

Active sensory systems have evolved to properly encode natural stimuli including those created by conspecifics, yet little is known about the properties of such stimuli. We consider the electrosensory signal at the skin of a fixed weakly electric fish in the presence of a swimming conspecific. The dipole recordings are obtained in parallel with video tracking of the position of the animals. This enables the quantification of the relationships between the recording dipole and the positions of the head, midbody and tail of the freely swimming fish. The contrast of the signal at the skin is shown to be well-fitted by a decreasing exponential function of distance. It is thus anti-correlated with distance; it is also correlated with the second envelope (i.e. the envelope of the envelope) of the raw recorded signal. The variance of the contrast signal is highest at short range. However, the coefficient of variation of this signal increases with distance. We find a range of position and associated contrast patterns under quasi-2D swimming conditions.  This is quantified using global measures of the visit times of the free fish within measurable range, with each visit causing a bump in contrast. The durations of these bumps as well as the times between these bumps are well reproduced by a doubly stochastic process formed by a dichotomous (two-state) noise with Poisson statistics multiplying a colored noise (Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process). Certain rapid body movements such as bending or turning are seen to produce contrast drops that may be part of cloaking strategies.

The purinergic P2X7 receptor is a key mediator in (neuro)inflammation, a process that is associated with neurodegeneration and excitotoxicity in Parkinson’s disease (PD). Recently, P2X7 imaging has become possible with [11C]JNJ-(54173)717. We investigated P2X7 availability, in comparison with availability of the translocator protein (TSPO), in two well-characterized rat models of PD using in vitro autoradiography at multiple time points throughout the disease progression. Rats received either a unilateral injection with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) in the striatum, or with recombinant adeno-associated viral vector overexpressing human A53T alpha-synuclein (α-SYN) in the substantia nigra. Transverse cryosections were incubated with [11C]JNJ-717 for P2X7 or [18F]DPA-714 for TSPO. [11C]JNJ-717 binding ratios were transiently elevated in the striatum of 6-OHDA rats at day 14-28 post-injection, with peak P2X7 binding at day 14. This largely coincided with the time course of striatal [18F]DPA-714 binding which was elevated at day 7-21, with peak TSPO binding at day 7. Increased P2X7 availability co-localized with microglial, but not astrocyte or neuronal markers. In the chronic α-SYN model, no significant differences were found in P2X7 binding, although in vitro TSPO overexpression was reported previously. This first study showed an increased P2X7 availability in the acute PD model in a time window corresponding with elevated TSPO binding and motor behavior changes. In contrast, the dynamics of TSPO and P2X7 were divergent in the chronic α-SYN model where no P2X7 changes were detectable. Overall, extended P2X7 phenotyping is warranted prior to implementation of P2X7 imaging for monitoring of neuroinflammation.

Positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are established imaging modalities for the study of neurological disorders, such as epilepsy, dementia, psychiatric disorders and so on. Since these two available modalities vary in imaging principle and physical performance, each technique has its own advantages and disadvantages over the other. To acquire the mutual complementary information and reinforce each other, there is a need for the fusion of PET and MRI. This combined dual-modality (either sequential or simultaneous) could generate preferable soft tissue contrast of brain tissue, flexible acquisition parameters and minimized exposure to radiation. The most unique superiority of PET/MRI is mainly manifested in MRI-based improvement for the inherent limitations of PET, such as motion artifacts, partial volume effect and invasive procedure in quantitative analysis. Head motion during scanning significantly deteriorates the effective resolution of PET image, especially for the dynamic scan with lengthy time. Hybrid PET/MRI device can offer motion correction (MC) for PET data through MRI information acquired simultaneously. Regarding the partial volume effect (PVE) associated with limited spatial resolution, the process and reconstruction of PET data can be further optimized by using acquired MRI either sequentially or simultaneously. The quantitative analysis of dynamic PET data mainly relies upon an invasive arterial blood sampling procedure to acquire arterial input function (AIF). An image-derived input function (IDIF) method without the need of arterial cannulization, can serve as a potential alternative estimation of AIF. Compared with using PET data only, combining anatomical or functional information from MRI for improving the accuracy in IDIF approach has been demonstrated. Yet, due to the interference and inherent disparity between the two modalities, these methods for optimizing PET image based on MRI still have many technical challenges. This review discussed upon the most recent progress, current challenges and future directions of MRI-driven PET data optimization for neurological applications, with either sequential or simultaneous acquisition approach.

Stroke causes behavioral deficits in multiple cognitive domains and there is a growing interest in predicting patient performance from neuroimaging data using machine learning techniques. Here we investigated a deep learning approach based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for predicting the severity of language disorder from 3D MRI lesion images from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a heterogeneous sample of stroke patients. CNN performance was compared to that of conventional (shallow) machine learning methods, including Ridge Regression on the images’ principal components and Support Vector Regression. We also devised a hybrid method based on re-using CNN’s high-level features as additional input to the Ridge Regression model. Predictive accuracy of the four different methods was further investigated in relation to the size of the training set and the level of redundancy across lesion images in the dataset, which was evaluated in terms of location and topological properties of the lesions. The hybrid model achieved the best performance in most cases, thereby suggesting that the high-level features extracted by CNNs are complementary to PCA features and improve the model’s predictive accuracy. Moreover, our analyses indicate that both the size of training data and image redundancy are critical factors in determining the accuracy of a computational model in predicting behavioural outcome from the structural brain imaging data of stroke patients.

Insula plays an essential role in maintaining the addiction to cigarette smoking and smoking-related alterations on the insular volume and density have been reported in smokers. However, less is known about the effects of chronic cigarette smoking on the insular cortical thickness. In this study, we explored the region-specific changes of insular cortical thickness in heavy smokers and their relations with smoking-related variables. Thirty-seven heavy smokers (29 males; mean age 47.19±7.22 years) and 37 nonsmoking healthy controls (29 males; mean age 46.95±8.45 years) participated in the study. Subregional insular cortical thickness was evaluated and compared between the two groups. Correlation analysis was performed to investigate relationships between the insular cortical thickness and clinical characteristics in heavy smokers. There was no statistical difference on the cortical thickness in the left insula (p=0.536) between the two groups while heavy smokers had a slightly thinner cortical thickness in the right insula (p=0.048). In addition, heavy smokers showed a greater cortical thinning in the anterior (p=0.0084) and superior (p=0.0054) segment of the circular sulcus of the right insula as well as the inferior (p=0.012) segment of the circular sulcus of the left insula. Moreover, the cortical thickness of the superior segment of the circular sulcus of the left insula was correlated negatively with nicotine severity (r=-0.423; p=0.009) and the longer cigarette exposure was associated with the cortical thinning in the long insular gyrus and central sulcus of the right insula (r=-0.475; p=0.003). Our findings indicate that chronic cigarette use is associated with region-specific insular thinning, which has the potential to improve our understanding of the specific roles of insular subregions in nicotine addiction.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00263">Can Oscillatory Alpha-Gamma Phase-Amplitude Coupling be Used to Understand and Enhance TMS Effects?</a></h4>

Recent applications of simultaneous scalp electroencephalography (EEG) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) suggest that adapting stimulation to underlying brain states may enhance neuroplastic effects of TMS. It is often assumed that longer-lasting effects of TMS on brain function may be mediated by phasic interactions between TMS pulses and endogenous cortical oscillatory dynamics. The mechanisms by which TMS exerts its neuromodulatory effects, however, remain unknown. Here we discuss evidence concerning the functional effects on synaptic plasticity of oscillatory cross-frequency coupling in cortical networks as a potential framework for understanding the neuromodulatory effects of TMS. We first discuss evidence for interactions between endogenous oscillatory brain dynamics and externally induced electromagnetic field activity. Alpha band (8-12 Hz) activities are of special interest here because of the wide application and therapeutic effectiveness of rhythmic TMS (rTMS) using a stimulus repetition frequency at or near 10 Hz. We discuss the large body of literature on alpha oscillations suggesting that alpha oscillatory cycles produce periodic inhibition or excitation of neuronal processing through phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) of low-frequency oscillations with high-frequency broadband (or gamma) bursting. Such alpha-gamma coupling may reflect excitability of neuronal ensembles underlying neuroplasticity effects of TMS. We propose that TMS delivery with simultaneous EEG recording and near-real time estimation of source-resolved alpha-gamma PAC might be used to select the precise timing of TMS pulse deliveries so as to enhance the neuroplastic effects of TMS therapies.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00260">Effects of Acute Aerobic Exercise on Cognitive Flexibility Required During Task-Switching Paradigm</a></h4>

The present study aimed to investigate the effects of acute aerobic exercise on underlying neuronal activities associated with task-switching processes including both mixing and switch costs. A total of 29 healthy young adults (21.4 ±1.2 years) participated in this study. The experiment consisted of an exercise and a rest condition. In the exercise condition, participants completed 30 minutes of walking and/or jogging on a motor driven treadmill sufficient to achieve an intensity of 70% of maximum heartrate (HRmax). In the rest condition, participants rested quietly for 30 minutes. Both conditions were conducted on different days, and the order was counterbalanced across participants. Participants performed the task-switching paradigm (switching between two different tasks), after both exercise and rest conditions respectively. The P3 amplitude was smaller in the non-switch trial than the single trial only in the rest condition, but not in the exercise condition. In other words, more attentional resources were allocated to the non-switch trial requiring greater amounts of working memory following the exercise condition. Mixing and switch effects on the P3 component were influenced by acute aerobic exercise. This result suggests that acute aerobic exercise may serve to facilitate the flexibility of task-set reconfiguration and maintaining the task set in working memory. Furthermore, during the switch trials, the P3 latency was shorter in the exercise condition than in the rest condition. This result is consistent with the findings of previous studies, indicating that cognitive processing speed is increased only during task conditions requiring greater amounts of executive control. Our study clearly indicates that acute aerobic exercise may facilitate cognitive flexibility as well as other executive functions (i.e., inhibitory control and working memory).

A new approach to understanding the interaction between cortical areas is provided by a mathematical analysis of biased competition, which describes many interactions between cortical areas, including those involved in top-down attention. The analysis helps to elucidate the principles of operation of such cortical systems, and in particular the parameter values within which biased competition operates. The analytic results are supported by simulations that illustrate the operation of the system with parameters selected from the analysis. The findings provide a detailed mathematical analysis of the operation of these neural systems with nodes connected by feedforward (bottom-up) and feedback (top-down) connections. The analysis provides the critical value of the top-down attentional bias that enables biased competition to operate for a range of input values to the network, and derives this as a function of all the parameters in the model. The critical value of the top-down bias depends linearly on the value of the other inputs, but the coefficients in the function reveal non-linear relations between the remaining parameters. The results provide reasons why the backprojections should not be very much weaker than the forward connections between two cortical areas. The major advantage of the analytical approach is that it discloses relations between all the parameters of the model. This task cannot be fulfilled purely by numerical simulations.

The immune system provides protection in the CNS via resident microglial cells and those that traffic into it in the course of pathological challenges. These populations of cells are key players in modulating immune functions that are involved in disease outcomes. In this review, we briefly summarize and highlight the current state of knowledge of the differential contributions of microglia and monocytes in Alzheimer’s disease and multiple sclerosis. The role of innate immunity is frequently seen as a Yin and Yang in both diseases, but this depends on the environment, pre-clinical disease models and the type of cells involved.

The development of the human cerebral cortex is a complex and dynamic process, in which neural stem cell proliferation, neuronal migration and post-migratory neuronal organization need to occur in a well-organized fashion. Alterations at any of these crucial stages can result in Malformations of Cortical Development (MCDs), a group of genetically heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorders that present with developmental delay, intellectual disability and epilepsy. Recent progress in genetic technologies, such as next generation sequencing, most often focusing on all protein-coding exons (e.g., Whole Exome Sequencing), allowed the discovery of more than a hundred genes associated with various types of MCDs. Although this has considerably increased the diagnostic yield, most MCD cases still remain unexplained. As Whole Exome Sequencing investigates only a minor part of the human genome (1-2%), it is likely that patients, in which no disease-causing mutation has been identified, could harbor mutations in genomic regions beyond the exome. Even though functional annotation of non-coding regions is still lagging behind that of protein-coding genes, tremendous progress has been made in the field of gene regulation. One group of non-coding regulatory regions are enhancers, which can be distantly located upstream or downstream of genes and which can mediate temporal and tissue-specific transcriptional control via long-distance interactions with promoter regions. Although some examples exist in literature that link alterations of enhancers to genetic disorders, a widespread appreciation of the putative roles of these sequences in MCDs is still lacking. Here, we summarize the current state of knowledge on cis-regulatory regions and discuss novel technologies such as massively-parallel reporter assay systems, CRISPR-Cas9-based screens and computational approaches that help to further  elucidate the emerging role of the non-coding genome in disease. Moreover, we discuss existing literature on mutations or copy number alterations of regulatory regions involved in brain development. We foresee that the future implementation of the knowledge obtained through ongoing gene regulation studies will benefit patients and will provide an explanation to part of the missing heritability of MCDs and other genetic disorders.

The basic leucine-zipper (bZIP) domain transcription factors CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins (C/EBP) have a variety of roles in cell proliferation, differentiation, and stress response. In the nervous system, several isoforms of C/EBP function in learning and memory, neuronal plasticity, neuroinflammation and axon regeneration. We previously reported that the C. elegans C/EBP homolog, CEBP-1, is essential for axon regeneration. CEBP-1 consists of 319 amino acids, with its bZIP domain at the C-terminus and a long N-terminal fragment with no known protein motifs. Here, using forward genetic screening with targeted genome editing, we have identified a unique domain in the N-terminus that is critical for its in vivo function. Additionally, we characterized three nuclear localization signals (NLS) in CEBP-1 that act together to mediate CEBP-1’s nuclear import. Moreover, the Importin-α, IMA-3, can bind to CEBP-1 via one of the NLS. ima-3 is ubiquitously expressed in all somatic cells, and ima-3 null mutants are larval lethal. Using Cre-lox dependent neuron-specific deletion strategy, we show that ima-3 is not critical for axon development, but is required for axon regeneration in adults. Together, these data advance our understanding of CEBP-1’s function, and suggest new regulators that remain to be identified to expand the CEBP-1 protein interactome.

BACKGROUND: Multicellular taste buds located within taste papillae on the tongue mediate taste sensation. In taste papillae, taste bud cells, such as taste receptor cells and taste precursor cells, and the surrounding lingual epithelium including epithelial progenitors (also called taste stem/progenitor cells) are maintained by continuous cell turnover throughout life. However, it remains unknown how the cells constituting taste buds proliferate and differentiate to maintain taste bud tissue. Based on in situ hybridization screening, we demonstrated that the oncofetal antigen 5T4 (also known as trophoblast glycoprotein: TPBG) gene is expressed in the adult mouse tongue.
RESULTS: In immunohistochemistry of coronal tongue sections, 5T4 protein was detected at a low level exclusively in the basal part of the lingual epithelium in developing and adult mice, and at a high level particularly in foliate papillae and circumvallate papillae (CVPs). Furthermore, immunohistochemistry of the basal part of CVPs indicated that the proliferation marker PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen) co-localized with 5T4. 5T4 was strongly expressed in Krt5+ epithelial progenitors and Shh+ taste precursor cells, but weakly in mature taste receptor cells. The number of proliferating cells in the CVP was higher in 5T4-knockout mice than in wild-type mice, while neither cell differentiation nor the size of taste buds differed between these two groups of mice. Notably, X-ray irradiation enhanced cell proliferation more in 5T4-knockout mice than in wild-type mice.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that 5T4, expressed in epithelial progenitors (taste stem/progenitor cells) and taste precursor cells, may influence the maintenance of taste papillae under both normal and injury conditions.

Genetically encoded voltage indicators (GEVIs) are fluorescent protein reporters of membrane potential. These tools can, in principle, be used to monitor the neural activity of genetically distinct cell types in the brain. Although introduced in 1997, they have been a challenge to use to study intact neural circuits due to a combination of small signal-to-noise ratio, slow kinetics, and poor membrane expression. New strategies have yielded novel GEVIs such as ArcLight, which have improved properties. Here we compare the in vivo properties of ArcLight with Genetically Encoded Calcium Indicators (GECIs) in the mouse olfactory bulb. We show how voltage imaging can be combined with organic calcium sensitive dyes to measure the input-output transformation of the olfactory bulb. Finally, we demonstrate that ArcLight can be targeted to olfactory bulb interneurons. The olfactory bulb contributes substantially to the perception of the concentration invariance of odor recognition.

Similar to humans, the normal aged rat population is not homogenous in terms of cognitive function. Two distinct subpopulations of aged Sprague-Dawley rats can be identified on the basis of spatial memory performance in the hole-board paradigm. It was the aim of the study to reveal protein changes relevant to aging and spatial memory performance.
Aged impaired (AI) and unimpaired (AU) male rats, 22-24 months old were selected from a large cohort of 160 animals; young animals served as controls. Enriched synaptosomal fraction from dentate gyrus from behaviourally characterized old animals were used for isobaric tags labelling based quantitative proteomic analysis. As differences in peroxiredoxin 6 (PRDX6) levels were a pronounced finding, PRDX6 levels were also quantified by immunoblotting.
AI showed impaired spatial memory abilities while AU performed comparable to young animals. Our study demonstrates substantial quantitative alteration of proteins involved in energy metabolism, inflammation and synaptic plasticity during aging. Moreover, we identified protein changes specifically coupled to memory performance of aged rats. PRDX6 levels clearly differentiated AI from AU and levels in AU were comparable to those of young animals. In addition, it was observed that stochasticity in protein levels increased with age and discriminate between AI and AU groups. Moreover, there was a significantly higher variability of protein levels in AI.  
PRDX6 is a member of the peroxiredoxin family and well-defined as a cystein-1 PRDX that reduces and detoxifies hydroxyperoxides. It is well-known and documented that the aging brain shows increased active oxygen species but so far no study proposed a potential target with antioxidant activity that would discriminate between impaired and unimpaired memory performers. Current data, representing so far the largest proteomics data set in aging DG, provide first evidence for a probable role of PRDX6 in memory performance.

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most frequent neurodegenerative disease worldwide and the availability of early biomarkers and novel biotargets represents an urgent medical need. The main pathogenetic hallmark of PD is the specific loss of nigral dopaminergic neurons, in which mitochondrial dysfunction plays a crucial role. Mitochondrial proteases are central to the maintenance of healthy mitochondria and they have recently emerged as drug targets. However, an exhaustive characterization of these enzymes and their targets is still lacking, due to difficulties in analyzing proteolytic fragments by bottom-up proteomics approaches. 
	Here, we propose the “mitochondrial dimethylation-TAILS” strategy, which combines the isolation of mitochondria with the enrichment of N-terminal peptides to analyze the mitochondrial N-terminome. We applied this method in a cellular model of altered dopamine homeostasis in neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells, which recapitulates early steps of PD pathogenesis. The main aim was to identify candidate mitochondrial proteases aberrantly activated by dopamine dysregulation and their cleaved targets. The proposed degradomics workflow was able to improve the identification of mitochondrial proteins if compared to classical shotgun analysis. In detail, 40% coverage of the mitochondrial proteome was obtained, the sequences of the transit peptides of two mitochondrial proteins was unveiled, and a consensus cleavage sequence for proteases involved in the processing of mitochondrial proteins was depicted. Mass spectrometry proteomics data have been submitted to ProteomeXchange with the identifier PXD013900. Moreover, sixty-one N-terminal peptides whose levels were affected by dopamine treatment were identified. By an in-depth analysis of the proteolytic peptides included in this list, eleven mitochondrial proteins showed altered proteolytic processing. One of these proteins (i.e., the 39S ribosomal protein L49 - MRPL49) was cleaved by the neprilysin protease, already exploited in clinics as a biotarget. We eventually demonstrated a mitochondrial subcellular localization of neprilysin in human cells for the first time.
	Collectively, these results shed new light on mitochondrial dysfunction linked to dopamine imbalance in PD and opened up the possibility to explore the mitochondrial targets of neprilysin as candidate biomarkers.

<p>by Jonathan E. Rubin, Jeffrey C. Smith</p>

A central issue in the study of the neural generation of respiratory rhythms is the role of the intrinsic pacemaking capabilities that some respiratory neurons exhibit. The debate on this issue has occurred in parallel to investigations of interactions among respiratory network neurons and how these contribute to respiratory behavior. In this computational study, we demonstrate how these two issues are inextricably linked. We use simulations and dynamical systems analysis to show that once a conditional respiratory pacemaker, which can be tuned across oscillatory and non-oscillatory dynamic regimes in isolation, is embedded into a respiratory network, its dynamics become masked: the network exhibits similar dynamical properties regardless of the conditional pacemaker node’s tuning, and that node’s outputs are dominated by network influences. Furthermore, the outputs of the respiratory central pattern generator as a whole are invariant to these changes of dynamical properties, which ensures flexible and robust performance over a wide dynamic range.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/XyZO8F7-3rc" width="1" />

Abstract<p>In the resting state, heartbeats evoke cortical responses called heartbeat-evoked responses (HERs), which reflect cortical cardiac interoceptive processing. While previous studies have reported that the heartbeat evokes cortical responses at a regional level, whether the heartbeat induces synchronization between regions to form a network structure remains unknown. Using resting-state magnetoencephalography data from 85 human subjects of both genders, we first showed that heartbeat increases the phase synchronization between cortical regions in the theta frequency but not in other frequency bands. This increase in synchronization between cortical regions formed a network structure called the heartbeat-induced network (HIN), which did not reflect artificial phase synchronization. In the HIN, the left inferior temporal gyrus and parahippocampal gyrus played a central role as hubs. Furthermore, the HIN was modularized, containing 5 subnetworks called modules. In particular, module 1 played a central role in between-module interactions in the HIN. Furthermore, synchronization within module 1 had a positive association with the mood of an individual. In this study, we show the existence of the HIN and its network properties, advancing the current understanding of cortical heartbeat processing and its relationship with mood, which was previously confined to region-level.</p><p><b>Significance statement</b> Complex brain processing usually occurs at a network level, which requires an interaction between brain regions. However, despite its importance in homeostasis and affective processing, a network level processing of cardiac interoception has not been investigated. Here, we first provided an evidence that the heartbeat induces phase synchronizations between cortical regions those comprise a heartbeat-induced network (HIN) with control analyses excluding the possibility of an artificial synchronization. Furthermore, by applying graph-theoretical analysis, we find hubs of the HIN and found out that it is a modularized network with five modules. Finally, we also showed the relationship between the participants’ mood and the HIN. These results provide the first evidence of network-level heartbeat processing and its relevance with emotion.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>To determine whether amyloid imaging with the positron emission tomography (PET) agent Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) can detect vascular ß‐amyloid (Aß) in the essentially pure form of cerebral amyloid angiopathy associated with the Dutch‐type hereditary cerebral amyloid angiopathy (D‐CAA) mutation.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>PiB retention in a cortical composite of frontal, lateral, and retrosplenial regions (FLR) was measured by PiB‐PET in 19 D‐CAA mutation carriers (M+; 13 without neurologic symptoms, 6 with prior lobar intracerebral hemorrhage) and 17 mutation non‐carriers (M‐). Progression of PiB retention was analyzed in a subset of 18 serially imaged individuals (10 asymptomatic M+, 8 M‐). We also analyzed associations between PiB retention and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Aß concentrations in 17 M+ and 11 M‐ participants who underwent lumbar puncture and compared the findings to PiB‐PET and CSF Aß in 37 autosomal dominant Alzheimer disease (ADAD) mutation carriers.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>D‐CAA M+ showed greater age‐dependent FLR PiB retention (p&lt;0.001) than M‐, and serially imaged asymptomatic M+ demonstrated greater longitudinal increases (p=0.004). Among M+, greater FLR PiB retention associated with reduced CSF concentrations of Aß40 (r=‐0.55, p=0.021) but not Aß42 (r=0.01, p=0.991). Despite comparably low CSF Aß40 and Aß42, PiB retention was substantially less in D‐CAA than ADAD (p&lt;0.001).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Increased PiB retention in D‐CAA and correlation with reduced CSF Aß40 suggest this compound labels vascular amyloid, though to a lesser degree than amyloid deposits in ADAD. Progression in PiB signal over time suggests amyloid PET as a potential biomarker in trials of candidate agents for this untreatable cause of hemorrhagic stroke.</p>

Abstract<p>Neurons in the adult mammalian CNS fails to regenerate after severe injury. However, it is known that an increase in neural activity occurs in mouse retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) after extrinsic stimulation and this can induce axon growth. In the present study, we applied an optogenetic approach using a mouse model, specifically involving channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) expression in RGCs. We investigated whether modulation of RGC neural activity exclusively by blue light stimulation is able to promote neurite outgrowth of postnatal retinal explants. The results showed that activation of RGCs expressing ChR2 by 20 Hz blue light for one hour is a most effective way of enhancing neurite outgrowth in postnatal retinas. This is achieved via gap junctions that spread neural activity across the whole retina. Moreover, we found that activation of intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells by blue light also contributes significantly to the promotion of neurite outgrowth in the same postnatal retinal explants. Our findings not only demonstrate that a short-term increase in RGC neural activity is sufficient to facilitate the neurite outgrowth of retinal explants, but also highlight the fact that the temporal pattern of neural activity in RGCs is a critical factor in regulating axon regeneration.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Neurons in the mammalian central nervous system rarely regenerate and typically die soon after injury. The use of optogenetics in promoting axon regrowth has been recognized in recent years. However, the potential of optogenetics has not been fully explored in treating optic nerve injury and glaucoma. By using the mice with channelrhodopsin-2 expressed specifically in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and stimulating the retinal explants with blue light, this project reveals that the temporal pattern of neural activity in RGCs is an important factor driving neurite outgrowth. In addition, intrinsic photosensitive RGCs also contribute in facilitating axon growth in postnatal animals. This study thus provides significant insights into the development of therapeutic strategy for axon regeneration of RGCs.</p>

Abstract<p>The ability to recognize and identify a smell is highly dependent on multisensory context and expectation, for example, hearing the name of the odor source. Here, we develop a novel auditory-odor association task in rats, wherein the animal learn that a specific auditory tone, when associated with a specific odor, predicts reward (Go signal), whereas the same tone associated with a different odor, or <i>vice versa,</i> is not (No-Go signal). The tone occurs prior to the onset of the odor, allowing physiological analyses of sensory-evoked local field potential activity to each stimulus in primary auditory cortex and anterior piriform cortex. In trained animals that have acquired the task, both auditory and subsequent olfactory cues activate beta band oscillations in both the auditory and piriform cortices, suggesting multisensory integration. Naïve animals show no such multisensory responses, suggesting the response is learned. In addition to the learned multisensory evoked responses, functional connectivity between auditory and piriform cortex, as assessed with spectral coherence and phase lag index, is enhanced. Importantly, both the multi-sensory evoked responses and the functional connectivity are context-dependent. In trained animals, the same auditory stimuli presented in the home cage evoke no responses in auditory or piriform cortex, and functional connectivity between the sensory cortices is reduced. Together, the results demonstrate how learning and context shape the expression of multisensory cortical processing. Given that odor identification impairment is associated with preclinical dementia in humans, the mechanisms suggested here may help develop experimental models to assess effects of neuropathology on behavior.</p><p><b>Significance statement</b> An important feature in mammalian olfaction is the multisensory support provided by "higher" senses, such as hearing and vision. In humans, such multisensory context and expectation, for example hearing the name of the odor source, facilitates the identification of a smell. An impaired ability to identify odors is a sensitive predictor of cognitive decline and neurodegenerative dementia. We found that rats trained on a tone-odor association task, but not untrained rats, showed elevated electrophysiological responses in both auditory and olfactory cortices, as well as increased functional connectivity between these regions, during task engagement. These results provide evidence of a multisensory integration process that might provide clues to how neuropathology affects the brain.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To investigate whether soluble growth stimulation expressed gene 2 (sST2), a prognostic marker in cardiovascular and inflammatory disorders, is associated with neurological injury after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH).</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We studied SAH patients from 2 independent cohorts. Outcome assessments included functional status at 90 days using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS), mortality, and delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI). The relationships between sST2 plasma level and outcome measures were assessed in both cross‐sectional and longitudinal analysis. Primary blood mononuclear cells from SAH patients and elective aneurysm controls were analyzed by multiparameter flow cytometry.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In the discovery cohort, sST2 predicted 90‐day mRS 3–6 (C index = 0.724, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and mortality in Kaplan–Meier analysis (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). The association with functional status was independent of age, sex, World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies score, modified Fisher score, treatment modality, and cardiac comorbidities (adjusted odds ratio = 2.28, 95% confidence interval = 1.04–5.00, <i>p</i> = 0.039). Higher sST2 concentration was observed in those patients with DCI (90.8 vs 53.7ng/ml, <i>p</i> = 0.003). These associations were confirmed in a replication cohort. In patients with high sST2, flow cytometry identified decreased expression of CD14 (4.27 × 10<sup>5</sup> ± 2,950 arbitrary unit (AU) vs 5.64 × 10<sup>5</sup> ± 1,290 AU, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), and increased expression of CD16 (39,960 ± 272 AU vs 34,869 ± 183 AU, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Plasma sST2 predicts DCI, functional outcome, and mortality after SAH, independent of clinical and radiographic markers. Elevated sST2 is also associated with changes in CD14<sup>+</sup>CD16<sup>+</sup> monocytes. ANN NEUROL 2019</p>

<p>In daily life situations, we have to perform multiple tasks given a visual
stimulus, which requires task-relevant information to be transmitted through
our visual system. When it is not possible to transmit all the possibly
relevant information to higher layers, due to a bottleneck, task-based
modulation of early visual processing might be necessary. In this work, we
report how the effectiveness of modulating the early processing stage of an
artificial neural network depends on the information bottleneck faced by the
network. The bottleneck is quantified by the number of tasks the network has to
perform and the neural capacity of the later stage of the network. The
effectiveness is gauged by the performance on multiple object detection tasks,
where the network is trained with a recent multi-task optimization scheme. By
associating neural modulations with task-based switching of the state of the
network and characterizing when such switching is helpful in early processing,
our results provide a functional perspective towards understanding why
task-based modulation of early neural processes might be observed in the
primate visual cortex

<p>Spatiotemporal information processing is fundamental to brain functions. The
present study investigates a canonic neural network model for spatiotemporal
pattern recognition. Specifically, the model consists of two modules, a
reservoir subnetwork and a decision-making subnetwork. The former projects
complex spatiotemporal patterns into spatially separated neural
representations, and the latter reads out these neural representations via
integrating information over time; the two modules are combined together via
supervised-learning using known examples. We elucidate the working mechanism of
the model and demonstrate its feasibility for discriminating complex
spatiotemporal patterns. Our model reproduces the phenomenon of recognizing
looming patterns in the neural system, and can learn to discriminate gait with
very few training examples. We hope this study gives us insight into
understanding how spatiotemporal information is processed in the brain and
helps us to develop brain-inspired application algorithms.

<p>Recently, visual encoding based on functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI) have realized many achievements with the rapid development of deep
network computation. Visual encoding model is aimed at predicting brain
activity in response to presented image stimuli. Currently, visual encoding is
accomplished mainly by firstly extracting image features through convolutional
neural network (CNN) model pre-trained on computer vision task, and secondly
training a linear regression model to map specific layer of CNN features to
each voxel, namely voxel-wise encoding. However, the two-step manner model,
essentially, is hard to determine which kind of well features are well linearly
matched for beforehand unknown fMRI data with little understanding of human
visual representation. Analogizing computer vision mostly related human vision,
we proposed the end-to-end convolution regression model (ETECRM) in the region
of interest (ROI)-wise manner to accomplish effective and efficient visual
encoding. The end-to-end manner was introduced to make the model automatically
learn better matching features to improve encoding performance. The ROI-wise
manner was used to improve the encoding efficiency for many voxels. In
addition, we designed the selective optimization including self-adapting weight
learning and weighted correlation loss, noise regularization to avoid
interfering of ineffective voxels in ROI-wise encoding. Experiment demonstrated
that the proposed model obtained better predicting accuracy than the two-step
manner of encoding models. Comparative analysis implied that end-to-end manner
and large volume of fMRI data may drive the future development of visual
encoding.

<p>Machine learning has made major advances in categorizing objects in images,
yet the best algorithms miss important aspects of how people learn and think
about categories. People can learn richer concepts from fewer examples,
including causal models that explain how members of a category are formed.
Here, we explore the limits of this human ability to infer causal "programs" --
latent generating processes with nontrivial algorithmic properties -- from one,
two, or three visual examples. People were asked to extrapolate the programs in
several ways, for both classifying and generating new examples. As a theory of
these inductive abilities, we present a Bayesian program learning model that
searches the space of programs for the best explanation of the observations.
Although variable, people's judgments are broadly consistent with the model and
inconsistent with several alternatives, including a pre-trained deep neural
network for object recognition, indicating that people can learn and reason
with rich algorithmic abstractions from sparse input data.

<p>Any function can be constructed using a hierarchy of simpler functions
through compositions. Such a hierarchy can be characterized by a binary rooted
tree. Each node of this tree is associated with a function which takes as
inputs two numbers from its children and produces one output. Since thinking
about functions in terms of computation graphs is getting popular we may want
to know which functions can be implemented on a given tree. Here, we describe a
set of necessary constraints in the form of a system of non-linear partial
differential equations that must be satisfied. Moreover, we prove that these
conditions are sufficient in both contexts of analytic and bit-valued
functions. In the latter case, we explicitly enumerate discrete functions and
observe that there are relatively few. Our point of view allows us to compare
different neural network architectures in regard to their function spaces. Our
work connects the structure of computation graphs with the functions they can
implement and has potential applications to neuroscience and computer science.

<p>The ancient mind/body problem continues to be one of deepest mysteries of
science and of the human spirit. Despite major advances in many fields, there
is still no plausible link between subjective experience (qualia) and its
realization in the body. This paper outlines some of the elements of a rigorous
science of mind (SoM) - key ideas include scientific realism of mind, agnostic
mysterianism, careful attention to language, and a focus on concrete
(touchstone) questions and results. A core suggestion is to focus effort on the
(still mysterious) mapping from neural activity to subjective experience.

(18):1-48 (2016), <a href="http://export.arxiv.org/abs/1504.02953">arXiv:1504.02953</a>] contains a mistake, which implies a weaker
regularity estimate than the one stated in Proposition 4.11. This does not
affect the proof of Theorem 2.1, but Theorems 2.2 and 2.3 only follow from the
given proof if either the space dimension $d$ is equal to $2$, or the
nonlinearity $F(U,V)$ is linear in $V$. To fix this problem and provide a proof
of Theorems 2.2 and 2.3 valid in full generality, we consider an alternative
formulation of the fixed-point problem, involving a modified integration
operator with nonlocal singularity and a slightly different regularity
structure. We provide the multilevel Schauder estimates and
renormalisation-group analysis required for the fixed-point argument in this
new setting.

2, 3, 5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining is a commonly used method to determine the volume of the cerebral infarction in experimental stroke models. The TTC staining protocol is considered to interfere with downstream analyses, and it is unclear whether TTC-stained brain samples can be used for biochemistry analyses. However, there is evidence indicating that, with proper optimization and handling, TTC-stained brains may remain viable for protein analyses. In the present study, we aimed to rigorously assess whether TTC can reliably be used for western blotting of various markers. In this study, brain samples obtained from C57BL/6 male mice were treated with TTC (TTC+) or left untreated (TTC-) at 1 week after photothrombotic occlusion or sham surgery. Brain regions were dissected into infarct, thalamus and hippocampus and proteins were extracted by using radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer. Protein levels of apoptosis, autophagy, neuronal, glial, vascular and neurodegenerative related markers were analyzed by western blotting. Our results showed that TTC+ brains display similar relative changes in most of the markers compared with TTC- brains. In addition, we validated that these analyses can be performed in the infarct as well as other brain regions such as the thalamus and hippocampus. Our findings demonstrate that TTC+ brains are reliable for protein analyses using western blotting.

Malocclusion is an important risk factor for temporomandibular disorder (TMD), a series of disorders characterized by dysfunction in the orofacial region involving the temporomandibular joint and jaw muscles. We recently showed that experimental unilateral anterior crossbite (UAC) produced masseter hyperactivity through a circuit involving the periodontal proprioception, trigeminal mesencephalic nucleus (Vme), and trigeminal motor nucleus (Vmo). Anxiety is a common complication in patients with TMD. The lateral habenula (LHb) is involved in emotional modulation and has direct projections to the Vme. Therefore, the present research examined whether UAC facilitates excitatory input from the LHb to the Vme and subsequently anxiety-like behaviors in rats. The LHb activation was evaluated by the electrophysiological recording, assessment of vesicular glutamate transporter-2 (VGLUT2) mRNA expression, and measurement of anxiety-like behaviors. The effects of LHb activity on Vme were evaluated by electrophysiological recording from Vme neurons and local changes in VGLUT2 protein density. UAC produced anxiety in modelled rats and increased neuronal activity in the LHb. VGLUT2 mRNA expression was also increased in the LHb. Further, VGLUT2-positive boutons were observed in close apposite upon parvalbumin-labelled Vme neurons. VGLUT2 protein expression was also increased in the Vme. Significantly, injection of VGLUT2-targeted shRNA into the LHb reduced the expression of VGLUT2 protein in the Vme, attenuated UAC-associated anxiety-like behaviors, and attenuated electrophysiological changes in the Vme neurons. In conclusion, we show that UAC activates the LHb neurons as well as the periodontal proprioceptive pathway to provide excitatory input to the Vme and produce anxiety in rats. These findings provide a rationale for suppressing activity of the LHb to attenuate both the physical and psychological effects of TMD.

Taste perception changes with obesity but the underlying neural changes remain poorly understood. To address this issue, we recorded taste responses from single cells in the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS, the first synapse in the central gustatory circuit) in awake, diet-induced obese [(DIO; ≥ 8wks on a high-energy diet (45%fat, 17% sugar; HED)] and lean rats. Rats were implanted with a bundle of microelectrodes in the NTS and allowed to recover. Water-deprived rats were allowed to freely lick various tastants in an experimental chamber. Taste stimuli included an array of sapid stimuli dissolved in artificial saliva (AS). Each taste trial consisted of five consecutive licks followed by five AS licks presented on a VR5 schedule. Results showed that taste responses in NTS cells in DIO rats (n=49) were smaller in magnitude, shorter in duration and longer in latency that those in lean rats (n=74).  However, there were proportionately more taste-responsive cells in DIO than in lean rats. Lick coherence in DIO rats was significantly lower than in lean rats, both in taste-responsive and lick-related cells (n=172 in lean; n=65 in DIO). Analyses of temporal coding showed that taste cells in DIO rats conveyed less information about taste quality than cells in lean rats. Collectively, results suggest that a HED produces blunted, but more prevalent, responses to taste in the NTS and a weakened association of taste responses with ingestive behavior. These neural adaptations may represent both negative effects and compensatory mechanisms of a HED that may underlie deficits in taste-related behavior associated with obesity.

The olfactory involvement is an early feature of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The olfactory functional MRI (fMRI) is an objective method to evaluate the olfactory function, but might be affected by the individual variation and the magnetic susceptibility artifact of basis cranii. To improve the reliability of olfactory fMRI, we explored the response of primary olfactory cortex (POC) across three different concentrations of odors. 44 normal controls, 46 subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 44 patients with AD underwent olfactory fMRI using lavender stimuli of three different (0.10%, 0.33%, and 1.00%) concentrations during one fMRI sequence with a 3.0T MRI scanner. The numbers of activated voxels in the POC especially the activation changes during different concentrations were analyzed. The POC activation pattern of controls showed olfactory adaptation at the higher concentration, whereas the AD patients showed not only increased olfactory threshold but also lack of olfactory habituation. Five types of activation patterns across different concentrations were summarized to evaluate the olfactory function. The result showed the activation pattern could effectively found 40/44(90.9%) of the ADs showed impaired habituation, whereas 31/44(70.5%) of the normal controls showed normal olfactory habituation. In MCIs, 29/46(63.0%) of subjects showed impaired habituation. This finding indicates that the POC activation pattern of olfactory fMRI across different concentrations is useful in evaluating the olfactory function, which is important in the detection of early AD among MCI cases.

Electrical stimulation of the brain through the implantation of electrodes is an effective treatment for certain diseases and the focus of a large body of research investigating new cell mechanisms, neurological phenomena, and treatments. Electrode devices developed for stimulation in rodents vary widely in size, cost, and functionality, with the majority of recent studies presenting complex, multi-functional designs. While some experiments require these added features, others are in greater need of reliable, low cost, and readily available devices that will allow surgeries to be scheduled and completed without delay. In this work, we utilize 3D printing and common electrical hardware to produce an effective 2-channel stimulation device that meets these requirements. Our stimulation electrode has not failed in over 60 consecutive surgeries, costs less than $1 USD, and can be assembled in less than 20 minutes. 3D printing minimizes the amount of material used in manufacturing the device and enables one to match the curvature of the connector’s base with the curvature of the mouse skull, producing an ultra-lightweight, low size device with improved adhesion to the mouse skull. The range of the stimulation parameters used with the proposed device was: pulse amplitude 1-200 μA, pulse duration 50-500 μs and pulse frequency 1-285Hz.

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease. PD symptomology is recognized as heterogeneous and in addition to motor function decline, includes cognitive, mood, sleep and metabolic disorders. Previous studies showed early reductions in anxiety and locomotion in the A53T mice model of PD. Since inflammation and astrogliosis are an integral part of PD pathology and impair proper neuronal function, we were keen to investigate if behavioral changes in A53T mice are accompanied by increased inflammation and astrogliosis in the Hippocampus (Hipp) and motor cortex (mCtx), brain regions involved in the regulation of anxiety and locomotion, respectively. To test this, we used 3, 5, and 7-month old A53T mice to examine anxiety-like behavior, locomotion, and expression of inflammation and astrogliosis markers in the hippocampus (Hipp) and motor cortex (mCtx). Further, we examined the presence of alpha-synuclein accumulation in orexin neurons and orexin neuronal loss. The data show early reductions in anxiety like behavior as well as increased locomotor activity, which was accompanied by inflammation and astrogliosis in the Hipp and mCtx. Due to the persistence of the orexin neuron population in A53T mice and the involvement of orexin in anxiety and locomotor regulation, we hypothesized that chemogenetic modulation of orexin neurons would reverse the observed reductions in anxiety-like behavior and the increases in locomotor activity in these animals. We showed that chemogenetic activation of orexin neurons in A53T mice restores anxiety-like behavior back to control levels without affecting locomotor activity, whereas the inhibition of orexin neurons reverses the elevated locomotor activity without any effects on anxiety-like behavior. This study exemplifies the complex role of orexin neurons in this model of PD and demonstrates the novel finding that changes in locomotor and anxiety-like behavior are accompanied by inflammation and astrogliosis.  Together, these data suggest that the orexin system may play a significant role in early and late stages of PD.

We overview major open-source toolboxes for spike and LFP data analysis as well as toolboxes with tools for connectivity analysis, dimensionality reduction and generalized linear modeling. We focus on comparing toolboxes functionality, statistical and visualization tools, documentation and support quality. To give a better insight, we compare and illustrate functionality of the toolboxes on open-access dataset or simulated data and make corresponding MATLAB scripts publicly available.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2019.00052">Revealing the Synaptic Hodology of Mammalian Neural Circuits With Multiscale Neurocartography</a></h4>

The functional features of neural circuits are determined by a combination of properties that range in scale from projections systems across the whole brain to molecular interactions at the synapse. The burgeoning field of neurocartography seeks to map these relevant features of brain structure—spanning a volume ~20 orders of magnitude—to determine how neural circuits perform computations supporting cognitive function and complex behavior. Recent technological breakthroughs in tissue sample preparation, high-throughput electron microscopy imaging, and automated image analyses have produced the first visualizations of all synaptic connections between neurons of invertebrate model systems. However, the sheer size of the central nervous system in mammals implies that reconstruction of the first full brain maps at synaptic scale may not be feasible for decades. In this review, we outline existing and emerging technologies for neurocartography that complement electron microscopy-based strategies and are beginning to derive some basic organizing principles of circuit hodology at the mesoscale, microscale, and nanoscale. Specifically, we discuss how a host of light microscopy techniques including array tomography have been utilized to determine both long-range and subcellular organizing principles of synaptic connectivity. In addition, we discuss how new techniques, such as two-photon serial tomography of the entire mouse brain, have become attractive approaches to dissect the potential connectivity of defined cell types. Ultimately, principles derived from these techniques promise to facilitate a conceptual understanding of how connectomes, and neurocartography in general, can be effectively utilized towards reaching a mechanistic understanding of circuit function.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00261">P300 Speller Performance Predictor Based on RSVP Multi-feature</a></h4>

Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have been developed so that people can control computers or machines through their brain activity without limb movements. The P300 speller is one of the BCI applications most commonly used as it is very simple and reliable and may achieve relatively higher accuracy compared to other types of BCIs. However, like other BCIs, the P300 speller still has performance variation issues in practical use, for example, selecting the best tradeoff between spelling accuracy and information transfer rate (speed). Therefore, seeking correlates of the P300 speller’s performance and predicting their performance is necessary to improve the P300 speller. In this work, we investigated the correlations between rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) task features and the P300 speller performance. Fifty-five subjects participated in the RSVP and conventional matrix P300 speller tasks, and RSVP behavioral features and electroencephalography features were compared to the P300 speller performance. We found that several ERP features and behavioral features of the RSVP were correlated with the P300 speller’s offline binary classification accuracy. Using these RSVP features, we proposed a simple multi-feature performance predictor (r = 0.53, p &lt; 0.0001) that outperformed any single feature performance predictor, including the conventional RSVP T1% predictor (r  = 0.32, p &lt; 0.05). This result demonstrates that selective multi-features can predict BCI performance better than only a single feature.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00255">Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation Modulates the Effect of Unreasonable Request in the Context of Peer Punishment</a></h4>

Making a request is a common occurrence during social interactions. In most social contexts, requesters may impose punishments and many behavioral studies have focused on the differential effects of reasonable and unreasonable requests during such interactions. However, few studies have explored whether reasonable or unreasonable requests involve differential neurocognitive mechanisms. In this study, we used transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to investigate the mechanistic effects of request within the context of peer punishment. We used a modified ultimatum game (UG) task as well as a modified dictator game (DG) task. Both unreasonable and reasonable requests induced the proposer to increase their monetary offer for both tasks. Moreover, in the modified UG task, cathodal tDCS over the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (rDLPFC) significantly decreased the effect of an unreasonable request when compared to sham stimulation. Cathodal stimulation did not impact the effect of a reasonable request on the modified UG task. For the modified DG task, no tDCS effect for either an unreasonable or reasonable request was observed. These findings suggest that rDLPFC was only involved in decision-making processes during unreasonable requests when there was an opportunity for peer punishment. Moreover, our results indicate that reasonable and unreasonable requests involve differential neurocognitive mechanisms in the context of possible peer punishment.

This study compared the predictive power and robustness of texture, topological, and convolutional neural network (CNN) based image features for measuring tumors in MRI.  These features were used to predict 1p/19q codeletion in the MICCAI BRATS 2017 challenge dataset.  Topological data analysis (TDA) based on persistent homology had predictive performance as good as or better than texture-based features and was also less susceptible to image-based perturbations.  Features from a pre-trained convolutional neural network had similar predictive performances and robustness as TDA, but also performed better using an alternative classification algorithm, k-top scoring pairs.  Feature robustness can be used as a filtering technique without greatly impacting model performance and can also be used to evaluate model stability.

Propagating waves with complex dynamics have been widely observed in neural population activity. To understand their formation mechanisms, we investigate a type of two-dimensional neural field model by systematically varying its recurrent excitatory and inhibitory inputs. We show that the neural field model exhibits a rich repertoire of dynamical activity states when the relevant strength of excitation and inhibition is increased, ranging from localized rotating and traveling waves to global waves. Particularly, near the transition between stable states of rotating and traveling waves, the model exhibits a bistable state; that is, both the rotating and the travelling waves can exist, and the inclusion of noise can induce spontaneous transitions between them. Furthermore, we demonstrate that when there are multiple propagating waves, they exhibit rich collective propagation dynamics with variable propagating speeds and trajectories. We use techniques from time series analysis such detrended fluctuation analysis to characterize the effect of the strength of excitation and inhibition on these collective dynamics, which range from purely random motion to motion with long-range spatiotemporal correlations. These results provide insights into the possible contribution of excitation and inhibition towards a range of previously observed spatiotemporal wave phenomena.

Histopathological studies revealed that progressive neuropathies including Alzheimer, and Prion diseases among others, include accumulations of misfolded proteins intracellularly, extracellularly, or both. Experimental evidence suggests that among the accumulated misfolded proteins, small soluble oligomeric conformers represent the most neurotoxic species. Concomitant phenomena shared by different protein misfolding diseases includes alterations in phosphorylation-based signaling pathways synaptic dysfunction, and axonal pathology, but mechanisms linking these pathogenic features to aggregated neuropathogenic proteins remain unknown. Relevant to this issue, results from recent work revealed inhibition of fast axonal transport (AT) as a novel toxic effect elicited by oligomeric forms of amyloid beta and cellular prion protein PrPC, signature pathological proteins associated with Alzheimer and Prion diseases, respectively. Interestingly, the toxic effect of these oligomers was fully prevented by pharmacological inhibitors of casein kinase 2 (CK2), a remarkable discovery with major implications for the development of pharmacological target-driven therapeutic intervention for Alzheimer and Prion diseases.

Some forms of triamcinolone may provide alternate options for local therapy of the inner ear in addition to the steroids currently in use. We compared the perilymph pharmacokinetics of triamcinolone-acetonide, triamcinolone and dexamethasone, each delivered as crystalline suspensions to guinea pigs. Triamcinolone-acetonide is a widely used form of the drug with molecular properties that allow it to readily permeate biological barriers. When applied intratympanically triamcinolone-acetonide entered perilymph rapidly but was also found to be eliminated rapidly from perilymph. The rapid rate of elimination severely limits the apical distribution of the drug when applied locally, making it unsuitable for use in the ear. In contrast, triamcinolone, rather than triamcinolone-acetonide, is a more polar form of the molecule, with higher aqueous solubility but calculated to pass less-readily through biological boundaries. Perilymph concentrations generated with intratympanic applications of triamcinolone were comparable to those with triamcinolone-acetonide but elimination measurements showed that triamcinolone was retained in perilymph longer than triamcinolone-acetonide or dexamethasone. The slower elimination is projected to result in improved distribution of triamcinolone towards the cochlear apex, potentially allowing higher drug levels to reach the speech frequency regions of the human ear. These measurements show that triamcinolone could constitute an attractive additional treatment option for local therapy of auditory disorders.

The mast cells (MCs) are the leader cells of inflammation. They are well-known for their involvement on allergic reactions through degranulation and release of vasoactive, inflammatory and nociceptive mediators. Upon encountering potential danger signal, MCs are true sensors of the environment, the first to respond in rapid and selective manner. The MC activates the algic response and modulates the evolution of nociceptive pain, typical of acute inflammation, to neuropathic. Yet, MC may contribute to modulate intensity of the associated depressive and ansiogenic component on the neuronal and microglial biological front. Chronic inflammation is a common mediator of these co-morbidities.
In parallel to the removal of the etiological factors of tissue damage, the modulation of MC hyperactivity and the reduction of the release of inflammatory factors may constitute a new frontier of pharmacological intervention aimed at preventing the chronicization of inflammation, the evolution of pain, and also the worsening of the depression and ansiogenic state associated with it. So, identifying specific molecules able to modify MC activity may be an important therapeutic tool.
Various preclinical evidences suggest that the intestinal microbiota contributes substantially to mood and behavioural disorders. In humans, conditions of the microbiota have been linked to stress, anxiety, depression, and visceral and centralized pain. 
MC is likely the crucial neuroimmune connecting between these components.
In this review, the involvement of MCs in pain, stress and depression is reviewed. We focus on the MC as target that may be mediating stress and mood disorders via microbiota-gut-brain axis.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is one of the most widespread neurodevelopmental disorders, characterized by impairment in social interactions and restricted stereotyped behaviors. Using immunohistochemistry and positron emission tomography (PET), several studies have provided evidence of the existence of activated microglia in ASD patients. Recently, we developed an animal model of ASD using the new world monkey common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) and demonstrated ASD-like social impairment after the in utero administration of valproic acid (VPA). To characterize microglia in this marmoset model of ASD from early toddler to adult, morphological analyses of microglia in VPA marmosets and age-matched unexposed (UE) marmosets were performed using immunohistochemistry for microglia-specific markers, Iba1 and P2RY12. The most robust morphological difference between VPA marmosets and UE marmosets throughout the life span evaluated were the microglia processes in VPA marmosets being frequently segmented by thin and faintly Iba1-positive structures. The segmentation of microglial processes was only rarely observed in UE marmosets. This feature of segmentation of microglial processes in VPA marmosets can also be observed in images from previous studies on ASD conducted in humans and animal models. Apoptotic cells have been shown to have segmented processes. Therefore, our results might suggest that microglia in patients and animals with ASD symptoms could frequently be in the apoptotic phase with high turnover rates of microglia found in some pathological conditions.

The pathological features of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) include senile plaques induced by amyloid-β (Aβ) protein deposits, neurofibrillary tangles formed by aggregates of hyperphosphorylated tau proteins and neuronal cell loss in specific position within the brain. Recent observations have suggested the possibility of an association between AD and cellular prion protein (PrPC) levels. PrPC is a high affinity receptor for oligomeric Aβ and is important for Aβ-induced neurotoxicity and thus plays a critical role in AD pathogenesis. The determination of the relationship between PrPC and AD and the characterization of PrPC binding to Aβ will facilitate the development of novel therapies for AD.

Prenatal hypoxic injury (HI) is a leading cause of neurological disability. The immediate and long-term effects of hypoxia on progenitor homeostasis and developmental progression during early human brain development remain unclear. This gap is due to difficulty to access human fetal brain tissues and inadequate animal models to study human corticogenesis. Recent optimization of cerebral organoid models derived from human embryonic stem (ES) cells present new opportunities to investigate pathophysiology of prenatal HI. Here, we implemented a transient HI model using human cerebral organoids with dorsal forebrain specification. We demonstrated that transient hypoxia resulted in immediate and prolonged apoptosis in cerebral organoids, with outer radial glia (oRG), a progenitor population more prominent in primates, and differentiating neuroblasts/immature neurons suffering larger losses. In contrast, neural stem cells in ventricular zone displayed relative resilience to HI and exhibited a shift of cleavage plane angle favoring symmetric division, thereby providing a mechanism to replenish the stem cell pool. Furthermore, we defined the vulnerable window and neurodifferentiation stages that are particularly sensitive to HI. Understanding cell type-specific and stage-dependent effects of prenatal HI on survival and mitotic behaviors of human neuroprogenitor subtypes during early human corticogenesis helps elucidate the etiology of neurodevelopmental disorders, and provides a therapeutic starting point to protect the vulnerable populations at critical timeframes.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00318">Dynamic Regulation of Synaptopodin and the Axon Initial Segment in Retinal Ganglion Cells During Postnatal Development</a></h4>

A key component allowing a neuron to function properly within its dynamic environment is the axon initial segment (AIS), the site of action potential generation. In visual cortex, AIS of pyramidal neurons undergoes periods of activity-dependent structural plasticity during development. However, it remains unknown how AIS morphology is organized during development for downstream cells in the visual pathway (retinal ganglion cells; RGCs) and whether AIS retains the ability to dynamically adjust to changes in network state. Here, we investigated the maturation of AIS in RGCs during mouse retinal development, and tested putative activity-dependent mechanisms by applying visual deprivation with a focus on the AIS-specific cisternal organelle (CO), a presumed Ca2+-store. Whole-mount retinae from wildtype and Thy1-GFP transgenic mice were processed for multi-channel immunofluorescence using antibodies against AIS scaffolding proteins ankyrin-G, βIV-spectrin and the CO marker synaptopodin (synpo). Confocal microscopy in combination with morphometrical analysis of AIS length and position as well as synpo cluster size was performed. Data indicated that a subset of RGC AIS contains synpo clusters and that these show significant dynamic regulation in size during development as well as after visual deprivation. Using super resolution microscopy, we addressed the subcellular localization of synpo in RGC axons. Similar to cortical neurons, RGCs show a periodic distribution of AIS scaffolding proteins. A previously reported scaffold-deficient nanodomain correlating with synpo localization is not evident in all RGC AIS. In summary, our work demonstrates a dynamic regulation of both the AIS and synpo in RGCs during retinal development and after visual deprivation, providing first evidence that the AIS and CO in RGCs can undergo structural plasticity in response to changes in network activity.

Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is a pleiotrophic molecule with neurotrophic and immunomodulatory functions. Knowing the capacity of chronically activated microglia to produce IGF-1 may therefore show essential to promote beneficial microglial functions in Alzheimer’s disease. Here, we investigated the expression of IGF-1 mRNA along with the expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) mRNA, and the amyloid-β (Aβ) plaque load in the hippocampus of 3- to 24-month-old APPswe/PS1dE9 transgenic (Tg) and wild-type (WT) mice. As IGF-1, in particular, is implicated in neurogenesis we also monitored the proliferation of cells in the subgranular zone (sgz) of the dentate gyrus. We found that the Aβ plaque load reached a plateau in aged APPswe/PS1dE9 Tg mice, and that microglial reactivity and hippocampal IGF-1 and TNF mRNA levels were significantly elevated in aged APPswe/PS1dE9 Tg mice. IGF-1 mRNA was expressed in subsets of sgz cells, likely neuroblasts, and neurons in both genotypes, regardless of age, as well as in glial-like cells which double in situ hybridization showed to be IGF1 mRNA+/CD11b mRNA+ cells, i.e. IGF-1 mRNA expressing microglia. Quantification showed a two-fold increase in the number of microglia and IGF-1 mRNA+ microglia in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus in aged APPswe/PS1dE9 Tg mice. Exposure of primary murine microglia and BV2 cells to Aβ42 did not affect IGF-1 mRNA expression. IGF-1 mRNA levels remained constant in WT mice with aging, unlike TNF mRNA levels which increased with aging. Finally, sgz cell proliferation decreased with age, regardless of genotype and the increased IGF-1 and TNF mRNA levels. In conclusion, our results suggest that the increased IGF-1 mRNA levels can be ascribed to a larger number of IGF-1 mRNA-expressing microglia in the aged APPswe/PS1dE9 Tg mice. The finding that subsets of microglia retain the capacity to express IGF-1 mRNA in the aged APPswe/PS1dE9 Tg mice is encouraging, considering the beneficial therapeutic potential of modulating microglial production of IGF-1 in AD.

Myotonic dystrophy (Dystrophia Myotonica; DM) is the most common adult onset muscular dystrophy and brain symptoms seriously affect patient’s quality of life. The Muscleblind-like (MBNL) proteins are splicing factors regulating posttranscriptional RNA during development. Previously, Mbnl KO mouse lines showed molecular and phenotypic evidences that recapitulating DM brains, however, detail morphological study has not yet been accomplished. In our studies, control (Mbnl1+/+; Mbnl2cond/cond; Nestin-Cre-/-), Mbnl2 conditional knockout (2KO, Mbnl1+/+; Mbnl2cond/cond; Nestin-Cre+/-) and Mbnl1/2 DKO (DKO, Mbnl1ΔE3/ΔE3; Mbnl2cond/cond; Nestin-Cre+/-) mice were generated by crossing three individual lines. Immunohistochemistry for evaluating densities and distributions of cortical neurons; Golgi staining for depicting the dendrites/dendritic spines; and electron microscopy for analyzing postsynaptic ultrastructure were performed. We found migratory defects in cortical neurons, reduction in dendritic complexity, immature dendritic spines and alterations of postsynaptic densities in the mutants. In conclusion, loss of function of Mbnl1/2 caused fundamental defects affecting neuronal positioning during migration, dendritic morphology and postsynaptic architectures that are reminiscent of predominantly immature and fetal phenotypes in DM patients.

During the last decade several papers reported a relationship between advanced age and changes in the integrity of the blood-brain barrier. These alterations manifested not only in the morphology and structure of the cerebral microvessels but also in the expression and function of the transporter proteins in the apical and basolateral surface of the capillary endothelial cells. Age-associated downregulation of the efflux pumps (ABC transporters) resulted in increased permeability and greater brain exposure to different xenobiotics enhancing the risk of drug-induced toxicity. In age-related neurodegenerative pathologies like Alzheimer’s disease the amyloid beta clearance decreased due to P-glycoprotein dysfunction leading to higher brain exposure. In the contrary, in stroke an enhanced P-glycoprotein function was reported in the cerebral capillaries making even more difficult to perform effective neuroprotective therapy in the infarcted brain area. This article is focusing on the role of efflux transporters at the blood-brain barrier in age-related brain pathologies and also in healthy aging.

Aging is associated with declines in motor and somatosensory function. Some of these motor declines have been linked to age-related reductions in inhibitory function. Here we examined whether tactile surround inhibition also changes with age, and whether these changes are associated with those in the motor domain. We tested a group of 56 participants spanning a wide age range (18-76 years old), allowing us to examine when age differences emerge across the lifespan. Participants performed tactile and motor tasks that have previously been linked to inter- and intrahemispheric inhibition in the somatosensory and motor systems. Results showed that aging is associated with reductions in inhibitory function in both the tactile and motor systems starting around 40 years of age; however, age effects in the two systems were not correlated. The independent effects of age on tactile and motor inhibitory function suggest that distinct mechanisms may underlie age-related reductions in inhibition in the somatosensory and motor systems.

In young (n = 36, mean ± SD: 24.8 ± 4.5 years) and older (n = 34, mean ± SD: 65.1 ± 6.5 years) healthy participants, we employed a modified version of the Serial Reaction Time task to measure procedural learning (PL) and consolidation while providing monetary and social reward. Using voxel-based morphometry (VBM), we additionally determined the structural correlates of reward-related motor performance (RMP) and PL.

A monetary reward had a beneficial effect on PL in the older subjects only. In contrast, social reward significantly enhanced PL in the older and consolidation in the young participants. VBM analyses revealed that motor performance related to monetary reward was associated with larger grey matter volume (GMV) of the left striatum in the young, and motor performance related to social reward with larger GMV of the medial orbitofrontal cortex in the older group.

The differential effects of social reward in young (improved consolidation) and both social and monetary rewards in older (enhanced PL) healthy subjects point to the potential of rewards for interventions targeting aging-associated motor decline or stroke-induced motor deficits.

Abstract
Background
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is considered as an independent risk factor for mild cognitive impairment (MCI). This study was performed to investigate the prevalence, influencing factors and cognitive characteristics of MCI in elderly patients with T2DM in China. 
Methods
In the cross-sectional study, we performed cluster random sampling of 3246 people age 60 years and older across the country. All participants were interviewed and screened for T2DM and MCI. A total of 341 subjects were diagnosed of MCI according to the criteria of Petersen, and a total of 256 subjects were diagnosed of T2DM by using the American Diabetes association criteria Among the 256 T2DM people, 56 were also diagnosed with MCI. Logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate risk and protective factor for MCI with T2DM. We also assessed their cognitive function by using the Mini-mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Digit span, Associative learning test, Visual identification test, Verbal fluency, Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS)-III Block Design, Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS)-III picture completion and Auditory verbal learning test. 
Results
Among the 256 T2DM patients, 56 were diagnosed with MCI, and the prevalence of MCI in T2DM was 21.8%. Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that depression (p=0.002, OR=6.220, 95%CI: 2.005~19.290) was a risk factor for MCI among T2DM patients, while education (p&lt;0.001, OR=0.869, 95%CI: 0.805~0.983) was a protective one. All the scores of neuropsychological tests (except for MMSE) in T2DM patients with MCI were lower than those without MCI (p&lt;0.05), but there was no statistical difference(p&gt;0.05) in neuropsychological tests between T2DM-MCI group and No-T2DM-MCI group. Linear regression analysis showed that the drug treatment of diabetes was positively correlated (t=2.263, p=0.025) with the total score of auditory word tests. 
Conclusions
The present study suggests a high prevalence of MCI among Chinese T2DM patients.  depression is a risk factors for MCI, while education is a protective one. T2DM patients with MCI often show comprehensive cognitive impairment, and the drug treatment of diabetes might help to improve cognitive function. 
Key words: T2DM, MCI, Chinese elderly, auditory verbal learning test

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/49175">Extracellular Pgk1 enhances neurite outgrowth of motoneurons through Nogo66/NgR-independent targeting of NogoA</a></h4>

NogoA inhibits neurite outgrowth of motoneurons (NOM) through interaction with its receptors, Nogo66/NgR. Inhibition of Nogo receptors rescues NOM, but not to the extent exhibited by <i>NogoA</i>-knockout mice, suggesting the presence of other pathways. We found that NogoA-overexpressing muscle cells reduced phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (Pgk1) secretion, resulting in inhibiting NOM. Apart from its glycolytic role and independent of the Nogo66 pathway, extracellular Pgk1 stimulated NOM by triggering a reduction of p-Cofilin-S3, a growth cone collapse marker, through decreasing a novel Rac1-GTP/p-Pak1-T423/p-P38-T180/p-MK2-T334/p-Limk1-S323/p-Cofilin-S3 molecular pathway. Not only did supplementary Pgk1 enhance NOM in defective cells, but injection of Pgk1 rescued denervation in muscle-specific NogoA-overexpression of zebrafish and an Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis mouse model, SOD1 G93A. Thus, Pgk1 secreted from muscle is detrimental to motoneuron neurite outgrowth and maintenance.

The CRISPR-associated endonuclease Cas9 from <i>Streptococcus pyogenes</i> (SpyCas9), along with a programmable single-guide RNA (sgRNA), has been exploited as a significant genome-editing tool. Despite the recent advances in determining the SpyCas9 structures and DNA cleavage mechanism, the cleavage-competent conformation of the catalytic HNH nuclease domain of SpyCas9 remains largely elusive and debatable. By integrating computational and experimental approaches, we unveiled and validated the activated Cas9-sgRNA-DNA ternary complex in which the HNH domain is neatly poised for cleaving the target DNA strand. In this catalysis model, the HNH employs the catalytic triad of D839-H840-N863 for cleavage catalysis, rather than previously implicated D839-H840-D861, D839-H840-N854, D837-D839-H840, or D839-H840-D861-N863. Our study contributes critical information to defining the catalytic conformation of the HNH domain and advances the knowledge about the conformational activation underlying Cas9-mediated DNA cleavage.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/45061">The antimicrobial peptide defensin cooperates with tumour necrosis factor to drive tumour cell death in <i>Drosophila</i></a></h4>

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are small cationic molecules best known as mediators of the innate defence against microbial infection. While in vitro and ex vivo evidence suggest AMPs’ capacity to kill cancer cells, in vivo demonstration of an anti-tumour role of endogenous AMPs is lacking. Using a <i>Drosophila</i> model of tumourigenesis, we demonstrate a role for the AMP Defensin in the control of tumour progression. Our results reveal that Tumour Necrosis Factor mediates exposure of phosphatidylserine (PS), which makes tumour cells selectively sensitive to the action of Defensin remotely secreted from tracheal and fat tissues. Defensin binds tumour cells in PS-enriched areas, provoking cell death and tumour regression. Altogether, our results provide the first in vivo demonstration for a role of an endogenous AMP as an anti-cancer agent, as well as a mechanism that explains tumour cell sensitivity to the action of AMPs.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/44591">Cell-sized confinement controls generation and stability of a protein wave for spatiotemporal regulation in cells</a></h4>

The Min system, a system that determines the bacterial cell division plane, uses changes in the localization of proteins (a Min wave) that emerges by reaction-diffusion coupling. Although previous studies have shown that space sizes and boundaries modulate the shape and speed of Min waves, their effects on wave emergence were still elusive. Here, by using a microsized fully confined space to mimic live cells, we revealed that confinement changes the conditions for the emergence of Min waves. In the microsized space, an increased surface-to-volume ratio changed the localization efficiency of proteins on membranes, and therefore, suppression of the localization change was necessary for the stable generation of Min waves. Furthermore, we showed that the cell-sized space strictly limits parameters for wave emergence because confinement inhibits both the instability and excitability of the system. These results show that confinement of reaction-diffusion systems has the potential to control spatiotemporal patterns in live cells.

Propranolol is an approved non-selective β-adrenergic blocker that is first line therapy for infantile hemangioma. Despite the clinical benefit of propranolol therapy in hemangioma, the mechanistic understanding of what drives this outcome is limited. Here, we report successful treatment of pericardial edema with propranolol in a patient with Hypotrichosis-Lymphedema-Telangiectasia and Renal (HLTRS) syndrome, caused by a mutation in <i>SOX18</i>. Using a mouse pre-clinical model of HLTRS, we show that propranolol treatment rescues its corneal neo-vascularisation phenotype. Dissection of the molecular mechanism identified the R(+)-propranolol enantiomer as a small molecule inhibitor of the SOX18 transcription factor, independent of any anti-adrenergic effect. Lastly, in a patient-derived in vitro model of infantile hemangioma and pre-clinical model of HLTRS we demonstrate the therapeutic potential of the R(+) enantiomer. Our work emphasizes the importance of SOX18 etiological role in vascular neoplasms, and suggests R(+)-propranolol repurposing to numerous indications ranging from vascular diseases to metastatic cancer.

Neurons in the primate cortical area V4 have been recognized as being selective for intermediate-level visual features, including shape, texture, and color. But, there is no a priori reason why V4 neurons should respond to easily describable categories of visual stimuli. In a recent study (Bashivan et al., Science, 2019) used an artificial neural network to synthesize images that acted as ‘super-stimuli’ for recorded neurons in V4, pushing the boundaries of known neural responses in this brain region and raising broader questions about the potential for synergies between biological and artificial neural networks.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/720250v1?rss=1">Neural and behavioral correlates of declarative memory are associated with temporal discounting in older adults</a></h4>

When facing intertemporal choices, or decisions involving trade-offs between smaller, sooner and larger, delayed rewards, people tend to discount the value of future rewards. There are substantial individual differences in this tendency toward temporal discounting, however. The neurocognitive mechanisms underlying these individual differences remain unclear. One possibility is that individual differences in declarative memory ability underlie individual differences in temporal discounting. Here we tested this hypothesis in older adults (both cognitively normal and with mild cognitive impairment), given that declarative memory declines with age, at rates that vary across individuals. We related temporal discounting to performance on neuropsychological measures of declarative memory, as well as to structural measures of medial temporal lobe regions that are critical for memory. Performance on episodic and semantic memory retrieval tasks was associated with temporal discounting, such that people with better declarative memory discounted delayed rewards less. This relationship held even when controlling for executive function abilities that might influence memory retrieval. Underlining the specificity of this association, performance on measures of executive function (Trail Making Test, Digit Span Backwards, lexical fluency) was unrelated to temporal discounting, and declarative memory ability was unrelated to risk preferences. Finally, cortical thickness in the entorhinal cortex was associated with reduced temporal discounting, with declarative memory ability partially mediating this association. These findings suggest that individual differences in temporal discounting are primarily driven by memory ability, and not executive function, and that a decline in medial temporal lobe structural integrity with aging may impact time preferences.

Epilepsy, intellectual and cortical sensory deficits and psychiatric manifestations are among the most frequent manifestations of mitochondrial diseases. Yet, how mitochondrial dysfunction affects neural structure and function remains largely elusive. This is mostly due to the lack of a proper in vitro translational neuronal model system(s) with impaired energy metabolism. Leveraging the induced pluripotent stem cell technology, from a cohort of patients with the common pathogenic m.3243A&gt;G variant of mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS), we differentiated excitatory cortical neurons (iNeurons) with normal (low heteroplasmy) and impaired (high heteroplasmy) mitochondrial function on an isogenic nuclear DNA background. iNeurons with high levels of heteroplasmy exhibited mitochondrial dysfunction, delayed neural maturation, reduced dendritic complexity and fewer functional excitatory synapses. Microelectrode array recordings of neuronal networks with high heteroplasmy displayed reduced network activity and decreased synchronous network bursting. The impaired neural energy metabolism of iNeurons compromising the structural and functional integrity of neurons and neural networks, could be the primary driver of increased susceptibility to neuropsychiatric manifestations of mitochondrial disease.

Integrated information theory (IIT) postulates that consciousness arises from the cause-effect structure of a system but the optimal network conditions for this structure have not been elucidated. In the study, we test the hypothesis that network criticality, a dynamically balanced state between a large variation of functional network configurations and a large constraint of structural network configurations, is a necessary condition for the emergence of a cause-effect structure that results in a large {Phi}, a surrogate of integrated information. We also hypothesized that if the brain deviates from criticality, the cause-effect structure is obscured and {Phi} diminishes. We tested these hypotheses with a large-scale brain network model and high-density electroencephalography (EEG) acquired during various levels of human consciousness during general anesthesia. In the modeling study, maximal criticality coincided with maximal {Phi}. The constraint of the structural network on the functional network is maximized in the maximal criticality. The EEG study demonstrated an explicit relationship between {Phi}, criticality, and level of consciousness. Functional brain network significantly correlated with structural brain network only in conscious states. The results support the hypothesis that network criticality maximizes {Phi}.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/720078v1?rss=1">Ion-channel regulation of response decorrelation in a multi-scale model of the dentate gyrus</a></h4>

The dentate gyrus (DG) is uniquely endowed with multiple forms of biological heterogeneities owing to the expression of adult neurogenesis and sparse connectivity, and has been functionally implicated in response decorrelation and pattern separation. Although channel decorrelation could be achieved through synergistic interactions between these heterogeneities, the impact of individual ion channels on channel decorrelation has not been explored. Here, to systematically assess the cascading impact of molecular-scale (ion channel) perturbations on network-scale outcomes (decorrelation), we first quantified the impact of eliminating individual ion channels on single-cell physiology of heterogeneous populations of granule cells (GCs) and basket cells (BCs). Employing virtual knockout simulations involving both populations, we found that the mapping between ion channels and nine distinct physiological measurements was many-to-many. Next, to assess the impact of ion channel elimination on channel decorrelation, we employed a conductance-based multi-scale network model of the DG. This network was endowed with four distinct forms of heterogeneities (intrinsic, synaptic, structural and afferent), with afferent inputs from the entorhinal cortices driven by virtual arena traversal. We show that individual ion channels expressed in GCs govern DG network excitability, and critically regulate the ability of the network to perform channel decorrelation. The impact of eliminating individual ion channels on network excitability and channel decorrelation was differential and variable, with local heterogeneities playing a pivotal role in determining the strength of such impact. Specifically, in the presence of structurally immature neurons in the DG network, the impact of ion channel elimination on channel decorrelation was considerably lower when compared with a network exclusively constructed with structurally mature neurons. Finally, we show that for any given ion channel knockout, the average percentage change in output correlation was invariant to the specific values of input correlation, across different network configurations endowed with disparate structural and afferent heterogeneities. Our analyses emphasizes that the mapping between components and function is many-to-many across scales, and assign critical roles for biological heterogeneities in conferring multi-scale functional robustness in the face of physiological and pathological perturbations.

Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a chronic illness with higher incidence in women. Dysregulated neural oscillatory activity is an emerging mechanism underlying MDD, however whether sex differences in these rhythms contribute to the development of MDD symptoms is unknown. Using the chronic unpredictable stress model, we found that stress-resilient and susceptible animals exhibited sex-specific oscillatory markers in the prefrontal cortex, cingulate cortex, nucleus accumbens and hippocampus. Resilient females were predominantly characterized by increased hippocampal theta power and coherence, while resilient males exhibited increased system-wide gamma coherence. In susceptible animals, the females displayed a widespread increase in delta and reduced theta power, however males showed few within-sex differences that could delineate stress susceptibility from resilience. Finally, stress responses were mediated by the temporal recruitment of specific neural pathways, culminating in system-wide changes that correlated with the expression of depression-like behaviours. These findings show that neurophysiological responses can serve as predictive markers of behaviours linked to depression in a sex-specific manner.

Homeodomain-interacting protein kinases (Hipk) have been previously associated with cell proliferation and cancer, however, their effects in the nervous system are less well understood. We have used Drosophila melanogaster to evaluate the effects of altered Hipk expression on the nervous system and muscle. Using genetic manipulation of Hipk expression we demonstrate that knockdown and over-expression of Hipk produces early adult lethality, partially due to the effects on the nervous system and muscle involvement. We find that optimal levels of Hipk are critical for the function of dopaminergic neurons and glial cells in the nervous system, as well as muscle. Furthermore, manipulation of Hipk affects the structure of the larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ) and increases motor neuron axonal branching. Hipk regulates the phosphorylation of the synapse-associated cytoskeletal protein Hts (adducin) and modulates the expression of two important protein kinases, Calcium-calmodulin protein kinase II (CaMKII) and Partitioning-defective 1 (PAR-1), all of which may alter neuromuscular function and influence lethality. Hipk also modifies the distribution of an important nuclear protein, TBPH, the fly orthologue of TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43), which may have relevance for understanding motor neuron diseases.

Reorganization of the sensorimotor cortex following amputation and other interventions has revealed large-scale plastic changes between the hand and face representations. To investigate whether hand-face interactions are also present in the normal state of the system we measured sensorimotor interactions between these two areas using an afferent inhibition transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) protocol in which the TMS motor evoked potential (MEP) is inhibited when it is preceded by an afferent stimulus. We hypothesized that if hand-face interactions exist in the normal state of the system then stimulation of the face would inhibit hand MEPs. In two separate experiments we delivered an electrocutaneous stimulus to either the right upper lip (Experiment 1) or right cheek (Experiment 2) and recorded muscular activity from the right first dorsal interosseous (FDI). Both lip and cheek stimulation inhibited FDI MEPs. To investigate the specificity of this effect we conducted two additional experiments in which cutaneous stimulation was applied to either the right forearm (Experiment 3) or right arm (Experiment 4). Neither forearm nor arm stimulation inhibited FDI MEPs. These data provide the first evidence for face-to-hand afferent inhibition and we suggest that the mechanisms underlying these sensorimotor interactions could contribute to face/hand interactions observed following sensorimotor reorganisation.

The Ventral Occipito-Temporal Cortex (VOTC) shows reliable category selective response to visual information. Do the development, topography and information content of this categorical organization depend on visual input or even visual experience? To further address this question, we used fMRI to characterize the brain responses to eight categories (4 living, 4 non-living) presented acoustically in sighted and early blind individuals, and visually in a separate sighted group. Using a combination of decoding and representational similarity analyses, we observed that VOTC reliably encodes sounds categories in the sighted and blind groups, using a representational structure strikingly similar to the one found in vision. Moreover, we found that the representational connectivity between VOTC and large-scale brain networks was substantially similar across modalities and groups. Blind people however showed higher decoding accuracies and higher inter-subject consistency for the representation of sounds in VOTC, and the correlation between the representational structure of visual and auditory categories was almost double in the blind when compared to the sighted group. Crucially, we also demonstrate that VOTC represents the categorical membership of sounds rather that their acoustic features in both groups. Our results suggest that early visual deprivation triggers an extension of the intrinsic categorical organization of VOTC that is at least partially independent from vision.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/719633v1?rss=1">Calcium-permeable AMPA receptors mediate timing-dependent LTP elicited by six coincident action potentials at Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses</a></h4>

Activity-dependent changes of synaptic transmission in neuronal circuits are thought to represent the cellular mechanism of memory formation in the brain. Experimentally, such changes can be elicited by repeated high-frequency synaptic stimulation inducing long-term potentiation (LTP), or by long-lasting low frequency stimulation, that induces long-term depression (LTD). In contrast, spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) can induce equally robust and long-lasting timing-dependent LTP (t-LTP) in response to low frequency repeats of coincident individual action potentials first in the presynaptic and then in the postsynaptic neuron. Conversely, this stimulation leads to t-LTD if the postsynaptic precedes the presynaptic action potential. Importantly, STDP is best suited to investigate synaptic plasticity mechanisms at the single cell level. Commonly, STDP paradigms relying on 25-100 repeats (comprising several minutes of synaptic stimulation) of coincident pre- and postsynaptic spike firing are used to elicit robust t-LTP or t-LTD. However, the minimum number of repeats required for successful STDP induction, which could account for single trial learning in vivo (comprising only a few seconds), is barely explored. Here, we examined low repeat STDP at Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses by pairing one presynaptic action potential with either one postsynaptic action potential (1:1 t-LTP), or with a burst of 4 postsynaptic action potentials (1:4 t-LTP). Six repeats were sufficient to elicit 1:1 t-LTP while only three repeats were required for 1:4 t-LTP. Postsynaptic Ca2+ elevation for 1:1 t-LTP required Ca2+ influx via NMDARs and voltage gated calcium channels (VGCCs), but depended in case of 1:4 t-LTP on activation of metabotropic GluR and ryanodine receptor mediated Ca2+ release from internal stores. Surprisingly, both t-LTP variants were strictly dependent on a transient activation of postsynaptic Ca2+-permeable AMPARs, although the locus of t-LTP expression was presynaptic for low repeat 1:1 t-LTP but depended on postsynaptic insertion of new GluA1 containing-AMPARs in case of low repeat 1:4 t-LTP. Both t-LTP forms were regulated differentially by dopamine receptor subtype 1 (D1R) and D2R activation, but occurred independent from BDNF/TrkB signaling. Our data suggest, that learning relevant long-lasting synaptic changes can be induced by only 3-6 repeats of mild STDP stimulation that can occur in &lt; 10 s and could therefore underlie single trial learning in vivo.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/719617v1?rss=1">CRMP2 mediates Sema3F-dependent axon pruning and dendritic spine remodeling</a></h4>

Regulation of axon guidance and pruning of inappropriate synapses by class 3 semaphorins is key to development of neural circuits. Collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2) has been shown to regulate axon guidance by mediating Semaphorin 3A (Sema3A) signaling and its dysfunction has been linked to schizophrenia, however, nothing is known about its role in the synapse pruning. Here, using newly generated crmp2-/- mice we demonstrate that while CRMP2 has only a moderate effect on Sema3A-dependent axon guidance in vivo, it is essential for Sema3F-dependent axon pruning and dendritic spine remodeling. We first demonstrate that CRMP2 deficiency interferes with Sema3A signaling in compartmentalized neuron cultures and leads to a mild defect in axon guidance in peripheral nerves and corpus callosum. Strikingly, we show that crmp2-/- mice display more prominent defects in dendritic spine pruning and stereotyped axon pruning in hippocampus and visual cortex consistent with impaired Sema3F signaling and with autism spectrum disorder (ASD)- rather than schizophrenia-like phenotype. Indeed, we demonstrate that CRMP2 mediates Sema3Finduced axon retraction in primary neurons and that crmp2-/- mice display early postnatal behavioral changes linked to ASD. In conclusion, we demonstrate that CRMP2 is an essential mediator of Sema3F-dependent synapse pruning and its dysfunction in early postnatal stages shares histological and behavioral features of ASD.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/719286v1?rss=1">Serotonergic plasticity in the dorsal raphe nucleus characterizes susceptibility and resilience to anhedonia</a></h4>

Chronic stress induces anhedonia in susceptible, but not resilient individuals, a phenomenon observed in humans as well as animal models, but the molecular mechanisms underlying susceptibility and resilience are not well understood. We hypothesized that the serotonergic system, which is implicated in stress, reward and antidepressant therapy, may play a role. We found that plasticity of the serotonergic system contributes to the differential vulnerability to stress displayed by susceptible and resilient animals. Stress-induced anhedonia was assessed in adult male rats using social defeat and intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS), while changes in serotonergic phenotype were investigated using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. Susceptible, but not resilient, rats displayed an increased number of neurons expressing the biosynthetic enzyme for serotonin, tryptophan-hydroxylase-2 (TPH2), in the ventral subnucleus of the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRv). Further, a decrease in the number of DRv glutamatergic neurons was observed in all stressed animals. This neurotransmitter plasticity is dependent on DR activity, as was revealed by chemogenetic manipulation of the central amygdala, a stress-sensitive nucleus that forms a major input to the DR. Activation of amygdalar corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH)+ neurons abolished the increase in DRv TPH2+ neurons and ameliorated stress-induced anhedonia in susceptible animals. These findings show that activation of amygdalar projections induces resilience, and suppresses the gain of serotonergic phenotype in the DR that is characteristic of susceptible animals. This molecular signature of vulnerability to stress-induced anhedonia and the active nature of resilience could be a target of new treatments for stress-related disorders like depression.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/719195v1?rss=1">Altered phosphorylation of the proteasome subunit Rpt6 has minimal impact on synaptic plasticity and learning</a></h4>

Dynamic control of protein degradation via the ubiquitin proteasome system is thought to play a crucial role in neuronal function and synaptic plasticity. The proteasome subunit Rpt6, an AAA ATPase subunit of the 19S regulatory particle, has emerged as an important site for regulation of 26S proteasome function in neurons. Phosphorylation of Rpt6 on serine 120 (S120) can stimulate the catalytic rate of substrate degradation by the 26S proteasome and this site is targeted by the plasticity-related kinase calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII), making it an attractive candidate for regulation of proteasome function in neurons. Several in vitro studies have shown that altered Rpt6 S120 phosphorylation can affect the structure and function of synapses. To evaluate the importance of Rpt6 S120 phosphorylation in vivo, we created two mouse models which feature mutations at S120 that block or mimic phosphorylation at this site. We find that peptidase and ATPase activities are upregulated in the phospho-mimetic mutant and downregulated in the phospho-dead mutant (S120 mutated to aspartic acid (S120D) or alanine (S120A), respectively). Surprisingly, these mutations had no effect on basal synaptic transmission, long-term potentiation, and dendritic spine dynamics and density in the hippocampus. Furthermore, these mutants displayed no deficits in cued and contextual fear memory. Thus, in a mouse model that blocks or mimics phosphorylation at this site, either compensatory mechanisms negate these effects, or small variations in proteasome activity are not enough to induce significant changes in synaptic structure, plasticity, or behavior.

Migraine is a very common and disabling neurological disorder that remains poorly understood at the cellular and circuit level. Transgenic mice harboring a mutation in casein kinase 1 delta (CK1dT44A) represent the first animal model of non-hemiplegic migraine. These mice have decreased sensory thresholds to mechanical and thermal pain after treatment with the migraine trigger nitroglycerin; and an increased susceptibility to cortical spreading depression (CSD), which models the migraine aura. In this study, we investigated cellular and synaptic mechanisms within sensory cortical circuits that might underlie the migraine relevant phenotypes of CK1dT44A mice, using in vitro and in vivo whole cell electrophysiology. Surprisingly we found that at resting state, CK1dT44A neurons exhibited hyperpolarized membrane potentials, due to increased tonic inhibition. Despite this reduction in baseline excitability, CK1dT44A neurons fired action potentials more frequently in response to current injection. And despite similar synaptic and dendritic characteristics to wild type neurons, excitatory but not inhibitory CK1dT44A synapses failed to adapt to high frequency short-stimulus trains, resulting in elevated steady state excitatory currents. The increased steady state currents were attributable to an increased replenishment rate of the readily releasable pool, providing a presynaptic mechanism for the CK1dT44A phenotype. Finally, during in vivo experiments, CK1dT44A animals showed increased duration and membrane potential variance at cortical up states, showing that the intrinsic and synaptic changes we observed have excitatory consequences at the local network level. In conclusion excitatory sensory cortical neurons and networks in CK1dT44A animals appear to exhibit decreased adaptation and increased gain that may inform the migraine phenotype.

Loss-of-function SYNGAP1 mutations cause a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by intellectual disability and epilepsy. SYNGAP1 is a Ras-GTPase-activating protein that underlies the formation and experience-dependent regulation of postsynaptic densities. The mechanisms that contribute to this proposed monogenic cause of intellectual disability and epilepsy remain unresolved. Here, for the first time we establish the phenotype of the epileptogenesis in a Syngap1+/- mouse model using 24h video electroencephalogram/electromyogram (vEEG/EMG) recordings at advancing ages. A progressive worsening of seizures, interictal spike frequency, sleep dysfunction, and hyperactivity was identified in Syngap1+/- mice. Interictal spike and seizures emerged predominantly during NREM in 24h vEEG of Syngap1+/- mice and patients with SYNGAP1 haploinsufficiency. In Syngap1+/- mice, EEG spectral power analyses identified a significant loss of cortical gamma homeostasis during behavioral-state transitions from NREM to Wake and NREM to REM. The loss of gamma homeostasis was associated with a region and location specific significant increase in the somatic GluA2 AMPA receptor subunit expression in parvalbumin-positive (PV+) interneurons. Acute dosing with Perampanel, an FDA approved AMPA antagonist significantly rescued cortical gamma homeostasis, identifying a novel mechanism implicating Ca2+ impermeable AMPARs on PV+ interneurons underlying circuit dysfunction in SYNGAP1 haploinsufficiency.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/718882v1?rss=1">DDIT3 (CHOP) contributes to retinal ganglion cell somal loss but not axonal degeneration in DBA/2J mice</a></h4>

Glaucoma is an age-related neurodegenerative disease characterized by the progressive loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Chronic ocular hypertension, an important risk factor for glaucoma, leads to RGC axonal injury at the optic nerve head. This insult triggers molecularly distinct cascades governing RGC somal apoptosis and axonal degeneration. The molecular mechanisms activated by ocular hypertensive insult that drive both RGC somal apoptosis and axonal degeneration are incompletely understood. The cellular response to endoplasmic reticulum stress and induction of pro-apoptotic DNA damage inducible transcript 3 (DDIT3, also known as CHOP) has been implicated as a driver of neurodegeneration in many disease models, including glaucoma. RGCs express DDIT3 upon glaucoma-relevant insults, and importantly, DDIT3 has been shown to contribute to both RGC somal apoptosis and axonal degeneration after acute induction of ocular hypertension. However, the role of DDIT3 in RGC somal and axonal degeneration has not been critically tested in a model of age-related chronic ocular hypertension. Here, we investigated the role of DDIT3 in glaucomatous RGC death using an age-related, naturally occurring ocular hypertensive mouse model of glaucoma, DBA/2J mice (D2). To accomplish this, a null allele of Ddit3 was backcrossed onto the D2 background. Homozygous Ddit3 deletion did not alter gross retinal or optic nerve head morphology, nor did it change the ocular hypertensive profile of D2 mice. In D2 mice, Ddit3 deletion conferred mild protection to RGC somas but did not significantly prevent RGC axonal degeneration. Together, these data suggest that DDIT3 plays a minor role in perpetuating RGC somal apoptosis caused by chronic ocular hypertension-induced axonal injury, but does not significantly contribute to distal axonal degeneration.

Recent studies indicate that the precise timing and location of inhibition (I) and excitation (E) on the dendritic tree can significantly impact neuronal function. However, the spatiotemporal scale over which synaptic inputs are coordinated and integrated in intact circuits remains unclear. Here, analysis of isolated local light-evoked Ca2+ signals in the dendrites of retinal direction-selective ganglion cells reveals that synaptic inputs are integrated within semi-independent micron-scale subunits (&lt;10 microns). Strikingly, each dendritic subunit is well-tuned for direction, indicating that the presynaptic circuitry driving the inhibitory and excitatory inputs known to underlie direction-selective computations is coordinated on a fine spatiotemporal scale. Finally, we show that inhibition can differentially affect activity at dendritic sites even within the same branch, allowing nearby dendrites to relay distinct computational outcomes to the soma. Together, our findings provide new insights into how neurons may compute information rapidly and accurately using parallel processing schemes.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/718759v1?rss=1">Evaluating the burstlet theory of inspiratory rhythm and pattern generation</a></h4>

The preBotzinger complex (preBotC) generates the rhythm and rudimentary motor pattern for inspiratory breathing movements. Here, we test 'burstlet' theory (Kam, Worrell, Janczewski, et al. 2013), which posits that low amplitude burstlets, subthreshold from the standpoint of inspiratory bursts, reflect the fundamental oscillator of the preBotC. In turn, a discrete suprathreshold process transforms burstlets into full amplitude inspiratory bursts that drive motor output, measurable via hypoglossal nerve (XII) discharge in vitro. We recap observations by Kam &amp; Feldman: field recordings from preBotC demonstrate bursts and concurrent XII motor output intermingled with lower amplitude burstlets that do not produce XII motor output. Manipulations of excitability affect the relative prevalence of bursts and burstlets and modulate their frequency. Whole-cell and photonic recordings of preBotC neurons suggest that burstlets involve inconstant subsets of rhythmogenic interneurons. We conclude that discrete rhythm- and pattern- generating mechanisms coexist in the preBotC and that burstlets reflect its fundamental rhythmogenic nature.

Background: Positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGlu5) have behavioral effects predictive of antipsychotic activity in experimental models such as amphetamine-induced hyperlocomotion (AHL). However, the signaling mechanisms that contribute to the antipsychotic-like properties of mGlu5 PAMs are not well understood. Methods: Because the Akt/GSK3{beta} pathway has been implicated in schizophrenia and is modulated by known antipsychotic drugs, we evaluated the effects of systemic administration of two mGlu5 PAMs on Akt and GSK3{beta} signaling using western blot analysis in both naive and amphetamine-treated adult male rats. Results: In the dorsal striatum, the mGlu5-selective PAM VU0092273 (30 mg/kg) significantly increased Akt phosphorylation at residues associated with enhanced kinase activity, Thr308 and Ser473. Inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK3{beta} at Ser9 was also increased. Similar effects were observed with a second mGlu5 PAM, VU0360172 (56.6 mg/kg). VU0092273 increased Akt phosphorylation levels in amphetamine-treated rats. Effects on Akt/GSK3{beta} signaling were not limited to the striatum, as VU0092273 also increased Akt/GSK3{beta} phosphorylation in the medial prefrontal cortex. Conclusions: These findings suggest that mGlu5 PAMs that have antipsychotic-like efficacy in rats affect signaling pathways that are modulated by known antipsychotics, and raise the possibility that inhibition of GSK3{beta} might contribute to the antipsychotic-like effects of mGlu5 PAMs.

As the number of individuals living beyond the age of 65 is rapidly increasing, so is the need to develop strategies to combat the age-related cognitive decline that may threaten independent living. Although the link between altered neuronal signaling and age-related cognitive impairments is not completely understood, it is evident that declining cognitive abilities are at least partially due to synaptic dysfunction. Aging is accompanied by well-documented changes in both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic signaling across species. Age-related synaptic alterations are not uniform across the brain, however, with different regions showing unique patterns of vulnerability in advanced age. In the hippocampus, increased activity within the CA3 subregion has been observed across species, and this can be reversed with anti-epileptic medication (Bakker et al., 2012). In contrast to CA3, the dentate gyrus shows reduced activity with age and declining metabolic activity. Ketogenic diets have been shown to decrease seizure incidence and severity in epilepsy, improve metabolic function in diabetes type II, and improve cognitive function in aged rats. This link between neuronal activity and metabolism suggests that metabolic interventions may be able to ameliorate synaptic signaling deficits accompanying advanced age. We therefore investigated the ability of a dietary regimen capable of inducing nutritional ketosis and improving cognition to alter synapse-related gene expression across the dentate gyrus, CA3 and CA1 subregions of the hippocampus. Following 12 weeks of a ketogenic or calorie-matched standard diet, RTq-PCR was used to quantify expression levels of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic signaling genes within CA1, CA3 and dentate gyrus. While there were no age or diet-related changes in CA1 gene expression, expression levels were significantly altered within CA3 by age and within the dentate gyrus by diet for several genes involved in presynaptic glutamate regulation and postsynaptic excitation and plasticity. These data demonstrate subregion-specific alterations in synaptic signaling with age and the potential for a ketogenic diet to alter these processes in dissociable ways across different brain structures that are uniquely vulnerable in older animals.

Theoretical and experimental evidence suggest that the induction of oscillatory activity by an external rhythmic source on a specific brain area is maximally efficient if the input pattern matches its so-called natural frequency, defined as the predominant neural rhythm at which the activity of this area tends to fluctuate spontaneously. Based on this principle, single pulse Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) coupled to scalp electroencephalography (EEG) has provided evidence of frequency-specific power increases within a unique natural frequency band, considered common to the whole lobe. In an attempt to gain deeper insight into this phenomenon and set the basis for a finer-grained atlas of natural frequencies, here we analyzed intracranial EEG (iEEG) signals modulated by single pulses of direct electrical brain stimulation in human patients implanted with depth multielectrodes. Our analyses revealed changes in local EEG activity emerging from local oscillators and contributing to a complex distribution of frequency-specific natural rhythmic responses throughout cortical regions. Moreover, challenging the notion of natural oscillations featuring a predominant frequency band characteristic for an entire lobe, our data support a rich diversity of spectral fingerprints (narrowband, vs. broadband or multiband) with single or multiple frequency peaks, often encompassing contiguous frequency bands, operating at a very local scale. Our findings contribute novel insights on which specific brain areas could be more likely to be synchronized at a given frequencies band and their preferred coupling frequencies, features that could ultimately inform on their structural and functional organization. Our results may also increase our mechanistic understanding of invasive and noninvasive brain stimulation and promote further developments of these approaches for the manipulation of brain oscillations subtending normal and impaired cognition.

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/Do_lrXndo3s/article">A model for the origin and development of visual orientation selectivity</a></h4>

<p>by Gratia Nguyen, Alan W. Freeman</p>

Orientation selectivity is a key property of primary visual cortex that contributes, downstream, to object recognition. The origin of orientation selectivity, however, has been debated for decades. It is known that on- and off-centre subcortical pathways converge onto single neurons in primary visual cortex, and that the spatial offset between these pathways gives rise to orientation selectivity. On- and off-centre pathways are intermingled, however, so it is unclear how their inputs to cortex come to be spatially segregated. We here describe a model in which the segregation occurs through Hebbian strengthening and weakening of geniculocortical synapses during the development of the visual system. Our findings include the following. 1. Neighbouring on- and off-inputs to cortex largely cancelled each other at the start of development. At each receptive field location, the Hebbian process increased the strength of one input sign at the expense of the other sign, producing a spatial segregation of on- and off-inputs. 2. The resulting orientation selectivity was precise in that the bandwidths of the orientation tuning functions fell within empirical estimates. 3. The model produced maps of preferred orientation–complete with iso-orientation domains and pinwheels–similar to those found in real cortex. 4. These maps did not originate in cortical processes, but from clustering of off-centre subcortical pathways and the relative location of neighbouring on-centre clusters. We conclude that a model with intermingled on- and off-pathways shaped by Hebbian synaptic plasticity can explain both the origin and development of orientation selectivity.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Do_lrXndo3s" width="1" />

<p>by Majed Mohamed Magzoub, Marcos Prunello, Kevin Brennan, Olivier Gevaert</p>

Aberrant DNA methylation disrupts normal gene expression in cancer and broadly contributes to oncogenesis. We previously developed MethylMix, a model-based algorithmic approach to identify epigenetically regulated driver genes. MethylMix identifies genes where methylation likely executes a functional role by using transcriptomic data to select only methylation events that can be linked to changes in gene expression. However, given that proteins more closely link genotype to phenotype recent high-throughput proteomic data provides an opportunity to more accurately identify functionally relevant abnormal methylation events. Here we present a MethylMix analysis that refines nominations for epigenetic driver genes by leveraging quantitative high-throughput proteomic data to select only genes where DNA methylation is predictive of protein abundance. Applying our algorithm across three cancer cohorts we find that using protein abundance data narrows candidate nominations, where the effect of DNA methylation is often buffered at the protein level. Next, we find that MethylMix genes predictive of protein abundance are enriched for biological processes involved in cancer including functions involved in epithelial and mesenchymal transition. Moreover, our results are also enriched for tumor markers which are predictive of clinical features like tumor stage and we find clustering using MethylMix genes predictive of protein abundance captures cancer subtypes.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/CacuunWYmno" width="1" />

Quantification of the effect of spatial tumour sampling on the patterns of mutations detected in next-generation sequencing data is largely lacking. Here we use a spatial stochastic cellular automaton model of tumour growth that accounts for somatic mutations, selection, drift and spatial constraints, to simulate multi-region sequencing data derived from spatial sampling of a neoplasm. We show that the spatial structure of a solid cancer has a major impact on the detection of clonal selection and genetic drift from both bulk and single-cell sequencing data. Our results indicate that spatial constrains can introduce significant sampling biases when performing multi-region bulk sampling and that such bias becomes a major confounding factor for the measurement of the evolutionary dynamics of human tumours. We also propose a statistical inference framework that incorporates spatial effects within a growing tumour and so represents a further step forwards in the inference evolutionary dynamics from genomic data. Our analysis shows that measuring cancer evolution using next-generation sequencing while accounting for the numerous confounding factors remains challenging. However, mechanistic model-based approaches have the potential to capture the sources of noise and better interpret the data.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/lVMwD1Xm2Mc" width="1" />

<p>by Lou Safra, Coralie Chevallier, Stefano Palminteri</p>

Depression is characterized by a marked decrease in social interactions and blunted sensitivity to rewards. Surprisingly, despite the importance of social deficits in depression, non-social aspects have been disproportionally investigated. As a consequence, the cognitive mechanisms underlying atypical decision-making in social contexts in depression are poorly understood. In the present study, we investigate whether deficits in reward processing interact with the social context and how this interaction is affected by self-reported depression and anxiety symptoms in the general population. Two cohorts of subjects (discovery and replication sample: <i>N</i> = 50 each) took part in an experiment involving reward learning in contexts with different levels of social information (absent, partial and complete). Behavioral analyses revealed a specific detrimental effect of depressive symptoms–but not anxiety–on behavioral performance in the presence of social information, i.e. when participants were informed about the choices of another player. Model-based analyses further characterized the computational nature of this deficit as a negative audience effect, rather than a deficit in the way others’ choices and rewards are integrated in decision making. To conclude, our results shed light on the cognitive and computational mechanisms underlying the interaction between social cognition, reward learning and decision-making in depressive disorders.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/PFRLQIsFE1w" width="1" />

<p>by Shiva Rudraraju, Derek E. Moulton, Régis Chirat, Alain Goriely, Krishna Garikipati</p>

Mollusk shells are an ideal model system for understanding the morpho-elastic basis of morphological evolution of invertebrates’ exoskeletons. During the formation of the shell, the mantle tissue secretes proteins and minerals that calcify to form a new incremental layer of the exoskeleton. Most of the existing literature on the morphology of mollusks is descriptive. The mathematical understanding of the underlying coupling between pre-existing shell morphology, <i>de novo</i> surface deposition and morpho-elastic volume growth is at a nascent stage, primarily limited to reduced geometric representations. Here, we propose a general, three-dimensional computational framework coupling pre-existing morphology, incremental surface growth by accretion, and morpho-elastic volume growth. We exercise this framework by applying it to explain the stepwise morphogenesis of seashells during growth: new material surfaces are laid down by accretive growth on the mantle whose form is determined by its morpho-elastic growth. Calcification of the newest surfaces extends the shell as well as creates a new scaffold that constrains the next growth step. We study the effects of surface and volumetric growth rates, and of previously deposited shell geometries on the resulting modes of mantle deformation, and therefore of the developing shell’s morphology. Connections are made to a range of complex shells ornamentations.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0dZctqFEsGw" width="1" />

<p>by Jan R. Wessel, David E. Huber</p>

The brain constantly generates predictions about the environment to guide action. Unexpected events lead to surprise and can necessitate the modification of ongoing behavior. Surprise can occur for any sensory domain, but it is not clear how these separate surprise signals are integrated to affect motor output. By applying a trial-to-trial Bayesian surprise model to human electroencephalography data recorded during a cross-modal oddball task, we tested whether there are separate predictive models for different sensory modalities (visual, auditory), or whether expectations are integrated across modalities such that surprise in one modality decreases surprise for a subsequent unexpected event in the other modality. We found that while surprise was represented in a common frontal signature across sensory modalities (the fronto-central P3 event-related potential), the single-trial amplitudes of this signature more closely conformed to a model with separate surprise terms for each sensory domain. We then investigated whether surprise-related fronto-central P3 activity indexes the rapid inhibitory control of ongoing behavior after surprise, as suggested by recent theories. Confirming this prediction, the fronto-central P3 amplitude after both auditory and visual unexpected events was highly correlated with the fronto-central P3 found after stop-signals (measured in a separate stop-signal task). Moreover, surprise-related and stopping-related activity loaded onto the same component in a cross-task independent components analysis. Together, these findings suggest that medial frontal cortex maintains separate predictive models for different sensory domains, but engages a common mechanism for inhibitory control of behavior regardless of the source of surprise.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/TPaom7ceY60" width="1" />

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Clinical trials targeting Aβ for Alzheimer's disease (AD) failed for arguable reasons that include selecting the wrong stages of AD pathophysiology or Aβ being the wrong target at all. Targeting Aβ to prevent cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) has not been rigorously followed although the causal role of Aβ for CAA and related hemorrhages is undisputed. CAA occurs with normal aging and to various degree in AD where its impact and treatment is confounded by the presence of parenchymal Aβ deposition.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>APPDutch mice develop CAA in the absence of parenchymal amyloid, mimicking hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis ‐ Dutch (HCHWA‐D). Mice were treated with a BACE1 inhibitor. 3D‐ultramicroscopy and immunoassays were used for visualizing CAA and assessing Aβ in CSF and brain.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>CAA onset in mice was at 22‐24 mo of age, first in frontal leptomeningeal and superficial cortical vessels followed by vessels penetrating the cortical layers. CSF Aβ increased with aging followed by a decrease of both, Aβ40 and Aβ42 upon CAA onset supporting that combined reduction of CSF Aβ40 and 42 is a specific biomarker for vascular amyloid. BACE1 inhibitor treatment starting at CAA onset and continued for 4 mo revealed a 90% Aβ reduction in CSF and largely prevented CAA progression and associated pathologies.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>This is the first study showing that Aβ reduction at early disease time points largely prevents CAA in the absence of parenchymal amyloid. Our observation provides a preclinical basis for Aβ‐reducing treatments in patients at risk of CAA and in presymptomatic HCHWA‐D.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Limited evidence is available to guide treatment of depression for persons with epilepsy. We evaluated comparative effectiveness of sertraline and cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) for depression, quality of life, seizures, and adverse treatment effects.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We randomly assigned 140 adult outpatients with epilepsy and current major depressive disorder to sertraline or weekly CBT for 16 weeks. The primary outcome was remission from depression based on the Mini‐International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.). Secondary outcomes included the Quality of Life in Epilepsy Inventory (QOLIE)‐89, seizure rates, the Adverse Events Profile (AEP), the Beck Depression Inventory, and the M.I.N.I. Suicide Risk Module.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>In the intention to treat analysis, 38 (52.8%; 95% CI±12) of the 72 subjects assigned to sertraline and 41 (60.3%; 95% CI±11.6) of the 68 in the CBT group achieved remission; the lower bound of efficacy for both groups was greater than our historical placebo control group upper bound of 33.7%. Difference in time to remission between groups was 2.8 days (95% CI±0.43; p=0.79). The percent improvement of mean QOLIE‐89 scores was significant for both CBT (25.7%; p&lt;0.001) and sertraline (28.3%; p&lt;0.001). The difference in occurrence of generalized tonic‐clonic seizures between groups was 0.3% (95% CI±8.6; p=0.95). Suicide risk at final assessment was associated with persistent depression (p&lt;0.0001), but not seizures or sertraline.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Depression remitted in just over one half of subjects following sertraline or CBT. Despite the complex psychosocial disability associated with epilepsy, improving depression benefits quality of life. Serotonin reuptake inhibition does not appear to increase seizures or suicidality in persons with epilepsy.</p>

Abstract
<p>Although TWIK-related spinal cord K<sup>+</sup> (TRESK) channel is expressed in all primary afferent neurons in trigeminal ganglia (TG) and dorsal root ganglia (DRG), whether TRESK activity regulates trigeminal pain processing is still not established. Dominant-negative TRESK mutations are associated with migraine but not with other types of pain in humans, suggesting that genetic TRESK dysfunction preferentially affects the generation of trigeminal pain, especially headache. Using TRESK global knock-out mice as a model system, we found that loss of TRESK in all TG neurons selectively increased the intrinsic excitability of small-diameter nociceptors, especially those that do not bind to isolectin B4 (IB4<sup>–</sup>). Similarly, loss of TRESK resulted in hyper-excitation of the small IB4<sup>–</sup> dural afferent neurons but not those that bind to IB4 (IB4<sup>+</sup>). Compared with wild-type littermates, both male and female TRESK knock-out mice exhibited more robust trigeminal nociceptive behaviors, including headache-related behaviors, whereas their body and visceral pain responses were normal. Interestingly, neither the total persistent outward current nor the intrinsic excitability was altered in adult TRESK knock-out DRG neurons, which may explain why genetic TRESK dysfunction is not associated with body and/or visceral pain in humans. We reveal for the first time that, among all primary afferent neurons, TG nociceptors are the most vulnerable to the genetic loss of TRESK. Our findings indicate that endogenous TRESK activity regulates trigeminal nociception, likely through controlling the intrinsic excitability of TG nociceptors. Importantly, we provide evidence that genetic loss of TRESK significantly increases the likelihood of developing headache.</p>

Abstract
<p>The paraventricular hypothalamus (PVH) regulates stress, feeding behaviors and other homeostatic processes, but whether PVH also drives defensive states remains unknown. Here we showed that photostimulation of PVH neurons in mice elicited escape jumping, a typical defensive behavior. We mapped PVH outputs that densely terminate in the ventral midbrain (vMB) area, and found that activation of the PVH-&gt;vMB circuit produced profound defensive behavioral changes, including escape jumping, hiding, hyperlocomotion, and learned aversion. Electrophysiological recordings showed excitatory postsynaptic input onto vMB neurons via PVH fiber activation, and <i>in vivo</i> studies demonstrated that glutamate transmission from PVH-&gt;vMB was required for the evoked behavioral responses. Photostimulation of PVH-&gt;vMB fibers induced cFos expression mainly in non-dopaminergic neurons. Using a dual optogenetic-chemogenetic strategy, we further revealed that escape jumping and hiding were partially contributed by the activation of midbrain glutamatergic neurons. Taken together, our work unveils a hypothalamic-vMB circuit that encodes defensive properties, which may be implicated in stress-induced defensive responses.</p>

Abstract<p>The prefrontal cortex plays a central role in guiding decision-making, and its function is altered by alcohol use and an individual’s innate risk for excessive alcohol drinking. The primary goal of this work was to determine how neural activity in the prefrontal cortex guides the decision to drink. Towards this goal, the within-session changes in neural activity were measured from medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of rats performing a drinking procedure that allowed them to consume or abstain from alcohol in a self-paced manner. Recordings were obtained from rats that either lacked or expressed an innate risk for excessive alcohol intake - Wistar or Alcohol Preferring ‘P’ rats, respectively. Wistar rats exhibited patterns of neural activity consistent with the intention to drink or abstain from drinking, whereas these patterns were blunted or absent in P rats. Collectively, these data indicate that neural activity patterns in mPFC associated with the intention to drink alcohol are influenced by innate risk for excessive alcohol drinking. This observation may indicate a lack of control over the decision to drink by this otherwise well-validated supervisory brain region.</p><p><b>Significance Statement:</b> Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) are fundamentally disorders in decision-making; specifically alcohol drinking decisions. Thus, identifying the neural mechanisms regulating drinking decisions may lead to unique prevention and intervention strategies. The current study demonstrates that the intent to drink alcohol is encoded by the activity of neural populations within the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). However, the encoding of this intention signal is greatly reduced in a population of rodents with an extensive family history of high alcohol consumption. These data suggest that identifying strategies to restore the contribution of mPFC in the decision to drink alcohol may provide effective targets to treat an AUD, particularly in those with family history of AUDs.</p>

Abstract<p>One way that drugs of abuse perturb the dopamine system is by triggering large amounts of extracellular dopamine efflux into limbic regions.

Here we investigate the effects of dopamine D1 receptor blockade in the BLA and the CeA during asymptotic performance of cocaine self administration and in a novel application of contextual renewal under continued access conditions. After &gt;3 weeks of chained seek-take self-administration of cocaine, male Long Evans rats were given a bilateral intra-BLA or intra-CeA infusion of the D1 antagonist SCH-23390 (2 µg/0.3 µL) for multiple days. Intra-BLA D1 receptor blockade before, but not after the self-administration session, gradually suppressed drug seeking and taking responses and persisted with a change in context with continued D1 blockade. In contrast, intra-CeA D1 receptor blockade caused a rapid reduction in self-administration that showed renewal with a change in context with continued D1 blockade. Further, conditioned place aversion developed with intra-BLA but not intra-CeA infusions. Collectively, these results demonstrate that dopamine D1 receptors in the BLA and CeA both contribute to drug seeking and taking, but may do so through distinct mechanisms.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Drugs of abuse perturb the dopamine system by triggering large amounts of dopamine to efflux into limbic regions.

Abstract<p>In the mouse accessory olfactory bulb (AOB), inhibitory interneurons play an essential role in gating behaviors elicited by sensory exposure to social odors. Several morphological classes have been described, but the full complement of interneurons remains incomplete. In order to develop a more comprehensive view of interneuron function in the AOB, we performed targeted patch clamp recordings from partially-overlapping subsets of genetically-labeled and morphologically-defined interneuron types. <i>Gad2</i> (GAD65), <i>Calb2</i> (calretinin), and <i>Cort</i> (cortistatin)-cre mouse lines were used to drive selective expression of tdTomato in AOB interneurons. <i>Gad2</i> and <i>Calb2-</i>labeled interneurons were found in the internal, external, and glomerular layers, whereas <i>Cort</i>-labeled interneurons were enriched within the lateral olfactory tract (LOT) and external cellular layer (ECL). We found that external granule cells (EGCs) from all genetically-labeled subpopulations possessed intrinsic functional differences that allowed them to be readily distinguished from internal granule cells (IGCs). EGCs showed stronger voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> and non-inactivating voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> currents, decreased I<sub>H</sub> currents, and robust excitatory synaptic input. These specific intrinsic properties did not correspond to any genetically-labeled type, suggesting that transcriptional heterogeneity among EGCs and IGCs is not correlated with expression of these particular marker genes. Intrinsic heterogeneity was also seen among AOB juxtaglomerular cells (JGCs), with a major subset of <i>Calb2</i>-labeled JGCs exhibiting spontaneous and depolarization-evoked plateau potentials. These data identify specific physiological features of AOB interneurons types that will assist in future studies of AOB function.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> The mouse accessory olfactory bulb (AOB) plays a critical role in processing social chemosensory information. Several morphologically-identified types of AOB inhibitory interneurons are thought to refine and restrict information flow from the AOB to its downstream targets in the limbic system. However, little is known about the electrophysiological and transcriptional diversity among AOB interneuron types. We systematically investigated intrinsic electrophysiological diversity across 5 AOB cell populations in three transgenic mouse lines. Analysis of 26 intrinsic physiological features revealed feature combinations associated with identified morphological AOB cell types, but few associated with the transgenic lines we studied. The results provide quantitative information about functional diversity in AOB interneurons and provide an improved foundation for future studies of AOB circuit function.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To describe early functional outcomes of nerve transfer surgery in a relatively large cohort of patients with Acute Flaccid Myelitis (AFM).</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Retrospective case analysis of patients with AFM treated with nerve transfer surgery between 2007 and 2018. Surgical criteria were persistent motor deficits after 6 months from onset and available donor nerves. Thirty‐two patients with AFM were evaluated, 16 underwent nerve transfer surgeries. Motor function was evaluated by a licensed occupational therapist using the Active Movement Scale (AMS) preoperatively and during follow‐up examinations. Patients with 6 or more months of follow‐up were included in the analysis. Patients with procedures other than nerve transfers were excluded.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Sixteen patients with AFM had nerve transfers, with a male predominance (75%) and median age of 2.5 years (range 4 months‐12 years). Eleven patients had a minimum 6 months follow‐up. Nerve transfers to restore elbow function had 87% excellent recovery for elbow flexion and 67% for elbow extension. Finger and thumb extension were full against gravity in one patient (100%). Shoulder external rotation was excellent in 50% of patients and shoulder abduction in only 20%. Nine out of 10 patients (90%) had resolution of shoulder pseudosubluxation following nerve transfer to the suprascapular nerve.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Patients with AFM with persistent motor deficits after 6 to 9 months after onset benefit from nerve transfer surgery. Restoration of elbow function was more reliable than restoration of shoulder function. We recommend early referral of patients with incomplete recovery to an experienced center in nerve transfers for timely evaluation and treatment.</p>

<p>Correlated electrical activity in neurons is a prominent characteristic of
cortical microcircuits. Despite a growing amount of evidence concerning both
spike-count and subthreshold membrane potential pairwise correlations, little
is known about how different types of cortical neurons convert correlated
inputs into correlated outputs. We studied pyramidal neurons and two classes of
GABAergic interneurons of layer 5 in neocortical brain slices obtained from
rats of both sexes, and we stimulated them with biophysically realistic
correlated inputs, generated using dynamic clamp. We found that the
physiological differences between cell types manifested unique features in
their capacity to transfer correlated inputs. We used linear response theory
and computational modeling to gain clear insights into how cellular properties
determine both the gain and timescale of correlation transfer, thus tying
single-cell features with network interactions. Our results provide further
ground for the functionally distinct roles played by various types of neuronal
cells in the cortical microcircuit.

<p>Identifying the physiological processes underlying the emergence and
maintenance of consciousness is one of the most fundamental problems of
neuroscience, with implications ranging from fundamental neuroscience to the
treatment of patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC). One major
challenge is to understand how cortical circuits at drastically different
spatial scales, from local networks to brain-scale networks, operate in concert
to enable consciousness, and how those processes are impaired in DOC patients.
In this review, we attempt to relate available neurophysiological and clinical
data with existing theoretical models of consciousness, while linking the
micro- and macro-circuit levels. First, we address the relationships between
awareness and wakefulness on the one hand, and cortico-cortical, and
thalamo-cortical connectivity on the other hand. Second, we discuss the role of
three main types of GABAergic interneurons in specific circuits responsible for
the dynamical re-organization of functional networks. Third, we explore
advances in the functional role of nested oscillations for neural
synchronization and communication, emphasizing the importance of the balance
between local (high-frequency) and distant (low-frequency) activity for
efficient information processing. The clinical implications of these
theoretical considerations are presented. We propose that such cellular-scale
mechanisms could extend current theories of consciousness.

<p>Interaction mechanism in the acoustic communication of actual animals is
investigated by combining mathematical modeling and empirical data. Here we use
a deterministic mathematical model (a phase oscillator model) to describe the
interaction mechanism underlying the choruses of male Japanese tree frogs (Hyla
japonica) in which the male frogs attempt to avoid call overlaps with each
other due to acoustic communication. The mathematical model with a general
interaction term is identified by a Bayesian approach from multiple audio
recordings on the choruses of three male frogs. The identified model
qualitatively reproduces the stationary and dynamical features of the empirical
data, supporting the validity of the model identification. In addition, we
quantify the magnitude of attention paid among the male frogs from the
identified model, and then analyze the relationship between the attention and
behavioral parameters by using a statistical model. The analysis demonstrates
the biologically valid relationship about the negative correlation between the
attention and inter-frog distance, and also indicates the existence of a
behavioral strategy that the male frogs selectively pay attention towards a
less attractive male frog so as to utilize the advantage of their
attractiveness for effective mate attraction.

<p>Synthetic lethality, the finding that the simultaneous knockout of two or
more individually non-essential genes leads to cell or organism death, has
offered a systematic framework to explore cellular function, and also offered
therapeutic applications. Yet, the concept lacks its parallel in neuroscience -
a systematic knowledge base on the role of double or higher order ablations in
the functioning of a neural system. Here, we use the framework of network
control to systematically predict the ablation of neuron pairs and triplets. We
find that surprisingly small sets of 58 pairs and 46 triplets can reduce muscle
controllability, and that these sets are localised in the nervous system in
distinct groups. Further, they lead to highly specific experimentally testable
predictions about mechanisms of loss of control, and which muscle cells are
expected to experience this loss.

<p>If we consider the neural network optimization process as a model selection
problem, the implicit space can be constrained by the normalizing factor, the
minimum description length of the optimal universal code. Inspired by the
adaptation phenomenon of biological neuronal firing, we propose a class of
reparameterization of the activation in the neural network that take into
account the statistical regularity in the implicit space under the Minimum
Description Length (MDL) principle. We introduce an incremental version of
computing this universal code as normalized maximum likelihood and demonstrated
its flexibility to include data prior such as top-down attention and other
oracle information and its compatibility to be incorporated into batch
normalization and layer normalization. The empirical results showed that the
proposed method outperforms existing normalization methods in tackling the
limited and imbalanced data from a non-stationary distribution benchmarked on
computer vision and reinforcement learning tasks. As an unsupervised attention
mechanism given input data, this biologically plausible normalization has the
potential to deal with other complicated real-world scenarios as well as
reinforcement learning setting where the rewards are sparse and non-uniform.
Further research is proposed to discover these scenarios and explore the
behaviors among different variants.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/48788">Lmx1b is required at multiple stages to build expansive serotonergic axon architectures</a></h4>

Formation of long-range axons occurs over multiple stages of morphological maturation. However, the intrinsic transcriptional mechanisms that temporally control different stages of axon projection development are unknown. Here, we addressed this question by studying the formation of mouse serotonin (5-HT) axons, the exemplar of long-range profusely arborized axon architectures. We report that LIM homeodomain factor 1b (Lmx1b)-deficient 5-HT neurons fail to generate axonal projections to the forebrain and spinal cord. Stage-specific targeting demonstrates that Lmx1b is required at successive stages to control 5-HT axon primary outgrowth, selective routing, and terminal arborization. We show a Lmx1b→Pet1 regulatory cascade is temporally required for 5-HT arborization and upregulation of the 5-HT axon arborization gene, Protocadherin-alphac2, during postnatal development of forebrain 5-HT axons. Our findings identify a temporal regulatory mechanism in which a single continuously expressed transcription factor functions at successive stages to orchestrate the progressive development of long-range axon architectures enabling expansive neuromodulation.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/47988">Two mechanisms regulate directional cell growth in <i>Arabidopsis</i> lateral roots</a></h4>

Morphogenesis in plants depends critically on directional (anisotropic) growth. This occurs principally perpendicular to the net orientation of cellulose microfibrils (CMFs), which is in turn controlled by cortical microtubules (CMTs). In young lateral roots of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, growth anisotropy also depends on RAB-A5c, a plant-specific small GTPase that specifies a membrane trafficking pathway to the geometric edges of cells. Here we investigate the functional relationship between structural anisotropy at faces and RAB-A5c activity at edges during lateral root development. We show that surprisingly, inhibition of RAB-A5c function is associated with increased CMT/CMF anisotropy. We present genetic, pharmacological, and modelling evidence that this increase in CMT/CMF anisotropy partially compensates for loss of an independent RAB-A5c-mediated mechanism that maintains anisotropic growth in meristematic cells. We show that RAB-A5c associates with CMTs at cell edges, indicating that CMTs act as an integration point for both mechanisms controlling cellular growth anisotropy in lateral roots.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/47891">Epimutations are associated with CHROMOMETHYLASE 3-induced de novo DNA methylation</a></h4>

In many plant species, a subset of transcribed genes are characterized by strictly CG-context DNA methylation, referred to as gene body methylation (gbM). The mechanisms that establish gbM are unclear, yet flowering plant species naturally without gbM lack the DNA methyltransferase, CMT3, which maintains CHG (H = A, C, or T) and not CG methylation at constitutive heterochromatin. Here, we identify the mechanistic basis for gbM establishment by expressing <i>CMT3</i> in a species naturally lacking <i>CMT3. CMT3</i> expression reconstituted gbM through a progression of de novo CHG methylation on expressed genes, followed by the accumulation of CG methylation that could be inherited even following loss of the <i>CMT3</i> transgene. Thus, gbM likely originates from the simultaneous targeting of loci by pathways that promote euchromatin and heterochromatin, which primes genes for the formation of stably inherited epimutations in the form of CG DNA methylation.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/47837">Spinal V2b neurons reveal a role for ipsilateral inhibition in speed control</a></h4>

The spinal cord contains a diverse array of interneurons that govern motor output. Traditionally, models of spinal circuits have emphasized the role of inhibition in enforcing reciprocal alternation between left and right sides or flexors and extensors. However, recent work has shown that inhibition also increases coincident with excitation during contraction. Here, using larval zebrafish, we investigate the V2b (Gata3+) class of neurons, which contribute to flexor-extensor alternation but are otherwise poorly understood. Using newly generated transgenic lines we define two stable subclasses with distinct neurotransmitter and morphological properties. These V2b subclasses synapse directly onto motor neurons with differential targeting to speed-specific circuits. <i>In vivo</i>, optogenetic manipulation of V2b activity modulates locomotor frequency: suppressing V2b neurons elicits faster locomotion, whereas activating V2b neurons slows locomotion. We conclude that V2b neurons serve as a brake on axial motor circuits. Together, these results indicate a role for ipsilateral inhibition in speed control.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/47037">A new family of cell surface located purine transporters in Microsporidia and related fungal endoparasites</a></h4>

Plasma membrane-located transport proteins are key adaptations for obligate intracellular Microsporidia parasites, because they can use them to steal host metabolites the parasites need to grow and replicate. However, despite their importance, the functions and substrate specificities of most Microsporidia transporters are unknown. Here we provide functional data for a family of transporters conserved in all microsporidian genomes and also in the genomes of related endoparasites. The universal retention among otherwise highly reduced genomes indicates an important role for these transporters for intracellular parasites. Using <i>Trachipleistophora hominis</i>, a Microsporidia isolated from an HIV/AIDS patient, as our experimental model, we show that the proteins are ATP and GTP transporters located on the surface of parasites during their intracellular growth and replication. Our work identifies a new route for the acquisition of essential energy and nucleotides for a major group of intracellular parasites that infect most animal species including humans.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/45261">Point of View: Four erroneous beliefs thwarting more trustworthy research</a></h4>

A range of problems currently undermines public trust in biomedical research. We discuss four erroneous beliefs that may prevent the biomedical research community from recognizing the need to focus on deserving this trust, and thus which act as powerful barriers to necessary improvements in the research process.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/44320">Sub-second dynamics of theta-gamma coupling in Hippocampal CA1</a></h4>

Oscillatory brain activity reflects different internal brain states including neurons' excitatory state and synchrony among neurons. However, characterizing these states is complicated by the fact that different oscillations are often coupled, such as gamma oscillations nested in theta in the hippocampus, and changes in coupling are thought to reflect distinct states. Here, we describe a new method to separate single oscillatory cycles into distinct states based on frequency and phase coupling. Using this method, we identified four theta-gamma coupling states in rat hippocampal CA1. These states differed in abundance across behaviors, phase synchrony with other hippocampal subregions, and neural coding properties suggesting that these states are functionally distinct. We captured cycle-to-cycle changes in oscillatory coupling states and found frequent switching between theta-gamma states showing that the hippocampus rapidly shifts between different functional states. This method provides a new approach to investigate oscillatory brain dynamics broadly.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Scores on intelligence tests are strongly predictive of various important life outcomes. However, the gender discrepancy on intelligence quotient (IQ) prediction using brain imaging variables has not been studied. To this aim, we predicted individual IQ scores for males and females separately using whole-brain functional connectivity (FC). Robust predictions of intellectual capabilities were achieved across three independent data sets (680 subjects) and two intelligence measurements (IQ and fluid intelligence) using the same model within each gender. Interestingly, we found that intelligence of males and females were underpinned by different neurobiological correlates, which are consistent with their respective superiority in cognitive domains (visuospatial vs verbal ability). In addition, the identified FC patterns are uniquely predictive on IQ and its sub-domain scores only within the same gender but neither for the opposite gender nor on the IQ-irrelevant measures such as temperament traits. Moreover, females exhibit significantly higher IQ predictability than males in the discovery cohort. This findings facilitate our understanding of the biological basis of intelligence by demonstrating that intelligence is underpinned by a variety of complex neural mechanisms that engage an interacting network of regions—particularly prefrontal–parietal and basal ganglia—whereas the network pattern differs between genders.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Past studies have demonstrated that flexible interactions between brain regions support a wide range of goal-directed behaviors. However, the neural mechanisms that underlie adaptive communication between brain regions are not well understood. In this study, we combined theta-burst transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the sources of top-down biasing signals that influence task-evoked functional connectivity. Subjects viewed sequences of images of faces and buildings and were required to detect repetitions (2-back vs. 1-back) of the attended stimuli category (faces or buildings). We found that functional connectivity between ventral temporal cortex and the primary visual cortex (VC) increased during processing of task-relevant stimuli, especially during higher memory loads. Furthermore, the strength of functional connectivity was greater for correct trials. Increases in task-evoked functional connectivity strength were correlated with increases in activity in multiple frontal, parietal, and subcortical (caudate and thalamus) regions. Finally, we found that TMS to superior intraparietal sulcus (IPS), but not to primary somatosensory cortex, decreased task-specific modulation in connectivity patterns between the primary VC and the parahippocampal place area. These findings demonstrate that the human IPS is a source of top-down biasing signals that modulate task-evoked functional connectivity among task-relevant cortical regions.</span>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Quantification of gait with wearable technology is promising; recent cross‐sectional studies showed that gait characteristics are potential prodromal markers for Parkinson disease (PD). The aim of this longitudinal prospective observational study was to establish gait impairments and trajectories in the prodromal phase of PD, identifying which gait characteristics are potentially early diagnostic markers of PD.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>The 696 healthy controls (mean age = 63 ± 7 years) recruited in the Tubingen Evaluation of Risk Factors for Early Detection of Neurodegeneration study were included. Assessments were performed longitudinally 4 times at 2‐year intervals, and people who converted to PD were identified. Participants were asked to walk at different speeds under single and dual tasking, with a wearable device placed on the lower back; 14 validated clinically relevant gait characteristics were quantified. Cox regression was used to examine whether gait at first visit could predict time to PD conversion after controlling for age and sex. Random effects linear mixed models (RELMs) were used to establish longitudinal trajectories of gait and model the latency between impaired gait and PD diagnosis.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Sixteen participants were diagnosed with PD on average 4.5 years after first visit (converters; PDC). Higher step time variability and asymmetry of all gait characteristics were associated with a shorter time to PD diagnosis. RELMs indicated that gait (lower pace) deviates from that of non‐PDC approximately 4 years prior to diagnosis.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Together with other prodromal markers, quantitative gait characteristics can play an important role in identifying prodromal PD and progression within this phase. ANN NEUROL 2019</p>

Accumulating data highlight the contribution of brain mitochondria and bioenergetics to psychiatric disorders and stress-related pathologies. Although anxiety has not received much attention in this booming literature, a bidirectional interplay between anxiety and brain mitochondria and metabolism has recently started to emerge. Substantial observations indicate alterations in mitochondria and metabolism in highly anxious individuals and, conversely, anxiety symptoms in humans suffering from mitochondrial disorders.

Cohort studies, randomized trials, and post-licensure studies have reported reduced natural and vaccine-derived protection against rotavirus gastroenteritis (RVGE) in low- and middle-income countries. While susceptibility of children to rotavirus is known to vary within and between settings, implications for estimation of immune protection are not well understood. We sought to re-estimate naturally-acquired protection against rotavirus infection and RVGE, and to understand how differences in susceptibility among children impacted estimates. We re-analyzed data from studies conducted in Mexico City, Mexico and Vellore, India. Cumulatively, 573 rotavirus-unvaccinated children experienced 1418 rotavirus infections and 371 episodes of RVGE over 17,636 child-months. We developed a model that characterized susceptibility to rotavirus infection and RVGE among children, accounting for aspects of the natural history of rotavirus and differences in transmission rates between settings. We tested whether model-generated susceptibility measurements were associated with demographic and anthropometric factors, and with the severity of RVGE symptoms. We identified greater variation in susceptibility to rotavirus infection and RVGE in Vellore than in Mexico City. In both cohorts, susceptibility to rotavirus infection and RVGE were associated with male sex, lower birth weight, lower maternal education, and having fewer siblings; within Vellore, susceptibility was also associated with lower socioeconomic status. Children who were more susceptible to rotavirus also experienced higher rates of rotavirus-negative diarrhea, and higher risk of moderate-to-severe symptoms when experiencing RVGE. Simulations suggested that discrepant estimates of naturally-acquired immunity against RVGE can be attributed, in part, to between-setting differences in susceptibility of children, but result primarily from the interaction of transmission rates with age-dependent risk for infections to cause RVGE. We found that more children in Vellore than in Mexico City belong to a high-risk group for rotavirus infection and RVGE, and demonstrate that unmeasured individual- and age-dependent susceptibility may influence estimates of naturally-acquired immune protection against RVGE.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/QoFUEA-Zyaw" width="1" />

<p>We develop a stochastic whole-brain and body simulator of the nematode
roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) and show that it is sufficiently
regularizing to allow imputation of latent membrane potentials from partial
calcium fluorescence imaging observations. This is the first attempt we know of
to "complete the circle," where an anatomically grounded whole-connectome
simulator is used to impute a time-varying "brain" state at single-cell
fidelity from covariates that are measurable in practice. The sequential Monte
Carlo (SMC) method we employ not only enables imputation of said latent states
but also presents a strategy for learning simulator parameters via variational
optimization of the noisy model evidence approximation provided by SMC. Our
imputation and parameter estimation experiments were conducted on distributed
systems using novel implementations of the aforementioned techniques applied to
synthetic data of dimension and type representative of that which are measured
in laboratories currently.

<p>The dynamics of an initial wave packed affected by random noise is considered
in the framework of a comb model. The model is relevant to a diffusion problem
in neurons where the transport of ions can be accelerated by an external random
field due to synapse fluctuations. In the present specific case, it acts as
boundary conditions, which lead to a reaction transport equation with
multiplicative noise. The temporal behavior of the mean squared displacement is
estimated analytically, and it is shown that the spreading of the initial wave
packet corresponds to Richardson diffusion.

<p>Latency reduction of postsynaptic spikes is a well-known effect of Synaptic
Time-Dependent Plasticity. We expand this notion for long postsynaptic spike
trains, showing that, for a fixed input spike train, STDP reduces the number of
postsynaptic spikes and concentrates the remaining ones. Then we study the
consequences of this phenomena in terms of coding, finding that this mechanism
improves the neural code by increasing the signal-to-noise ratio and lowering
the metabolic costs of frequent stimuli. Finally, we illustrate that the
reduction of postsynaptic latencies can lead to the emergence of predictions.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00775">Evaluation of Functional Connectivity in the Brain Using Positron Emission Tomography: A Mini-Review</a></h4>

Resting-state networks (RSNs) exhibit spontaneous functional connectivity in the resting state. Previous studies have evaluated RSNs mainly based on spontaneous fluctuations in blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). However, separation between regional increases in cerebral blood flow and oxygen consumption is theoretically difficult using BOLD-fMRI. Such separation can be achieved using quantitative 15O-gas and water positron emission tomography (PET). In addition, 18F-FDG PET can be used to investigate functional connectivity based on changes in glucose metabolism, which reflects local brain activity. Previous studies have highlighted the feasibility and clinical usefulness of 18F-FDG-PET for the analysis of RSNs, and recent studies have utilized simultaneous PET/fMRI for such analyses. While PET provides seed information regarding the focus of the abnormalities (e.g., hypometabolism, reduced target binding), fMRI is used for the analysis of functional connectivity. Thus, as PET and fMRI provide different types of information, integrating these modalities may aid in elucidating the pathological mechanisms underlying certain diseases, and in characterizing individual patients.

Abstract 

P2X receptors are ATP-gated cations channels formed by the homo or hetero-trimeric association from the seven cloned subunits (P2X1-7). P2X receptors are widely distributed in different organs and cell types throughout the body including the nervous system and are involved in a large variety of physiological but also pathological processes in adult mammals.  However, their expression and function during embryogenesis remain poorly understood.  Here, we report the cloning and the comparative expression map establishment of the entire P2X subunit family in the clawed frog Xenopus. Orthologous sequences for 6 mammalian P2X subunits were identified in both X. laevis and X. tropicalis, but not for P2X3 subunit, suggesting a potential loss of this subunit in the Pipidae family. Three of these genes (p2rx1, p2rx2 and p2rx5) exist as homeologs in the pseudoallotetraploid X. laevis, making a total of 9 subunits in this species. Phylogenetic analyses demonstrate the high level of conservation of these receptors between amphibian and other vertebrate species. RT-PCR revealed that all subunits are expressed during the development although zygotic p2rx6 and p2rx7 transcripts are mainly detected at late organogenesis stages. Whole mount in situ hybridization shows that each subunit displays a specific spatio-temporal expression profile and that these subunits can therefore be grouped into two groups, based on their expression or not in the developing nervous system. Overlapping expression in the central and peripheral nervous system and in the sensory organs suggests potential heteromerization and/or redundant functions of P2X subunits in Xenopus embryos. The developmental expression of the p2rx subunit family during early phases of embryogenesis indicates that these subunits may have distinct roles during vertebrate development, especially embryonic neurogenesis.

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease, neuropathologically characterised by progressive loss of neurons in distinct brain areas. We hypothesize that quantifiable network alterations are caused by neurodegeneration. The primary motivation of this study was to assess the specific network alterations in PD patients that are distinct but appear in conjunction with physiological aging.  

178 subjects (130 females) stratified into PD patients, young, middle-aged and elderly healthy controls (age- and sex-matched with PD patients), were analysed using 3D-T1 magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo (MPRAGE) and diffusion weighted images acquired in 3T MRI scanner. Diffusion modelling and probabilistic tractography analysis were applied for generating voxel-based connectivity index maps from each seed voxel. The obtained connectivity matrices were analysed using graph theoretical tools for characterization of involved network. By network-based statistic (NBS) the interregional connectivity differences between the groups were assessed. Measures evaluating local diffusion properties for anisotropy and diffusivity were computed for characterization of white matter microstructural integrity.

The graph theoretical analysis showed a significant decrease in distance measures - eccentricity and characteristic path length - in PD patients in comparison to healthy subjects. Both measures as well were lower in PD patients when compared to young and middle-aged healthy controls. NBS analysis demonstrated lowered structural connectivity in PD patients in comparison to young and middle-aged healthy subject groups, mainly in frontal, cingulate, olfactory, insula, thalamus and parietal regions. These specific network differences were distinct for PD and were not observed between the healthy subject groups. Microstructural analysis revealed diffusivity alterations within the white matter tracts in PD patients, predominantly in the body, splenium and tapetum of corpus callosum, corticospinal tract and corona radiata, which were absent in normal aging. 

The identified alterations of network connectivity presumably caused by neurodegeneration indicate the disruption in global network integration in PD patients. The microstructural changes identified within the white matter could endorse network reconfiguration. This study provides a clear distinction between the network changes occurring during aging and PD. This will facilitate a better understanding of PD pathophysiology and the direct link between white matter changes and their role in the restructured network topology..

Atxn7, a subunit of SAGA chromatin remodeling complex, is subject to polyglutamine expansion at the amino terminus, causing spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7), a progressive retinal and neurodegenerative disease. Within SAGA, the Atxn7 amino terminus anchors Non-stop, a deubiquitinase, to the complex. To understand the scope of Atxn7-dependent regulation of Non-stop, substrates of the deubiquitinase were sought. This revealed Non-stop, dissociated from Atxn7, interacts with Arp2/3 and WAVE regulatory complexes (WRC), which control actin cytoskeleton assembly. There, Non-stop countered polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of WRC subunit SCAR. Dependent on conserved <span class="underline">W</span>RC <span class="underline">i</span>nteracting <span class="underline">r</span>eceptor <span class="underline">s</span>equences (WIRS), Non-stop augmentation increased protein levels, and directed subcellular localization, of SCAR, decreasing cell area and number of protrusions. <i>In vivo</i>, heterozygous mutation of Atxn7 rescued haploinsufficiency of SCAR, but heterozygous mutation of SCAR did not significantly rescue knockdown of Atxn7.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/47148">Human foveal cone photoreceptor topography and its dependence on eye length</a></h4>

We provide the first measures of foveal cone density as a function of axial length in living eyes and discuss the physical and visual implications of our findings. We used a new generation Adaptive Optics Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscope to image cones at and near the fovea in 28 eyes of 16 subjects. Cone density and other metrics were computed in units of visual angle and linear retinal units. The foveal cone mosaic in longer eyes is expanded at the fovea, but not in proportion to eye length. Despite retinal stretching (decrease in cones/mm<sup>2</sup>), myopes generally have a higher angular sampling density (increase in cones/deg<sup>2</sup>) in and around the fovea compared to emmetropes, offering the potential for better visual acuity. Reports of deficits in best-corrected foveal vision in myopes compared to emmetropes cannot be explained by increased spacing between photoreceptors caused by retinal stretching during myopic progression.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/46454">Combinations of <i>Spok</i> genes create multiple meiotic drivers in <i>Podospora</i></a></h4>

Meiotic drive is the preferential transmission of a particular allele during sexual reproduction. The phenomenon is observed as spore killing in multiple fungi. In natural populations of <i>Podospora anserina</i>, seven spore killer types (<i>Psk</i>s) have been identified through classical genetic analyses. Here we show that the <i>Spok</i> gene family underlies the <i>Psk</i>s. The combination of <i>Spok</i> genes at different chromosomal locations defines the spore killer types and creates a killing hierarchy within a population. We identify two novel <i>Spok</i> homologs located within a large (74–167 kbp) region (the <i>Spok</i> block) that resides in different chromosomal locations in different strains. We confirm that the SPOK protein performs both killing and resistance functions and show that these activities are dependent on distinct domains, a predicted nuclease and kinase domain. Genomic and phylogenetic analyses across ascomycetes suggest that the <i>Spok</i> genes disperse through cross-species transfer, and evolve by duplication and diversification within lineages.

Abstract
<p>The future of medicine lies not primarily in cures but in disease modification and prevention. While the science of preclinical detection is young, it is moving rapidly. Preclinical interventions offer hope to decrease the severity of a disease or delay the development of a disorder. With such promise, the research and practice of detecting brain disorders at a preclinical stage present unique ethical challenges that must be addressed to ensure the benefit of these technologies. Direct brain interventions have the potential to impact not just what a patient has but who they are and who they could become. Further, receiving an assessment for a preclinical or prodromal state has potential to impact perceptions about capacity, autonomy and personhood and could become entangled with stigma and discrimination. Exploring ethical issues alongside and integrated into the experimental design and research of these technologies is critical. This review will highlight ethical issues attendant to the current and near future states of preclinical detection across the life span, specifically as it relates to autism spectrum disorder (ASD), schizophrenia, and Alzheimer’s disease.</p>

Abstract
<p>Sex differences in human cognitive performance are well characterized. However, the neural correlates of these differences remain elusive. This issue may be clarified using nonhuman primates, for which sociocultural influences are minimized. We used the marmoset (<i>Callithrix jacchus</i>) to investigate sex differences in two aspects of executive function: reversal learning and intradimensional/extradimensional (ID/ED) set shifting. Stress reactivity and motor function were also assessed. In agreement with human literature, females needed more trials than males to acquire the reversals. No sex differences in ED set shifting or motivational measures were observed. The findings suggest enhanced habit formation in females, perhaps due to striatal estrogenic effects. Both sexes showed increased urinary cortisol during social separation stressor, but females showed an earlier increase in cortisol and a greater increase in agitated locomotion, possibly indicating enhanced stress reactivity. Independent of sex, basal cortisol predicted cognitive performance. No sex differences were found in motor performance. Associations between brain networks and reversal learning performance were investigated using resting state fMRI. Resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) analyses revealed sex differences in cognitive networks, with differences in overall neural network metrics and specific regions, including the prefrontal cortex, caudate, putamen, and nucleus accumbens. Correlations between cognitive flexibility and neural connectivity indicate that sex differences in cognitive flexibility are related to sex-dependent patterns of resting brain networks. Overall, our findings reveal sex differences in reversal learning, brain networks, and their relationship in the marmoset, positioning this species as an excellent model to investigate the biological basis of cognitive sex differences.</p>

Abstract
<p>Grasping is an action engraved in the human genome, enabling newborn infants to hang from a monkey-bar immediately after birth. The grasp force provides rich information about the brain’s control of arm movements. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the grasp force increases to improve the hand’s movement precision during reaching. In two reaching experiments, subjects increased grasp force to suppress movement imprecision that arose from both self-generated motor noise and from an unpredictable environment. Furthermore, the grasp force did not increase constantly, but increased specifically along the movement where the hand’s deviation was greatest. The increased grasp was premeditated and was not a reaction to environmental forces, suggesting that the central nervous system has a predictive, state-dependent model of movement precision during reaching. The grasp force provides a high temporal resolution and calibration-less estimate of movement precision adaptation.</p>

Abstract
<p>Despite the importance of the prefrontal-amygdala (AMY) network for emotion processing, valence-dependent coupling within this network remains elusive. In this study, we assessed the effect of emotional valence on brain activity and effective connectivity. We tested which functional pathways within the prefrontal-AMY network are specifically engaged during the processing of emotional valence. Thirty-three healthy adults were examined with functional magnetic resonance imaging while performing a dynamic faces and dynamic shapes matching task. The valence of the facial expressions varied systematically between positive, negative, and neutral across the task. Functional contrasts determined core areas of the emotion processing circuitry, comprising the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), the right lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC), the AMY, and the right fusiform face area (FFA). Dynamic causal modelling demonstrated that the bidirectional coupling within the prefrontal-AMY circuitry is modulated by emotional valence. Additionally, Bayesian model averaging showed significant bottom-up connectivity from the AMY to the MPFC during negative and neutral, but not positive, valence. Thus, our study provides strong evidence for alterations of bottom-up coupling within the prefrontal-AMY network as a function of emotional valence. Thereby our results not only advance the understanding of the human prefrontal-AMY circuitry in varying valence context, but, moreover, provide a model to examine mechanisms of valence-sensitive emotional dysregulation in neuropsychiatric disorders.</p>

Abstract
<p>The neural mechanisms responsible for the initiation and expression of migraines remain unknown. Although there is growing evidence of changes in brainstem anatomy and function between attacks, very little is known about brainstem function and structure in the period immediately prior to a migraine. The aim of this investigation is to use brainstem-specific analyses of diffusion weighted images to determine whether the brainstem pain processing regions display altered structure in individuals with migraine across the migraine cycle, and in particular immediately prior to a migraine. Diffusion tensor images (29 controls, 36 migraineurs) were used to assess brainstem anatomy in migraineurs compared with controls. We found that during the interictal phase, migraineurs displayed greater mean diffusivity (MD) in the region of the spinal trigeminal nucleus (SpV), dorsomedial pons (dmPons)/dorsolateral pons (dlPons), and midbrain periaqueductal gray matter (PAG)/cuneiform nucleus (CNF). Remarkably, the MD returned to controls levels during the 24-h period immediately prior to a migraine, only to increase again within the three following days. Additionally, fractional anisotropy (FA) was significantly elevated in the region of the medial lemniscus/ventral trigeminal thalamic tract in migraineurs compared with controls over the entire migraine cycle. These data show that regional brainstem anatomy changes over the migraine cycle, with specific anatomical changes occurring in the 24-h period prior to onset. These changes may contribute to the activation of the ascending trigeminal pathway by either an increase in basal traffic or by sensitizing the trigeminal nuclei to external triggers, with activation ultimately resulting in perception of head pain during a migraine attack.</p>

Abstract<p>Glutamatergic transmission in the brain typically occurs at well-defined synaptic connections, but increasing evidence indicates that neural excitation can also occur through activation of "extrasynaptic" glutamate receptors. Here we investigated the underlying mechanisms and functional properties of extrasynaptic signals that are part of a feedforward path of information flow in the olfactory bulb. This pathway involves glutamatergic interneurons, external tufted cells (eTCs), that are excited by olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) and in turn excite output mitral cells (MCs) extrasynaptically. Using pair- and triple-cell recordings in rat bulb slices (of either sex), combined with ultrastructural approaches, we first present evidence that eTC-to-MC signaling results from "spillover" of glutamate released at eTC synapses onto GABAergic periglomerular (PG) cells in glomeruli. Thus, feedforward excitation is an indirect result of and must co-occur with activation of inhibitory circuitry. Next, to examine the dynamics of the competing signals, we assayed the relationship between the number of spikes in eTCs and excitation of MCs or PG cells in pair-cell recordings. This showed that extrasynaptic excitation in MCs is very weak due to single spikes but rises sharply and supralinearly with increasing spikes, differing from sublinear behavior for synaptic excitation of PG cells. Similar dynamics leading to a preference for extrasynaptic excitation were also observed during recordings of extrasynaptic and inhibitory currents in response to OSN input of increasing magnitude. The observed alterations in the balance between extrasynaptic excitation and inhibition in glomeruli with stimulus strength could underlie an intraglomerular mechanism for olfactory contrast enhancement.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Glutamatergic transmission in the brain occurs primarily at anatomically defined synaptic connections, but increasing evidence supports the prevalence of "extrasynaptic" mechanisms. Here we investigated extrasynaptic glutamatergic transmission between two types of excitatory cells in glomeruli of the rodent olfactory bulb, as well as its relationship with respect to local GABAergic inhibition. Our results indicate that weak stimuli preferentially favor inhibition over extrasynaptic excitation, but differences in the non-linear properties between extrasynaptic excitation and inhibition result in strong stimuli favoring extrasynaptic excitation. The shift in balance between extrasynaptic excitation and inhibition with stimulus strength could provide a novel intraglomerular mechanism for olfactory contrast enhancement, helping the brain discriminate different but similar odors.</p>

Abstract<p>Approach-avoidance conflict arises when the drives to pursue reward and avoid harm are incompatible. Previous neuroimaging studies of approach-avoidance conflict have shown large variability in reported neuroanatomical correlates. These prior studies have generally neglected to account for potential sources of variability, such as individual differences in choice preferences and modeling of hemodynamic response during conflict. In the present study, we controlled for these limitations using a hierarchical Bayesian model (HBM). This enabled us to measure participant-specific per-trial estimates of conflict during an approach-avoidance task. We also employed a variable epoch method to identify brain structures specifically sensitive to conflict. In a sample of 28 human participants, we found that only a limited set of brain structures (inferior frontal gyrus, right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and right pre-supplementary motor area) are specifically correlated with approach-avoidance conflict. These findings suggest that controlling for previous sources of variability increases the specificity of the neuroanatomical correlates of approach-avoidance conflict.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Approach-avoidance conflict is implicated in many psychiatric syndromes. Previous fMRI studies of this important process have potential biases caused by overlooking individual differences in the evaluation of reward and threat in their analyses. We present a method to model individual differences in approach-avoidance conflict and demonstrate how to incorporate this model into fMRI analyses. We found our approach to have greater specificity than previous studies, which highlights the importance of capturing large variability in participant behavior.</p>

Abstract<p>Large-scale brain networks are increasingly recognized as important for the generation of seizures in epilepsy. However, how a network evolves from a healthy state through the process of epileptogenesis remains unclear. To address this question, here, we study longitudinal epicranial background EEG recordings (30 electrodes, EEG free from epileptiform activity) of a mouse model of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. We analyse functional connectivity networks and observe that over the time-course of epileptogenesis the networks become increasingly asymmetric. Furthermore, computational modelling reveals that a set of nodes, located outside of the region of initial insult, emerges as particularly important for the network dynamics. These findings are consistent with experimental observations, thus demonstrating that ictogenic mechanisms can be revealed on the EEG, that computational models can be used to monitor unfolding epileptogenesis and that both the primary focus and epileptic network play a role in epileptogenesis.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> We provide the first description of how functional connectivity and network dynamics inferred from background EEG evolve during epileptogenesis. We focus on background EEG because it allows for direct comparison of functional networks before and after experimental intervention. We show that network dynamics inferred by means of computational modelling are different at early and later stages of epileptogenesis. Our findings provide further support for clinical potential of background EEG.</p>

Abstract<p>The orphan receptor GPR88 is highly expressed in D1R- and D2R-medium spiny neurons (MSNs) and has been associated to striatum-dependent functions in rodents. The total deletion of <i>Gpr88</i> in mice was shown to decrease anxiety-like behaviors, increase stereotypies and locomotion, and impair motor coordination and motor learning. Knowing the opposing role of D1R- and D2R-MSNs, we here investigated the respective roles of GPR88 in the two MSN subtypes for these behaviors. To do so, we compared effects of a conditional <i>Gpr88</i> gene knockout (KO) in D1R-MSNs (D1R-<i>Gpr88</i> mice) or D2R-MSNs (A<sub>2A</sub>R-<i>Gpr88</i> mice) with effects of the total <i>Gpr88</i> KO (CMV-<i>Gpr88</i> mice). Overall, most phenotypes of CMV-<i>Gpr88</i> mice were recapitulated in A<sub>2A</sub>R-<i>Gpr88</i> mice, including reduced marble burying, increased social interactions, increased locomotor activity and stereotypies in the open field, and reduced motor coordination in the rotarod. Exceptions were the reduced habituation to the open field and reduced motor skill learning, which were observed in CMV-<i>Gpr88</i> and D1R-<i>Gpr88</i> mice, but not in A<sub>2A</sub>R-<i>Gpr88</i> mice. D1R-<i>Gpr88</i> mice otherwise showed no other phenotype in this study. Our data together show that GPR88 modulates the function of both D1R- and D2R-MSNs, and that GPR88 activity in these two neuron populations has very different and dissociable impacts on behavior. We suggest that GPR88 in D2R-MSNs shapes defensive and social behavior and contributes in maintaining the inhibition of basal ganglia outputs to control locomotion, stereotypies and motor coordination, while GPR88 in D1R-MSNs promotes novelty habituation and motor learning.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> GPR88, an orphan G-protein-coupled receptor, has been implicated in the regulation of striatum-dependent behaviors.

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Excessive inflammation in the CNS and the periphery can result in neurodegeneration and parkinsonism. Recent evidence suggests that immune responses in Parkinson's disease patients are dysregulated, leading to an increased inflammatory reaction to unspecific triggers. Although alpha‐synuclein pathology is the hallmark of Parkinson's disease, it has not been investigated if pathologic alpha‐synuclein is a specific trigger for excessive inflammatory responses in Parkinson's disease.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We investigated the immune response of primary human monocytes and a microglial cell line to pathologic forms of alpha‐synuclein by assessing cytokine release upon exposure.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We show that pathologic alpha‐synuclein (mutations, aggregation) results in a robust inflammatory activation of human monocytes and microglial BV2 cells. The activation is conformation‐dependent, with increasing fibrillation and early‐onset mutations having the strongest effect on immune activation. We also found that activation of immune cells by extracellular alpha‐synuclein is potentiated by extracellular vesicles, possibly by facilitating the uptake of alpha‐synuclein. Blood extracellular vesicles from Parkinson's disease patients induce a stronger activation of monocytes than blood extracellular vesicles from healthy controls. Most importantly, monocytes from Parkinson's disease patients are dysregulated and hyperactive in response to stimulation with pathologic alpha‐synuclein. Furthermore, we demonstrate that α‐syn pathology in the CNS is sufficient to induce the monocyte dysregulation in the periphery of a mouse model.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Taken together, our data suggests that alpha‐synuclein pathology and dysregulation of monocytes in Parkinson's disease can act together to induce excessive inflammatory responses to alpha‐synuclein.</p>

Previous studies have found alterations in 40 Hz oscillatory activity in response to auditory stimuli in adults with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The current study sought to examine the specificity and developmental trajectory of these findings by driving the cortex to oscillate at a range of frequencies in both children and adults with and without ASD. Fifteen participants with ASD (3 female, aged 6-23 years) and 15 age-matched controls (4 female, aged 6-25 years) underwent dense-array EEG as they listened to a carrier tone amplitude-modulated by a sinusoid linearly increasing in frequency from 0-100 Hz over two seconds. EEG data were analyzed for inter-trial phase coherence (ITPC) and single-trial power (STP). Older participants with ASD displayed significantly decreased ability to phase-lock to the stimulus in the low gamma frequency range relative to their TD counterparts, while younger ASD and TD did not significantly differ from each other. An interaction between age and diagnosis suggested that TD and ASD also show different developmental trajectories for low gamma power; TD showed a significant decrease in low gamma power with age, while ASD did not. Regardless of age, increased low gamma STP was significantly correlated with increased clinical scores for repetitive behaviors in the ASD group, particularly insistence on sameness. This study contributes to a growing body of evidence supporting alterations in auditory processing in ASD. Older ASD participants showed more pronounced low gamma deficits than younger participants, suggesting an altered developmental trajectory for neural activity contributing to auditory processing deficits that may also be more broadly clinically relevant. Future studies are needed employing a longitudinal approach to confirm findings of this cross-sectional study.

Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is earning a role in the therapeutic arsenal of cocaine use disorder. A widespread and still growing number of studies have reported beneficial use of repeated TMS (rTMS) in reduction of craving, intake and cue-induced craving in cocaine addicts. In spite of these encouraging findings, many issues are still unresolved such as brain area to be stimulated, laterality of the effects, coil geometry and stimulation protocols/parameters. Intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) is a more tolerable protocol administered at lower intensities and shorter intervals than conventional repeated TMS (rTMS) protocols. Yet, its effects on cocaine craving and length of abstinence in comparison with standard high frequency (10-15Hz) protocols have never been evaluated so far. In the present paper we describe the effect of the bilateral iTBS of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in a population (n=25) of treatment-seeking cocaine addicts, in an outpatient setting, and compare them with 15 Hz stimulation of the same brain area (n=22). The results indicate that iTBS produces effects on cocaine consumption and cocaine craving virtually superimposable to the 15 Hz rTMS group. Both treatments had low numbers of dropouts and similar side-effects, safety and tolerability profiles. While larger studies are warranted to confirm these observations, iTBS appears to be a valid approach to be considered in treatment-seeking cocaine addicts, especially in light of its brief duration (3 mins) vs 15 Hz stimulation (15 mins). The use of iTBS would allow increasing the number of patients treated per day with current rTMS devices, thus reducing patient discomfort and hopefully reducing drop-out rates without compromising clinical effectiveness.

Background: Event related potential (ERP) components, such as P3, N2, and FRN, are potential metrics for assessing feedback response as a form of performance monitoring. Most research studies investigate these ERP components using clinical or research-grade electroencephalography (EEG) systems. Wearable EEGs, which are an affordable alternative, have the potential to assess feedback response using ERPs but have not been sufficiently evaluated. Feedback-related ERPs also have not been scientifically evaluated in interactive settings that are similar to daily computer use. In this study, a consumer-grade wearable EEG system was assessed for its feasibility to collect feedback-related ERPs through an interactive software module that provided an environment in which users were permitted to navigate freely within the program to make decisions.
Methods: The recording hardware, which costs less than $1500 in total, incorporated the OpenBCI Cyton Board with Daisy chain, a consumer-grade EEG system that costs $949 USD. 17 participants interacted with an oddball paradigm and an interactive module designed to elicit feedback-related ERPs. The features of interests for the oddball paradigm were the P3 and N2 components. The features of interests for the interactive module were the the P3, N2, and FRN components elicited in response to positive, neutral, and two types of negative feedback. The FRN was calculated by subtracting the positive feedback response from the negative feedback responses.
Results: The P3 and N2 components of the oddball paradigm indicated statistically significant differences between infrequent targets and frequent targets which is in line with current literature. The P3 and N2 components elicited in the interactive module indicated statistically significant differences between positive, neutral, and negative feedback responses. There were no significant differences between the FRN types and significant interactions with channel group and FRN type.
Conclusion: The OpenBCI Cyton, after some modifications, shows potential for eliciting and assessing P3, N2, and FRN components, which are important indicators for performance monitoring, in an interactive setting.

Several studies indicate the functional importance of the motor cortex for higher cognition, language and semantic processing, and place the neural substrate of these processes in sensorimotor action-perception circuits linking motor, sensory and perisylvian language regions. Interestingly, in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), semantic processing of action and emotion words seems to be impaired and is associated with hypoactivity of the motor cortex during semantic processing. In this study, the relationship between semantic processing, fine motor skills and clinical symptoms was investigated in 19 individuals with ASD and in 22 typically-developing matched controls. Participants completed two semantic decision tasks involving words from different semantic categories, a test of alexithymia (the Toronto Alexithymia Scale), and a test of fine motor skills (the Purdue Pegboard Test). A significant Group x Word Category interaction in accuracy (p &lt; .05) demonstrated impaired semantic processing for action words, but not object words in the autistic group. There was no significant group difference when processing abstract emotional words or abstract neutral words.  Moreover, our study revealed deficits in fine motor skills as well as evidence for alexithymia in the ASD group, but not in neurotypical controls. We interpret the data in terms of an underlying dysfunction of the action-perception system in ASD which has a specific impact on semantic language processing.

Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain–computer interface (BCI) is a tool to non-invasively
control computers by translating the electrical activity of the brain. This technology has the
potential to provide patients who have severe generalized myopathy, such as those suffering from
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), with the ability to communicate. Recently, auditory oddball
paradigms have been developed to implement more practical event-related potential (ERP)-based
BCIs because they can operate without ocular activities. These paradigms generally make use
of clinical (over 16-channel) EEG devices and natural sound stimuli for maintaining the user’s
motivation during the BCI operation; however, most of ALS patients who took part in auditory
ERP-based BCIs tended to complain about the following factors: (i) total device cost and (ii) setup
time. The development of a portable auditory ERP-based BCI would overcome considerable
obstacles that prevent the use of this technology in communication in everyday life. To address this
issue, we analyzed prefrontal single-channel EEG data acquired from a consumer-grade single-
channel EEG device using a natural sound-based auditory oddball paradigm. In our experiments,
EEG data was gathered from nine healthy subjects and one ALS patient. The performance of
auditory ERP-based BCI was quantified under offline condition and two online conditions. The
offline analysis indicated that our paradigm maintained a high level of detection accuracy (%)
and ITR (bits/min) across all subjects through a cross-validation procedure (for five commands:
70.0 ± 16.1 and 1.29 ± 0.93, for four commands: 73.8 ± 14.2 and 1.16 ± 0.78, for three commands:
78.7 ± 11.8 and 0.95 ± 0.61, and for two commands: 85.7 ± 8.6 and 0.63 ± 0.38). Furthermore, the
first online analysis demonstrated that our paradigm also achieved high performance for new
data in an online data acquisition stream (for three commands: 80.0 ± 19.4 and 1.16 ± 0.83). The
second online analysis demonstrated online performances on the different day of offline and first online analyses (for three commands: 62.5 ± 14.3 and 0.43 ± 0.36). These results indicate that prefrontal single-channel EEGs have the potential to contribute to the development of a user-friendly portable auditory ERP-based BCI.

Apologizing is an effective interpersonal conflict resolution strategy, but whether organizations should issue public apologies after crises has been less clear. Recently it was shown that public apologies are effective, especially when they provide a comprehensive account of what happened and clear actions taken by the company to address the problems. Intriguingly, public apologies may be most effective when the crisis source resides within the organization itself, suggesting that the company has control over it. In the current study we first attempted to replicate this behavioral finding by presenting participants with multiple crisis scenarios (e.g., ignition failures in a new car model) followed by one of two written apologies: one stating that the crisis source was internal to and controllable by the organization, and the other that it was external and uncontrollable. Replicating the previous study, we found that the internal-controllable public apology was most effective. We then examined the neural basis of this public apology assessment and found that the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex appears to mediate the believability of organizational control, and the precuneus uses the information for the apology assessment. Examination of complex social interactions, such as the public’s response to corporate crises, help elucidate high-level brain function.

The inflammatory microenvironment in the retina plays a vital role in the pathogenesis and progression of retinitis pigmentosa (RP). Microglial inflammatory cytokines production leads to gliosis and apoptosis of retinal neurons, and ultimately, visual loss. Cell-based therapies using grafted olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) have demonstrated modulation of degenerative microenvironments in the central nervous system (CNS), in a number of animal models. However, mechanisms by which grafted OECs can reduce degeneration in the retina are not well understood.
In the present study, we set up an in vitro OEC/BV2 microglia co-culture system, and an in vivo Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) rat model, used cell transplantation, immunohistochemistry, RT-PCR, Western Blot to explore the mechanisms by which OECs affect expression of pro- or anti-inflammatory cytokines and polarization of M(IL-6) and M(Arg1) type microglial activation in the retina. We found that compared with the LPS (Lipopolysaccharide) and olfactory nerve fibroblast (ONF), the OEC and BV2 co-culture group modulate microglial cytokines releasing towards the anti-inflammation, and away from the pro-inflammation, which was followed by higher IL-4 and IL-10 and lower IL-6 and TNF-a in their expression levels. In vivo, the transplantation group significantly reduced activated resident microglia/infiltrated macrophage, and expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in RCS rats retina, increased anti-inflammatory cytokines in transplantation area. Additionally, we found that OECs down-regulated the JAK2/STAT3 (Janus Kinase 2/Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3) pathway. Thirdly, OEC transplantation reduced Caspase-3 expression, protected inner retinal neurons and photoreceptors and therefore, delayed the visual function degeneration. In conclusion, our data suggest that OECs delay retinal degeneration in RP, at least in part through immunomodulation of microglia via the JAK/STAT pathway.

Abstract
Müller glial cells (MGC) are stem cells in the retina. Although their regenerative capacity is very low in mammals, the use of MGC as stem cells to regenerate photoreceptors (PHRs) during retina degenerations, such as in retinitis pigmentosa, is being intensely studied. Changes affecting PHRs in diseased retinas have been thoroughly investigated; however, whether MGC are also affected is still unclear. We here investigated whether MGC in retinal degeneration 1 (rd1) mouse, an animal model of retinitis pigmentosa, have impaired stem cell properties or structure. rd1 MGC showed an altered morphology, both in culture and in the whole retina. Using mixed neuron-glial cultures obtained from newborn mice retinas, we determined that proliferation was significantly lower in rd1 than in wild type (wt) MGC. Levels of stem cell markers, such as Nestin and Sox2, were also markedly reduced in rd1 MGC compared to wt MGC in neuron-glial cultures and in retina cryosections, even before the onset of PHR degeneration. We then investigated whether neuron-glial crosstalk was involved in these changes. Noteworthy, Nestin expression was restored in rd1 MGC in co-culture with wt neurons. Conversely, Nestin expression decreased in wt MGC in co-culture with rd1 neurons, as occurred in rd1 MGC in rd1 neuron-glial mixed cultures. These results imply that MGC proliferation and stem cell markers are reduced in rd1 retinas and might be restored by their interaction with “healthy” PHRs, suggesting that alterations in rd1 PHRs lead to a disruption in neuron-glial crosstalk affecting the regenerative potential of MGC.

The globus pallidus occupies a critical position in the indirect pathway of the basal ganglia motor control system. Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic-nucleotide gated (HCN) channels play an important role in the modulation of neuronal excitability. In vivo extracellular single unit recording, behavioral test and immunohistochemistry were performed to explore the possible modulation of endogenous HCN channels in the globus pallidus under parkinsonian states. In MPTP parkinsonian mice, micro-pressure application of the selective HCN channel antagonist, ZD7288, decreased the firing rate in 10 out of the 28 pallidal neurons, while increased the firing rate in another 15 out of the 28 neurons. In 6-OHDA parkinsonian rats, ZD7288 also bidirectionally regulated the spontaneous firing activity of the globus pallidus neurons. The proportion of pallidal neurons with ZD7288-induced slowing of firing rate tended to reduce in both parkinsonian animals. Morphological studies revealed a weaker staining of HCN channels in the globus pallidus under parkinsonian state. Finally, behavioral study demonstrated that intrapallidal microinjection of ZD7288 alleviated locomotor deficits in MPTP parkinsonian mice. These results suggest that endogenous HCN channels modulate the activities of pallidal neurons under parkinsonian states.

<i>NORAD</i> is a conserved long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) that is required for genome stability in mammals, and which acts as a negative regulator of PUMILIO (PUM) proteins in the cytoplasm. Previously we showed that loss of <i>NORAD</i> or PUM hyperactivity results in premature aging in mice (Kopp et al., 2019). Recently, however, it was reported that <i>NORAD</i>  regulates genome stability through an interaction with the RNA binding protein RBMX in the nucleus. Here we addressed the contributions of <i>NORAD</i>:PUM and <i>NORAD</i>:RBMX interactions to genome maintenance by this lncRNA in human cells. Extensive RNA FISH and fractionation experiments established that <i>NORAD</i> localizes predominantly to the cytoplasm with or without DNA damage. Moreover, genetic rescue experiments demonstrated that PUM binding is required for maintenance of genomic stability by <i>NORAD</i> whereas binding of RBMX is dispensable for this function. These data provide an important foundation for further mechanistic dissection of the <i>NORAD</i>-PUMILIO axis in genome maintenance.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/46689">FcγRIIB-I232T polymorphic change allosterically suppresses ligand binding</a></h4>

FcγRIIB binding to its ligand suppresses immune cell activation. A single-nucleotide polymorphic (SNP) change, I232T, in the transmembrane (TM) domain of FcγRIIB loses its suppressive function, which is clinically associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Previously, we reported that I232T tilted FcγRIIB's TM domain. In this study, combining with molecular dynamics simulations and single-cell FRET assay, we further reveal that such tilting by I232T unexpectedly bends the FcγRIIB's ectodomain towards plasma membrane to allosterically impede FcγRIIB's ligand association. I232T substitution reduces <i>in-situ</i> two-dimensional binding affinities and association rates of FcγRIIB to interact with its ligands, IgG1, IgG2 and IgG3 by three to four folds. This allosteric regulation by a SNP provides an intrinsic molecular mechanism for the functional loss of FcγRIIB-I232T in SLE patients.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/46417">Mechanism of pharmacochaperoning in a mammalian K<sub>ATP</sub> channel revealed by cryo-EM</a></h4>

ATP-sensitive potassium (K<sub>ATP</sub>) channels composed of a pore-forming Kir6.2 potassium channel and a regulatory ABC transporter sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1) regulate insulin secretion in pancreatic β-cells to maintain glucose homeostasis. Mutations that impair channel folding or assembly prevent cell surface expression and cause congenital hyperinsulinism. Structurally diverse K<sub>ATP</sub> inhibitors are known to act as pharmacochaperones to correct mutant channel expression, but the mechanism is unknown. Here, we compare cryoEM structures of a mammalian K<sub>ATP</sub> channel bound to pharmacochaperones glibenclamide, repaglinide, and carbamazepine. We found all three drugs bind within a common pocket in SUR1. Further, we found the N-terminus of Kir6.2 inserted within the central cavity of the SUR1 ABC core, adjacent the drug binding pocket. The findings reveal a common mechanism by which diverse compounds stabilize the Kir6.2 N-terminus within SUR1's ABC core, allowing it to act as a firm 'handle' for the assembly of metastable mutant SUR1-Kir6.2 complexes.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Somatosensory signals play roles in the fine control of dexterous movements through a somatosensory–motor integration mechanism. While skilled individuals are typically characterized by fine-tuned somatosensory functions and dexterous motor skills, it remains unknown whether and in what manner their bridging mechanism, the tactile–motor and proprioceptive–motor integration functions, plastically changes through extensive sensorimotor experiences. Here, we addressed this issue by comparing physiological indices of these functions between pianists and nonmusicians. Both tactile and proprioceptive stimuli to the right index finger inhibited corticospinal excitability measured by a transcranial magnetic stimulation method. However, the tactile and proprioceptive stimuli exerted weaker and stronger inhibitory effects, respectively, on corticospinal excitability in pianists than in nonmusicians. The results of the electroencephalogram measurements revealed no significant group difference in the amplitude of cortical responses to the somatosensory stimuli around the motor and somatosensory cortices, suggesting that the group difference in the inhibitory effects reflects neuroplastic adaptation of the somatosensory–motor integration functions in pianists. Penalized regression analyses further revealed an association between these integration functions and motor performance in the pianists, suggesting that extensive piano practice reorganizes somatosensory–motor integration functions so as to enable fine control of dexterous finger movements during piano performances.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">ABSTRACT</div>Much evidence suggests that reversal learning is mediated by cortico-striatal circuitries with the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) playing a prominent role. The OFC is a functionally heterogeneous region, but potential differential roles of lateral (lOFC) and medial (mOFC) portions in visual reversal learning have yet to be determined. We investigated the effects of pharmacological inactivation of mOFC and lOFC on a deterministic serial visual reversal learning task for rats. For reference, we also targeted other areas previously implicated in reversal learning: prelimbic (PrL) and infralimbic (IL) prefrontal cortex, and basolateral amygdala (BLA). Inactivating mOFC and lOFC produced opposite effects; lOFC impairing, and mOFC improving, performance in the early, perseverative phase specifically. Additionally, mOFC inactivation enhanced negative feedback sensitivity, while lOFC inactivation diminished feedback sensitivity in general. mOFC and lOFC inactivation also affected novel visual discrimination learning differently; lOFC inactivation paradoxically improved learning, and mOFC inactivation had no effect. We also observed dissociable roles of the OFC and the IL/PrL. Whereas the OFC inactivation affected only perseveration, IL/PrL inactivation improved learning overall. BLA inactivation did not affect perseveration, but improved the late phase of reversal learning. These results support opponent roles of the rodent mOFC and lOFC in deterministic visual reversal learning.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Perturbation of the developmental refinement of the corticospinal (CS) pathway leads to motor disorders. While non-primate developmental refinement is well documented, in primates invasive investigations of the developing CS pathway have been confined to neonatal and postnatal stages when refinement is relatively modest.

Injections of retrograde tracer at cervical levels of the spinal cord at embryonic day (E) 95 and E105 show that: (i) areal distribution of back-labeled neurons is more extensive than in the neonate and dense labeling is found in prefrontal, limbic, temporal, and occipital cortex; (ii) distributions of contralateral and ipsilateral projecting CS neurons are comparable in terms of location and numbers of labeled neurons, in contrast to the adult where the contralateral projection is an order of magnitude higher than the ipsilateral projection. Findings from one largely restricted injection suggest a hitherto unsuspected early innervation of the gray matter.

Bonnefont et al. show that Bcl6 promotes neurogenesis by directly repressing genes belonging to the major signaling pathways promoting cortical progenitor self-renewal. These data indicate that a single cell-intrinsic factor represses multiple extrinsic signaling pathways to ensure irreversible neurogenic commitment.

<p>by Jessica M. Conway, Alan S. Perelson, Jonathan Z. Li</p>

Antiretroviral therapy (ART) effectively controls HIV infection, suppressing HIV viral loads. Suspension of therapy is followed by rebound of viral loads to high, pre-therapy levels. However, there is significant heterogeneity in speed of rebound, with some rebounds occurring within days, weeks, or sometimes years. We present a stochastic mathematical model to gain insight into these post-treatment dynamics, specifically characterizing the dynamics of short term viral rebounds (≤ 60 days). Li et al. (2016) report that the size of the expressed HIV reservoir, i.e., cell-associated HIV RNA levels, and drug regimen correlate with the time between ART suspension and viral rebound to detectable levels. We incorporate this information and viral rebound times to parametrize our model. We then investigate insights offered by our model into the underlying dynamics of the latent reservoir. In particular, we refine previous estimates of viral recrudescence after ART interruption by accounting for heterogeneity in infection rebound dynamics, and determine a recrudescence rate of once every 2-4 days. Our parametrized model can be used to aid in design of clinical trials to study viral dynamics following analytic treatment interruption. We show how to derive informative personalized testing frequencies from our model and offer a proof-of-concept example. Our results represent first steps towards a model that can make predictions on a person living with HIV (PLWH)’s rebound time distribution based on biomarkers, and help identify PLWH with long viral rebound delays.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/n51SDowLqAU" width="1" />

<p>by Eric Libby, Laurent Hébert-Dufresne, Sayed-Rzgar Hosseini, Andreas Wagner</p>

Syntrophy allows a microbial community as a whole to survive in an environment, even though individual microbes cannot. The metabolic interdependence typical of syntrophy is thought to arise from the accumulation of degenerative mutations during the sustained co-evolution of initially self-sufficient organisms. An alternative and underexplored possibility is that syntrophy can emerge spontaneously in communities of organisms that did not co-evolve. Here, we study this <i>de novo</i> origin of syntrophy using experimentally validated computational techniques to predict an organism’s viability from its metabolic reactions. We show that pairs of metabolisms that are randomly sampled from a large space of possible metabolism and viable on specific primary carbon sources often become viable on new carbon sources by exchanging metabolites. The same biochemical reactions that are required for viability on primary carbon sources also confer viability on novel carbon sources. Our observations highlight a new and important avenue for the emergence of metabolic adaptations and novel ecological interactions.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/lwFO2DBjszo" width="1" />

<p>by Jacob D. Davidson, Ahmed El Hady</p>

The patch-leaving problem is a canonical foraging task, in which a forager must decide to leave a current resource in search for another. Theoretical work has derived optimal strategies for when to leave a patch, and experiments have tested for conditions where animals do or do not follow an optimal strategy. Nevertheless, models of patch-leaving decisions do not consider the imperfect and noisy sampling process through which an animal gathers information, and how this process is constrained by neurobiological mechanisms. In this theoretical study, we formulate an evidence accumulation model of patch-leaving decisions where the animal averages over noisy measurements to estimate the state of the current patch and the overall environment. We solve the model for conditions where foraging decisions are optimal and equivalent to the marginal value theorem, and perform simulations to analyze deviations from optimal when these conditions are not met. By adjusting the drift rate and decision threshold, the model can represent different “strategies”, for example an incremental, decremental, or counting strategy. These strategies yield identical decisions in the limiting case but differ in how patch residence times adapt when the foraging environment is uncertain. To describe sub-optimal decisions, we introduce an energy-dependent marginal utility function that predicts longer than optimal patch residence times when food is plentiful. Our model provides a quantitative connection between ecological models of foraging behavior and evidence accumulation models of decision making. Moreover, it provides a theoretical framework for potential experiments which seek to identify neural circuits underlying patch-leaving decisions.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ZwQASFIYZ4o" width="1" />

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25556?af=R">The contribution of acute infarcts to cerebral small vessel disease progression</a></h4>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To determine the contribution of acute infarcts, evidenced by diffusion‐weighted imaging positive (DWI+) lesions to progression of white matter hyperintensities (WMH) and other cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) markers.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed 10 monthly 3 T MRIs in 54 elderly individuals with SVD. MRI included high‐resolution multi‐shell DWI, and 3D FLAIR, T1 and SWI. We determined DWI+ lesion evolution, WMH progression rate (mL/month), and number of incident lacunes and microbleeds, and calculated for each marker the proportion of progression explained by DWI+ lesions.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified 39 DWI+ lesions on 21/472 DWI scans in 9/54 subjects. Of the 36 DWI+ lesions with follow‐up MRI, two evolved into WMH, four into a lacune (three of which with cavity &lt; 3 mm), three into a microbleed, and 27 were not detectable on follow‐up. WMH volume increased at a median rate of 0.027 (0.005‐0.073) mL/month, but was not significantly higher in subjects with DWI+ lesions compared to those without (<i>p</i> = 0.195). Of the two DWI+ lesions evolving into WMH on follow‐up, one explained 23% of the total WMH volume increase in one subject, whereas WMH regressed in the other subject. DWI+ lesions preceded 4/5 incident lacunes, and 3/10 incident microbleeds.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>DWI+ lesions explain only a small proportion of the total WMH progression. Hence, WMH progression seems to be mostly driven by factors other than acute infarcts. DWI+ lesions explain the majority of incident lacunes and small cavities, and almost a third of incident microbleeds, confirming that WMH, lacunes, and microbleeds, although heterogeneous on MRI, can have a common initial appearance on MRI.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Drug resistant epilepsy causes great danger in clinical and still lacks effective treatments.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Here, we used multifaceted approaches combining electrophysiology, optogenetics and chemogenetics in a classic phenytoin resistant epilepsy model to reveal the key target of subicular pyramidal neurons in phenytoin resistance.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p><i>In vivo</i> neural recording showed that the firing rate of pyramidal neurons in the subiculum, but not other hippocampal subregions, could not be inhibited by phenytoin in phenytoin resistant rats. Selective inhibition of subicular pyramidal neurons by optogenetics or chemogenetics reversed phenytoin resistance, while selective activation of subicular pyramidal neurons induced phenytoin resistance. Moreover, long‐term low frequency stimulation at the subiculum, which is clinically feasible, significantly inhibited the subicular pyramidal neurons and reversed phenytoin resistance. Further, <i>in vitro</i> electrophysiology revealed that off‐target of phenytoin on sodium channels of subicular pyramidal neurons were involved in the phenytoin resistance, and clinical neuroimage data suggested the volume of the subiculum in drug‐resistant patients was related with the usage of sodium channel inhibitors.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These results highlight that the subicular pyramidal neurons may be a key “switch” control of drug resistant epilepsy and represent a new potential target for precise treatments.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/30/6012?rss=1">Growth Factor Signaling Regulates Mechanical Nociception in Flies and Vertebrates</a></h4>

<p>Mechanical sensitization is one of the most difficult clinical pain problems to treat. However, the molecular and genetic bases of mechanical nociception are unclear. Here we develop a <i>Drosophila</i> model of mechanical nociception to investigate the ion channels and signaling pathways that regulate mechanical nociception. We fabricated von Frey filaments that span the subthreshold to high noxious range for <i>Drosophila</i> larvae. Using these, we discovered that pressure (force/area), rather than force per se, is the main determinant of aversive rolling responses to noxious mechanical stimuli. We demonstrated that the RTK PDGF/VEGF receptor (Pvr) and its ligands (Pvfs 2 and 3) are required for mechanical nociception and normal dendritic branching. Pvr is expressed and functions in class IV sensory neurons, whereas Pvf2 and Pvf3 are produced by multiple tissues. Constitutive overexpression of Pvr and its ligands or inducible overexpression of Pvr led to mechanical hypersensitivity that could be partially separated from morphological effects. Genetic analyses revealed that the Piezo and Pain ion channels are required for mechanical hypersensitivity observed upon ectopic activation of Pvr signaling. PDGF, but not VEGF, peptides caused mechanical hypersensitivity in rats. Pharmacological inhibition of VEGF receptor Type 2 (VEGFR-2) signaling attenuated mechanical nociception in rats, suggesting a conserved role for PDGF and VEGFR-2 signaling in regulating mechanical nociception. VEGFR-2 inhibition also attenuated morphine analgesic tolerance in rats. Our results reveal that a conserved RTK signaling pathway regulates baseline mechanical nociception in flies and rats.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Hypersensitivity to touch is poorly understood and extremely difficult to treat. Using a refined <i>Drosophila</i> model of mechanical nociception, we discovered a conserved VEGF-related receptor tyrosine kinase signaling pathway that regulates mechanical nociception in flies. Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of VEGF receptor Type 2 signaling in rats causes analgesia and blocks opioid tolerance. We have thus established a robust, genetically tractable system for the rapid identification and functional analysis of conserved genes underlying mechanical pain sensitivity.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/30/6001?rss=1">CSD-Induced Arterial Dilatation and Plasma Protein Extravasation Are Unaffected by Fremanezumab: Implications for CGRP's Role in Migraine with Aura</a></h4>

<p>Cortical spreading depression (CSD) is a wave of neuronal depolarization thought to underlie migraine aura. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a potent vasodilator involved in migraine pathophysiology. Evidence for functional connectivity between CSD and CGRP has triggered scientific interest in the possibility that CGRP antagonism may disrupt vascular responses to CSD and the ensuing plasma protein extravasation (PPE). Using imaging tools that allow us to generate continuous, live, high-resolution views of spatial and temporal changes that affect arteries and veins in the dura and pia, we determined the extent to which CGRP contributes to the induction of arterial dilatation or PPE by CSD in female rats, and how these events are affected by the anti-CGRP monoclonal antibody (anti-CGRP-mAb) fremanezumab. We found that the CSD-induced brief dilatation and prolonged constriction of pial arteries, prolonged dilatation of dural arteries and PPE are all unaffected by fremanezumab, whereas the brief constriction and prolonged dilatation of pial veins are affected. In comparison, although CGRP infusion gave rise to the expected dilatation of dural arteries, which was effectively blocked by fremanezumab, it did not induce dilatation in pial arteries, pial veins, or dural veins. It also failed to induce PPE. Regardless of whether the nociceptors become active before or after the induction of arterial dilatation or PPE by CSD, the inability of fremanezumab to prevent them suggests that these events are not mediated by CGRP, a conclusion with important implications for our understanding of the mechanism of action of anti-CGRP-mAbs in migraine prevention.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The current study identifies fundamental differences between two commonly used models of migraine, CSD induction and systemic CGRP infusion. It raises the possibility that conclusions drawn from one model may not be true or relevant to the other. It sharpens the need to accept the view that there is more than one truth to migraine pathophysiology and that it is unlikely that one theory will explain all types of migraine headache or the mechanisms of action of drugs that prevent it. Regarding the latter, it is concluded that not all vascular responses in the meninges are born alike and, consequently, that drugs that prevent vascular dilatation through different molecular pathways may have different therapeutic outcomes in different types of migraine.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/30/5986?rss=1">Neuromodulatory Action of Picomolar Extracellular A{beta}42 Oligomers on Presynaptic and Postsynaptic Mechanisms Underlying Synaptic Function and Memory</a></h4>

<p>Failure of anti-amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) therapies against Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by high amounts of the peptide in the brain, raised the question of the physiological role of Aβ released at low concentrations in the healthy brain. To address this question, we studied the presynaptic and postsynaptic mechanisms underlying the neuromodulatory action of picomolar amounts of oligomeric Aβ<sub>42</sub> (oAβ<sub>42</sub>) on synaptic glutamatergic function in male and female mice. We found that 200 pm oAβ<sub>42</sub> induces an increase of frequency of miniature EPSCs and a decrease of paired pulse facilitation, associated with an increase in docked vesicle number, indicating that it augments neurotransmitter release at presynaptic level. oAβ<sub>42</sub> also produced postsynaptic changes as shown by an increased length of postsynaptic density, accompanied by an increased expression of plasticity-related proteins such as cAMP-responsive element binding protein phosphorylated at Ser133, calcium-calmodulin-dependent kinase II phosphorylated at Thr286, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor, suggesting a role for Aβ in synaptic tagging. These changes resulted in the conversion of early into late long-term potentiation through the nitric oxide/cGMP/protein kinase G intracellular cascade consistent with a cGMP-dependent switch from short- to long-term memory observed <i>in vivo</i> after intrahippocampal administration of picomolar amounts of oAβ<sub>42</sub>. These effects were present upon extracellular but not intracellular application of the peptide and involved α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. These observations clarified the physiological role of oAβ<sub>42</sub> in synaptic function and memory formation providing solid fundamentals for investigating the pathological effects of high Aβ levels in the AD brains.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> High levels of oligomeric amyloid-β<sub>42</sub> (oAβ<sub>42</sub>) induce synaptic dysfunction leading to memory impairment in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, at picomolar concentrations, the peptide is needed to ensure long-term potentiation (LTP) and memory. Here, we show that extracellular 200 pm oAβ<sub>42</sub> concentrations increase neurotransmitter release, number of docked vesicles, postsynaptic density length, and expression of plasticity-related proteins leading to the conversion of early LTP into late LTP and of short-term memory into long-term memory. These effects require α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and are mediated through the nitric oxide/cGMP/protein kinase G pathway. The knowledge of Aβ function in the healthy brain might be useful to understand the causes leading to its increase and detrimental effect in AD.</p>

<p>Attention can be subdivided into several components, including alertness and spatial attention. It is believed that the behavioral benefits of attention, such as increased accuracy and faster reaction times, are generated by an increase in neural activity and a decrease in neural variability, which enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of task-relevant neural populations. However, empirical evidence regarding attention-related changes in neural variability in humans is extremely rare. Here we used EEG to demonstrate that trial-by-trial neural variability was reduced by visual cues that modulated alertness and spatial attention. Reductions in neural variability were specific to the visual system and larger in the contralateral hemisphere of the attended visual field. Subjects with higher initial levels of neural variability and larger decreases in variability exhibited greater behavioral benefits from attentional cues. These findings demonstrate that both alertness and spatial attention modulate neural variability and highlight the importance of reducing/quenching neural variability for attaining the behavioral benefits of attention.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Attention is thought to improve perception by increasing the signal-to-noise ratio of the neuronal populations that encode the attended stimulus. Signal-to-noise ratio can be enhanced by increasing neural response (signal) and/or by reducing neural variability (noise). The ability of attention to increase neural responses has been studied extensively, but the effects of attention on neural variability have rarely been examined in humans. Here, we demonstrate that modulating different components of attention, including alertness and spatial attention, reduces neural variability in humans. Furthermore, we show that subjects with larger reductions in neural variability exhibit greater behavioral benefits from attention. These results demonstrate that reduction of neural variability is a fundamental feature of attentional processes in humans with clear behavioral importance.</p>

<p>The middle temporal gyrus (MTG) has been shown to be recruited during the processing of words, but also during the observation of actions. Here we investigated how information related to words and gestures is organized along the MTG. To this aim, we measured the BOLD response in the MTG to video clips of gestures and spoken words in 17 healthy human adults (male and female). Gestures consisted of videos of an actress performing object-use pantomimes (iconic representations of object-directed actions; e.g., playing guitar), emblems (conventional gestures, e.g., thumb up), and meaningless gestures. Word stimuli (verbs, nouns) consisted of video clips of the same actress pronouncing words. We found a stronger response to meaningful compared with meaningless gestures along the whole left and large portions of the right MTG. Importantly, we observed a gradient, with posterior regions responding more strongly to gestures (pantomimes and emblems) than words and anterior regions showing a stronger response to words than gestures. In an intermediate region in the left hemisphere, the response was significantly higher to words and emblems (i.e., items with a greater arbitrariness of the sign-to-meaning mapping) than to pantomimes. These results show that the large-scale organization of information in the MTG is driven by the input modality and may also reflect the arbitrariness of the relationship between sign and meaning.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Here we investigated the organizing principle of information in the middle temporal gyrus, taking into consideration the input-modality and the arbitrariness of the relationship between a sign and its meaning. We compared the middle temporal gyrus response during the processing of pantomimes, emblems, and spoken words. We found that posterior regions responded more strongly to pantomimes and emblems than to words, whereas anterior regions responded more strongly to words than to pantomimes and emblems. In an intermediate region, only in the left hemisphere, words and emblems evoked a stronger response than pantomimes. Our results identify two organizing principles of neural representation: the modality of communication (gestural or verbal) and the (arbitrariness of the) relationship between sign and meanings.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/30/5949?rss=1">Diacylglycerol Lipase-Alpha Regulates Hippocampal-Dependent Learning and Memory Processes in Mice</a></h4>

<p>Diacylglycerol lipase-α (DAGL-α), the principal biosynthetic enzyme of the endogenous cannabinoid 2-arachidonylglycerol (2-AG) on neurons, plays a key role in CB<sub>1</sub> receptor-mediated synaptic plasticity and hippocampal neurogenesis, but its contribution to global hippocampal-mediated processes remains unknown. Thus, the present study examines the role that DAGL-α plays on LTP in hippocampus, as well as in hippocampal-dependent spatial learning and memory tasks, and on the production of endocannabinoid and related lipids through the use of complementary pharmacologic and genetic approaches to disrupt this enzyme in male mice. Here we show that DAGL-α gene deletion or pharmacological inhibition disrupts LTP in CA1 of the hippocampus but elicits varying magnitudes of behavioral learning and memory deficits in mice. In particular, <i>DAGL</i>-α<sup>–/–</sup> mice display profound impairments in the Object Location assay and Morris Water Maze (MWM) acquisition engaging in nonspatial search strategies. In contrast, WT mice administered the DAGL-α inhibitor DO34 show delays in MWM acquisition and reversal learning, but no deficits in expression, extinction, forgetting, or perseveration processes in this task, as well as no impairment in Object Location. The deficits in synaptic plasticity and MWM performance occur in concert with decreased 2-AG and its major lipid metabolite (arachidonic acid), but increases of a 2-AG diacylglycerol precursor in hippocampus, PFC, striatum, and cerebellum. These novel behavioral and electrophysiological results implicate a direct and perhaps selective role of DAGL-α in the integration of new spatial information.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Here we show that genetic deletion or pharmacologic inhibition of diacylglycerol lipase-α (DAGL-α) impairs hippocampal CA1 LTP, differentially disrupts spatial learning and memory performance in Morris water maze (MWM) and Object Location tasks, and alters brain levels of endocannabinoids and related lipids. Whereas <i>DAGL</i>-α<sup>–/–</sup> mice exhibit profound phenotypic spatial memory deficits, a DAGL inhibitor selectively impairs the integration of new information in MWM acquisition and reversal tasks, but not memory processes of expression, extinction, forgetting, or perseveration, and does not affect performance in the Objection Location task. The findings that constitutive or short-term DAGL-α disruption impairs learning and memory at electrophysiological and selective <i>in vivo</i> levels implicate this enzyme as playing a key role in the integration of new spatial information.</p>

<p>Epidemiological studies indicate that insulin resistance (IR), a hallmark of type 2 diabetes, is associated with an increased risk of major depression. Here, we demonstrated that male mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) exhibited peripheral metabolic impairments reminiscent of IR accompanied by elevated circulating levels of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), whereas both parameters were normalized by chronic treatment with metformin (Met). Given the role of BCAAs in the regulation of tryptophan influx into the brain, we then explored the activity of the serotonin (5-HT) system. Our results indicated that HFD-fed mice displayed impairment in the electrical activity of dorsal raphe 5-HT neurons, attenuated hippocampal extracellular 5-HT concentrations and anxiety, one of the most visible and early symptoms of depression. On the contrary, Met stimulated 5-HT neurons excitability and 5-HT neurotransmission while hindering HFD-induced anxiety. Met also promoted antidepressant-like activities as observed with fluoxetine. In light of these data, we designed a modified HFD in which BCAA dietary supply was reduced by half. Deficiency in BCAAs failed to reverse HFD-induced metabolic impairments while producing antidepressant-like activity and enhancing the behavioral response to fluoxetine. Our results suggest that Met may act by decreasing circulating BCAAs levels to favor serotonergic neurotransmission in the hippocampus and promote antidepressant-like effects in mice fed an HFD. These findings also lead us to envision that a diet poor in BCAAs, provided either alone or as add-on therapy to conventional antidepressant drugs, could help to relieve depressive symptoms in patients with metabolic comorbidities.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Insulin resistance in humans is associated with increased risk of anxiodepressive disorders. Such a relationship has been also found in rodents fed a high-fat diet (HFD). To determine whether insulin-sensitizing strategies induce anxiolytic- and/or antidepressant-like activities and to investigate the underlying mechanisms, we tested the effects of metformin, an oral antidiabetic drug, in mice fed an HFD. Metformin reduced levels of circulating branched-chain amino acids, which regulate tryptophan uptake within the brain. Moreover, metformin increased hippocampal serotonergic neurotransmission while promoting anxiolytic- and antidepressant-like effects. Moreover, a diet poor in these amino acids produced similar beneficial behavioral property. Collectively, these results suggest that metformin could be used as add-on therapy to a conventional antidepressant for the comorbidity between metabolic and mental disorders.</p>

<p>The human PFC has been associated more with meta-perceptual as opposed to meta-memory decisions from correlational neuroimaging investigations. Recently, metacognitive abilities have also been shown to be causally dependent upon anterior and dorsal PFC in nonhuman primate lesion studies. Two studies, using postdecision wagering paradigms and reversible inactivation, challenged this meta-perceptual versus meta-memory notion and showed that dorsal and anterior prefrontal areas are associated with metamemory for experienced objects and awareness of ignorance, respectively. Causal investigations are important but scarce; nothing is known, for example, about the causal contributions of prefrontal subregions to spatial metamemory. Here, we investigated the effects of dorsal versus ventral PFC lesions on two-alternative forced-choice spatial discrimination tasks in male macaque monkeys. Importantly, we were rigorous in approach and applied three independent but complementary indices used to quantify individual animals' metacognitive ability ("Type II sensitivity") by two variants of <i>meta-d'/d'</i> and phi coefficient (). Our results were consistent across indices: while neither lesions to superior dorsolateral PFC nor orbitofrontal cortex impaired spatial recognition performance, only monkeys with superior dorsolateral PFC lesions were impaired in meta-accuracy. Together with the observation that the same orbitofrontal cortex lesioned monkeys were impaired in updating rule value in a Wisconsin Card Sorting Test analog, we therefore document a functional double-dissociation between these two PFC regions. Our study presents important causal evidence that other dimensions, namely, domain-specific processing (e.g., spatial vs nonspatial metamemory), also need considerations in understanding the functional specialization in the neural underpinnings of introspection.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> This study demonstrates macaque monkeys' metacognitive capability of introspecting its own memory success is causally dependent on intact superior dorsolateral prefrontal cortices but not the orbitofrontal cortices. Combining neurosurgical techniques on monkeys and state-of-the-art measures of metacognition, we affirm a critical role of the PFC in supporting spatial meta-recognition memory and delineate functional specificity within PFC for distinct elements of metacognition.</p>

<p>The speed of motor reaction to an external stimulus varies substantially between individuals and is slowed in aging. However, the neuroanatomical origins of interindividual variability in reaction time (RT) remain unclear. Here, we combined a cognitive model of RT and a biophysical compartment model of diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) to characterize the relationship between RT and microstructure of the corticospinal tract (CST) and the optic radiation (OR), the primary motor output and visual input pathways associated with visual-motor responses. We fitted an accumulator model of RT to 46 female human participants' behavioral performance in a simple reaction time task. The non-decision time parameter (<i>T</i><sub>er</sub>) derived from the model was used to account for the latencies of stimulus encoding and action initiation. From multi-shell DWI data, we quantified tissue microstructure of the CST and OR with the neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) model as well as the conventional diffusion tensor imaging model. Using novel skeletonization and segmentation approaches, we showed that DWI-based microstructure metrics varied substantially along CST and OR. The <i>T</i><sub>er</sub> of individual participants was negatively correlated with the NODDI measure of the neurite density in the bilateral superior CST. Further, we found no significant correlation between the microstructural measures and mean RT. Thus, our findings suggest a link between interindividual differences in sensorimotor speed and selective microstructural properties in white-matter tracts.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> How does our brain structure contribute to our speed to react? Here, we provided anatomically specific evidence that interindividual differences in response speed is associated with white-matter microstructure. Using a cognitive model of reaction time (RT), we estimated the non-decision time, as an index of the latencies of stimulus encoding and action initiation, during a simple reaction time task. Using an advanced microstructural model for diffusion MRI, we estimated the tissue properties and their variations along the corticospinal tract and optic radiation. We found significant location-specific correlations between the microstructural measures and the model-derived parameter of non-decision time but not mean RT. These results highlight the neuroanatomical signature of interindividual variability in response speed along the sensorimotor pathways.</p>

<p>The striatum comprises of multiple functional territories involved with multilevel control of behavior. Disinhibition of different functional territories leads to territory-specific hyperkinetic and hyperbehavioral symptoms. The ventromedial striatum, including the nucleus accumbens (NAc) core, is typically associated with limbic input but was historically linked to high-level motor control. In this study, performed in female Long–Evans rats, we show that the NAc core directly controls motor behavior on multiple timescales. On the macro-scale, following NAc disinhibition, the animals manifested prolonged hyperactivity, expressed as excessive normal behavior, whereas on the micro-scale multiple behavior transitions occurred, generating short movement segments. The underlying striatal network displayed population-based local field potential transient deflections (LFP spikes) whose rate determined the magnitude of the hyperactivity and whose timing corresponded to unitary behavioral transition events. Individual striatal neurons preserved normal baseline activity and network interactions following the disinhibition, maintaining the normal encoding of behavioral primitives and forming a sparse link between the LFP spikes and single neuron activity. Disinhibition of this classically limbic territory leads to profound motor changes resembling hyperactivity and attention deficit. These behavioral and neuronal results highlight the direct interplay on multiple timescales between different striatal territories during normal and pathological conditions.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is a key part of the striatal limbic territory. In the current study we show that this classically limbic area directly controls motor behavior on multiple timescales. Focal disinhibition of the NAc core in freely behaving rats led to macro-scale hyperactivity and micro-scale behavioral transitions, symptoms typically associated with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. The behavioral changes were encoded by the striatal LFP signal and single-unit spiking activity in line with the neuronal changes observed during tic expression following disinhibition of the striatal motor territory. These results point to the need to extend the existing parallel functional pathway concept of basal ganglia function to include the study of limbic-motor cross-territory interactions in both health and disease.</p>

<p>Rodents are the most commonly studied model system in neuroscience, but surprisingly few studies investigate the natural sensory stimuli that rodent nervous systems evolved to interpret. Even fewer studies examine neural responses to these natural stimuli. Decades of research have investigated the rat vibrissal (whisker) system in the context of direct touch and tactile stimulation, but recent work has shown that rats also use their whiskers to help detect and localize airflow. The present study investigates the neural basis for this ability as dictated by the mechanical response of whiskers to airflow. Mechanical experiments show that a whisker's vibration magnitude depends on airspeed and the intrinsic shape of the whisker. Surprisingly, the direction of the whisker's vibration changes as a function of airflow speed: vibrations transition from parallel to perpendicular with respect to the airflow as airspeed increases. Recordings from primary sensory trigeminal ganglion neurons show that these neurons exhibit responses consistent with those that would be predicted from direct touch. Trigeminal neuron firing rate increases with airspeed, is modulated by the orientation of the whisker relative to the airflow, and is influenced by the whisker's resonant frequencies. We develop a simple model to describe how a population of neurons could leverage mechanical relationships to decode both airspeed and direction. These results open new avenues for studying vibrissotactile regions of the brain in the context of evolutionarily important airflow-sensing behaviors and olfactory search. Although this study used only female rats, all results are expected to generalize to male rats.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The rodent vibrissal (whisker) system has been studied for decades in the context of direct tactile sensation, but recent work has indicated that rats also use whiskers to help localize airflow. Neural circuits in somatosensory regions of the rodent brain thus likely evolved in part to process airflow information. This study investigates the whiskers' mechanical response to airflow and the associated neural response. Airspeed affects the magnitude of whisker vibration and the response magnitude of whisker-sensitive primary sensory neurons in the trigeminal ganglion. Surprisingly, the direction of vibration and the associated directionally dependent neural response changes with airspeed. These findings suggest a population code for airflow speed and direction and open new avenues for studying vibrissotactile regions of the brain.</p>

<p>Columnar structure is a basic unit of the brain, but the mechanism underlying its development remains largely unknown. The medulla, the largest ganglion of the <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> visual center, provides a unique opportunity to reveal the mechanisms of 3D organization of the columns. In this study, using N-cadherin (Ncad) as a marker, we reveal the donut-like columnar structures along the 2D layer in the larval medulla that evolves to form three distinct layers in pupal development. Column formation is initiated by three core neurons, R8, R7, and Mi1, which establish distinct concentric domains within a column. We demonstrate that Ncad-dependent relative adhesiveness of the core columnar neurons regulates their relative location within a column along a 2D layer in the larval medulla according to the differential adhesion hypothesis. We also propose the presence of mutual interactions among the three layers during formation of the 3D structures of the medulla columns.</p>

<p>Neural circuit development involves the coordinated growth and guidance of axons. During this process, axons encounter many different cues, but how these cues are integrated and translated into growth is poorly understood. In this study, we report that receptor signaling does not follow a linear path but changes dependent on developmental stage and coreceptors involved. Using developing chicken embryos of both sexes, our data show that calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR), a G-protein-coupled receptor important for regulating calcium homeostasis, regulates neurite growth in two distinct ways. First, when signaling in isolation, CaSR promotes growth through the PI3-kinase-Akt pathway. At later developmental stages, CaSR enhances tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB)/BDNF-mediated neurite growth. This enhancement is facilitated through a switch in the signaling cascade downstream of CaSR (i.e., from the PI3-kinase-Akt pathway to activation of GSK3α Tyr279). TrkB and CaSR colocalize within late endosomes, cotraffic and coactivate GSK3, which serves as a shared signaling node for both receptors. Our study provides evidence that two unrelated receptors can integrate their individual signaling cascades toward a nonadditive effect and thus control neurite growth during development.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> This work highlights the effect of receptor coactivation and signal integration in a developmental setting. During embryonic development, neurites grow toward their targets guided by cues in the extracellular environment. These cues are sensed by receptors at the surface that trigger intracellular signaling events modulating the cytoskeleton. Emerging evidence suggests that the effects of guidance cues are diversified, therefore expanding the number of responses. Here, we show that two unrelated receptors can change the downstream signaling cascade and regulate neuronal growth through a shared signaling node. In addition to unraveling a novel signaling pathway in neurite growth, this research stresses the importance of receptor coactivation and signal integration during development of the nervous system.</p>

Abstract<p>Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the nervous system. GABA A receptors (GABA<sub>A</sub>R) are pentameric ionotropic channels. Subunit composition of the receptors is associated with the affinity of GABA binding and its downstream inhibitory actions. Fluctuations in subunit expression levels with increasing age have been demonstrated in animal and human studies. However, our knowledge regarding the age-related hippocampal GABA<sub>A</sub>R expression changes is limited and based on rat studies. This study is the first analysis of the aging-related changes of the GABA<sub>A</sub>R subunit expression in the CA1, CA2/3 and dentate gyrus (DG) regions of the mouse hippocampus. Utilizing Western blotting and immunohistochemistry we found that the GABAergic system is robust, with no significant age-related differences in GABA<sub>A</sub>R α1, α2, α3, α5, β3 and 2 subunit expression level differences found between the young (6 months) and old (21 months) age groups in any of the hippocampal regions examined. However, we detected a localized decrease of α2 subunit expression around the soma, proximal dendrites and in the axon initial segment of pyramidal cells in the CA1 and CA3 regions that is accompanied by a pronounced upregulation of the α2 subunit immunoreactivity in the neuropil of aged mice. In summary, GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs are well preserved in the mouse hippocampus during normal aging although GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs in the hippocampus are severely affected in age-related neurological disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease.</p><p><b>Significance statement</b> The current knowledge on GABAergic age-related alterations across different regions of the mouse brain is limited. These findings highlight that hippocampal GABA<sub>A</sub>R subunit composition and receptor function is well preserved in the hippocampus during normal aging in mice. Aging is the main risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease and other neurodegenerative disorders characterized by established remodeling of the hippocampal GABAergic system. Mice are frequently used as diseases models of aging, and the majority of the transgenic animal based research on neurodegenerative conditions has been conducted with mouse models, but the age-related GABA<sub>A</sub>R subunit expression changes have not been examined in the mouse brain. Therefore, studies like this are necessary to understand the importance of age in study design and interpretation of results.</p>

<p>Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) type 0 is the most severe form of SMA, associated with the <i>SMN1</i> gene and manifesting at birth. Most patients die in the first weeks of life. In this work, we present 3 patients with SMA type 0 who survived &gt;1 year and presented diffuse and progressive brain abnormalities on magnetic resonance imaging, which are not usually seen in patients with SMA. Thus, severe brain involvement may likely be the full end manifestation of an already extreme SMA phenotype caused by substantial reduction of the SMN protein in the brain. ANN NEUROL 2019</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2019.00031">The Role of Top-Down Modulation in Shaping Sensory Processing Across Brain States: Implications for Consciousness</a></h4>

Top-down, feedback projections account for a large portion of all connections between neurons in the thalamocortical system, yet their precise role remains the subject of much discussion. A large number of studies has focused on investigating how sensory information is transformed across hierarchically-distributed processing stages in a feedforward fashion, and computational models have shown that purely feedforward artificial neural networks can even outperform humans in pattern classification tasks. What is then the functional role of feedback connections? Several key roles have been identified, ranging from attentional modulation to, crucially, conscious perception. Specifically, most of the major theories on consciousness postulate that feedback connections would play an essential role in enabling sensory information to be consciously perceived. Consequently, it follows that their efficacy in modulating target regions should drastically decrease in nonconscious brain states (non-REM sleep, anesthesia) compared to conscious ones (wakefulness), and also in instances when a given sensory stimulus is not perceived compared to when it is. Until recently, however, this prediction could only be tested with correlative experiments, due to the lack of techniques to selectively manipulate and measure the activity of feedback pathways. In this paper we will review the most recent literature on the functions of feedback connections across brain states and based on the presence or absence of perception. We will focus on experiments studying mismatch negativity, a phenomenon which has been hypothesized to rely on top-down modulation but which persists during nonconscious states. While feedback modulation is generally dampened in nonconscious states and enhanced when perception occurs, there are clear deviations from this rule. As we will discuss, this may pose a challenge to most theories of consciousness, and possibly require a change in how the level of consciousness in supposedly nonconscious states is assessed.

The numbers and strengths of synapses in the brain change throughout development, and even into adulthood, as synaptic inputs are added, eliminated, and refined in response to ongoing neural activity. A number of experimental techniques can assess these changes, including single- cell electrophysiological recording which offers measurements of synaptic inputs with high temporal resolution. Coupled with electrical stimulation, photoactivatable opsins, and caged compounds, to facilitate fine spatiotemporal control over release of neurotransmitters, electrophysiological recordings allow for precise dissection of presynaptic and postsynaptic mechanisms of action. Here, we discuss the strengths and pitfalls of various techniques commonly used to analyze synapses, including miniature excitatory/inhibitory postsynaptic currents, evoked release, and optogenetic stimulation. Together, these techniques can provide multiple lines of convergent evidence to generate meaningful insight into the emergence of circuit connectivity and maturation. A full understanding of potential caveats and alternative explanations for findings is essential to avoid data misinterpretation.

To evaluate the contribution of the DNA methylation and DNA demethylation pathways in retinal development, we studied DNA methylation in retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) and retinal neurons using a combination of whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) data obtained in our study and WGBS data collected from previous studies. The data was analyzed using Hidden Markov Model- and change point-based methods to identify methylome states in different segments of the studied genomes following genome annotation. We found that promoters of rod and cone phototransduction genes and rod photoreceptor genes, but not genes required for the development and function of other retinal phenotypes, were highly methylated in DNA isolated from human and murine fetal retinas (which mostly contain RPCs) and postnatal murine RPCs. While these highly methylated genomic regions were inherited by non-photoreceptor phenotypes during RPC differentiation, the methylation of these promoters was significantly reduced during RPC differentiation into photoreceptors and accompanied by increased expression of these genes. Our analysis of DNA methylation during embryogenesis revealed low methylation levels in genomic regions containing photoreceptor genes at the inner cell mass stage, but a sharp increase in methylation at the epiblast stage, which remained the same later on (except for DNA demethylation in photoreceptors). Thus, our data suggest that the DNA demethylation pathway is required for photoreceptor phenotypes in the developing retina. Meanwhile, the role of the DNA methylation and DNA demethylation pathways during RPC differentiation into non-photoreceptor retinal phenotypes might be less important.

Status epilepticus (SE, a prolonged seizure activity) leads to reactive astrogliosis and astroglial apoptosis in the regional specific manners, independent of hemodynamics. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP1) activity is relevant to these distinct astroglial responses. Since various regulatory signaling molecules beyond PARP1 activity may be involved in the distinct astroglial response to SE, it is noteworthy to explore the roles of protein kinases in PARP1-mediated reactive astrogliosis and astroglial apoptosis following SE, albeit at a lesser extent. In the present study, inhibitions of protein kinase C (PKC), AKT and extracellular signal-related kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2), but not calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), attenuated CA1 reactive astrogliosis accompanied by reducing PARP1 activity following SE, respectively. However, inhibition of AKT and ERK1/2 deteriorated SE-induced dentate astroglial loss concomitant with the diminished PARP1 activity. Following SE, PKC- and AKT inhibitors diminished phosphoprotein enriched in astrocytes of 15 kDa (PEA15)-S104 and -S116 phosphorylations in CA1 astrocytes, but not in dentate astrocytes, respectively. Inhibitors of PKC, AKT and ERK1/2 also abrogated SE-induced nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)-S311 and -S468 phosphorylations in CA1 astrocytes. In contrast, both AKT and ERK1/2 inhibitors enhanced NF-κB-S468 phosphorylation in dentate astrocytes. Furthermore, PARP1 inhibitor aggravated dentate astroglial loss following SE. AKT inhibition deteriorated dentate astroglial loss and led to CA1 astroglial apoptosis following SE, which were ameliorated by AKT activation. These findings suggest that activities of PARP1, PEA15 and NF-κB may be distinctly regulated by PKC, AKT and ERK1/2, which may be involved in regional specific astroglial responses following SE.

α5 subunit containing GABA type A receptors (GABAARs) have long been an enigmatic receptor subtype of interest due to their specific brain distribution, unusual surface localization and key role in synaptic plasticity, cognition and memory. These receptors are uniquely positioned to sculpt both the developing and mature hippocampal circuitry due to high overall expression and a distinct peak during the critical synapse formation period during the second postnatal week. Unlike the majority of other GABAARs, they exhibit both receptor clustering at extrasynaptic sites via interactions with the radixin scaffold as well as synaptic sites via gephyrin, thus contributing respectively to tonic currents and synaptic GABAergic neurotransmission. α5 GABAAR signaling can be altered in neurodevelopmental disorders including autism and mental retardation and by inflammation in CNS injury and disease. Due to the unique physiology and pharmacology of α5 GABAARs, drugs targeting these receptors are being developed and tested as treatments for neurodevelopmental disorders, depression, schizophrenia, and mild cognitive impairment. This review focuses on advances in understanding how the α5 subunit contributes to GABAAR neurobiology. In particular I discuss both recent insights and remaining knowledge gaps for the functional role of these receptors, pathologies associated with α5 GABAAR dysfunction, and the effects and potential therapeutic uses of α5 receptor subtype targeted drugs.

In the present study, we conducted microarray gene expression profiling to explore the direction of differentiation of human amnion epithelial cells (hAECs) treated with rosmarinic acid (RA).  hAECs have several clinical advantages over other types of stem cells, including availability, low immunogenicity, low rejection rate, nontumorigenecity, and less ethical constraint. On the other hand, RA is a phenolic compound having several health benefits, including neuroprotective and antidepressant-like activities. In this study, hAECs were isolated from discarded term placenta and were treated with 20 μM RA for seven days. Microarray gene expression profiling was conducted for three biological replicates of RA-treated and untreated control cells on day 0 and day 7. Gene set enrichment analysis, and gene annotation and pathway analysis were conducted using online data mining tools GSEA and DAVID. Gene expression profiling showed that RA treatment biased hAECs towards ectodermal lineage progression, regulated transcription factors involved in neuronal differentiation, regulated neural specific epigenetic modifiers and several extracellular signaling pathways of neural induction, and significantly inhibited Notch signaling pathway. Gene expression profiling of RA-treated hAECs reveals for the first time a potential role of RA in neural induction and neuronal differentiation of hAECs. Having a naturally occurring compound as differentiation inducer as well as a readily available source of stem cells would have great advantages for the cell-based therapies. Findings from our genome-wide analysis could provide a foundation for further in-depth investigation.

There is a pressing need to further our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the depression symptoms in patients with post-stroke depression (PSD) in order to inform targeted therapeutic approaches. While previous research has demonstrated a reorganization in the functional brain network of PSD, it remains uncertain whether or not it also occurs in the structural brain network. We therefore aim to investigate the structural brain network of patients with PSD as compared to post-stroke non-depression (PSND) patients. In addition, our research considers the relationship between network metrics and functional measurements. Thirty-one PSD patients and twenty-three PSND patients were recruited. All patients underwent MRI and functional assessments, including the Barthel Index, Mini-Mental State Examination, and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD). Diffusion tensor imaging was used to construct the structural brain network and to conduct the subsequent graph theoretical analysis. Network measures were computed and compared between PSD and PSND patients. Associations between functional assessments and network measures were studied as well. We successfully detected increased global and local efficiency in patients with PSD. Regions with disrupted local connections were located primarily in the cognitive and limbic systems. More importantly, PSD patients’ global and regional network measures were associated with depression severity, as measured by HAMD. These findings suggest that disrupted global and local network topologies might contribute to PSD patients’ depression symptoms. Therefore, connectome-based network measures could be potential bio-markers for evaluating stroke patients’ depression levels.

Recent studies have demonstrated the close relationship between the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and resting state functional connectivity changes in the normal healthy people. However, little is known about the different parameters changes of the most vulnerable regions in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, we collected resting-state perfusion and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data including 40 AD patients and 30 healthy controls. By using voxel wise arterial spin labeling (ASL) perfusion, we firstly identified several regions of the altered rCBF in the AD patients. And then, by using resting state fMRI analysis including amplitude low frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and seed based functional connectivity, we explored the changes of the functional activities and connectivities based on the identified rCBF regions. We extracted the cognitive related parameters and search for the sensitive biomarker to differentiate the AD and normal controls. As the results, compared with controls, the AD patients showed distinct disruption of rCBF, which were mainly located in the left posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), left and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), left inferior parietal lobule (IPL), right middle temporal gyrus (MTG), left middle occipital gyrus (MOG), and left precuneus (PCu). ALFF was performed based on the seven regions identified by the ASL method, AD patients showed significantly decreased ALFF in left PCC, left IPL, right MTG, left MOG, and left PCu and increased ALFF in the bilateral DLPFC. We constitute the network based on the seven regions and found the decreased connectivity among the identified regions in the AD patients, predicting to the disruption of the default mode network (DMN), executive control network (ECN) and visual network (VN). Furthermore, these abnormal parameters are closely correlated with cognitive performances in the AD patients. We combined the rCBF and ALFF value of PCC/PCu as biomarker to differciate the two groups and reached the sensitivity of 85.3% and speciﬁcity of 88.5%. Conclusively, our findings suggested that disrupted regional cerebral blood flow, functional activity and connectivity in specific cognitive related regions in Alzheimer’s disease, which can be used as the valuable imaging biomarker for the diagnosis of AD.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00728">Re-thinking the Etiological Framework of Neurodegeneration</a></h4>

Neurodegenerative diseases are among the leading causes of disability and death worldwide. The disease-related socioeconomic burden is expected to increase with the steadily increasing life expectancy. In spite of decades of clinical and basic research, most strategies designed to manage degenerative brain diseases are palliative. This is not surprising as neurodegeneration progresses “silently” for decades before symptoms are noticed. Importantly, conceptual models with heuristic value used to study neurodegeneration have been constructed retrospectively, based on signs and symptoms already present in affected patients; a circumstance that may confound causes and consequences. Hence, innovative, paradigm-shifting views of the etiology of these diseases are necessary to enable their timely prevention and treatment.
Here, we outline four alternative views, not mutually exclusive, on different etiological paths towards neurodegeneration. First, we propose neurodegeneration as being a secondary outcome of a primary cardiovascular cause with vascular pathology disrupting the vital homeostatic interactions between the vasculature and the brain resulting in cognitive impairment, dementia, and cerebrovascular events such as stroke. Second, we suggest that the persistence of senescent cells in neuronal circuits may favor, together with systemic metabolic diseases, neurodegeneration to occur. Third, we argue that neurodegeneration may start in response to altered body and brain trophic interactions established via the hardwire that connects peripheral targets with central neuronal structures or by means of extracellular vesicle-mediated communication. Lastly, we elaborate on how lifespan body dysbiosis may be linked to the origin of neurodegeneration. We highlight the existence of bacterial products that modulate the gut-brain axis causing neuroinflammation and neuronal dysfunction.
As a concluding section, we end by recommending research avenues to investigate these etiological paths in the future. This think that this requires an integrated, interdisciplinary conceptual research approach based on the investigation of multimodal aspects of physiology and pathophysiology. It involves utilizing proper conceptual models, experimental animal units, and identifying currently unused opportunities derived from human data. Overall, the proposed etiological paths and experimental recommendations will be important guidelines for future cross-discipline research to overcome the translational roadblock and to develop causative treatments for neurodegenerative diseases.

Abstract
Background and objective: Low Intensity Transcranial Ultrasound Stimulation (TUS) is a new form of non-invasive brain modulation with promising data; however, systematic reviews on the brain modulatory effects of TUS on both animals and humans have not been well conducted. We aimed to conduct a systematic review on the studies using the TUS to modulate the brain functions and associated behavioral changes in both animals and humans. 
Methods: A literature search for published studies in the past 10 years was conducted. Two authors independently reviewed the relevant articles. Data were extracted and qualitatively summarized. Quality of studies was assessed by the SYRCLE’s risk of bias tool for preclinical studies or PEDro scale for clinical studies. 
Results: A total of 24 animal studies (506 animals) and 11 human studies (213 subjects) were included. Findings based on most animal studies demonstrated the excitatory or suppressive modulatory effects of ultrasonic stimulations on motor cortex, somatosensory cortex, thalamus, prefrontal cortex, auditory and visual areas. Brain modulatory effects also were found among healthy human subjects in seven studies and two clinical studies suggested TUS may result in potential benefits on patients with disorder of consciousness or chronic pain. The safety concerns of TUS seem to be minor based on the human studies. 
Conclusions: TUS appears to be a viable technique in modulating the brain functions; however, research on TUS is still in its early stages, especially in human studies. Parameters need to be optimized before launching systematic investigations in humans.

Aim: To assess changes in the developmental trajectory of corticospinal tracts maturation in children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy (HCP). 
Methods: Neuroimaging data were obtained from 36 children with HCP for both the more affected and less affected hemispheres, and, for purposes of direct comparison, between groups, 15 typically developing children. With diffusion tensor imaging, we estimated the mean fractional anisotropy, axial diffusivity, mean diffusivity, and radial diffusivity of the corticospinal tract, parameters indicative of factors including myelination and axon density. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was performed as a neurophysiologic measure of corticospinal tract integrity and organization. Resting motor threshold was obtained per hemisphere, per patient.
Results: We observed a significant axial diffusivity and mean diffusivity developmental trajectory, both of which were inversely related to age (decrease in axial diffusivity and diffusivity corresponding to increased age) in both hemispheres of typically developing children (p&lt;0.001). This maturation process was absent in both more affected and less affected hemispheres of children with HCP. Additionally, the TMS-derived previously established resting motor threshold developmental trajectory was preserved in the less affected hemisphere of children with HCP (n=26; p&lt;0.0001) but this trajectory was absent in the more affected hemisphere. 
Conclusions: Corticospinal tract maturation arrests in both hemispheres of children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy, possibly reflecting perinatal disruption of corticospinal tract myelination and axonal integrity.

Transplantation of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) is a promising therapy for ischemic stroke. Previously, we had reported that the secondary degeneration occurred in the ipsilateral substantia nigra (SN) after permanent distal branch of middle cerebral artery occlusion (dMCAO) in Sprague-Dawley rats. However, whether BMSCs have neurorestorative effects on the secondary damage in the SN after focal cerebral infarction has not known. In this study, rats were subjected to dMCAO followed by intravenous administration of BMSCs 1 day later. We found that transplanted BMSCs survived and migrated to cortical infarct areas and ipsilateral SN. Furthermore, BMSCs promoted neurogenesis through proliferation and differentiation in the SN after dMCAO. Rats implanted with BMSCs showed significant improvement in their performance of modified neurological severity scores and adhesive-removal test. Engrafted BMSCs enhanced survival of dopaminergic neuron, reduced gliosis in the ipsilateral SN, and increased contents of dopamine (DA) and its metabolites in the ipsilateral striatum after dMCAO. With pseudorabies virus-152 as a retrograde tracer, we also demonstrated that BMSCs could effectively enhance the cortico-striatum-nigral connections. These results suggest that BMSCs transplantation exerts neurorestorative effects after cortical infarction through promoting endogenous neurogenesis, increasing contents of DA and its metabolites, alleviating the secondary neuronal damage in the SN, enhancing the cortico-striatum-nigral projections pathway, and finally improving the neurological functional outcome.

Restoration of neuronal connectivity after lesion of the central nervous system, such as spinal cord injury, is one of the biggest challenges in modern medicine. In particular, the accumulation of axon growth inhibitory factors at the site of injury constitutes a major obstacle to structural and thus functional repair. We previously investigated a group of prenylflavonoids derived from hops for their capacity to promote neuroregeneration and identified a molecule called ENDF1 that was very potent to enhance regrowth and branching of neurites from dorsal root ganglion neurons in culture on growth promoting substrates. In the present study, we investigated ENDF1's capacity to promote regeneration of rat dorsal root ganglion neurons in vitro in the presence of three main components of the extracellular matrix acting as axon growth inhibitors: Semaphorin3A, EphrinA4 and mixed chondroitin sulphate proteoglycans. We report that ENDF1 application significantly promoted the percentages of sensory neurons able to regrow their neurites regardless of the presence of those inhibitors, and this to an extent similar to the one obtained after NGF treatment. Moreover, ENDF1 strongly enhanced the total neurite length and the complexity of neurites extending from neurons challenged with axon growth inhibitors. Importantly, although the impact of NGF and ENDF1 on the regeneration of neurons was similar, the regenerative activity of ENDF1 was not compromised by an inhibitor of the NGF receptor TrkA (GW441756), indicating that ENDF1 and NGF act through different signaling pathways.

Here, we describe a cost-effective setup for targeted photoconversion of fluorescent signals into electron dense ones. This approach has offered invaluable insights in the morphology and function of fine neuronal structures. The technique relies on the localised oxidation of diaminobenzidine (DAB) mediated by excited fluorophores. This paper includes a detailed description of how to build a simple photoconversion setup that can increase reliability and throughput of this well-established technique. The system described here, is particularly well-suited for thick neuronal tissue, where light penetration and oxygen diffusion may be limiting DAB oxidation. To demonstrate the system, we use Correlative Light and Electron Microscopy (CLEM) to visualise functionally-labelled individual synaptic vesicles released onto an identified layer 5 neuron in an acute cortical slice. The setup significantly simplifies the photoconversion workflow, increasing the depth of photoillumination, improving the targeting of the region of interest and reducing the time required to process each individual samples. We have tested this setup extensively for the photoconversion of FM 1-43FXand Lucifer Yellowboth excited at 473nm. In principle, the system can be adapted to any dye or nanoparticle able to oxidize DAB when excited by a specific light wavelength.

Background: To study the extent that neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) influence the cognitive and functional decline in frontotemporal degeneration (FTD) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). 
Methods: We assessed the progression of NPS and their influence on cognitive and functional progression in a group of FTD [n=36] and AD patients [n=47] at two different stages of the disease (2.5 years). A standardized scale was used to assess NPS - Columbia University Scale for Psychopathology in Alzheimer’s Disease (CUSPAD), which tracks different symptoms including depression, psychotic symptoms, as well as sleep, and conduct problems. In addition, in a subsample of patients (AD n=14 and FTD n= 14), we analyzed another group of NPS by using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). Cognitive declines were tracked by using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), the Mini-mental state examination (MMSE); and functionality was tracked by using the Lawton scale and the Barthel Index. 
Results: The presence of NPS impacts cognitive and functional decline in both groups of patients 2.5 years after disease onset. However, we observed a dissociable profile of the affectation of NPS in each group. In the AD group, results indicate that the progression of depressive symptoms and sleep problems predict cognitive and functional decline. In contrast, the progression of a mixed group of NPS including conduct problems and delusions predict cognitive and functional decline in FTD. 
Conclusion: The presence of NPS have a critical impact on the prediction of cognitive decline in FTD and AD patients after 2.5 years of disease progression. Our results demonstrate the importance of assessing different types of NPS in neurodegenerative disorders which in turn, predict disease progression.  Future studies should assess the role of NPS in predicting different neurocognitive pathways and in neurodegeneration.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Maternal depression is associated with disrupted neurodevelopment in offspring. This study examined relationships among postnatal maternal depressive symptoms, the functional reward network and behavioral problems in 4.5-year-old boys (57) and girls (65). We employed canonical correlation analysis to evaluate whether the resting-state functional connectivity within a reward network, identified through an activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis of fMRI studies, was associated with postnatal maternal depressive symptoms and child behaviors. The functional reward network consisted of three subnetworks, that is, the mesolimbic, mesocortical, and amygdala–hippocampus reward subnetworks. Postnatal maternal depressive symptoms were associated with the functional connectivity of the mesocortical subnetwork with the mesolimbic and amygdala–hippocampus complex subnetworks in girls and with the functional connectivity within the mesocortical subnetwork in boys. The functional connectivity of the amygdala–hippocampus subnetwork with the mesocortical and mesolimbic subnetworks was associated with both internalizing and externalizing problems in girls, while in boys, the functional connectivity of the mesocortical subnetwork with the amygdala–hippocampus complex and the mesolimbic subnetworks was associated with the internalizing and externalizing problems, respectively. Our findings suggest that the functional reward network might be a promising neural phenotype for effects of maternal depression and potential intervention to nurture child behavioral development.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Seeing familiar faces prompts the recall of diverse kinds of person-related knowledge. How this information is encoded within the well-characterized face-/person-selective network remains an outstanding question. In this functional magnetic resonance imaging study, participants rated famous faces in 10 tasks covering 5 domains of person knowledge (social, episodic, semantic, physical, and nominal). Comparing different cognitive domains enabled us to 1) test the relative roles of brain regions in specific cognitive processes and 2) apply a multivariate network-level representational similarity analysis (NetRSA) to gain insight into underlying system-level organization. Comparing across cognitive domains revealed the importance of multiple domains in most regions, the importance of social over nominal knowledge in the anterior temporal lobe, and the functional subdivision of the temporoparietal junction into perceptual superior temporal sulcus and knowledge-related angular gyrus. NetRSA revealed a strong divide between regions implicated in ``default-mode” cognition and the fronto-lateral elements that coordinated more with ``core” perceptual components (fusiform/occipital face areas and posterior superior temporal sulcus). NetRSA also revealed a taxonomy of cognitive processes, with semantic retrieval being more similar to episodic than nominal knowledge. Collectively, these results illustrate the importance of coordinated activity of the person knowledge network in the instantiation of the diverse cognitive capacities of this system.</span>

The physiological functions of astrocytes within neural circuits remain incompletely understood. There has been progress in this regard from recent work on striatal astrocytes, where detailed studies are emerging. In this review, findings on striatal astrocyte identity, form, and function, are summarized with a focus on how astrocytes regulate striatal neurons, circuits, and behavior. Specific features of striatal astrocytes are highlighted to illustrate how they may be specialized to regulate medium spiny neurons (MSNs) by responding to, and altering, excitation and inhibition.

<p>by Paul A. Roberts, Ryan M. Huebinger, Emma Keen, Anne-Marie Krachler, Sara Jabbari</p>

As antimicrobial resistance increases, it is crucial to develop new treatment strategies to counter the emerging threat. In this paper, we consider combination therapies involving conventional antibiotics and debridement, coupled with a novel anti-adhesion therapy, and their use in the treatment of antimicrobial resistant burn wound infections. Our models predict that anti-adhesion–antibiotic–debridement combination therapies can eliminate a bacterial infection in cases where each treatment in isolation would fail. Antibiotics are assumed to have a bactericidal mode of action, killing bacteria, while debridement involves physically cleaning a wound (e.g. with a cloth); removing free bacteria. Anti-adhesion therapy can take a number of forms. Here we consider adhesion inhibitors consisting of polystyrene microbeads chemically coupled to a protein known as multivalent adhesion molecule 7, an adhesin which mediates the initial stages of attachment of many bacterial species to host cells. Adhesion inhibitors competitively inhibit bacteria from binding to host cells, thus rendering them susceptible to removal through debridement. An ordinary differential equation model is developed and the antibiotic-related parameters are fitted against new <i>in vitro</i> data gathered for the present study. The model is used to predict treatment outcomes and to suggest optimal treatment strategies. Our model predicts that anti-adhesion and antibiotic therapies will combine synergistically, producing a combined effect which is often greater than the sum of their individual effects, and that anti-adhesion–antibiotic–debridement combination therapy will be more effective than any of the treatment strategies used in isolation. Further, the use of inhibitors significantly reduces the minimum dose of antibiotics required to eliminate an infection, reducing the chances that bacteria will develop increased resistance. Lastly, we use our model to suggest treatment regimens capable of eliminating bacterial infections within clinically relevant timescales.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/SQI4Hedh_e8" width="1" />

<p>by Enrico Seiler, Kathrin Trappe, Bernhard Y. Renard</p>

Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) has changed the way we regard evolution. Instead of waiting for the next generation to establish new traits, especially bacteria are able to take a shortcut via HGT that enables them to pass on genes from one individual to another, even across species boundaries. The tool Daisy offers the first HGT detection approach based on read mapping that provides complementary evidence compared to existing methods. However, Daisy relies on the acceptor and donor organism involved in the HGT being known. We introduce DaisyGPS, a mapping-based pipeline that is able to identify acceptor and donor reference candidates of an HGT event based on sequencing reads. Acceptor and donor identification is akin to species identification in metagenomic samples based on sequencing reads, a problem addressed by metagenomic profiling tools. However, acceptor and donor references have certain properties such that these methods cannot be directly applied. DaisyGPS uses MicrobeGPS, a metagenomic profiling tool tailored towards estimating the genomic distance between organisms in the sample and the reference database. We enhance the underlying scoring system of MicrobeGPS to account for the sequence patterns in terms of mapping coverage of an acceptor and donor involved in an HGT event, and report a ranked list of reference candidates. These candidates can then be further evaluated by tools like Daisy to establish HGT regions. We successfully validated our approach on both simulated and real data, and show its benefits in an investigation of an outbreak involving Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus data.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/efbsFNCMjHE" width="1" />

<p>by Madhura R. Joglekar, Logan Chariker, Robert Shapley, Lai-Sang Young</p>

Neuroscience models come in a wide range of scales and specificity, from mean-field rate models to large-scale networks of spiking neurons. There are potential trade-offs between simplicity and realism, versatility and computational speed. This paper is about large-scale cortical network models, and the question we address is one of scalability: would scaling down cell density impact a network’s ability to reproduce cortical dynamics and function? We investigated this problem using a previously constructed realistic model of the monkey visual cortex that is true to size. Reducing cell density gradually up to 50-fold, we studied changes in model behavior. Size reduction without parameter adjustment was catastrophic. Surprisingly, relatively minor compensation in synaptic weights guided by a theoretical algorithm restored mean firing rates and basic function such as orientation selectivity to models 10-20 times smaller than the real cortex. Not all was normal in the reduced model cortices: intracellular dynamics acquired a character different from that of real neurons, and while the ability to relay feedforward inputs remained intact, reduced models showed signs of deficiency in functions that required dynamical interaction among cortical neurons. These findings are not confined to models of the visual cortex, and modelers should be aware of potential issues that accompany size reduction. Broader implications of this study include the importance of homeostatic maintenance of firing rates, and the functional consequences of feedforward versus recurrent dynamics, ideas that may shed light on other species and on systems suffering cell loss.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/pIYdVbiLCUQ" width="1" />

<p>by Bhavin S. Khatri, Richard A. Goldstein</p>

Developmental system drift is a likely mechanism for the origin of hybrid incompatibilities between closely related species. We examine here the detailed mechanistic basis of hybrid incompatibilities between two allopatric lineages, for a genotype-phenotype map of developmental system drift under stabilising selection, where an organismal phenotype is conserved, but the underlying molecular phenotypes and genotype can drift. This leads to number of emergent phenomenon not obtainable by modelling genotype or phenotype alone. Our results show that: 1) speciation is more rapid at smaller population sizes with a characteristic, Orr-like, power law, but at large population sizes slow, characterised by a sub-diffusive growth law; 2) the molecular phenotypes under weakest selection contribute to the earliest incompatibilities; and 3) pair-wise incompatibilities dominate over higher order, contrary to previous predictions that the latter should dominate. The population size effect we find is consistent with previous results on allopatric divergence of transcription factor-DNA binding, where smaller populations have common ancestors with a larger drift load because genetic drift favours phenotypes which have a larger number of genotypes (higher sequence entropy) over more fit phenotypes which have far fewer genotypes; this means less substitutions are required in either lineage before incompatibilities arise. Overall, our results indicate that biophysics and population size provide a much stronger constraint to speciation than suggested by previous models, and point to a general mechanistic principle of how incompatibilities arise the under stabilising selection for an organismal phenotype.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/LCizs-nbjwE" width="1" />

Cortical synapse organization supports a range of dynamic states on multiple spatial and temporal scales, from synchronous slow wave activity (SWA), characteristic of deep sleep or anesthesia, to fluctuating, asynchronous activity during wakefulness (AW). Such dynamic diversity poses a challenge for producing efficient large-scale simulations that embody realistic metaphors of short- and long-range synaptic connectivity. In fact, during SWA and AW different spatial extents of the cortical tissue are active in a given timespan and at different levels, which implies a wide variety of loads of local computation and communication. A balanced evaluation of simulation performance and robustness should therefore include tests of a variety of cortical dynamic states. Here, we demonstrate performance scaling of our proprietary Distributed and Plastic Spiking Neural Networks (DPSNN) simulation engine in both SWA and AW for bi-dimensional grids of neural populations, which reflects the modular organization of the cortex. We explored networks up to 192x192 modules, each composed of 1250 integrate-and-fire neurons with spike-frequency adaptation, and exponentially decaying inter-modular synaptic connectivity with varying spatial decay constant. For the largest networks the total number of synapses was over 70 billion. The execution platform included up to 64 dual-socket nodes, each socket mounting 8 Intel Xeon Haswell processor cores @ 2.40GHz clock. Network initialization time, memory usage, and execution times showed good scaling performances from 1 to 1024 processes, implemented using the standard Message Passing Interface (MPI) protocol. We achieved simulation speeds of between 2.3x10^9 and 4.1x10^9 synaptic events per second for both cortical states in the explored range of inter-modular interconnections.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00173">Developmental Regulation of KCC2 Phosphorylation Has Long-Term Impacts on Cognitive Function</a></h4>

GABAA receptor-mediated currents shift from excitatory to inhibitory during postnatal brain development in rodents. A postnatal increase in KCC2 protein expression is considered to be the sole mechanism controlling the developmental onset of hyperpolarizing synaptic transmission, but here we identify a key role for KCC2 phosphorylation in the developmental EGABA shift. Preventing phosphorylation of KCC2 in vivo at either residue serine 940 (S940), or at residues threonine 906 and threonine 1007 (T906/T1007), delayed or accelerated the postnatal onset of KCC2 function, respectively. Several models of neurodevelopmental disorders including Rett syndrome, Fragile X and Down’s syndrome exhibit delayed postnatal onset of hyperpolarizing GABAergic inhibition, but whether the timing of the onset of hyperpolarizing synaptic inhibition during development plays a role in establishing adulthood cognitive function is unknown; we have used the distinct KCC2-S940A and KCC2-T906A/T1007A knock-in mouse models to address this issue. Altering KCC2 function resulted in long-term abnormalities in social behavior and memory retention. Tight regulation of KCC2 phosphorylation is therefore required for the typical timing of the developmental onset of hyperpolarizing synaptic inhibition, and it plays a fundamental role in the regulation of adulthood cognitive function.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2019.00032">The Role of Neuronal Oscillations in Visual Active Sensing</a></h4>

Visual perception is most often studied as a “passive” process in which an observer fixates steadily at point in space so that stimuli can be delivered to the system with spatial precision. Analysis of neuronal signals related to vision is generally keyed to stimulus onset, stimulus movement, etc.; i.e., events external to the observer. In natural “active” vision however, information is systematically acquired by using eye movements including rapid (saccadic) eye movements, as well as smooth ocular pursuit of moving objects and slower drifts. Here we consider the use of alternating saccades and fixations to gather information from a visual scene. In this Perspective we note that active saccadic sampling behavior imposes robust temporal patterning on the activity of neuron ensembles and large-scale neural dynamics throughout the brain’s visual pathways whose mechanistic effects on information processing are not yet fully understood. The spatio-temporal sequence of eye movements elicits a succession of temporally predictable quasi-rhythmic sensory inputs, whose encoding is enhanced by entrainment of low frequency oscillations to the rate of eye movements. Review of the pertinent findings underscores the fact that temporal coordination between motor and visual cortices is critical for understanding neural dynamics of active vision and posits that phase entrainment of neuronal oscillations plays a mechanistic role in this process.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00767">Delayed Effects of Acute Reperfusion on Vascular Remodeling and Late-Phase Functional Recovery After Stroke</a></h4>

Tissue perfusion is a necessary condition for vessel survival that can be compromised under ischemic conditions. Following stroke, delayed effects of early brain reperfusion on the vascular substrate necessary for remodelling, perfusion and maintenance of proper peri-lesional hemodynamics are unknown. Such aspects of ischemic injury progression may be critical for neurological recovery in stroke patients. This study aims to describe the impact of early, non-thrombolytic reperfusion on the vascular brain component and its potential contribution to tissue remodelling and long-term functional recovery beyond the acute phase after stroke in 3-month-old male C57bl/6 mice.  Permanent (pMCAO) and transient (60 min, tMCAO) brain ischemia mouse models were used for characterizing the effect of early, non-thrombolytic reperfusion on the brain vasculature. Analysis of different vascular parameters (vessel density, proliferation, degeneration and perfusion) revealed that, while early middle cerebral artery recanalisation was not sufficient to prevent sub-acute vascular degeneration within the ischemic brain regions, brain reperfusion promoted a secondary wave of vascular remodelling in the peri-lesional regions, which led to improved perfusion of the ischemic boundaries and late-phase neurological recovery.  This study concluded that acute, non-thrombolytic artery recanalisation following stroke favours late-phase vascular remodelling and improves peri-lesional perfusion, contributing to secondary functional recovery.

Paraffin embedding is widely used in microscopic imaging for preparing biological specimens. However, owing to significant fluorescence quenching during the embedding process, it is not compatible with fluorescent-labeling techniques, such as transgenic and viral labeling using green fluorescent protein (GFP). Here we investigated the quenching mechanism and optimized the embedding process to improve the preservation of fluorescence intensity. The results showed that dehydration is the main reason of fluorescence quenching during paraffin embedding, caused by full denaturation of GFP molecules in ethyl alcohol. To evaluate fluorescent and morphological preservation, we modified the embedding process using tertiary butanol (TBA) instead of ethyl alcohol. Fluorescence intensity following TBA dehydration increased 12.08-fold of that observed in the traditional method. We obtained uniform fluorescence maintenance throughout the whole mouse brain, while the continuous apical dendrites, spines, and axon terminals were shown evenly within the cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala. Moreover, we embedded a whole rat brain labeled with AAV in the prelimbic cortex (Prl). With the axon terminals in different areas, such as the caudate putamen, thalamus, and pyramidal tract, the results showed a continuous tract of Prl neurons throughout the whole brain. Meanwhile, this method was suitable to tdTomota labeled samples. These findings indicated this modified embedding method could be compatible with GFP and provides a potential turning point for applications in the fluorescent labeling of samples.

Objective: To investigate the potential regional homogeneity (ReHo) brain activity changes in patients with corneal ulcer (CU) and their possible relationship with clinical symptoms. 
Materials and methods: 40 patients with CU (26 men and 14 women), and 40 healthy controls (HCs) (26 men and 14 women) closely matched in age, sex and weight underwent resting-state functional MRI scans respectively. The ReHo method was applied to evaluate synchronous neural activity changes. Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC curve) was used to show high test-retest stability and high degree of sensitivity and specificity.. We utilized the correlation analysis to calculate the relationship between the average ReHo signal values in different brain areas and the clinical symptoms in CU patients.
Results: Compared with the HCs, CU patients had significantly increased ReHo values in right cerebellum posterior lobe, left cerebellum posterior lobe, left inferior temporal gyrus, right lingual gyrus, left middle frontal gyrus, left angular gyrus, left cingulate gyrus, right angular gyrus and bilateral superior frontal gyrus，and decreased ReHo values in right anterior cingulate and left precentral gyrus. ROC curve analysis of each brain regions showed the accuracy of AUC was perfect except the right cerebellum posterior lobe. Nevertheless, there was no clear evidence of prominent relevance between the average ReHo values in brain areas and the clinical symptoms. 
Conclusion: CU caused dysfunctional adaption in different brain areas, which including relatively increased values and decreased values. This finding may help us take a further step in exploring the underlying pathologic mechanisms of CU.

Resting-state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI) is a common method for mapping functional brain networks. However, estimation of these networks is affected by the presence of a common global systemic noise, or global signal (GS). Previous studies have shown that the common preprocessing steps of removing the GS may create spurious correlations between brain regions. In this paper, we decompose fMRI signals into 5 spatial and 3 temporal intrinsic mode functions (SIMF and TIMF, respectively) by means of the empirical mode decomposition (EMD), which is an adaptive data-driven method widely used to analyze non-linear and non-stationary phenomena. For each SIMF, functional connectivity matrices were computed by means of the Pearson correlation between TIMFs of different brain areas. Thus, instead of a single connectivity matrix, we obtained 5*3 = 15 functional connectivity matrices. Given the high correlation and global efficiency values of the connectivity matrices related to the low spatial maps (SIMF3, SIMF4, and SIMF5), our results suggest that these maps can be considered as spatial global signal masks. Thus, by summing up the first two SIMFs extracted from the fMRI signals, we have automatically excluded the GS  which is now voxel-specific. We compared the performance of our method with the conventional GS regression and to the results when the GS was not removed. While the correlation pattern identified by the other methods suffers from a low level of precision in identifying the correct brain network connectivity, our approach demonstrated expected connectivity patterns for the default mode network and task-positive network.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00735">Targeting the Synapse in Alzheimer’s Disease</a></h4>

Dynamic gain and loss of synapses is fundamental to healthy brain function. While Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) treatment strategies have largely focussed on beta-amyloid and tau protein pathologies, the synapse itself may also be a critical endpoint to consider regarding disease modification.  Disruption of mechanisms of neuronal plasticity, eventually resulting in a net loss of synapses, is implicated as an early pathological event in AD.  Synaptic dysfunction therefore may be a final common biological mechanism linking protein pathologies to disease symptoms.  This review summarises evidence supporting the idea of early neuroplastic deficits being prevalent in AD. Changes in synaptic density can occur before overt neurodegeneration and should not be considered to uniformly decrease over the course of the disease.  Instead, synaptic levels are influenced by an interplay between processes of degeneration and atrophy, and those of maintenance and compensation at regional and network levels.  How these neuroplastic changes are driven by amyloid and tau pathology are varied.  A mixture of direct effects of amyloid and tau on synaptic integrity, as well as indirect effects on processes such as inflammation and neuronal energetics are likely to be at play here.  Focussing on the synapse and mechanisms of neuroplasticity as therapeutic opportunities in AD raises some important conceptual and strategic issues regarding translational research, and how preclinical research can inform clinical studies.  Nevertheless, substrates of neuroplasticity represent an emerging complementary class of drug target that would aim to normalise synapse dynamics and restore cognitive function in the AD brain.

Simulations of electrical activity of networks of morphologically detailed neuron models allow for a better understanding of the brain. State-of-the-art simulations describe the dynamics of ionic currents and biochemical processes within branching topological representations of the neurons. Acceleration of such simulation is possible in the weak scaling limit by modelling neurons as indivisible computation units and increasing the computing power. Strong scaling and simulations close to biological time are difficult, yet required for the study of synaptic plasticity and other use cases requiring simulation of neurons for long periods of time. Current methods rely on parallel Gaussian elimination, computing triangulation and substitution of many branches simultaneously.
Existing limitations are: (a) high heterogeneity of compute time per neuron leads to high computational load imbalance; and (b) difficulty in providing a computation model that fully utilises the computing resources on distributed multi-core architectures with Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) capabilities.

To address these issues, we present a strategy that extracts flow-dependencies between parameters of the ODEs and the algebraic solver of individual neurons. Based on the resulting dependencies map, we provide three techniques for memory, communication, and computation reorganization that yield a load-balanced distributed asynchronous execution. The new computation model distributes datasets and balances computational workload across a distributed memory space, exposing a tree-based parallelism of neuron topological structure, an embarrassingly parallel execution model of neuron subtrees, and a SIMD acceleration of subtree state updates.

The capabilities of our methods are demonstrated on a prototype implementation developed on the core compute kernel of the NEURON scientific application, built on the HPX runtime system for the ParalleX execution model. Our implementation yields a fully-asynchronous  distributed and parallel simulation that accelerates single neuron to medium-sized neural networks. Benchmark results display better strong scaling properties, finer-grained parallelism, and lower time to solution compared to the state of the art, on a wide range of distributed multi-core compute architectures.

We propose event-related cortical sources estimation from subject-independent electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings for motor imagery brain computer interface (BCI). By using wavelet-based maximum entropy on the mean (wMEM), task-specific EEG channels are selected to predict right hand and right foot sensorimotor tasks, employing spatial pattern analysis with and without covariance estimation regularization. EEG from five healthy individuals (Dataset IVa, BCI Competition III) were evaluated by a cross-subject paradigm. Prediction performance was evaluated via a two-layer feed-forward neural network, where the classifier was trained and tested by data from two subjects independently. The highest mean prediction accuracy achieved by using subject-pair (ay-al) specific selected EEG channels was on average (90:36+/-5:59) and outperformed that achieved by using all available channels (83:21+/-12:26). Significant improvements in performance suggest a role of wMEM for channel selection in BCI. Spatially projected cortical sources may be useful for capturing inter-subject associative sensorimotor brain dynamics and pave the way towards subject-independent BCI.

Professional pride is a positive emotion that includes self-reflection or evaluation and attitude toward one’s own occupational group. Uniforms can encourage the wearer to have professional pride. The current study aimed to elucidate the neural basis of professional pride using an experimental task related to the self in uniform and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The person-adjective matching task, in which a participant or other in uniform or casual wear was presented with positive and negative words, was used for scanning fMRI. Imaging data from 21 adults who had an occupation requiring a uniform were analyzed to identify the main and interaction effects of individual (self vs. other), clothes (uniform vs. casual wear), and valence (positive vs. negative). Identified brain activities were correlated with psychological scales including the Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale and Group Environment Questionnaire. Whole brain analyses found that the interaction between individual and clothes was present in multiple regions such as the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, left middle and inferior temporal gyri, left posterior superior temporal sulcus, right temporoparietal junction, left lingual gyrus, left calcarine cortex, right insula, left caudate, and right putamen. In particular, activities in the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, left calcarine cortex, and right putamen in the self/uniform condition were positively correlated with several psychological scales. These results suggest that professional pride may be represented through multiple brain networks related to empathy, reward, and emotion regulation as well as the theory-of-mind network. The neural basis of professional pride is closely related to positive self-evaluation and group cohesion.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00249">Evidence for the Rhythmic Perceptual Sampling of Auditory Scenes</a></h4>

Converging results suggest that perception is controlled by rhythmic processes in the brain. In the auditory domain, neuroimaging studies show that the perception of sounds is shaped by rhythmic activity prior to the stimulus, and electrophysiological recordings have linked delta and theta band activity to the functioning of individual neurons. These results have promoted theories of rhythmic modes of listening and generally suggest that the perceptually relevant encoding of acoustic information is structured by rhythmic processes along auditory pathways. A prediction from this perspective  ̶  which so far has not been tested  ̶  is that such rhythmic processes also shape how acoustic information is combined over time to judge extended soundscapes. The present study was designed to directly test this prediction. Human participants judged the overall change in perceived frequency content in temporally extended (1.2 to 1.8 s) soundscapes, while the perceptual use of the available sensory evidence was quantified using psychophysical reverse correlation. Model-based analysis of individual participant’s perceptual weights revealed a rich temporal structure, including linear trends, a U-shaped profile tied to the overall stimulus duration, and importantly, rhythmic components at the time scale of 1 to 2Hz. The collective evidence found here across four versions of the experiment supports the notion that rhythmic processes operating on the delta time scale structure how perception samples temporally extended acoustic scenes.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2019.00049">The Energy Homeostasis Principle: Neuronal Energy Regulation Drives Local Network Dynamics Generating Behavior</a></h4>

Understanding how neurons arrange themselves into neural networks that result in behaviors is a major goal in neuroscience. Most theoretical and experimental efforts have focused on a top-down approach which seeks to identify neuronal correlates of behaviors. This has been accomplished by effectively mapping specific behaviors to distinct neural patterns or by creating computational models that produce a desired behavioral outcome. Nonetheless, these approaches, have only implicitly considered the fact that neural tissue, like any other physical system, is subjected to several restrictions and boundaries of operations. 
	Here, we proposed a new, bottom-up conceptual paradigm: The Energy Homeostasis Principle, where the balance between energy income, expenditure, and availability are the key parameters in determining the dynamics of neuronal phenomena found from molecular to behavioral levels. Neurons display high energy consumption relative to other cells, with metabolic consumption of the brain representing 20% of the whole-body oxygen uptake, which contrasts with this organ representing only 2% of the body weight. Also, neurons have specialized surrounding tissue that provides the necessary energy which in the case of the central nervous system, is provided by astrocytes. Moreover, and unlike other cell types with high energy demands such as muscle cells, neurons have a strict aerobic metabolism. These facts indicate that neurons are highly sensitive to energy limitations with Gibb’s free energy dictating the direction of all cellular metabolic processes. From this activity, the largest energy is by far, expended by action potentials and post-synaptic potentials, therefore, plasticity can be reinterpreted on their energy context. Consequently, neurons, through their synapses, would impose energy demands over post-synaptic neurons in a close loop-manner, modulating the dynamics of local circuits. Therefrom, energy dynamics end up impacting the homeostatic mechanisms of neuronal networks. Furthermore, local energy management emerges also as a neural population property, where most of the energy expenses are triggered by sensory or other modulatory input. Local energy management in neurons may be sufficient to explain the emergence of behavior, enabling the assessment of which and how properties arise in neural circuits. Importantly, the Energy Homeostasis Principle proposal is also readily testable in simple neuronal networks.

Background: The brain is protected by the blood-brain barrier (BBB), constituted by endothelial cells supported by pericytes and astrocytes. In Alzheimer’s Disease a dysregulation of the BBB occurs since the early phases of the disease leading to an increased access of solutes and immune cells that can participate to the central inflammatory response. Here we investigated whether astrocytes may influence endothelial-leukocytes interaction in the presence of amyloid-β (Aβ). Methods: We used an in vitro BBB model, where endothelial cells, cultured alone or with astrocytes were exposed for 5 h to Aβ, both under resting or inflammatory conditions (TNFα and IFNγ), to evaluate endothelial barrier properties, as well as transendothelial migration of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Results: In the co-culture model, barrier permeability to solutes was increased by all treatments, but migration was only observed in inflammatory conditions and was prevented by Aβ treatment. On the contrary, in endothelial monocultures, Aβ induced leukocytes migration under resting conditions and did not modify that induced by inflammatory cytokines. In endothelial astrocyte co-cultures, a low molecular weight isoform of the adhesion molecule ICAM-1, important to allow interaction with PBMCs, was increased after 5 h exposure to inflammatory cytokines, an effect that was prevented by Aβ. This modulation by Aβ was not observed in endothelial monocultures. In addition, endothelial expression of β-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III (Gnt-III), responsible for the formation of the low molecular weight ICAM-1 isoform, was enhanced in inflammatory conditions, but negatively modulated by Aβ only in the co-culture model. miR-200b, increased in astrocytes following Aβ treatment and may represent one of the factors involved in the control of Gnt-III expression. Conclusions: These data point out that, at least in the early phases of Aβ exposure, astrocytes play a role in the modulation of leucocytes migration through the endothelial layer.

Background: The modality effect plays the central role in learning and memory functions. Retrieval failure constitutes a common memory impairment that occurs among patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, little knowledge exists about the relation between modality effect and delayed recall impairment in PD. The primary goal of this study was to compare delayed free recall performance between three different memory modalities (verbal, visual, and cross visual-verbal) in a sample of non-demented patients with mild PD progression. The secondary goal was to explore the frequency of deficient performance on the basis of normative comparisons on each of the three delayed free-recall measures. Method: A total of 71 non-demented patients with mild Parkinson’s disease progression were recruited for the administration of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT), the Rey Osterrieth Complex Figure Test (ROCFT), and the Greek Version of Face-Name Associative Memory Examination (GR-FNAME12). Results: The percentages of deficient-performances for the three delayed free recall measures were 45.1% (32/71), 39.4% (28/71) and 31% (22/71) for the GR-FNAME12, ROFCT and RAVLT, respectively. The results indicated no significant difference between performances of the GR-FNAME12 and ROCFT, both of which were significantly lower than performance on the RAVLT. Conclusions: In conclusion, delayed free recall appears to be more severely affected in the cross visual-verbal and visual memory modalities than in verbal-memory modalities in the early phase of PD progression.

These days the important role of retinoids in adult brain functionality and homeostasis is well accepted and has been proven by genomic as well as non-genomic mechanisms. In the healthy brain, numerous biological processes e.g. cell proliferation, neurogenesis, dendritic spine formation as well as modulation of the immune system have been attributed to retinoid signaling.  This, together with the finding that retinoid metabolism is impaired in Alzheimer’s disease, led to preclinical and early clinical testing of natural and synthetic retinoids as innovative pharmaceuticals with multifactorial properties. Acitretin, an aromatic retinoid, was found to exert anti-amyloidogenic effect in mouse models for Alzheimer’s disease as well as in human patients by stimulating the alpha-secretase ADAM10. The lipophilic drug was already demonstrated to easily pass the blood brain barrier after i.p. administration and increased nest building capability in the 5xFAD mouse model. Additionally, we analyzed the immune-modulatory capacity of acitretin via a  multiplex array in the 5xFAD mouse model and evaluated some of our findings in human CSF derived from a pilot study  using acitretin. Although several serum analytes did not display changes, IL-6 was found to be significantly increased in both - mouse and human neural material. This demonstrates that acitretin exerts an immune stimulatory effect – besides the alpha-secretase induction – which could impact the alleviation of learning and memory disabilities observed in the mouse model.

Although the neural mechanism supporting episodic recollection has been well characterized in younger adults, exactly how recollection is supported in older adults remains unclear. The electrophysiological correlate of recollection – the parietal retrieval success effect – for example, has been shown to be sensitive to both the amount of information recollected and the accuracy of remembered information in younger adults. To date, there is mixed evidence that parietal effect also scales with the amount of information remembered in older adults whilst there is little evidence that the same mechanism is sensitive to the accuracy of recollected information. Here, we address one potential concern when investigating Event Related Potentials (ERPs) among older adults – namely, the greater potential for single trial latency variability to smear and reduces the amplitudes of averaged ERPs. We apply a well-established algorithm for correcting single trial latency variability, Residual Iteration Decomposition Analysis (RIDE), to investigate whether the parietal retrieval success effect among older adults is sensitive to retrieval accuracy. Our results reveal that, similar to younger adults, older adult parietal retrieval success effects scale with the accuracy of recollected information – i.e., is greater in magnitude when recollected information is of high accuracy, reduced in magnitude when accuracy is low, and entirely absent when guessing. The results help clarify the functional significance of the neural mechanism supporting recollection in older adults whilst also highlighting the potential issues with interpreting average ERPs in older adult populations.

<p>by Christopher J. Bates, Ilker Yildirim, Joshua B. Tenenbaum, Peter Battaglia</p>

Humans can easily describe, imagine, and, crucially, <i>predict</i> a wide variety of behaviors of liquids—splashing, squirting, gushing, sloshing, soaking, dripping, draining, trickling, pooling, and pouring—despite tremendous variability in their material and dynamical properties. Here we propose and test a computational model of how people perceive and predict these liquid dynamics, based on coarse approximate simulations of fluids as collections of interacting particles. Our model is analogous to a “game engine in the head”, drawing on techniques for interactive simulations (as in video games) that optimize for efficiency and natural appearance rather than physical accuracy. In two behavioral experiments, we found that the model accurately captured people’s predictions about how liquids flow among complex solid obstacles, and was significantly better than two alternatives based on simple heuristics and deep neural networks. Our model was also able to explain how people’s predictions varied as a function of the liquids’ properties (e.g., viscosity and stickiness). Together, the model and empirical results extend the recent proposal that human physical scene understanding for the dynamics of rigid, solid objects can be supported by approximate probabilistic simulation, to the more complex and unexplored domain of fluid dynamics.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HdFwenUGB3I" width="1" />

<p>by Xing Chen, Chi-Chi Zhu, Jun Yin</p>

In recent years, increasing associations between microRNAs (miRNAs) and human diseases have been identified. Based on accumulating biological data, many computational models for potential miRNA-disease associations inference have been developed, which saves time and expenditure on experimental studies, making great contributions to researching molecular mechanism of human diseases and developing new drugs for disease treatment. In this paper, we proposed a novel computational method named Ensemble of Decision Tree based MiRNA-Disease Association prediction (EDTMDA), which innovatively built a computational framework integrating ensemble learning and dimensionality reduction. For each miRNA-disease pair, the feature vector was extracted by calculating the statistical measures, graph theoretical measures, and matrix factorization results for the miRNA and disease, respectively. Then multiple base learnings were built to yield many decision trees (DTs) based on random selection of negative samples and miRNA/disease features. Particularly, Principal Components Analysis was applied to each base learning to reduce feature dimensionality and hence remove the noise or redundancy. Average strategy was adopted for these DTs to get final association scores between miRNAs and diseases. In model performance evaluation, EDTMDA showed AUC of 0.9309 in global leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) and AUC of 0.8524 in local LOOCV. Additionally, AUC of 0.9192+/-0.0009 in 5-fold cross validation proved the model’s reliability and stability. Furthermore, three types of case studies for four human diseases were implemented. As a result, 94% (Esophageal Neoplasms), 86% (Kidney Neoplasms), 96% (Breast Neoplasms) and 88% (Carcinoma Hepatocellular) of top 50 predicted miRNAs were confirmed by experimental evidences in literature.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/NTml9lcjzb8" width="1" />

<p>by Walter Basile, Marco Salvatore, Claudio Bassot, Arne Elofsson</p>

Intrinsic disorder is more abundant in eukaryotic than prokaryotic proteins. Methods predicting intrinsic disorder are based on the amino acid sequence of a protein. Therefore, there must exist an underlying difference in the sequences between eukaryotic and prokaryotic proteins causing the (predicted) difference in intrinsic disorder. By comparing proteins, from complete eukaryotic and prokaryotic proteomes, we show that the difference in intrinsic disorder emerges from the linker regions connecting Pfam domains. Eukaryotic proteins have more extended linker regions, and in addition, the eukaryotic linkers are significantly more disordered, 38% vs. 12-16% disordered residues. Next, we examined the underlying reason for the increase in disorder in eukaryotic linkers, and we found that the changes in abundance of only three amino acids cause the increase. Eukaryotic proteins contain 8.6% serine; while prokaryotic proteins have 6.5%, eukaryotic proteins also contain 5.4% proline and 5.3% isoleucine compared with 4.0% proline and ≈ 7.5% isoleucine in the prokaryotes. All these three differences contribute to the increased disorder in eukaryotic proteins. It is tempting to speculate that the increase in serine frequencies in eukaryotes is related to regulation by kinases, but direct evidence for this is lacking. The differences are observed in all phyla, protein families, structural regions and type of protein but are most pronounced in disordered and linker regions. The observation that differences in the abundance of three amino acids cause the difference in disorder between eukaryotic and prokaryotic proteins raises the question: Are amino acid frequencies different in eukaryotic linkers because the linkers are more disordered or do the differences cause the increased disorder?<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/VF5f6giyZIo" width="1" />

ABSTRACT<p>Many experimental approaches require housing rodents in individual cages, including in epilepsy research. However, rats and mice are social animals; and individual housing constitutes a stressful situation. The goal of the present study was to determine the effects of individual housing as compared to conditions maintaining social contact on stress markers and epilepsy. Control male mice socially housed during pretest and then transferred to individual cages for six weeks displayed anhedonia, increased anxiety and biological markers of stress as compared to pretest values or mice kept socially housed during six weeks. Pilocarpine-treated mice housed together showed increased levels of anhedonia, anxiety and stress markers as well as decreased cognitive performance as compared to the control group. The differences were more significant in pilocarpine-treated mice housed individually. Anxiety correlated linearly with cognitive performance and stress markers independently of the experimental conditions. In the male rat pilocarpine model, seizures were sixteen times more frequent in singly housed animals as compared to animals kept in pairs. Daily interactions with an experimenter in otherwise singly housed animals was sufficient to produce results identical to those found in animals kept in pairs. We propose that social isolation produces a severe phenotype in terms of stress and seizure frequency as compared to animals maintaining social contact (at least in these two models), a factor that needs to be taken into account for data interpretation, in particular for preclinical studies.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Many experimental approaches require housing rodents in individual cages, a stressful condition for social animals, even in an enriched environment context. Using the pilocarpine model of epilepsy in rats and mice, we report that singly housing animals develop a more severe phenotype in terms of stress and epilepsy as compared to animals maintaining social contact. We propose that social isolation adds a degree of complexity for the interpretation of data, which may be particularly relevant for preclinical studies.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Compared to older Caucasians, older African Americans have higher risks of developing Alzheimer disease (AD) and lower cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tau biomarker levels. It is not known whether tau‐related differences begin earlier in life or whether race modifies other AD‐related biomarkers such as inflammatory proteins.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We performed multiplex cytokine analysis in a healthy middle‐aged cohort with family history of AD (n = 68) and an older cohort (n = 125) with normal cognition (NC), mild cognitive impairment, or AD dementia. After determining baseline interleukin (IL)‐9 level and AD‐associated IL‐9 change to differ according to race, we performed immunohistochemical analysis for proteins mechanistically linked to IL‐9 in brains of African Americans and Caucasians (n = 38), and analyzed postmortem IL‐9–related gene expression profiles in the publicly available Mount Sinai cohort (26 African Americans and 180 Caucasians).</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Compared to Caucasians with NC, African Americans with NC had lower CSF tau, p‐Tau<sub>181</sub>, and IL‐9 levels in both living cohorts. Conversely, AD was only correlated with increased CSF IL‐9 levels in African Americans but not Caucasians. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed perivascular, neuronal, and glial cells immunoreactive to IL‐9, and quantitative analysis in independent US cohorts showed AD to correlate with molecular changes (upstream differentiation marker and downstream effector cell marker) of IL‐9 upregulation only in African Americans but not Caucasians.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Baseline and AD‐associated IL‐9 differences between African Americans and Caucasians point to distinct molecular phenotypes for AD according to ancestry. Genetic and nongenetic factors need to be considered in future AD research involving unique populations. ANN NEUROL 2019</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The substantial clinical improvement in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients treated with mechanical thrombectomy (MT), combined with the poor response of proximal intracranial occlusions to intravenous thrombolysis (IVT), led to questions regarding the utility of bridging therapy (BT; IVT followed by MT) compared to direct mechanical thrombectomy (dMT) for AIS patients with large vessel occlusion (LVO).</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We aimed to investigate the comparative safety and efficacy of BT and dMT in AIS patients. We included all observational studies and post hoc analyses from randomized controlled clinical trials that provided data on the outcomes of AIS patients with LVO stratified by IVT treatment status prior to MT.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified 38 eligible observational studies (11,798 LVO patients, mean age = 68 years, 56% treated with BT). In unadjusted analyses, BT was associated with a higher likelihood of 3‐month functional independence (odds ratio [OR] = 1.52, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.32–1.76), 3‐month functional improvement (common OR [cOR] for 1‐point decrease in modified Rankin Scale score = 1.52, 95% CI = 1.18–1.97), early neurological improvement (OR = 1.21, 95% CI = 1.83–1.76), successful recanalization (OR = 1.22, 95% CI = 1.02–1.46), and successful recanalization with ≤2 device passes (OR = 2.28, 95% CI = 1.43–3.64) compared to dMT. BT was also related to a lower likelihood of 3‐month mortality (OR = 0.64, 95% CI = 0.57–0.73). In the adjusted analyses, BT was independently associated with a higher likelihood of 3‐month functional independence (adjusted OR = 1.55, 95% CI = 1.26–1.91) and lower odds of 3‐month mortality (adjusted OR = 0.80, 95% CI = 0.66–0.97) compared to dMT. The two groups did not differ in functional improvement (adjusted cOR = 1.24, 95% CI = 0.89–1.74) or symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (adjusted OR = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.61–1.25).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>BT appears to be associated with improved functional independence without evidence for safety concerns, compared to dMT, for AIS patients with LVO. ANN NEUROL 2019</p>

Hierarchical movement sequences are often assumed to mirror an anatomical hierarchy of brain regions. Using representational fMRI analysis, Yokoi and Diedrichsen challenge this common assumption. Although the primary motor cortex represents elementary movements, chunk and sequence representations coexist in the premotor and parietal cortices.

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25552?af=R">Human gestational NMDAR autoantibodies impair neonatal murine brain function</a></h4>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Maternal autoantibodies are a risk factor for impaired brain development in the offspring. Antibodies (AB) against the NR1 (GluN1) subunit of the <i>N</i>‐Methyl‐D‐Aspartate‐receptor (NMDAR) are among the most frequently diagnosed anti‐neuronal surface AB, yet little is known about effects on fetal development during pregnancy.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We established a murine model of <i>in utero</i> exposure to human recombinant NR1 and isotype‐matched non‐reactive control (CTL) ABs. Pregnant C57BL/6J mice were intraperitoneally injected on embryonic days 13 and 17 each with 240 μg of human monoclonal AB. Offspring were investigated for acute and chronic effects on NMDAR function, brain development and behavior.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Transferred NR1 AB enriched in the fetus and bound to synaptic structures in the fetal brain. Density of NMDAR was considerably reduced (up to ‐49.2%) and electrophysiological properties altered, reflected by decreased amplitudes of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents in young neonates (‐34.4%). NR1 AB‐treated animals displayed increased early postnatal mortality (+27.2%), impaired neurodevelopmental reflexes, altered blood pH and reduced bodyweight. During adolescence and adulthood, animals showed hyperactivity (+27.8% median activity over 14 days), lower anxiety and impaired sensorimotor gating. NR1 AB caused long‐lasting neuropathological effects also in aged mice (10 months), such as reduced volumes of cerebellum, midbrain and brainstem.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The data collectively support a model in which asymptomatic mothers can harbor low‐level pathogenic human NR1 AB that are diaplacentally transferred causing neurotoxic effects on neonatal development. Thus, AB‐mediated network changes may represent a – potentially treatable – neurodevelopmental congenital brain disorder contributing to lifelong neuropsychiatric morbidity in affected children.</p>

These spontaneous metastable states are increasingly found to subserve internal representations that are not locked to external triggers, including states of deliberations, attention and expectation.

Using a high resolution in situ hybridization technique we have measured PIEZO1, PIEZO2 and TRPV1 transcripts in mouse dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons.   Consistent with previous studies, PIEZO2 transcripts were highly expressed in most DRG neurons, including the largest diameter neurons implicated in mediating touch and proprioception.  In contrast, PIEZO1 transcripts were selectively expressed in smaller diameter DRG neurons, which are implicated in mediating nociception.  Moreover, neurons expressing PIEZO1 were distinct from those neurons that strongly expressed TRPV1, one of the channels implicated in heat-nociception.   Using an in vivo functional test for the selective expression, we found that Yoda1, a PIEZO1-specific agonist, induced a mechanical hyperalgesia that displayed a significantly prolonged time course compared with that induced by capsaicin, a TRPV1-specific agonist.  Taken together, our results indicate that PIEZO1 should be considered a potential candidate for the long sought channel mediating mechano-nociception.

Older adults commonly report difficulty understanding speech, particularly in adverse listening environments. These communication difficulties may exist in the absence of peripheral hearing loss. Older adults, both with normal hearing and with hearing loss, demonstrate temporal processing deficits that affect speech perception. The purpose of the present study is to investigate aging, cognition, and neural processing factors that may lead to deficits on perceptual tasks that rely on phoneme identification based on a temporal cue – vowel duration. A better understanding of the neural and cognitive impairments underlying temporal processing deficits could lead to more focused aural rehabilitation for improved speech understanding for older adults with normal hearing. 
This investigation was conducted in younger (YNH) and older normal-hearing (ONH) participants who completed three measures of cognitive functioning known to decline with age: working memory, processing speed, and inhibitory control. To evaluate perceptual and neural processing of auditory temporal contrasts, identification functions for the contrasting word-pair WHEAT and WEED were obtained on a nine-step continuum of vowel duration, and frequency-following responses (FFRs) and cortical auditory-evoked potentials (CAEPs) were recorded to the two endpoints of the continuum. Multiple linear regression analyses were conducted to determine the cognitive, peripheral, and/or central mechanisms that may contribute to perceptual performance. 
YNH participants demonstrated higher cognitive functioning on all three measures compared to ONH participants. The slope of the identification function was steeper in YNH than in ONH participants, suggesting a clearer distinction between the contrasting words in the YNH participants. FFRs revealed better response waveform morphology and more robust phase-locking in YNH compared to ONH participants. ONH participants also exhibited earlier latencies for CAEP components compared to the YNH participants. Linear regression analyses revealed that cortical processing significantly contributed to the variance in perceptual performance in the WHEAT/WEED identification functions. These results suggest that reduced neural precision contributes to age-related speech perception difficulties that arise from temporal processing deficits.

Previous study has proved the specific role of prefrontal-parietal network in the rapid goal-directed chunking (RGDC), which could dissociate the prefrontal activity from the working memory demand or encoding difficulty. However, it remains unknown how the prefrontal and parietal cortices collaborate to accomplish RGDC. A novel experiment design using Chinese characters as materials wad conduced with eighteen undergraduate students (9 females, mean age = 22.4 years) while recoding electroencephalogram (EEG). The radical-level chunking, accomplished in a timely stringent way, made a strict contrast with the stroke-level chunking whose cognitive brain processing were far less coherent due to the irregular and unpredictable chunking procedure. Comparing to the stoke-level chunking, RGDC like radical-level chunking showed an early increase of gamma band synchronization over parietal and occipital cortices, followed by enhanced power in the beta-gamma band (25-38 Hz) over frontal areas in the regular versus irregular chunking conditions. We suggest that the posterior rhythmic activities in the gamma band may underlie the processes that are directly associated with perceptual manipulations of chunking, while the subsequent beta-gamma activation over frontal area appears to reflect the reinforcement of the selected rules over alternative options, which would differentiate goal-directed chunking from chunking processes accomplished in a more implicit manner.

A hand mental rotation task (HMRT) is a task wherein a person judges whether an image of a rotated hand is of the right or left hand. Two performance strategies are expected to come into play when performing these tasks: a visual imagery (VI) strategy, in which an image is mentally rotated, and a motor imagery (MI) strategy, in which the movement of a person’s own hand is simulated. Although elderly people generally take some time to perform these tasks, ability differs greatly between individuals. The present study hypothesizes that there is a relationship between differences in task performance strategy and performance ability, and it compares performance strategy among elderly people divided into groups with a short mental rotation time and a long mental rotation time. In response to images of the palm, both groups displayed a medial-lateral effect in which responses were faster for images where the third finger was rotated toward the midline of the body than images rotated in the opposite direction, and we inferred that an MI strategy was primarily employed. Meanwhile, in response to images of the back of the hand, a medial-lateral effect was also observed in the group with a long mental rotation time and not in the group with the shortest mental rotation time (VI strategy). These results suggest that different strategies for performing HMRT tasks are used by elderly people with a short mental rotation time and those with a long mental rotation time.

The impact of traumatic brain injury (TBI) on procedural memory has received significantly less attention than declarative memory. Although to date studies on procedural memory have yielded mixed findings, many rehabilitation protocols (e.g., errorless learning) rely on the procedural memory system, and assume that it is relatively intact. The aim of the current study was to determine whether individuals with TBI are impaired on a task of procedural memory as a group, and to examine the presence of individual differences in performance. We administered to a sample of 36 individuals with moderate-severe TBI and 40 healthy comparisons (HC) the rotary pursuit (RP) task, and then examined their rate of learning, as well as their retention of learning. Our analyses revealed that while individuals with TBI spent a significantly shorter amount of time on target as a group, they did not retain significantly less procedural learning, and as a group their rate of learning was not different from HCs. However, there were high individual differences in both groups, indicating that some individuals might not be able to take advantage of treatment methods designed to leverage intact procedural memory system. Future work is needed to better assess and characterize procedural memory in individuals with TBI across a larger battery of tasks in experimental and clinical setting as memory and learning status may predict rehabilitation success.

In working memory (WM), the ability to concurrently integrate different types of information and maintain or manipulate them promotes the flow of ongoing tasks. WM is a key component of normal human cognition. In this study, we applied a combined voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) analysis to investigate the relationship between the ability of object and spatial working memory (WM), and regional gray matter density (GMD), as well as intrinsic functional connectivity. The VBM analysis showed a positive correlation between the individual difference of object WM and GMD in the right middle occipital gyrus (MOG) and the left superior temporal gyrus (STG), which are responsible for coding object information and processing the shape of an object. The individual difference of the spatial WM was positively related to GMD in the right middle frontal gyrus (MFG) located in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), which confirmed that it is an important region for memory stores and maintains WM spatial representations. Further functional connectivity analysis revealed that the individual difference of object WM was significantly correlated with the rsFC of right intraparietal sulcus (IPS) – left postcentral gyrus (PostCG)/right precentral gyrus (PreCG)/left supplementary motor area (SMA). Whereas the capacity of spatial WM was significantly associated with the FC strength of left dlPFC – left precuneus, right dlPFC – right MFG, and left superior frontal sulcus (SFS) – left SMA/ right inferior parietal lobe (IPL). Our findings suggested that object WM is associated with the structure and functional organization of the brain regions involved in the ventral pathway (occipital - temporal regions) and the capacity of spatial WM is related to the dorsal pathway (frontal - parietal regions).

Neuroanatomy suggests that adjacent neocortical neurons share a similar set of afferent synaptic inputs, as opposed to neurons localized to different areas of the neocortex. In the present study, we made simultaneous single-electrode patch clamp recordings from two or three adjacent neurons in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) of the ketamine-xylazine anesthetized rat in vivo to study the correlation patterns in their spike firing during both spontaneous and sensory-evoked activity. One difference with previous studies of pairwise neuronal spike firing correlations was that here we identified several different quantifiable parameters in the correlation patterns by which different pairs could be compared. The questions asked were if the correlation patterns between adjacent pairs were similar and if there was a relationship between the degree of similarity and the layer location of the pairs. In contrast, our results show that for putative pyramidal neurons within layer III and within layer V, each pair of neurons is to some extent unique in terms of their spiking correlation patterns. Interestingly, our results also indicated that these correlation patterns did not substantially alter between spontaneous and evoked activity. Our findings are compatible with the view that the synaptic input connectivity to each neocortical neuron is at least in some aspects unique. A possible interpretation is that plasticity mechanisms, which could either be initiating or be supported by transcriptomic differences, tend to differentiate rather than harmonize the synaptic weight distributions between adjacent neurons of the same type.

Connections in nervous systems are disproportionately concentrated on a small subset of neural elements that act as
network hubs. Hubs have been found across different of species and scales ranging from C.elegans to mouse, rat, cat,
macaque and human, suggesting a role for genetic influences. The recent availability of brain-wide gene expression
atlases provides new opportunities for mapping the transcriptional correlates of large-scale network-level phenotypes.
Here we review studies that use these atlases to investigate gene expression patterns associated with hub connectivity in
neural networks and present evidence that some of these patterns are conserved across species and scales.

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAT) with clopidogrel plus aspirin has been suggested by American Heart Association/American Stroke Association guidelines for minor stroke (MS) and transient ischemic attack (TIA) patients. The purpose of this study was to find the potential subgroups that benefit from DAT. We aimed to compare the efficacy of clopidogrel–aspirin therapy with that of aspirin therapy in MS/TIA patients stratified by CYP2C19 genotype and risk profiles.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>CYP2C19 loss‐of‐function allele (LoFA) carriers were defined as patients with LoFA of either *2 or *3. Low‐ and high‐risk profile was defined as Essen Stroke Risk Score (ESRS) &lt;3 and ≥3, respectively. Stroke recurrence at 1 year was considered primary outcome.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Of a total 2,933 MS/TIA patients, there were 1,726 (58.8%) LoFA carriers and 1,068 (36.4%) patients at high risk (ESRS ≥3). No significant difference for stroke recurrence between the clopidogrel–aspirin group and aspirin alone group was found in LoFA carriers (11.2% vs 13.3%, hazard ratio [HR] = 0.83, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.64~1.09). In stratified analyses by CYP2C19 genotype and ESRS, HRs (95% CIs) of the clopidogrel–aspirin therapy for stroke recurrence were 1.00 (0.70~1.42), 0.63 (0.41~0.97), 0.62 (0.40~0.96), and 0.52 (0.31~0.88) among subgroups of LoFA carriers at low risk, LoFA carriers at high risk, LoFA noncarriers at low risk, and LoFA noncarriers at high risk, respectively, with <i>p</i> = 0.021 for interaction.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Overall, LoFA carriers do not benefit from DAT, but there is significant benefit for LoFA carriers who are at high risk. The benefit of clopidogrel in Chinese MS/TIA patients depends on CYP2C19 genotype and risk profile. ANN NEUROL 2019</p>

Here, we review the neural circuit bases of habits, compulsions, and addictions, behaviors which are all characterized by relatively automatic action performance. We discuss relevant studies primarily from the rodent literature, and describe how major headway has been made in identifying the brain regions and neural cell types whose activity is modulated during the acquisition and performance of these automated behaviors. The dorsal striatum and cortical inputs to this structure have emerged as key players in the wider basal ganglia circuitry encoding behavioral automaticity, and changes in the activity of different neuronal cell-types in these brain regions have been shown to co-occur with the formation of these automatic behaviors. We highlight how disordered functioning of these neural circuits can result in neuropsychiatric disorders, such as OCD and drug addiction. Finally, we discuss how the next phase of research in the field may benefit from integration of approaches for access to cells based on their genetic makeup, activity, connectivity and precise anatomical location.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2019.00027">Sensory Modulation Disorder (SMD) and Pain: A New Perspective</a></h4>

Sensory modulation disorder (SMD) affects sensory processing across single or multiple sensory systems. The sensory over-responsivity (SOR) subtype of SMD is manifested clinically as a condition in which non-painful stimuli are perceived as abnormally irritating, unpleasant, or even painful. Moreover, SOR interferes with participation in daily routines and activities, co-occurs with daily pain hyper-sensitivity, and reduces quality of life due to bodily pain. 
Laboratory behavioral studies have confirmed abnormal pain perception, as demonstrated by hyperalgesia and an enhanced lingering painful sensation, in children and adults with SMD. Advanced quantitative sensory testing has revealed the mechanisms of altered pain processing in SOR whereby despite the existence of normal peripheral sensory processing, there is enhanced facilitation of pain transmitting pathways along with preserved but delayed inhibitory pain modulation. These findings point to central nervous system involvement as the underlying mechanism of pain hypersensitivity in SOR. Based on the mutual central processing of both non-painful and painful sensory stimuli, we suggest shared mechanisms such as cortical hyper-excitation, an excitatory-inhibitory neuronal imbalance, and sensory modulation alterations. This is supported by novel findings indicating that SOR is a risk factor and comorbidity of chronic non-neuropathic pain disorders. 
This is the first review to summarize current empirical knowledge investigating SMD and pain, a sensory modality not yet part of the official SMD realm. We propose a neurophysiological mechanism-based model for the interrelation between pain and SMD. Embracing the pain domain could significantly contribute to the understanding of this condition’s pathogenesis and how it manifests in daily life, as well as suggesting the basis for future potential mechanism-based therapies.

Electroencephalography (EEG) data can be used to decode an attended speech source in normal-hearing (NH) listeners using high-density EEG caps, as well as around-the-ear EEG devices. The technology may find application in identifying the target speaker in a cocktail party like scenario and steer speech enhancement algorithms in cochlear implants (CIs). However, the worse spectral resolution and the electrical artifacts introduced by a CI may limit the applicability of this approach to CI users. 
The goal of this study was to investigate whether selective attention can be decoded in CI users using an around-the-ear EEG system (cEEGrid). The performances of high-density cap EEG recordings and cEEGrid EEG recordings were compared in a selective attention paradigm using an envelope tracking algorithm. Speech from two audio books was presented through insert earphones to NH listeners and via direct audio cable to the CI users. 10 NH listeners and 10 bilateral CI users participated in the study. Participants were instructed to attend to one out of the two concurrent speech streams while data were recorded by a 96-channel scalp EEG and an 18-channel cEEGrid setup simultaneously. Reconstruction performance was evaluated by means of parametric correlations between the reconstructed speech and both, the envelope of the attended and the unattended speech stream. 
Results confirm the feasibility to decode selective attention by means of single-trial EEG data in NH and CI users using a high-density EEG. All NH listeners and 9 out 10 CI achieved high decoding accuracies. The cEEGrid was successful in decoding selective attention in 5 out of 10 NH listeners. The same result was obtained for CI users.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00231">Gender Differences in Throwing Revisited: Sensorimotor Coordination in a Virtual Ball Aiming Task</a></h4>

Numerous studies have demonstrated that boys throw balls faster, farther and more accurately than girls. This is largely due to well-known anatomical and muscle physiological differences that play a central role in overarm throwing. With the objective to understand the potential contribution of coordinative aspects in this gender difference, this large cross-sectional study examined a simplified forearm throw that eliminated the physical advantages of male individuals. As hypothesized, the gender disparity disappeared, but only in the age groups younger than 20 years. Two fine-grained spatiotemporal metrics displayed a similar age-dependent gender disparity. As throwing experience did not explain this age-dependency, the results are discussed in the context of spatial abilities and video game experience, both more pronounced in males. In contrast, a measure of intrinsic rhythmicity developed over successive throws did not reveal any gender differences, speaking to the fundamental tendency in humans to fall into rhythmic patterns. This computational study was performed in a large cohort in the context of an outreach activity, demonstrating that robust quantitative measures can also be obtained in less controlled environments. The findings also alert that motor neuroscience may need to pay more attention to gender differences.

Brain tissue contains autofluorescing elements that potentially impede accurate identification of neurons when visualized with fluorescent microscopy. Age-related accumulation of molecules with autofluorescent properties, such as lipofuscin, can possess spectral profiles that invade the typical emission range of fluorophores commonly utilized in fluorescent microscopy. The traditional method for accounting for this native fluorescence is to apply lipophilic dyes that are able to sequester these unwanted signals. While effective, such dyes can present a range of problems including the obstruction of fluorescent probe emissions. The present study utilizes aged primate midbrain tissue stained for tyrosine hydroxylase and calbindin to investigate an image processing approach for removing autofluorescence utilizing spectral imaging and linear unmixing. This technique is then compared against the traditional, dye-based autofluorescence sequestration method using Sudan Black B (SBB). Spectral imaging and linear unmixing yielded significantly higher cell numbers than SBB treatment. This finding suggests that computational approaches for removing autofluorescence in neural tissue are both viable and preferential to dye-based approaches for estimation of cell body numbers.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Whether auditory processing of speech relies on reference to the articulatory motor information of speaker remains elusive. Here, we addressed this issue under a two-brain framework. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was applied to record the brain activities of speakers when telling real-life stories and later of listeners when listening to the audio recordings of these stories. Based on between-brain seed-to-voxel correlation analyses, we revealed that neural dynamics in listeners’ auditory temporal cortex are temporally coupled with the dynamics in the speaker’s larynx/phonation area. Moreover, the coupling response in listener’s left auditory temporal cortex follows the hierarchical organization for speech processing, with response lags in A1+, STG/STS, and MTG increasing linearly. Further, listeners showing greater coupling responses understand the speech better. When comprehension fails, such interbrain auditory-articulation coupling vanishes substantially. These findings suggest that a listener’s auditory system and a speaker’s articulatory system are inherently aligned during naturalistic verbal interaction, and such alignment is associated with high-level information transfer from the speaker to the listener. Our study provides reliable evidence supporting that references to the articulatory motor information of speaker facilitate speech comprehension under a naturalistic scene.</span>

Gamma oscillations are hypothesized to temporally coordinate sensory encoding. Shin and Moore found a distinct subtype of fast spiking interneurons (FS) in SI that are nonsensory responsive and spike regularly at gamma intervals. These “gamma regular nonsensory FS” could potentially mediate perceptually relevant oscillations, independent of the LFP and sensory drive.

<p>Hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy Type 1 (HSAN1) is a rare autosomal dominantly inherited neuropathy, clinically characterized by a loss of distal peripheral sensory and motoneuronal function. Mutations in subunits of serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) have been linked to the majority of HSAN1 cases. SPTs catalyze the condensation of l-serine with palmitoyl-CoA, the first committed and rate-limiting step in <i>de novo</i> sphingolipid biosynthesis. Despite extensive investigation, the molecular pathogenesis of HSAN1 remains controversial. Here, we established a <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> (<i>C. elegans</i>) model of HSAN1 by generating a <i>sptl-1(c363g</i>) mutation, encoding SPTL-1(C121W) and equivalent to human SPTLC1<sup>C133W</sup>, at the <i>C. elegans</i> genomic locus through CRISPR. The <i>sptl-1(c363g</i>) homozygous mutants exhibited the same larval lethality and epithelial polarity defect as observed in <i>sptl-1(RNAi</i>) animals, suggesting a loss-of-function effect of the SPTL-1(C121W) mutation. <i>sptl-1(c363g)</i>/+ heterozygous mutants displayed sensory dysfunction with concomitant neuronal morphology and axon-dendrite polarity defects, demonstrating that the <i>C. elegans</i> model recapitulates characteristics of the human disease. <i>sptl-1(c363g</i>)-derived neuronal defects were copied in animals with defective sphingolipid biosynthetic enzymes downstream of SPTL-1, including ceramide glucosyltransferases, suggesting that SPTLC1<sup>C133W</sup> contributes to the HSAN1 pathogenesis by limiting the production of complex sphingolipids, including glucosylceramide. Overexpression of SPTL-1(C121W) led to similar epithelial and neuronal defects and to reduced levels of complex sphingolipids, specifically glucosylceramide, consistent with a dominant-negative effect of SPTL-1(C121W) that is mediated by loss of this downstream product. Genetic interactions between SPTL-1(C121W) and components of directional trafficking in neurons suggest that the neuronal polarity phenotype could be caused by glycosphingolipid-dependent defects in polarized vesicular trafficking.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The symptoms of inherited metabolic diseases are often attributed to the accumulation of toxic intermediates or byproducts, no matter whether the disease-causing enzyme participates in a biosynthetic or a degradation pathway. By showing that the phenotypes observed in a <i>C. elegans</i> model of HSAN1 disease could be caused by loss of a downstream product (glucosylceramide) rather than the accumulation of a toxic byproduct, our work provides new insights into the origins of the symptoms of inherited metabolic diseases while expanding the repertoire of sphingolipid functions, specifically, of glucosylceramides. These findings not only have their most immediate relevance for neuroprotective treatments for HSAN1, they may also have implications for a much broader range of neurologic conditions.</p>

<p>Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is characterized by neuronal loss in the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain. Here, we provide the first evidence of striking morphological alterations in dentate granule cells (DGCs) of FTD patients and in a mouse model of the disease, Tau<sup>VLW</sup> mice. Taking advantage of the fact that the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) gives rise to newborn DGCs throughout the lifetime in rodents, we used RGB retroviruses to study the temporary course of these alterations in newborn DGCs of female Tau<sup>VLW</sup> mice. In addition, retroviruses that encode either PSD95:GFP or Syn:GFP revealed striking alterations in the afferent and efferent connectivity of newborn Tau<sup>VLW</sup> DGCs, and monosynaptic retrograde rabies virus tracing showed that these cells are disconnected from distal brain regions and local sources of excitatory innervation. However, the same cells exhibited a predominance of local inhibitory innervation. Accordingly, the expression of presynaptic and postsynaptic markers of inhibitory synapses was markedly increased in the DG of Tau<sup>VLW</sup> mice and FTD patients. Moreover, an increased number of neuropeptide Y-positive interneurons in the DG correlated with a reduced number of activated egr-1<sup>+</sup> DGCs in Tau<sup>VLW</sup> mice. Finally, we tested the therapeutic potential of environmental enrichment and chemoactivation to reverse these alterations in mice. Both strategies reversed the morphological alterations of newborn DGCs and partially restored their connectivity in a mouse model of the disease. Moreover, our data point to remarkable morphological similarities between the DGCs of Tau<sup>VLW</sup> mice and FTD patients.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We show, for the first time to our knowledge, that the population of dentate granule cells is disconnected from other regions of the brain in the neurodegenerative disease frontotemporal dementia (FTD). These alterations were observed in FTD patients and in a mouse model of this disease. Moreover, we tested the therapeutic potential of two strategies, environmental enrichment and chemoactivation, to stimulate the activity of these neurons in mice. We found that some of the alterations were reversed by these therapeutic interventions.</p>

<p>Chronic pain is a serious debilitating disease for which effective treatment is still lacking. Acid-sensing ion channel 1a (ASIC1a) has been implicated in nociceptive processing at both peripheral and spinal neurons. However, whether ASIC1a also contributes to pain perception at the supraspinal level remains elusive. Here, we report that ASIC1a in ACC is required for thermal and mechanical hypersensitivity associated with chronic pain. ACC-specific genetic deletion or pharmacological blockade of ASIC1a reduced the probability of cortical LTP induction and attenuated inflammatory thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia in male mice. Using cell type-specific manipulations, we demonstrate that ASIC1a in excitatory neurons of ACC is a major player in cortical LTP and pain behavior. Mechanistically, we show that ASIC1a tuned pain-related cortical plasticity through protein kinase C -mediated increase of membrane trafficking of AMPAR subunit GluA1 in ACC. Importantly, postapplication of ASIC1a inhibitors in ACC reversed previously established nociceptive hypersensitivity in both chronic inflammatory pain and neuropathic pain models. These results suggest that ASIC1a critically contributes to a higher level of pain processing through synaptic potentiation in ACC, which may serve as a promising analgesic target for treatment of chronic pain.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Chronic pain is a debilitating disease that still lacks effective therapy. Ion channels are good candidates for developing new analgesics. Here, we provide several lines of evidence to support an important role of cortically located ASIC1a channel in pain hypersensitivity through promoting long-term synaptic potentiation in the ACC. Our results indicate a promising translational potential of targeting ASIC1a to treat chronic pain.</p>

<p>The accumulation of misfolded proteins is a common pathological feature of many neurodegenerative disorders, including synucleinopathies such as Parkinson's disease (PD), which is characterized by the presence of α-synuclein (α-syn)-containing Lewy bodies. However, although recent studies have investigated α-syn accumulation and propagation in neurons, the molecular mechanisms underlying α-syn transmission have been largely unexplored. Here, we examined a monogenic form of synucleinopathy caused by loss-of-function mutations in lysosomal ATP13A2/PARK9. These studies revealed that lysosomal exocytosis regulates intracellular levels of α-syn in human neurons. Loss of PARK9 function in patient-derived dopaminergic neurons disrupted lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis, reduced lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> storage, increased cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and impaired lysosomal exocytosis. Importantly, this dysfunction in lysosomal exocytosis impaired α-syn secretion from both axons and soma, promoting α-syn accumulation. However, activation of the lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel transient receptor potential mucolipin 1 (TRPML1) was sufficient to upregulate lysosomal exocytosis, rescue defective α-syn secretion, and prevent α-syn accumulation. Together, these results suggest that intracellular α-syn levels are regulated by lysosomal exocytosis in human dopaminergic neurons and may represent a potential therapeutic target for PD and other synucleinopathies.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease linked to the accumulation of α-synuclein (α-syn) in patient neurons. However, it is unclear what the mechanism might be. Here, we demonstrate a novel role for lysosomal exocytosis in clearing intracellular α-syn and show that impairment of this pathway by mutations in the PD-linked gene ATP13A2/PARK9 contributes to α-syn accumulation in human dopaminergic neurons. Importantly, upregulating lysosomal exocytosis by increasing lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels was sufficient to rescue defective α-syn secretion and accumulation in patient neurons. These studies identify lysosomal exocytosis as a potential therapeutic target in diseases characterized by the accumulation of α-syn, including PD.</p>

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00737">Insights From Dynamic Neuro-Immune Imaging on Murine Immune Responses to CNS Damage</a></h4>

Technological advances in 2-Photon Laser Scanning Microscopy (2P-LSM) have allowed novel insights into in vivo immune response in a variety of tissue microenvironments. While imaging of peripheral tissues has provided an abundance of data with regards to immune cell dynamics, central nervous system (CNS) imaging is comparatively inhibited by tissue accessibility and manipulation. Despite these limitations, the results of dynamic intravital neuro-immune imaging thus far have provided foundational insights into basic CNS biology. Utilizing a combination of intravital and ex vivo 2P-LSM we have observed novel pathways allowing immune cells, stromal cells, cancer cells and proteins to communicate between the CNS parenchyma and peripheral vasculature. Similar to what has been reported in the intestinal tract, we have visualized myeloid cells extend dendritic processes across the blood brain barrier (BBB) into pial blood vessels. Furthermore, transient vessel leaks seen during systemic inflammation provide opportunities for cellular protein to be exchanged between the periphery and CNS. These insights provide new, visual information regarding immune surveillance and antigen presentation within the CNS. Furthermore, when combining intravital 2P-LSM and microfluidic devices complexed with mathematical modeling, we are gaining new insights into the intravascular behavior of circulating immune cells. This new knowledge into the basic mechanisms by which cells migrate to and interact with the CNS provide important considerations for the design of neuroelectric devices that have the potential to connect the peripheral-neural microenvironments in a unique, artificial interface.

Parallel fiber (PF) synapses show pronounced and lasting facilitation during bursts of high-frequency activity. They typically connect to their target neurons via a single active zone (AZ), harboring few release sites (~2-8) with moderate initial vesicular release probability (~0.2-0.4). In light of these biophysical characteristics it seems surprising that PF synapses can sustain facilitation during high-frequency periods of tens of action potentials (APs). Recent findings suggest an increase in the number of occupied release sites due to ultra-rapid (~180 s-1), Ca2+ dependent recruitment of synaptic vesicles (SVs) from replenishment sites as major presynaptic mechanism of this lasting facilitation. On the molecular level, Synaptotagmin 7 or Munc13s have been suggested to be involved in mediating facilitation at PF synapses. The recruitment of SVs from replenishment sites appears to be reversible on a slower time-scale, thereby, explaining that PF synapses rapidly depress and ultimately become silent during low-frequency activity. Hence, PF synapses show high-frequency facilitation but low-frequency depression. This behavior is explained by regulation of the number of occupied release sites at the AZ by AP frequency.

Schwann cells are exquisitely sensitive to the elasticity of their environment and their differentiation and capacity to myelinate depend on the transduction of mechanical stimuli by YAP and TAZ.  YAP/TAZ, in concert with other transcription factors, regulate several pathways including lipid and sterol biosynthesis as well as extracellular matrix receptor expression such as integrins and G-proteins.  Yet, the characterization of the signaling downstream YAP/TAZ in Schwann cells is incomplete.  Myelin sheath production by Schwann cell coincides with rapid up-regulation of numerous transcription factors. Here we show that ablation of YAP/TAZ alters the expression of transcription regulators known to regulate Schwann cell myelin gene transcription and differentiation.  Furthermore, we link YAP/TAZ to two DNA binding proteins, Cc2d1b and Purβ, which have no described roles in myelinating glial cells.  We demonstrate that silencing of either Cc2d1b or Purβ limits the formation of myelin segments.  These data provide a deeper insight into the myelin gene transcriptional network and the role of YAP/TAZ in myelinating glial cells.

Two-pore domain K+ (K2P) channels generate K+ leak current, which serves a vital role in controlling and modulating neuronal excitability. This diverse family of K+ channels exhibit distinct expression and function across neuronal tissues. TWIK-related spinal cord K+ channel (TRESK) is a K2P channel with a particularly enriched role in sensory neurons and in vivo pain pathways. Here, we explored the role of TRESK across molecularly distinct sensory neuron populations and assessed its contribution to different sensory modalities. We found TRESK mRNA only in select populations of C- and A-δ nociceptors, in addition to low threshold D-hair afferents. Neurons from mice in which TRESK has been ablated demonstrated marked hyperexcitability, which was amplified under inflammatory challenge. Detailed behavioural phenotyping of TRESK knockout mice revealed specific deficits in somatosensory processing of noxious and non-noxious stimuli. These results demonstrate novel roles of TRESK in somatosensory processing and offer important information to those wishing to target the channel for therapeutic means.

A growing body of evidence supports the close relationship between major depressive disorder (MDD), a severe psychiatric disease more common among women than men, and alterations of the immune/inflammatory system. However, despite the large number of studies aimed at understanding the molecular bases of this association, a lack of information exists on the potential crosstalk between systems known to be involved in depression and components of the inflammatory response, especially with respect to sex differences.
Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a neurotrophin with a well-established role in MDD etiopathology: it is altered in depressed patients as well as in animal models of the disease and its changes are restored by antidepressant drugs. Interestingly, this neurotrophin is also involved in the inflammatory response. Indeed, it can be secreted by microglia, the primary innate immune cells in the central nervous system whose functions may be in turn regulated by BDNF.
With these premises, in this study we investigated the reciprocal impact of BDNF and the immune system by evaluating the neuroinflammatory response in male and female BDNF-heterozygous mutant mice acutely treated with the cytokine-inducer lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Specifically, we assessed the potential insurgence of an LPS-induced sickness behavior as well as changes of inflammatory mediators in the mouse hippocampus and frontal cortex, with respect to both genotype and sex.
We found that the increased inflammatory response induced by LPS in the brain of male mice was independentby the genotype, whereas in the female it was restricted to the heterozygous mice with no changes in the wild-type group, suggestive of a role for BDNF in the sex-dependent effect of the inflammatory challenge.
Considering the involvement of both BDNF and neuroinflammation in several psychiatric diseases and the diverse incidence of such pathologies in males and females, a deeper investigation of the mechanisms underlying their interaction may have a critical translational relevance.

Neurodevelopmental disorders represent a challenging biological and medical problem due to their genetic and phenotypic complexity. In many cases, we lack the comprehensive understanding of disease mechanism necessary for targeted therapeutic development. One key component that could improve both mechanistic understanding and clinical trial design is reliable molecular biomarkers. Presently, no objective biological markers exist to evaluate most neurodevelopmental disorders.  Here we discuss how systems biology and 'omic' approaches could address the mechanistic and biomarker limitations in these afflictions. We present heuristic principles for testing the potential of systems biology to identify mechanisms and biomarkers of disease in the example of Rett syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by a well-defined monogenic defect in MECP2. We propose that such an approach can not only aid in monitoring clinical disease severity, but can also provide a measure of target engagement in clinical trials. By deepening our understanding of the “big picture” of systems biology, this path could even help generate hypotheses for drug development programs, hopefully resulting in new treatments for these devastating conditions.

Sensory processing disorder (SPD), a developmental regulatory condition characterized by marked under- or over-responsivity to non-noxious sensory stimulation, is a common but poorly understood disorder that can profoundly affect mood, cognition, social behavior and adaptive life skills. Little is known about the etiology and neural underpinnings. Clinical research indicates that children with SPD show greater prevalence of difficulties in complex cognitive behavior including working memory, behavioral flexibility, and regulation of sensory and affective functions, which are related to prefrontal cortex (PFC), striatal, and midbrain regions. Neuroimaging may provide insight into mechanisms underlying SPD, and animal experiments provide important evidence that is not available in human studies. Rhesus monkeys (N = 73) were followed over a 20-year period from birth into old age. We focused on a single sensory modality, the tactile system, measured at 5-7 years, because of its critical importance for nourishment, attachment, and social reward in development. Positron emission tomography imaging was conducted at ages 12-18 years to quantify the availability of the D1 and D2 subtypes of the DA receptor (D1R and D2R), and the DA transporter (DAT). Heightened tactile responsivity was related to (a) elevated D1R in PFC overall, including lateral, ventrolateral, medial, anterior cingulate (aCg), frontopolar, and orbitofrontal (OFC) subregions, as well as nucleus accumbens (Acb), (b) reduced D2R in aCg, OFC, and substantia nigra / ventral tegmental area, and (c) elevated DAT in putamen. These findings suggest a mechanism by which DA pathways may be altered in SPD. These pathways are associated with reward processing and pain regulation, providing top-down regulation of sensory and affective processes. The balance between top-down cognitive control in the PFC-Acb pathway and bottom-up motivational function of the VTA-Acb-PFC pathway is critical for successful adaptive function. An imbalance in these two systems might explain DA-related symptoms in children with SPD, including reduced top-down regulatory function and exaggerated responsivity to stimuli. These results provide more direct evidence that SPD may involve altered DA receptor and transporter function in PFC, striatal, and midbrain regions. More work is needed to extend these results to humans.

One set of hypotheses focuses on the temporal structure of perceptual experience and links auditory cortex asymmetries to underlying differences in neural populations with differential temporal sensitivity (e.g. ideas advanced by Zatorre et al. 20021; Poeppel 20032). The Asymmetric Sampling in Time theory (AST; Poeppel 20032), builds on cytoarchitectonic differences between auditory cortices and predicts that modulation frequencies within the range of, roughly, the syllable rate, are more accurately tracked by the right hemisphere. To date, this conjecture is reasonably well supported, since - while there is some heterogeneity in the reported findings - the predicted asymmetrical entrainment has been observed in various experimental protocols. Here, we show that under specific processing demands, the rightward dominance disappears. We propose an enriched and modified version of the asymmetric sampling hypothesis in the context of speech. Recent work (Rimmele et al. 20183) proposes two different mechanisms to underlie the auditory tracking of the speech envelope: one derived from the intrinsic oscillatory properties of auditory regions; the other induced by top-down signals coming from other non-auditory regions of the brain. We propose that under non-speech listening conditions, the intrinsic auditory mechanism dominates and thus, in line with AST, entrainment is rightward lateralized, as is widely observed. However, (i) depending on individual brain structural/functional differences, and/or (ii) in the context of specific speech listening conditions, the relative weight of the top-down mechanism can increase. In this scenario, the typically observed auditory sampling asymmetry (and its rightward dominance) diminishes or vanishes.

Background: Multi-site MRI studies are often necessary for recruiting sufficiently-sized samples when studying rare conditions. However, they require pooling data from multiple scanners into a single data set, and therefore it is critical to evaluate the variability of quantitative MRI measures within and across scanners used in multi-site studies. The aim of this study was to evaluate the reproducibility of structural and diffusion weighted MRI measurements acquired on seven scanners at five medical centers as part of the Tuberous Sclerosis Complex Autism Center of Excellence Research Network (TACERN) multisite study. 

Methods: The American College of Radiology phantom was imaged monthly to measure reproducibility of signal intensity and uniformity within and across seven 3T scanners from General Electric, Philips, and Siemens vendors. One healthy adult male volunteer was imaged repeatedly on all seven scanners under the TACERN structural and diffusion weighted protocol (5 b=0 s/mm2 and 30 b=1000 s/mm2) over a period of 5 years (age 22-27 years). Reproducibility of inter- and intra-scanner brain segmentation volumes and diffusion tensor imaging metrics fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) within white matter regions was quantified with coefficient of variation.  

Results: ACR Phantom signal intensity and uniformity were similar across scanners and changed little over time, with a mean intra-scanner coefficient of variation of 3.6% and 1.8%, respectively. The mean inter- and intra-scanner coefficients of variation of brain structure volumes derived from T1-weighted images of the human phantom were 3.3% and 1.1%, respectively. The mean inter- and intra-scanner coefficients of variation of FA in white matter regions were 4.5% and 2.5%, while the mean inter- and intra-scanner coefficients of variation of MD in white matter regions were 5.4% and 1.5%. 

Conclusions: Our results suggest that volumetric and diffusion tensor imaging measurements are highly reproducible between and within scanners and provide typical variation amplitudes that can be used as references to interpret future findings in the TACERN network.

Erythropoietin (EPO) not only is a hormone that promotes erythropoiesis but also has a neuroprotective effect on hypoxic neurons related with their known antiapoptotic action. In a focal brain-hypoxia model, our group have previously demonstrated that recombinant-human EPO (rHu-Epo) can protect neurons with a Hypoxia Inducible Factor 1 (HIF-1) expression of EPO-receptor (EPO-R) and P-glycoprotein (P-gp). We and others also have reported that repetitive seizures can mimic a hypoxic-like condition by HIF-1nuclear translocationand high neuronal expression P-gp. Here, we document not only that excitotoxic stress can also induce the expression of EPO-R, but rHu-EPO can reverse the P-gp transport activity under the mentioned hypoxic-like conditions. A single status epilepticus (SE) of twenty minutes was induced in adult rats using the lithium-pilocarpine model. In vitro, primary cultures of neurons were briefly exposed to an excitotoxic concentration of glutamate (300 µM), while cultured astroglial-cells were treated for 6h with 0.3 mM of CoCl2, and later, the inhibitory effect of increased concentrations of rHu-Epo on Rhodamine 123 (Rho-123) P-gp dependent efflux was assayed. The specific P-gp blocker Tariquidar (1 µM) or saline, were used as positive or negative inhibitory controls respectively. SE promoted high co-expression of P-gp and EPO-R in cortical neurons and astrocytes. In vitro, neurons treated with glutamic acid exhibited nuclear translocation of HIF-1 and NFB and high overexpression P-gp and EPO-R. In cultured astroglial-cells treated with CoCl2, rHu-Epo recovered significantly the Rho-123 retention in a similar way of tariquidar. Our results confirm that convulsive stress promotes nuclear translocations of HIF- and NFkB transcription factors with a concomitant induction of neuronal expression of P-gp and EPO-R, suggesting that convulsive stress could mimic a hypoxic condition without oxygen deprivation. Furthermore, we demonstrate for the first time that rHu-Epo can inhibit the Rho-123 efflux activity. All these data suggest that EPO/EPO-R system stimulation could play a central role not only in brain cell protection after different stress signals, but also it could reverse the pharmacoresistant phenotype in refractory epilepsy as well as in other pharmacoresistant hypoxic brain diseases simultaneously expressing EPO-R and P-gp.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00739">Experience-Dependent Structural Plasticity of Adult-Born Neurons in the Aging Hippocampus</a></h4>

Synaptic modification in cortical structures underlies the acquisition of novel information that results in learning and memory formation.  In the adult dentate gyrus, circuit remodeling is boosted by the generation of new granule cells (GCs) that contribute to specific aspects of memory encoding. These forms of plasticity decrease in the aging brain, where both the rate of adult neurogenesis and the speed of morphological maturation of newly-generated neurons decline. In the young-adult brain, a brief novel experience accelerates the integration of new neurons. The extent to which such degree of plasticity is preserved in the aging hippocampus remains unclear. In this work, we characterized the time course of functional integration of adult-born GCs in middle-aged mice. We performed whole-cell recordings in developing GCs from Ascl1CreERT2;CAGfloxStopTom mice and found a late onset of functional excitatory synaptogenesis, which occurred at 4 weeks (vs. 2 weeks in young-adult mice). Overall mature excitability and maximal glutamatergic connectivity were achieved at 10 weeks. In contrast, large mossy fiber boutons (MFBs) in CA3 displayed mature morphological features including filopodial extensions at 4 weeks, suggesting that efferent connectivity develops faster than afference. Notably, new GCs from aging mice exposed to enriched environment for 7 days showed an advanced degree of maturity at 3 weeks, revealed by the high frequency of excitatory postsynaptic responses, complex dendritic trees, and large size of MFBs with filopodial extensions. These findings demonstrate that adult-born neurons act as sensors that transduce behavioral stimuli into major network remodeling in the aging brain.

Epilepsy is a serious neurological disorder and characterized by recurrent and unprovoked seizures. A critical pathological factor in the seizure genesis is neuronal loss. Until now, apart from the known regulatory cell death pathways, the newest one is ferroptosis, a newly discovered type of cell death with the features of iron accumulation and excessive production of lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS). In our present work, it was illustrated that ferroptosis occurred in murine models of pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) kindling and pilocarpine (Pilo)-induced seizures. In both of these two seizure models, treatment with ferroptosis inhibitor ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1) efficiently alleviated seizures. This was through elevated levels of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and glutathione (GSH) as well as inhibitions of lipid degradation product including 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) and malonaldehyde (MDA), iron accumulation and PTGS2 mRNA in hippocampus. It is concluded that ferroptosis is involved in the seizure genesis in PTZ- and Pilo-treated mice, and suppression of ferroptosis mitigates PTZ kindling and Pilo-induced seizures in mice.

Migraine is a highly disabling disease characterized by recurrent pain.Despite an intensive effort, mechanisms of migraine pathophysiology,  still represent an unsolved issue. Evidences from both animals and humans studies suggest that migraine is characterized by hyperresponsivity or hyperexcitability of sensory cortices, especially the visual cortex. This phenomenon, in turn, may affect multisensory processing. Indeed, migraineurs present with an abnormal, reduced, perception of the Sound-induced Flash Illusion (SiFI), a crossmodal illusion that relies on optimal integration of visual and auditory stimuli by the occipital visual cortex. Decreasing visual cortical excitability with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can increase the SiFI in healthy subjects.
Moving from these issues , we applied cathodal tDCS over the visual cortex of migraineurs, with and without aura, in order to decrease cortical excitability and thus physiologically restoring the perception of a reliable SiFI. Differently from our expectations tDCS was unable to reliably modulate SiFI in migraine. The chronic, relatively excessive, visual cortex hyperexcitability, , featuring the migraineur brain, may render tDCS ineffective for restoring multisensory processing in this disease.

Background: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a neuropsychiatric affective disorder that can develop after traumatic life-events. Exposure-based therapy is currently one of the most effective treatments for PTSD. However, exposure to traumatic stimuli is so aversive that a significant number of patients drop-out of therapy during the course of treatment. Among various attempts to develop novel therapies that bypass such aversiveness, neurofeedback appears promising. With neurofeedback, patients can unconsciously self-regulate brain activity via real-time monitoring and feedback of the EEG or fMRI signals. With conventional neurofeedback methods, however, it is difficult to induce neural representation related to specific trauma because the feedback is based on the neural signals averaged within specific brain areas. To overcome this difficulty, novel neurofeedback approaches such as Decoded Neurofeedback (DecNef) might prove helpful. Instead of the average BOLD signals, DecNef allows patients to implicitly regulate multivariate voxel patterns of the BOLD signals related with feared stimuli.  Here, we review recent advances in application of neurofeedback to PTSD treatments, including the DecNef. This review is intended to be informative for neuroscientists in general as well as practitioners planning to use neurofeedback as a therapeutic strategy for PTSD. 
Methods:  Follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, a systematic review was conducted to compare DecNef effect with those of conventional EEG/fMRI-based neurofeedback on PTSD amelioration. To elucidate the possible mechanisms of DecNef on fear reduction, we mathematically modeled the effects of exposure-based and counter conditioning separately and applied it to the data obtained from past DecNef studies. Finally, we conducted DecNef on four PTSD patients.
Results: Our mathematical model suggested that exposure is the key component for DecNef effects in the past studies. Following DecNef a significant reduction of PTSD severity was observed. This effect was comparable to those reported for conventional neurofeedback approach. 
Conclusions: Although a much larger number of participants will be needed in future, DecNef could be a promising therapy that bypasses the unpleasantness of conscious exposure associated with conventional therapies for fear related disorders, including PTSD.

The anatomical organization of distinct regions in the insect brain often reflects their functions. In the present study, the brain structure of A. lucorum was examined by using immunolabeling and three-dimensional reconstruction. The results revealed the location and volume of prominent neuropils, such as the antennal lobes, optic lobes, anterior optic tubercles, central body, lateral accessory lobes, mushroom lobes, and distinct tritocerebral neuropils. As expected, this brain is similar to that of other insects. One exception, however, is that the antennal lobes were found to be the most prominent neuropils. Their size relative to the entire brain is the largest among all insect species studied so far. In contrast, the calyx, a region getting direct input from the antennal lobe, has a smaller size relative to the brain than that of other species. These findings may suggest that olfaction plays an essential role for A. lucorum.

When sentence processing taxes verbal working memory, comprehension difficulties arise. This is specifically the case when processing resources decline with advancing adult age. Such decline likely affects the encoding of sentences into working memory, which constitutes the basis for successful comprehension. To assess age differences in encoding-related electrophysiological activity, we recorded the electroencephalogram from three age groups (24, 43, 65 years). Using an auditory sentence comprehension task, age differences in encoding-related oscillatory power were examined with respect to the accuracy of the given response. That is, the difference in oscillatory power between correctly and incorrectly encoded sentences, yielding subsequent memory effects (SME), was compared across age groups. Across age groups, we observed an age-related SME inversion in the alpha band from a power decrease in younger adults to a power increase in older adults. We suggest that this SME inversion underlies age-related comprehension difficulties. With alpha being commonly linked to inhibitory processes, this shift may reflect a change in the cortical inhibition–disinhibition balance. A cortical disinhibition may imply enriched sentence encoding in younger adults. In contrast, resource limitations in older adults may necessitate an increase in cortical inhibition during sentence encoding to avoid an information overload. Overall, our findings tentatively suggest that age-related comprehension difficulties are associated with alterations to the electrophysiological dynamics subserving general higher cognitive functions.

Postoperative cognitive decline (POCD) is a significant complication of surgery in elderly patients. Emerging researches showed that long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) may play a critical role in the pathogenesis of POCD. Here we aimed to identify potential key lncRNAs involved in the development of POCD. LncRNA and mRNA expression profiles in hippocampal tissues from POCD and control mice were analyzed by microarray assay. Gene ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses were conducted to probe the functions of dysregulated genes. Then, important factors of the mainly affected biological processes were measured in the hippocampus. Correlated coding-noncoding co-expression (CNC) networks were constructed. Finally, the potential key pairs of lncRNA and target mRNA implicated in POCD were probed. Our results showed that a total of 868 differentially expressed lncRNAs and 690 expressed mRNAs were identified. GO and KEGG analyses indicated that the differentially expressed genes were mainly associated with inflammatory and apoptotic signaling pathways. Surgery-induced inflammatory cytokines and apoptosis were significantly increased in hippocampal tissues of aged mice. In CNC network analysis, we found that LncRNA uc009qbj.1 was negatively correlated with apoptosis-associated gene Vrk2 level. LncRNA ENSMUST00000174338 correlated positively with expression of the inflammation and apoptosis-associated gene Smad7. LncRNA NONMMUT00000123687 mediated gene expression by binding the inflammation-regulated transcription factor Meis2. Our results suggested that these potential key lncRNAs and mRNAs may play a vital role in the development of POCD through mediating neuronal inflammation or apoptosis.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00178">Pioglitazone Reduces β Amyloid Levels via Inhibition of PPARγ Phosphorylation in a Neuronal Model of Alzheimer’s Disease</a></h4>

It has been demonstrated that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) can regulate the transcription of its target gene, insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) , and thus enhance the expression of the IDE protein. The protein can degrade β amyloid (Aβ), a core pathological product of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). PPARγ can also regulate the transcription of other target gene, β-amyloid cleavage enzyme 1 (BACE1), and thus inhibit the expression of the BACE1 protein. BACE1 can hydrolyze amyloid precursor protein (APP), the precursor of Aβ. In adipose tissue, PPARγ agonists can inhibit the phosphorylation of PPARγ by inhibiting cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5), which in turn affects the expression of target genes regulated by PPARγ. PPARγ agonists may also exert inhibitory effects on the phosphorylation of PPARγ in the brain, thereby affecting the expression of the aforementioned PPARγ target genes and reducing Aβ levels. The present study confirmed this hypothesis by showing that PPARγ agonist pioglitazone attenuated the neuronal apoptosis of primary rat hippocampal neurons induced by Aβ1-42, downregulated CDK5 expression, weakened the binding of CDK5 to PPARγ, reduced PPARγ phosphorylation, increased the expression of PPARγ and IDE, decreased the expression of BACE1, reduced APP production, and downregulated intraneuronal Aβ1-42 levels. These effects were inhibited by the PPARγ antagonist GW9662. After CDK5 silencing with CDK5 shRNA, the above effect of pioglitazone was not observed, except when upregulating the expression of PPARγ in Aβ1-42 treated neurons. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that pioglitazone could inhibit the phosphorylation of PPARγ in vitro by inhibiting CDK5 expression, which in turn affected the expression of PPARγ target genes Ide and Bace1, thereby promoting Aβ degradation and reducing Aβ production. This reduced Aβ levels in the brain, thereby exerting neuroprotective effects in an AD model.

Alzheimer’s disease (AD), which afflicts an estimated 20 million people worldwide, is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly and constitutes the fourth leading cause of death in the developed world. The major neuropathological features of AD are synaptic and neuronal degeneration and the presence of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. The main protein component of the amyloid plaques is the amyloid-beta peptide (Aβ). Accumulation of Aβ in the brain of AD patients is thought to be central in the pathogenesis of AD. During the last decade, it has become been clear that the synaptic loss and neuronal degeneration underlying early cognitive impairments are caused by small aggregates termed Aβ oligomers.
The blood brain barrier (BBB) is a layer of tightly packed cells that normally regulates the entry of substances into the brain, whiles maintains the removal of toxic molecules from brain to blood. Alzheimer ́s patients and research models evidence BBB impairment and dysfunction accompanying AD. It is not clearly understood if Aβ clearance through the BBB is affected in AD and whether this dynamic is affected by an impaired peripheral clearance due to other non-neurological pathological conditions. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), is a spectrum of liver disorders characterized by accumulation of fat in the liver accompanied by varying degrees of inflammation and hepatocyte injury. In the last decade, NAFLD has been the focus of intense research due of its pandemic reach (estimated prevalence between 20 and 30% of the general population). This review summarizes the current state of the literature linking NAFLD and Alzheimer ́s disease, highlighting the role of the major Aβ efflux and clearance player - the LRP1 receptor- which is abundantly expressed in liver, brain, and vasculatures.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00173">Incidental Learning: A Systematic Review of Its Effect on Episodic Memory Performance in Older Age</a></h4>

Episodic memory is the capacity to encode, store, and retrieve information of specific past events. Several studies have shown that decline in episodic memory accompanies aging, but most of these studies assessed memory performance through intentional learning. In this approach, the individuals deliberately acquire knowledge. Yet, another method to evaluate episodic memory performance - receiving less attention by the research community - is incidental learning. Here, participants do not explicitly intent to learn. Incidental learning becomes increasingly important over the lifespan, since people spent less time in institutions where intentional learning is required (e.g., school, university, or at work). Yet, we know little how incidental learning impacts episodic memory performance in advanced age. Likewise, the neural mechanisms underlying incidental learning in older age remain largely unknown. 
Thus, the immediate goal of this review was to summarize the existing literature on how incidental learning changes with age and how neural mechanisms map onto these age-related changes. We considered behavioural as well as neuroimaging studies using incidental learning paradigms (alone or in combination with intentional learning) to assess episodic memory performance in elderly adults. We conducted a systematic literature search on the Medline/PubMed, Cochrane and OVID SP databases and searched the reference lists of articles. The search yielded 238 studies, of which 27 concerned incidental learning and episodic memory in older adults.
In sum, these studies suggest that aging particularly affects episodic memory after incidental learning for cognitively demanding tasks. Monitoring deficits in older adults might account for these findings since cognitively demanding tasks need increased attentional resources. On a neuronal level, dysregulation of the default-mode-network mirrors monitoring deficits, with an attempt to compensate through increased frontal activity. Future (neuroimaging) studies should systematically evaluate retrieval tasks with diverging cognitive load and consider the influence of attention and executive functions in more detail.

To effectively promote life-long health and resilience against — for example — neurodegenerative diseases, evidence-based recommendations must acknowledge the complex multidimensionality not only of the diseases but also of personal lifestyle. In a straightforward descriptive and heuristic framework, 50+ potential lifestyle factors cluster around diet (D), education (E), exercise (E) and purpose (P), unveiling their many relationships across domains and scales. The resulting systematics and its visualization might be a small but helpful step towards the development of more comprehensive, interdisciplinary models of lifestyle-dependent risk and resilience and a means to explain the opportunities and limitations of preventive measures to the public and other stakeholders. Most importantly, this perspective onto the subject implies that not all lifestyle factors are created equal but that there is a hierarchy of values and needs that influences the success of life-style based interventions.

There are inherent trade-offs between the flexibility and the capacity of working memory, or the ability to temporarily hold information “in mind.” In a recent issue of Neuron, Bouchacourt and Buschman (2019) present a new model of working memory that demonstrates how coordinated activity between specialized sensory networks and flexible higher-order networks may support these competing constraints.

Neuronal populations respond within a small number of relevant dimensions. New research by Trautmann et al. (2019) shows that spike sorting is not necessary to extract the important features of this low-dimensional population signal. Combined responses of multiple neurons (multiunit activity) only generate small changes in the extracted signals.

The promises of nanomedicine are extensive. Graphene, the first true two-dimensional material to exist in isolation, is the type of new nanomaterial that results in interest for novel biomedical applications. From Michael Chrichton’s tragic protagonist in The Terminal Man to the recent growth in start-up companies seeking to transfer consciousness, the fictive present and future call to mind visions of devices that enable neural interfacing and control. Although these ideas may create questions as to ethics for neuroscience in the future, the current state-of-the-art for implanted devices is far more limited in scope. Progress in brain-computer interfaces holds great promise for patients following stroke (Ramos-Murguialday, Broetz et al. 2013), to control prosthetic limbs (Hochberg, Serruya et al. 2006, Donoghue, Nurmikko et al. 2007) , with the motor degeneration characteristic of Parkinson’s disease (Little, Pogosyan et al. 2013), and for a variety of other disorders and diseases (Chaudhary, Birbaumer et al. 2016). Graphene may be poised for incorporation into such devices. As the presence of graphene becomes more widespread and commonplace across the biomedical sciences, the relatively larger body of work detailing the biological effects of carbon nanotubes may serve as a template guiding the utility of graphene for biological applications (Kostarelos, Bianco et al. 2009). 
Graphene-based materials for interfacing with the peripheral nervous system have been reviewed elsewhere (Domínguez-Bajo, González-Mayorga et al. 2017). We instead focus on new directions for application to the central nervous system. This review is limited to preclinical applications, although graphene and graphene-based devices may someday advance to clinical implementation.  We begin with an overview of graphene manufacturing advances, applications to hybrid materials systems as well as drug delivery strategies. This is followed by an overview of work performed with non-murine models.  Finally, the interaction of graphene with murine neural systems, both in vivo and in-vitro is examined.  Despite a sizable body of work, to date there remain many unresolved questions as to cytotoxicity and the mechanisms underlying the graphene-cellular interaction that must be addressed moving forward.

In today’s society it becomes increasingly important to assess which non-human and non-verbal beings possess consciousness. This review aims to delineate criteria for consciousness especially in animals, while also taking into account intelligent artifacts. First, we circumscribe what we mean with “consciousness” and describe key features of subjective experience: qualitative richness, situatedness, intentionality and interpretation, integration and the combination of dynamic and stabilizing properties. We argue that consciousness has a biological function, which is to present the subject with a multimodal, situational survey of the surrounding world and body, subserving complex decision-making and goal-directed behavior. This survey reflects the brain’s capacity for internal modelling of external events underlying changes in sensory state. Next, we follow an inside-out approach: how can the features of conscious experience, correlating to mechanisms inside the brain, be logically coupled to externally observable (‘outside’) properties? Instead of proposing criteria that would each define a “hard” threshold for consciousness, we outline six indicators: (i) goal-directed behavior and model-based learning, (ii) anatomic and physiological substrates for generating integrative multimodal representations, (iii) psychometrics and meta-cognition, (iv) episodic memory, (v) susceptibility to illusions and multistable perception, and (vi) specific visuospatial behaviors. Rather than emphasizing a particular indicator as being decisive, we propose that the consistency amongst these indicators can serve to assess consciousness in particular species. The integration of scores on the various indicators yields an overall, graded criterion for consciousness, somewhat comparable to the Glasgow Coma Scale for unresponsive patients. When considering theoretically derived measures of consciousness, it is argued that their validity should not be assessed on the basis of a single quantifiable measure, but requires cross-examination across multiple pieces of evidence, including the indicators proposed here. Current intelligent machines, including deep learning neural networks and agile robots, are not indicated to be conscious yet. Instead of assessing machine consciousness by a brief Turing-type of test, evidence for it may gradually accumulate when we study machines ethologically and across time, considering multiple behaviors that require flexibility, improvisation, spontaneous problem-solving and the situational conspectus typically associated with conscious experience.

Maintaining Ca2+ homeostasis in lymphatic fluids is necessary for proper hearing. Despite its significance, the mechanisms that maintain the cochlear lymphatic Ca2+ concentrations within a certain range are not fully clarified. We investigated the functional expression of calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR), which plays a pivotal role in sensing extracellular Ca2+ concentrations. Western blotting for CaSR revealed an approximately 130-kDa protein expression in cochlear tissue extracts and immunohistochemical analysis revealed its expression specifically in type I fibrocytes in the spiral ligament, fibrocytes in the supralimbal and limbal regions, the epithelium of the osseous spiral lamina, and the smooth muscle cells of the spiral modiolar arteries. Ca2+ imaging demonstrated that extracellular Ca2+ increased the levels of intracellular Ca2+ in CaSR-expressing fibrocytes in the spiral ligament, and that this was suppressed by the CaSR inhibitor, NPS2143. Furthermore, hearing thresholds were moderately elevated by intracochlear application of the CaSR inhibitors NPS2143 and calhex231, across a range of frequencies (8-32 kHz). These results demonstrate the functional expression of CaSR in the cochlear perilymphatic compartment. In addition, the elevated hearing thresholds that are achieved by inhibiting CaSR suggest this is a required mechanism for normal hearing, presumably by sensing perilymphatic Ca2+ to stabilize Ca2+ concentrations within a certain range. These results provide novel insight into the mechanisms regulating Ca2+ homeostasis in the cochlea and provide a new perspective on cochlear physiology.

The remarkable physiology of the electric eel (Electrophorus electricus) made it one of the first model species in science.  It was pivotal for understanding animal electricity in the 1700’s, was investigated by Humboldt and Faraday in the 1800’s, was leveraged to isolate the acetylcholine receptor in the 20th century, and has inspired the design of new power sources and provided insights to electric organ evolution in the 21st century.  And yet few studies have investigated the electric eel’s behavior.  This review focuses on a series of recently discovered behaviors that evolved alongside the eel’s extreme physiology.  Eels use their high-voltage electric discharge to remotely control prey by transcutaneously activating motor neurons.  Hunting eels use this behavior in two different ways. When prey have been detected, eels use high-voltage to cause immobility by inducing sustained, involuntary muscle contractions.  On the other hand, when prey are hidden, eels often use brief pulses to induce prey twitch, which causes a water movement detected by the eel’s mechanoreceptors.  Once grasped in the eel’s jaws, difficult prey are often subdued by sandwiching them between the two poles (head and tail) of the eel’s powerful electric organ.  The resulting concentration of the high-voltage discharge, delivered at high-rates, causes involuntary fatigue in prey muscles. This novel strategy for inactivating muscles is functionally analogous to poisoning the neuromuscular junction with venom.  For self-defense, electric eels leap from the water to directly electrify threats, efficiently activating nociceptors to deter their target.  The latter behavior supports a legendary account by Alexander von Humboldt who described a battle between electric eels and horses in 1800.  Finally, electric eels use high-voltage not only as a weapon, but also to efficiently track fast moving prey with active electroreception.  In conclusion, remarkable behaviors go hand in hand with remarkable physiology.

Neurodegenerative diseases have mainly been associated with neuronal death. Recent investigations have shown that astroglia may modulate neuroinflammation in the early and late stages of the disease. [11C]Deuterodeprenyl ([11C]DED) is a tracer that has been used for reactive astrocyte detection in Alzheimer’s disease, Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, among others, with some limitations. To develop a new radiotracer for detecting astrocytosis and overcoming associated difficulties, we recently reported the synthesis of a sulfonamide derivative of Sulforhodamine 101 (SR101), labelled with 18F, namely SR101 N-(3-[18F]Fluoropropyl) sulfonamide ([18F]2B-SRF101). The red fluorescent dye SR101 has been used as a specific marker of astroglia in the neocortex of rodents using in vivo models. In the present work we performed a biological characterisation of the new tracer including biodistribution and micro-PET/computed tomography (CT) images. PET/CT studies with [11C]DED were also done to compare with [18F]2B-SRF101 in order to assess its potential as an astrocyte marker.
Biodistribution studies with [18F]2B-SRF101 were carried out in C57BL6J black and transgenic (3xTg) mice. A hepatointestinal metabolization as well as the pharmacokinetic profile were determined, showing appropriate characteristics to become a PET diagnostic agent.  Dynamic PET/CT studies were carried out with [18F]2B-SRF101 and [11C]DED to evaluate the distribution of both tracers in the brain. 

A significant difference in [18F]2B-SRF101 uptake was especially observed in the cortex and hippocampus, and it was higher in 3xTg mice than it was in the control group. These results suggested that [18F]2B-SRF101 is a promising candidate for more extensive evaluation as an astrocyte tracer. 

The difference observed for [18F]2B-SRF101 was not found in the case of [11C]DED. The comparative studies between [18F]2B-SRF101 and [11C]DED suggest that both tracers have different roles as astrocytosis markers in this animal model, and could provide different and complementary information at the same time. In this way, by means of a multitracer approach, useful information could be obtained for the staging of the disease.

Background and purpose: Previous neuroimaging studies have demonstrated T2D-related brain structural and functional changes that are partly associated with cognitive decline. However, less is known about the underlying mechanisms. Chronic hyperglycemia and microvascular complications are the two of most important risk factors related to cognitive decline in diabetes. Cerebral small vessel diseases (CSVDs), such as those defined by lacunar infarcts, white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) and microhemorrhages, are also associated with an increased risk of cognitive decline and dementia. In this study, we examined brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) changes in patients in the early stages of T2D without CSVDs to focus on glucose metabolism factors and avoid the interference of vascular risk factors on T2D-related brain damage.
Methods: T2D patients with disease durations of less than five years and without any signs of CSVDs (n＝34) were compared with healthy control subjects (n＝24). Whole-brain region-based functional connectivity was analyzed with network-based statistics (NBS), and brain surface morphology was examined. In addition, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was conducted for all subjects.
Results: At the whole-brain region-based functional connectivity level, thirty-three functional connectivities were changed in T2D patients relative to those in controls, mostly manifested as hyperconnectivities and mainly located between the sensory-motor network and auditory network. Some of the connectivities were positively correlated with blood glucose level, insulin resistance, and MoCA scores in the T2D group. The network-level analysis also showed between-network hyperconnectivity in T2D patients but no significant changes in within-network connectivity. In addition, there were no significant differences in MoCA scores or brain morphology measures, including cortical thickness, surface area, mean curvature, and gray/white matter volume, between the two groups.
Conclusion: The findings indicate that brain hyperconnectivity occurs in the early stages of T2D without CSVDs before the presence of significant brain morphology change and cognitive decline, which may be a neuroimaging basis for predicting cognitive decline in early T2D patients.

As the third cause of death and cognitive decline in industrialized countries, stroke is a major burden for society. Vascular risks factors such as hypertension and diabetes are involved in most stroke patients, aggravate stroke severity, but are still poorly taken into account in preclinical studies. Microangiopathy and sustained inflammation are exacerbated, likely explaining the severity of stroke in those patients. We sought to demonstrate that intravenous administration of human adipose derived-mesenchymal stem cells (hADMSC) that have immunomodulatory properties, could accelerate sensorimotor recovery, prevent long-term spatial memory and promote neurogenesis, in diabetic or hypertensive mice subjected to permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAo). Diabetic (streptozotocin IP) or hypertensive (L-NAME per os) male C57Bl6 mice subjected to pMCAo, were treated by hADMSC (500,000 cells IV) 2 days post stroke. Infarct volume, neurogenesis microglial/macrophage density, T-lymphocytes density, astrocytes density and vessel density were monitored 7 days after cells injection and at 6 weeks. Neurological sensorimotor deficit and spatial memory were assessed until six weeks post stroke. Whatever the vascular risk factor, hADMSC showed no effect on functional recovery/cognitive decline prevention at short or long-term assessment, nor significantly modified neurogenesis microglial/macrophage, T-lymphocytes, astrocytes and vessel density. This work is part of a European program (H2020, RESSTORE). We discuss the discrepancy of our results with those obtained in rats and the importance of timing, source and type of cells according to the species that is considered. A comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms preventing recovery should help for successful clinical translation but first could allow identifying good and bad responders to cell therapy in stroke.

Guillain Barré Syndrome (GBS) is an autoimmune disorder caused by the immune system damaging the peripheral nervous system. Increasing evidence suggest that inflammatory cytokines are important mediators for the onset and progression of GBS. A number of clinical studies have demonstrated elevated levels of Th1, Th2 and Th17 related cytokines in the patients with GBS, but results were inconsistent across studies.  Therefore, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies comparing cerebrospinal fluid and peripheral blood inflammatory cytokine levels between the patients with GBS and healthy individuals. The database search identified 30 studies encompassing 1302 GBS patients and 1073 controls to be included. The random-effects meta-analysis demonstrated that blood tumor necrosis factor-ɑ (Hedges g,1.544; 95% CI, 0.923-2.165; p &lt; 0.001), interleukin-1β (IL-1β; Hedges g, 0.678; 95% CI, 0.183-1.172; p = 0.007), IL-6 (Hedges g, 0.630; 95% CI, 0.100 -1.160; p = 0.02), IL-4 (Hedges g, 0.822; 95% CI, 0.220-1.423; p = 0.007 ), IL-17 (Hedges g, 1.452; 95% CI, 0.331-2.573; p = 0.011), interferon-γ (Hedges g,1.104; 95% CI, 0.490-1.719; p &lt; 0.001) and C-reactive protein (Hedges g, 0.909; 95% CI, 0.453-1.365; p &lt; 0.001) levels were significantly increased in the patients with GBS when compared with controls. In contrast, the blood IL-10 and TGF-β levels were not significantly associated with GBS. Furthermore, the meta-analysis found that cerebrospinal fluid IL-17 levels were significantly associated with GBS (Hedges g, 1.882; 95% CI, 0.104-3.661; p = 0.038). Taken together, our results clarified the circulating inflammatory cytokine profile in the patients with GBS, and revealed that Th1, Th2 and Th17 related cytokines were highly elevated in the GBS patients, and suggesting the potential of these cytokines to be used as biomarkers for GBS.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00246">Parallel Changes in Cognitive Function and Gray Matter Volume After Multi-Component Training of Cognitive Control (MTCC) in Adolescents</a></h4>

Adolescence is a unique period in which higher cognition develops to adult-level, while plasticity of neuron and behavior is at one of its peak. Yet, cognitive training studies for adolescents has been sparse and neural correlates of the training effects yet to be established. This study investigated the effects of multicomponent training of cognitive control (MTCC) in order to examine whether the training enhanced adolescents' cognitive control ability and if the effects were generalizable to other cognitive domains. Cognitive control refers to the ability to adjust a series of thoughts and behaviors in correspondence to an internal goal, and involves inhibition, working memory, shifting, and dual tasking as subcomponents. The participants were middle school students (aged 11–14) and randomly assigned to either a training group or an active control group. The training group performed 30 minutes of MTCC per day for six weeks. To identify the training effects, we examined the cognitive performance, regional gray matter, and their relationship. The training group showed modest improvement in a visuospatial fluid intelligence test (Block Design) after MTCC, which was not significant after correcting for multiple comparisons. In addition, the training effect on the gray matter volume (time × group interaction) was observed in the right inferior cortex (rIFC). While the control group showed a typical reduction in the rIFC volume, the training group showed a relative increase in the homologous region. The relative change in rIFC volume was associated with the change in Stroop performance. These results imply that MTCC may affect brain structure relevant to inhibitory control process.

In EEG measurements, processing of periodic sounds in the ascending auditory pathway generates the frequency-following response (FFR) phase-locked to the fundamental frequency (F0) and its harmonics of a sound. We measured FFRs to the steady-state (vowel) part of syllables /ba/ and /aw/ occurring in binaural rapid streams of speech sounds as frequently repeating standard syllables or as infrequent (p = .2) deviant syllables among standard /wa/ syllables. Our aim was to study whether concurrent active phonological processing affects early processing of irrelevant speech sounds reflected by FFRs to these sounds. To this end, during syllable delivery, our healthy adult participants performed tasks involving written letters delivered on a computer screen in a rapid stream. The stream consisted of vowel letters written in red, infrequently occurring consonant letters written in the same color, and infrequently occurring vowel letters written in blue. In the phonological task, the participants were instructed to press a response key to the consonant letters differing phonologically but not in color from the frequently occurring red vowels, whereas in the non-phonological task, they were instructed to respond to the vowel letters written in blue differing only in color from the frequently occurring red vowels. We observed that the phonological task enhanced responses to deviant /ba/ syllables but not responses to deviant /aw/ syllables. This suggests that active phonological task performance may enhance processing of such small changes in irrelevant speech sounds as the 30-ms difference in the initial formant-transition time between the otherwise identical syllables /ba/ and /wa/ used in the present study.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2019.00046">Intrinsic and Synaptic Dynamics Contribute to Adaptation in the Core of the Avian Central Nucleus of the Inferior Colliculus</a></h4>

The reduction of neuronal responses to repeated stimulus presentation occurs in many sensory neurons, also in the inferior colliculus of birds. Response adaptation plays a role in perceptual auditory phenomena like the precedence effect. The cellular mechanisms that cause response adaptation are not well described. Adaptation must be explicable by changes in the activity of input neurons, short-term synaptic plasticity of the incoming connections, excitability changes of the neuron under consideration or influences of inhibitory or modulatory network connections. Using whole-cell recordings in acute brain slices of the embryonic chicken brain we wanted to understand the intrinsic and synaptic contributions to adaptation in the core of the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus. We described two neuron types in the chicken ICCc based on their action potential firing patterns: Phasic/onset neurons showed strong intrinsic adaptation but recovered more rapidly. Tonic/sustained firing neurons had weaker adaptation but often had additional slow components of recovery from adaptation. Chicken ICCc neurons received mostly mixed AMPA- and NMDA-type glutamatergic synaptic inputs. In the majority of ICCc neurons the input synapses underwent short-term depression. With a simulation of the putative population output activity of the chicken ICCc we showed that the different adaptation profiles of the neuron classes could shift the emphasize of stimulus encoding from transients at long intervals to ongoing parts at short intervals. Thus we report here that description of biophysical and synaptic properties can help to explain adaptive phenomena in central auditory neurons.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2019.00072">The Women Neuroscientists in the Cajal School</a></h4>

At the beginning of the XX century, in view of the growing international recognition of Santiago Ramón y Cajal, the Spanish authorities took some important steps to support Cajal´s scientific work. This recognition peaked in 1906, when Camillo Golgi and Santiago Ramón y Cajal shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. The Spanish government provided Cajal a state-of-the-art laboratory in Madrid to allow him to continue with his research and they funded salaries to pay his first tenured collaborators, the number of which increased further after the creation of the Junta para Ampliación de Estudios -JAE. The JAE was an organism set up to help promising researchers develop their careers in different ways, thereby contributing to the development of science in Spain. Although largely forgotten or relatively unknown, there has been a recent revival in the recognition of the school that developed around Cajal, collectively referred to as the Spanish Neurological School (or colloquially, as the Cajal School or School of Madrid). Almost all Cajal’s collaborators were men, although a limited number of female scientists spent part of their careers at the heart of the Cajal School. Here we discuss these women and their work in the laboratory in Madrid. We have tracked the careers of Laura Forster (from Australia/United Kingdom), Manuela Serra, María Soledad Ruiz-Capillas and María Luisa Herreros (all Spanish), through their scientific publications, both in the journal founded by Cajal and elsewhere, and from other documentary sources. To complete the picture, we also outline the careers of other secondary figures that contributed to the production and running of Cajal’s laboratory in Madrid. We show here that the dawn of Spanish neuroscience included a number of contributions from female researchers who to date, have received little recognition.

Reversible formation of PHF-like phosphorylated tau an early feature of Alzheimer´s disease (AD) was previously shown to occur in torpor during hibernation of Syrian hamsters. Here, we tackled the question to what extend hibernating Syrian hamsters can serve as a model for for the early stage of AD. During early AD  , anosmia, the loss of olfactory function, is a common and typical feature. We, thus, investigated tau phosphorylation, synaptic plasticity and behavioral physiology of the olfactory system during hibernation. Tau was phosphorylated on several AD -relevant epitopes, and distribution of PHF-like phosphorylated tau in the olfactory bulb was quite similar to what is seen in AD. Tau phosphorylation was not associated with a destabilization of microtubules or actin filaments and did not lead to fibril formation. Previously we observed a transient spine reduction in pyramidal cells in the hippocampus, which is correlated to the distribution of phosphorylated tau. Consistently, in the olfactory bulb the granule cells, which are devoid of phosphorylated tau, do not show a reduction in their spines. Contrary to previous reports no reduction in synaptic proteins was observed. However, when the effect of hibernation on olfactory memory was tested using a two odor discrimination task, non-hibernating animals showed a significant preference for the odor presented with a food reward, whereas hibernating animals did not. We conclude that hibernation is associated with a specific olfactory memory deficit, which might not be attributed to the formation of PHF-like phosphorylated tau within the olfactory bulb. We discuss a possible involvement of modulatory input provided by cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain, which are affected by hibernation.

Neuroimaging MRI data in scientific research is increasingly pooled, but the reliability of such studies may be hampered by the use of different hardware elements. This might introduce bias, for example when cross-sectional studies pool data acquired with different head coils, or when longitudinal clinical studies change head coils halfway. In the present study, we aimed to estimate this possible bias introduced by using different head coils to create awareness and to avoid misinterpretation of results. We acquired, with both an 8 channel and 32 channel head coil, T1-weighted, diffusion tensor imaging and resting state fMRI images at 3T MRI (Philips Achieva) with stable acquisition parameters in a large group of cognitively healthy participants (n=77). Standard analysis methods, i.e. voxel-based morphometry, tract-based spatial statistics and resting state functional network analyses, were used in a within-subject design to compare 8 and 32 channel head coil data. Signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) for both head coils showed similar ranges, although the 32 channel SNR profile was more homogeneous. Our data demonstrates specific patterns of grey and white matter volume differences between head coils, related to altered image contrast and therefore, altered tissue segmentation. White matter connectivity (fractional anisotropy and diffusivity measures) showed hemispherical dependent differences between head coils, and functional connectivity in resting state networks was higher using the 32 channel head coil in posterior cortical areas. This study shows that, even when acquisition protocols are harmonized, the results of standardized analysis models can be severely affected by the use of different head coils. Researchers should be aware of this when combining multiple neuroimaging MRI datasets, to prevent coil-related bias and avoid misinterpretation of their findings.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Transient ischemic attack (TIA) is defined as focal neurological deficit caused by ischemia resolving within 24 hrs. In a secondary analysis of a large monocentric cohort of 446 TIA patients, we explored the frequency and determinants of DWI lesions on high‐resolution MRI. Overall, 240 (54%) of all TIA patients presented with DWI lesions. These patients had higher NIHSS and ABCD2 scores and presented more frequently with vessel occlusion and perfusion deficits, but had similar functional outcome at 3 months. Taken together high‐resolution DWI provides evidence of ischemic brain injury in the majority of TIA patients.</p>

The development of two-photon microscopy has revolutionized our understanding of how synapses are formed and how they transform synaptic inputs in dendritic spines – tiny protrusions that cover the dendrites of pyramidal neurons that receive most excitatory synaptic information in the brain. These discoveries have led us to better comprehend the neuronal computations that take place at the level of dendritic spines as well as within neuronal circuits with unprecedented resolution. Here we describe a method that uses a two-photon (2P) microscope and 2P uncaging of caged neurotransmitters for the activation of single and multiple spines in the dendrites of cortical pyramidal neurons. In addition, we propose a cost-effective description of the components necessary for the construction of a one laser source-2P microscope capable of nearly simultaneous 2P uncaging of neurotransmitters and 2P calcium imaging of the activated spines and nearby dendrites. We provide a brief overview on how the use of these techniques have helped researchers in the last 15 years unravel the function of spines in a) information processing, b) storage and c) integration of excitatory synaptic inputs.

Introduction: In-vivo quantification of the serotonin transporter (SERT) guided our understanding of many neuropsychiatric disorders. A recently introduced bolus plus constant infusion protocol has been shown to allow the reliable determination of SERT binding with reduced scan time. In this work, the outcomes of two methods, a bolus injection paradigm on a GE PET camera and a bolus plus infusion paradigm on a combined Siemens PET/MR camera were compared.
Methods: 7 healthy subjects underwent paired PET and paired PET/MR scans each with intravenous double-blind application of 7.5 mg citalopram or saline in a randomized cross-over study design. While PET scans were performed according to standard protocols and nondisplaceable binding potentials (BPND) were calculated using the multi-linear reference tissue model, during PET/MR measurements [11C]DASB was applied as bolus plus constant infusion and BPND was calculated using the steady state method and data acquired at tracer equilibrium. Occupancies were calculated as the relative decrease in BPND between saline and citalopram scans. 
Results:  During placebo scans, a mean difference in BPND of -0.08 (-11.71%) across all ROIs was found between methods. PET/MR scans resulted in higher BPND estimates than PET scans in all ROIs except the midbrain. A mean difference of -0.19 (-109.40%) across all ROIs between methods was observed for citalopram scans. PET/MR scans resulted in higher BPND estimates than PET scans in all ROIs. For occupancy, a mean difference of 23.12% (21.91%) was observed across all ROIs. PET/MR scans resulted in lower occupancy compared to PET scans in all ROIs except the temporal cortex. While for placebo, BPND of high-binding regions (thalamus and striatum) exhibited moderate reliability (ICC=0.66), during citalopram scans ICC decreased (0.36-0.46). However, reliability for occupancy remained high (0.57-0.82). 
Conclusion: Here, we demonstrated the feasibility of reliable and non-invasive SERT quantification using a [11C]DASB bolus plus constant infusion protocol at a hybrid PET/MR scanner, which might facilitate future pharmacological imaging studies. Highest agreement with established methods for quantification of occupancy and SERT binding potentials at baseline was observed in subcortical high-binding regions.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an incurable and progressively fatal neurodegenerative disease that manifests with distinct clinical phenotypes, which are seen in neuroimaging and clinical studies. T2- and proton density (PD)-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) displays hyperintense signal along the corticospinal tract (CST) in some ALS patients with upper motor neuron (UMN)-predominant signs. These patients tend to be younger and have signiﬁcantly faster disease progression. We hypothesize that such ALS patients with CST hyperintensity (ALS-CST+) comprise a clinical subtype distinct from other ALS subtypes, namely patients with UMN-predominant ALS without CST hyperintensity, classic ALS, and ALS with frontotemporal dementia. Novel approaches such as fractal dimension analysis on conventional MRI (cMRI) and advanced MR techniques such as diffusion tensor imaging reveal significant differences between ALS-CST+ and the aforementioned ALS subtypes. Our unbiased neuroimaging studies demonstrate that the ALS-CST+ group, which can be initially identified by T2-, PD-, and FLAIR-weighted cMRI, is distinctive and distinguishable from other ALS subtypes with possible differences in disease pathogenesis.

Magnetic resonance images of brain tumors are routinely used in neuro-oncology clinics for diagnosis, treatment planning and post-treatment tumor surveillance. Currently, physicians spend considerable time manually delineating different structures of the brain. Spatial and structural variations, as well as intensity inhomogeneity across images, make the problem of computer- assisted segmentation very challenging. We propose a new image segmentation framework for tumor delineation that benefits from two state-of-the-art machine learning architectures in computer vision, i.e., Inception modules and U-Net image segmentation architecture. Furthermore, our framework includes two learning regimes, i.e., learning to segment intra-tumoral structures (necrotic and non-enhancing tumor core, peritumoral edema, and enhancing tumor) or learning to segment glioma sub-regions (whole tumor, tumor core, and enhancing tumor). These learning regimes are incorporated into a newly proposed loss function which is based on the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC). In our experiments, we quantified the impact of introducing the Inception modules in the U-Net architecture, as well as, changing the objective function for the learning algorithm from segmenting the intra-tumoral structures to glioma sub-regions. We found that incorporating Inception modules significantly improved the segmentation performance (p &lt; 0.001) for all glioma sub-regions. Moreover, in architectures with Inception modules, the models trained with the learning objective of segmenting the intra-tumoral structures outperformed the models trained with the objective of segmenting the glioma sub-regions for the whole tumor (p &lt; 0.001). The improved performance is linked to multiscale features extracted by newly introduced Inception module and the modified loss function based on the DSC.

The presubiculum plays a key role in processing and integrating spatial and head-directional information. Layer III neurons of the presubiculum provide strong projections to the superficial layers of the medial entorhinal cortex in the rat. Our previous study revealed that the terminal distribution of efferents from layer III cells of the presubiculum was organized in a band-like fashion within the medial entorhinal cortex, and the transverse axis of these zones ran parallel to the rhinal fissure. Identifying axonal branching patterns of layer III neurons of the presubiculum is important to further elucidate the functional roles of the presubiculum. In the present study, we visualized all axonal processes and terminal distributions of single presubicular layer III neurons in the rat, using in vivo injection of a viral vector expressing membrane-targeted palmitoylation site-attached green fluorescent protein. We found that layer III of the rat presubiculum comprised multiple types of neurons (n=12) with characteristic patterns of axonal collateralization, including cortical projection neurons (n=6) and several types of intrinsic connectional neurons (n=6). Two of six cortical projection neurons provided two or three major axonal branches to the medial entorhinal cortex and formed elaborate terminal arbors within the superficial layers of the medial entorhinal cortex. The width and axis of the area of their terminal distribution resembled that of the band-like terminal field seen in our massive-scale observation. Two of the other four cortical projection neurons gave off axonal branches to the medial entorhinal cortex and also to the subiculum, and each of the other two neurons sent axons to the subiculum or parasubiculum. Patterns of axonal arborization of six intrinsic connectional neurons were distinct from each other, with four neurons sending many axonal branches to both superficial and deep layers of the presubiculum and the other two neurons showing sparse axonal branches with terminations confined to layers III-V of the presubiculum. These data demonstrate that layer III of the rat presubiculum consists of multiple types of cortical projection neurons and interneurons, and also suggest that inputs from a single presubicular layer III neuron can directly affect a band-like zone of the medial entorhinal cortex.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>It is well established that motor impairment often occurs alongside healthy aging, leading to problems with fine motor skills and coordination. Although previously thought to be caused by neuronal death accumulating across the lifespan, it is now believed that the source of this impairment instead stems from more subtle changes in neural connectivity. The dendritic spine is a prime target for exploration of this problem because it is the postsynaptic partner of most excitatory synapses received by the pyramidal neuron, a cortical cell that carries much of the information processing load in the cerebral cortex. We repeatedly imaged the same dendrites in young adult and aged mouse motor cortex over the course of 1 month to look for differences in the baseline state of the dendritic spine population. These experiments reveal increased dendritic spine density, without obvious changes in spine clustering, occurring at the aged dendrite. Additionally, aged dendrites exhibit elevated spine turnover and stabilization alongside decreased long-term spine survival. These results suggest that at baseline the aged motor cortex may exist in a perpetual state of relative instability and attempts at compensation. This phenotype of aging may provide clues for future targets of aging-related motor impairment remediation.</span>

Background: There is accumulating evidence suggesting a connection between the gut and Parkinson’s disease (PD). Gut microbiota may play an important role in the intestinal lesions in PD patients.
Objective: This study aims to determine whether gut microbiota differs between PD patients and healthy controls in Northeast of China, and to identify the factors that influence the changes in the gut microbiota. 
Methods: We enrolled 51 PD patients and 48 healthy controls in this study. Microbial species in stool samples were determined through 16S-rRNA gene sequencing. Dietary intakes were collected from subset of 42 patients and 23 controls using a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Gut microbiota species richness, diversity, differential abundance of individual taxa between PD patients and controls, and the relationship between the gut microbiota abundance and the dietary and clinical factors were analyzed.
Results: PD patients showed decreased species richness, phylogenetic diversity, β-diversity, and altered relative abundance in several taxa compared to the controls. PD-associated clinical scores appeared to be the most influential factors that correlated with the abundance of a variety of taxa. The most consistent findings suggested by multiple analyses used in this study were the increase of Akkermansia and the decrease of Lactobacillus in PD patients in Northeast China.
Conclusion: Gut microbiota significantly differed between a group of PD patients and healthy controls in Northeast China, with decreased species richness, phylogenetic diversity, β-diversity, and altered relative abundance in several taxa compared to the controls.

Indirect traumatic optic neuropathy (ITON) is a condition that is often associated with traumatic brain injury and can result in significant vision loss due to degeneration of retinal ganglion cell axons at the time of injury or within the ensuing weeks. We used a mouse model of eye-directed air-blast exposure to characterize the histopathology of blast-induced ITON. This injury caused a transient elevation of intraocular pressure with subsequent retinal ganglion cell death and axon degeneration that was similar throughout the length of the optic nerve. Deficits in active anterograde axon transport to the superior colliculus accompanied axon degeneration and first appeared in peripheral representations of the retina. Glial area in the optic nerve increased early after injury and involved a later period of additional expansion. The increase in area involved a transient change in astrocyte organization independent of axon degeneration. While levels of many cytokines and chemokines did not change, IL-1α and IL-1β increased in both the optic nerve and retina. In contrast, glaucoma shows distal to proximal axon degeneration with astrocyte remodeling and increases in many cytokines and chemokines. Further, direct traumatic optic neuropathies have a clear site of injury with rapid, progressive axon degeneration and cell death. These data show that blast-induced ITON is a distinct neuropathology from other optic neuropathies.

The choice of the reference electrode scheme is an important step in event-related potential (ERP) analysis. In order to explore the optimal electroencephalogram reference electrode scheme for the ERP signal related to facial recognition, we investigated the influence of average reference (AR), mean mastoid reference (MM) and Reference Electrode Standardization Technique (REST) on the N170 component via statistical analysis, statistical parametric scalp mappings (SPSM) and source analysis. The statistical results showed that the choice of reference electrode scheme has little effect on N170 latency (p&gt;0.05), but has a greater impact on N170 amplitude (p&lt;0.05). ANOVA results show that, for the three references scheme, there was statistically significant difference between N170 latency and amplitude induced by the unfamiliar face and that induced by the scrambled face (p&lt;0.05). Specifically, the SPSM results show an anterior and a temporo-occipital distribution for AR and REST, with just anterior distribution shown for MM. However, the circumstantial evidence provided by source analysis is more consistent with SPSM of AR and REST. These results indicate that the experimental results under the AR and REST references are more objective and appropriate. Thus, it is more appropriate to use AR and REST reference scheme settings in future facial recognition experiments.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2019.00047">The Orientation Selectivity of Spike-LFP Synchronization in Macaque V1 and V4</a></h4>

Orientation selectivity is a fundamental property of visual cortical neurons and plays a crucial role in pattern perception. Although many studies have dedicated to explain how the orientation selectivity emerged, the mechanism underlying orientation selectivity is still not clear. In this work, we investigated the synchronization between spikes and local field potentials (LFP) in gamma band, with the aim of providing a new avenue to analyze the orientation selectivity. The experimental data were recorded by utilizing two chronically implanted multi-electrode arrays, where each array consisted of 48 electrodes and was placed over V1 and V4 respectively in two macaques performing a selective visual attention task. An unbiased and robust measure for quantifying the synchronization between spikes and LFP was employed in the analysis process, which is termed as spike-triggered correlation matrix synchronization (SCMS) and performs reliably for limited samples of data. We observed the spike-LFP synchronization in three cases, i.e. spikes and LFP in V1, spikes and LFP in V4, spikes in V4 and LFP in V1. From the orientation tuning curves based on the spike-LFP synchronization, it is found that there is a strong correlation between the synchronization and grating orientation. The neurons in both V1 and V4 exhibit orientation selectivity, but V1 is stronger. In addition, the spike-LFP synchronization strength between V1 and V4 also shows orientation selectivity to drifting gratings. It means that the synchronization not only reflects the basic features of visual stimulation, but also describes the orientation tuning characteristics of neurons in different regions. Our results suggest that the spike-LFP synchronization can be used as an alternative and effective method to study the mechanism for generating orientation selectivity of visual neurons.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Neural progenitor proliferation, neuronal migration, areal organization, and pioneer axon wiring are critical events during early forebrain development, yet remain incompletely understood, especially in human. Here, we studied forebrain development in human embryos aged 5 to 8 postconceptional weeks (WPC5–8), stages that correspond to the neuroepithelium/early marginal zone (WPC5), telencephalic preplate (WPC6 &amp; 7), and incipient cortical plate (WPC8). We show that early telencephalic neurons are formed at the neuroepithelial stage; the most precocious ones originate from local telencephalic neuroepithelium and possibly from the olfactory placode. At the preplate stage, forebrain organization is quite similar in human and mouse in terms of areal organization and of differentiation of Cajal-Retzius cells, pioneer neurons, and axons. Like in mice, axons from pioneer neurons in prethalamus, ventral telencephalon, and cortical preplate cross the diencephalon–telencephalon junction and the pallial–subpallial boundary, forming scaffolds that could guide thalamic and cortical axons at later stages. In accord with this model, at the early cortical plate stage, corticofugal axons run in ventral telencephalon in close contact with scaffold neurons, which express CELSR3 and FZD3, two molecules that regulates formation of similar scaffolds in mice.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The prefrontal cortex is vital for a range of cognitive processes, including working memory, attention, and decision-making. Notably, its absence impairs the performance of tasks requiring the maintenance of information through a delay period. In this paper, we formulate a rodent task—which requires maintenance of delay-period activity—as a Markov decision process and treat optimal task performance as an (active) inference problem. We simulate the behavior of a Bayes optimal mouse presented with 1 of 2 cues that instructs the selection of concurrent visual and auditory targets on a trial-by-trial basis. Formulating inference as message passing, we reproduce features of neuronal coupling within and between prefrontal regions engaged by this task. We focus on the micro-circuitry that underwrites delay-period activity and relate it to functional specialization within the prefrontal cortex in primates. Finally, we simulate the electrophysiological correlates of inference and demonstrate the consequences of lesions to each part of our in silico prefrontal cortex. In brief, this formulation suggests that recurrent excitatory connections—which support persistent neuronal activity—encode beliefs about transition probabilities over time. We argue that attentional modulation can be understood as the contextualization of sensory input by these persistent beliefs.</span>

The sensory recruitment model envisages visual working memory (VWM) as an emergent property that is encoded and maintained in sensory (visual) regions. The model implies that enhanced sensory-perceptual functions, as in synaesthesia, entail a dedicated VWM-system, showing reduced visual cortex activity as a result of neural specificity. By contrast, sensory-perceptual decline, as in old age, is expected to show enhanced visual cortex activity as a result of neural broadening. To test this model, young grapheme-colour synaesthetes, older adults and young controls engaged in a delayed pair-associative retrieval and a delayed matching-to-sample task, consisting of achromatic fractal stimuli that do not induce synaesthesia. While a previous analysis of this dataset (Pfeifer et al., 2016) has focused on cued retrieval and recognition of pair-associates (i.e. long-term memory), the current study focuses on visual working memory and considers, for the first time, the crucial delay period in which no visual stimuli are present, but working memory processes are engaged. Participants were trained to criterion and demonstrated comparable behavioural performance on VWM tasks. Whole-brain and region-of-interest-analyses revealed significantly lower activity in synaesthetes’ middle frontal gyrus and visual regions (cuneus, inferior temporal cortex) respectively, suggesting greater neural efficiency relative to young and older adults in both tasks. The results support the sensory recruitment model and can explain age and individual WM-differences based on neural specificity in visual cortex.

Over the past 2,500 years, contemplative traditions have explored the nature of the mind using meditation. More recently, neuroimaging research on meditation has revealed differences in brain function and structure in meditators. Nevertheless, the underlying neural mechanisms are still unclear. In order to understand how meditation shapes global activity through the brain, we investigated the spatiotemporal dynamics across the whole-brain functional network using the Intrinsic Ignition Framework. Recent neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that different states of consciousness differ in their underlying dynamical complexity, i.e., how the broadness of communication is elicited and distributed through the brain over time and space. In this work, controls and experienced meditators were scanned using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during resting-state and meditation (focused attention on breathing). Our results evidenced that the dynamical complexity underlying meditation shows less complexity than during resting-state in the meditator group but not in the control group. Furthermore, we report that during resting-state, the brain activity of experienced meditators showed higher metastability (i.e., a wider dynamical regime over time) than the one observed in the control group. Overall, these results indicate that the meditation state operates in a different dynamical regime compared to the resting-state.

Of the 179 children referred for vertigo or dizziness (over 3 years) and ophthalmological disorder as the only problem after complete oto-neuro-vestibular testing, 69 presented vergence insufficiency, and 49 accepted to participate to this study. 109 healthy children served as controls. All subjects performed classic orthoptic evaluation and video binocular movement recordings during various oculomotor tasks. Patients were evaluated before OVT (M0), after the end of OVT (M3) and 6 months later (M9). Statistics compared orthoptic and oculomotor parameters between patients and controls over time with one-way ANCOVA, and mixed models, controlling for age and gender.
Results
Patients reported vertigo that was usually rotatory, lasting &lt;15 min, associated or alternating with headache (50%). Their exposure to small videoscreens and TV was intensive (~3.6 h per day). At M0, all orthoptic and oculomotor parameters were statistically different in patients relative to controls (p&lt;0.0001) except for divergence. At M3, vertigo symptoms had disappeared in all of the patients, and all eye movement parameters improved significantly (p&lt;0.0001). At M9, this improvement remained stable or continued. 
Conclusion
Vergence disorders (assessed by abnormal orthoptic and oculomotor parameters) can generate symptoms of dizziness in children. Orthoptic treatment and instruction to reduce screen usage has a significant and long term effect on vertigo symptoms as well as oculomotor performances. Dizzy children should be screened for vergence disorders.

Limited in part by the spatial resolution of typical in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, recent neuroimaging studies have only identified a connectivity-based shell-core-like partitioning of the nucleus accumbens (Acb) in humans. This has hindered the process of making a more refined description of the Acb using non-invasive neuroimaging technologies and approaches. In this study, high-resolution ex vivo macaque brain diffusion MRI data were acquired to investigate the tractography-based parcellation of the Acb. Our results identified a shell-core-like partitioning in macaques that is similar to that in humans as well as an alternative solution that subdivided the Acb into four parcels, the medial shell, the lateral shell, the ventral core, and the dorsal core. Furthermore, we characterized the specific anatomical and functional connectivity profiles of these Acb subregions and generalized their specialized functions to establish a fine-grained macaque Acb brainnetome atlas. This atlas should be helpful in neuroimaging, stereotactic surgery, and comparative neuroimaging studies to reveal the neurophysiological substrates of various diseases and cognitive functions associated with the Acb.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00690">Simultaneous EEG-fMRI: Evaluating the Effect of the EEG Cap-Cabling Configuration on the Gradient Artifact</a></h4>

Electroencephalography (EEG) data recorded during simultaneous EEG-fMRI experiments are contaminated by large gradient artefacts (GA). The amplitude of the GA depends on the area of the wire loops formed by the EEG leads, as well as on the rate of switching of the magnetic field gradients, which are essential for MR imaging. Average artefact subtraction (AAS), the method most commonly used method for GA correction, relies on the EEG amplifier having a large enough dynamic range to characterize the artefact voltages. Low-pass filtering (250 Hz cut-off) is generally used to attenuate the high-frequency voltage fluctuations of the GA, but even with this precaution channel saturation can occur, particularly during acquisition of high spatial resolution MRI data. Previous work has shown that the ribbon cable, used to connect the EEG cap and amplifier, makes a significant contribution to the GA, since the cable geometry produces large effective wire-loop areas. However, by appropriately connecting the wires of the ribbon cable to the EEG cap it should be possible to minimize the overall range and root mean square (RMS) amplitude of the GA by producing partial cancellation of the cap and cable contributions. Here by modifying the connections of the EEG cap to a 1 m ribbon cable we were able to reduce the range of the GA for a high-resolution coronal echo planar Imaging (EPI) acquisition by a factor of ~ 1.6 and by a factor of ~ 1.15 for a standard axial EPI acquisition. These changes could potentially be translated into a reduction in the required dynamic range, an increase in the EEG bandwidth or an increase in the achievable image resolution without saturation, all of which could be beneficially exploited in EEG-fMRI studies. The re-wiring could also prevent the system from saturating when small subject movements occur using the standard recording bandwidth.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00683">On the Role of Adenosine A2A Receptor Gene Transcriptional Regulation in Parkinson’s Disease</a></h4>

Adenosine A2A receptors (A2ARs) have attracted considerable attention as an important molecular target for the design of Parkinson’s disease (PD) therapeutic compounds. Here, we studied the transcriptional regulation of the A2AR gene in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from PD patients and in the striatum of the well-validated, 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced PD mouse model.  We report an increase in A2AR mRNA expression and protein levels in both human cells and mice striata, and in the latter we could also observe a consistent reduction in DNA methylation at gene promoter and an increase in histone H3 acetylation at lysine 9. Of particular relevance in clinical samples, we also observed higher levels in the receptor gene expression in younger subjects, as well as in those with less years from disease onset and less severe disease according to clinical scores. In conclusion, the present findings provide further evidence of the relevant role of A2AR in PD and, based on the clinical data, highlight its potential role as disease biomarker for PD especially at the initial stages of disease development. Furthermore, our preclinical results also suggest selective epigenetic mechanisms targeting gene promoter as tool for the development of new treatments.

Objectives: To evaluate white matter hyperintensities (WMH) quantification reproducibility from multiple aspects of view, examine the effects of scan-rescan procedure, types of scanner, imaging protocols, scanner software upgrade, and automatic segmentation tools on WMH quantification results using MRI. 
Methods: Six post-stroke subjects (4 males; mean age 62.8, range 58-72 years) were scanned and rescanned with both 3D T1-weighted, 2D and 3D T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (T2-FLAIR) MRI across four different MRI scanners within 12 hours. Two automated WMH segmentation and quantification tools were used to measure WMH volume based on each MR scan. Robustness was assessed using the coefficient of variation (CV).
Results: Experimental results show that the best reproducibility was achieved by using 3D T2-FLAIR MRI under intra-scanner setting with CV ranging from 2.69% to 2.97%, while the largest variability resulted from comparing WMH volumes measured based on 2D T2-FLAIR MRI with those of 3D T2-FLAIR MRI, with CV values in the range of 15.62%-29.33%. The WMH quantification variability based on 2D MRIs is larger than 3D MRIs due to their large slice thickness. In addition to image acquisition, the choice of automatic WMH segmentation tool also has a large impact on WMH quantification.
Conclusions: WMH reproducibility is one of the primary issues to be considered in multicenter and longitudinal studies. The study provides solid guidance in assisting multicenter and longitudinal study design to achieve meaningful results with enough power.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00668">Identifying Imaging Markers for Predicting Cognitive Assessments Using Wasserstein Distances Based Matrix Regression</a></h4>

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a severe type of neurodegeneration which worsens human memory, thinking and cognition along a temporal continuum. How to identify the informative  phenotypic neuroimaging markers and accurately predict cognitive assessment are crucial for early detection and diagnosis Alzheimer's disease. Regression models are widely used to predict the relationship between imaging biomarkers and cognitive assessment, and identify discriminative neuroimaging markers. Most existing methods use different matrix norms as the similarity measures of the empirical loss or regularization to improve the prediction performance, but ignore the inherent geometry of the cognitive data. To tackle this issue, in this paper we propose a novel robust matrix regression model with imposing Wasserstein distances on both loss function and regularization. It successfully integrate Wasserstein distance into the regression model, which can excavate the latent geometry of cognitive data. We introduce an efficient algorithm to solve the proposed new model with convergence analysis. Empirical results on cognitive data of the  ADNI cohort demonstrate the great effectiveness of the proposed method for clinical cognitive predication.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00618">Characterizing Rapid Fluctuations of Resting State Functional Connectivity in Demyelinating, Neurodegenerative, and Psychiatric Conditions: From Static to Time-Varying Analysis</a></h4>

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at resting state (RS) has been widely used to characterize the main brain networks. Functional connectivity (FC) has been mostly assessed assuming that FC is stationary across the whole fMRI examination. However, FC is highly variable at a very fast time-scale, as demonstrated by neurophysiological techniques. Dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) is a novel approach that allows capturing reoccurring patterns of interaction among functional brain networks. Aim of this review is to provide a description of the methods currently used to assess dFC on RS fMRI data, and to summarize the main results of studies applying dFC in healthy controls and patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). An overview of the main results obtained in neurodegenerative and psychiatric conditions is also provided.
The most popular dFC approach is based on the so-called “sliding windows”, in which the RS fMRI acquisition is divided in small temporal segments (windows). A window of fixed length is shifted over RS fMRI time courses, and data within each window are used to calculate FC and its variability over time. Sliding windows can be combined with clustering techniques to identify recurring FC states or used to assess global dFC properties of large-scale functional networks or specific brain regions. 
dFC studies have used heterogeneous methodologies so far. Despite this, similar results have been obtained across investigations. In healthy subjects, the default-mode network (DMN) exhibited the highest degree of connectivity dynamism. In MS patients, abnormal global dFC properties and dFC strengths were found mainly in sensorimotor, DMN and salience networks, and were associated with more severe structural MRI damage and with more severe physical and cognitive disability. Conversely, abnormal dFC measures of the temporal network were correlated with better cognitive performances and less severe fatigue. In patients with neurodegenerative and psychiatric conditions, dFC abnormalities of the DMN, attention and executive networks were associated to more severe clinical manifestations.
Dynamic FC helps to provide novel insights into fundamental properties of functional networks, and improves the understanding of brain reorganization mechanisms. Future technical advances might help to clarify dFC association with disease prognosis and response to treatment.

                <h4><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2019.00040">A Computational Model of Attention Control in Multi-Attribute, Context-Dependent Decision Making</a></h4>

Real-life decisions often require a comparison of multi-attribute options with various benefits and costs, and the evaluation of each option depends partly on the other ones in the choice set (i.e., the choice context). Although reinforcement learning models have successfully described choice behavior, it remains unclear how multi-attribute information is taken into account for making a context-dependent decision in reinforcement learning algorithms. Here we develop a computational model of attention control that includes context effects on multi-attribute decisions, linking a context-dependent choice model with a reinforcement learning model. The overall model suggests that the distinctiveness of attributes guides an individual’s preferences among multi-attribute options via an attention-control mechanism that determines whether choices are selectively biased toward the most distinctive attribute (selective attention) or proportionally distributed based on the relative distinctiveness of attributes (divided attention). To test the model, we conducted a behavioral experiment in rhesus monkeys, in which they made simple multi-attribute decisions over three conditions that manipulated the degree of distinctiveness between alternatives: (1) four foods of different size and calorie; (2) four pieces of the same food in different colors; and (3) four identical pieces of food. The model simulation of the choice behavior captured the preference bias (i.e., overall preference structure) and the choice persistence (repeated choices) in the empirical data, providing evidence for the respective influences of attention and memory on preference bias and choice persistence. Our study provides insights into computations underlying multi-attribute decisions, linking attentional control to decision-making processes.
