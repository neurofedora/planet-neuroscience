              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Performance of Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool and Patient-Generated Global Subjective Assessment in screening for cancer-related malnutrition in Nairobi, Kenya [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Malnutrition is a common feature among oncology patients. It is responsible for poor response and tolerance to anticancer therapy, increased morbidity, and mortality. More than half of malnourished cancer patients remain undetected owing to lack of effective screening. Body mass index is the main indicator for assessing malnutrition in Kenyan public hospitals. However, it underestimates weight loss in patients with chronic illnesses. The Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool and Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment have been widely used in research and clinical practice and have both reported good validity and reliability. However, their diagnostic evaluation has not been performed in Kenya. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 138 and 76 cancer outpatients from Kenyatta National Hospital and Texas cancer treatment centres, respectively. Participants had a confirmed disease, stage 1-4 cancer, and aged 18 years and above. They were screened for malnutrition using both Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool and Patient Generated-Subjective Global Assessment. A separate study questionnaire was utilized to gather participant’s socio-demographic and clinical characteristics. A Bayesian latent class modelling framework was employed to infer the tests’ estimates based on participants ‘cumulative scores from the two tests. Results: The cut-off value of ≥ 1 and ≥ 4 gave the best combination of sensitivity and specificity of Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool and Patient Generated-Subjective Global Assessment. Both tests yielded statistically similar sensitivities and specificities. Predictive values were comparable between the tests and across the two populations. The posterior median true prevalences of malnutrition were high (˃ 54%) and numerically similar between the studied populations. Conclusions: The performance of both tests among patients with cancer is similar. Healthcare workers are therefore at liberty to use either of them to inform treatment. Given the high true prevalence of cancer-related malnutrition, routine screening is critical and should be included as part of cancer care.

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Neuronal Correlates of Hyperalgesia and Somatic Signs of Heroin Withdrawal in Male and Female Mice</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Opioid withdrawal involves the manifestation of motivational and somatic symptoms. However, the brain structures that are involved in the expression of different opioid withdrawal signs remain unclear. We induced opioid dependence by repeatedly injecting escalating heroin doses in male and female C57BL/6J mice. We assessed hyperalgesia during spontaneous heroin withdrawal and somatic signs of withdrawal that was precipitated by the preferential &mu;-opioid receptor antagonist naloxone. Heroin-treated mice exhibited significantly higher hyperalgesia and somatic signs than saline-treated mice. Following behavioral assessment, we measured regional changes in brain activity by automated the counting of c-Fos expression (a marker of cellular activity). Using Principal Component Analysis, we determined the association between behavior (hyperalgesia and somatic signs of withdrawal) and c-Fos expression in different brain regions. Hyperalgesia was associated with c-Fos expression in the lateral hypothalamus, central nucleus of the amygdala, ventral tegmental area, parabrachial nucleus, dorsal raphe (DR), and locus coeruleus (LC). Somatic withdrawal was associated with c-Fos expression in the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus, lateral habenula, DR, and LC. Thus, hyperalgesia and somatic withdrawal signs were each associated with c-Fos expression in unique sets of brain areas. The expression of c-Fos in the DR and LC was associated with both hyperalgesia and somatic withdrawal. Understanding common neurobiological mechanisms of acute and protracted opioid withdrawal may help identify new targets for treating this salient aspect of opioid use disorder.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Microglial mTOR Activation Upregulates Trem2 and Enhances {beta}-Amyloid Plaque Clearance in the 5XFAD Alzheimer's Disease Model</a></h4>

              
                <p>The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway plays a major role in key cellular processes including metabolism and differentiation; however, the role of mTOR in microglia and its importance in Alzheimer's disease (AD) have remained largely uncharacterized. We report that selective loss of <I>Tsc1</I>, a negative regulator of mTOR, in microglia in mice of both sexes, caused mTOR activation and upregulation of Trem2 with enhanced &beta;-Amyloid (A&beta;) clearance, reduced spine loss, and improved cognitive function in the <I>5XFAD</I> AD mouse model. Combined loss of <I>Tsc1</I> and <I>Trem2</I> in microglia led to reduced A&beta; clearance and increased A&beta; plaque burden revealing that Trem2 functions downstream of mTOR. <I>Tsc1</I> mutant microglia showed increased phagocytosis with upregulation of CD68 and Lamp1 lysosomal proteins. <I>In vitro</I> studies using <I>Tsc1</I>-deficient microglia revealed enhanced endocytosis of the lysosomal tracker indicator Green DND-26 suggesting increased lysosomal activity. Incubation of <I>Tsc1</I>-deficient microglia with fluorescent-labeled A&beta; revealed enhanced A&beta; uptake and clearance, which was blunted by rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor. <I>In vivo</I> treatment of mice of relevant genotypes in the <I>5XFAD</I> background with rapamycin, affected microglial activity, decreased Trem2 expression and reduced A&beta; clearance causing an increase in A&beta; plaque burden. Prolonged treatment with rapamycin caused even further reduction of mTOR activity, reduction in Trem2 expression, and increase in A&beta; levels. Together, our findings reveal that mTOR signaling in microglia is critically linked to Trem2 regulation and lysosomal biogenesis, and that the upregulation of Trem2 in microglia through mTOR activation could be exploited toward better therapeutic avenues to A&beta;-related AD pathologies.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway is a key regulator for major cellular metabolic processes. However, the link between mTOR signaling and Alzheimer's disease (AD) is not well understood. In this study, we provide compelling <I>in vivo</I> evidence that mTOR activation in microglia would benefit &beta;-Amyloid (A&beta;)-related AD pathologies, as it upregulates Trem2, a key receptor for A&beta; plaque uptake. Inhibition of mTOR pathway with rapamycin, a well-established immunosuppressant, downregulated Trem2 in microglia and reduced A&beta; plaque clearance indicating that mTOR inactivation may be detrimental in A&beta;-associated AD patients. This finding will have a significant public health impact and benefit, regarding the usage of rapamycin in AD patients, which we believe will aggravate the A&beta;-related AD pathologies.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Neuronal Activities in the Rostral Ventromedial Medulla Associated with Experimental Occlusal Interference-Induced Orofacial Hyperalgesia</a></h4>

              
                <p>The imbalanced conditions of pronociceptive ON-cells and antinociceptive OFF-cells in the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) alter nociceptive transmission and play an important role in the development of chronic pain. This study aimed to explore the neuroplastic mechanisms of the RVM ON-cells and OFF-cells in a male rat model of experimental occlusal interference (EOI)-induced nociceptive behavior reflecting orofacial hyperalgesia and in modified models involving EOI removal at early and later stages. We recorded the mechanical head withdrawal thresholds, orofacial operant behaviors, and the activity of identified RVM ON-cells and OFF-cells in these rats. EOI-induced orofacial hyperalgesia could be relieved by EOI removal around postoperative day 3; this effect could be inhibited by intra-RVM microinjection of the -opioid receptor agonist U-69593. EOI removal around postoperative day 8 did not relieve the orofacial hyperalgesia, which could, however, be reversed by intra-RVM microinjection of the NK-1 (neurokinin-1) receptor antagonist L-733060. The activity of ON-cells and OFF-cells did not change during both the initial 3 and 6 d of EOI. When EOI was removed on postoperative day 3, OFF-cell responses decreased, contributing to the reversal of hyperalgesia. When EOI lasted for 8 d or was removed on postoperative day 8, spontaneous activity and stimulus-evoked responses of ON-cell increased, contributing to the maintained hyperalgesia. In contrast, when the EOI lasted for 14 d, OFF-cell responses decreased, possibly participating in the maintenance of hyperalgesia with persistent EOI. Our results reveal that adaptive changes in the RVM were associated with orofacial pain following EOI placement and removal.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> A considerable proportion of patients experience chronic orofacial pain throughout life despite the therapies given or removal of potential etiologic factors. However, current therapies lack effectiveness because of limited knowledge of the chronicity mechanisms. Using electrophysiological recording, combined with a behavioral test, we found that the prevailing descending facilitation in the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) participates in the maintenance of orofacial hyperalgesia following late removal of nociceptive stimuli, while the prevailing descending inhibition from the RVM may contribute to the reversal of orofacial hyperalgesia following early removal of nociceptive stimuli. Thus, variable clinical outcomes of orofacial pain may be associated with descending modulation, and an optimal window of time may exist in the management of chronic orofacial pain.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Role of Sleep in Formation of Relational Associative Memory</a></h4>

              
                <p>Relational memory, the ability to make and remember associations between objects, is an essential component of mammalian reasoning. In relational memory tasks, it has been shown that periods of offline processing, such as sleep, are critical to making indirect associations. To understand biophysical mechanisms behind the role of sleep in improving relational memory, we developed a model of the thalamocortical network to test how slow-wave sleep affects performance on an unordered relational memory task. First, the model was trained in the awake state on a paired associate inference task, in which the model learned to recall direct associations. After a period of subsequent slow-wave sleep, the model developed the ability to recall indirect associations. We found that replay, during sleep, of memory patterns learned in awake increased synaptic connectivity between neurons representing the item that was overlapping between tasks and neurons representing the unlinked items of the different tasks; this forms an attractor that enables indirect memory recall. Our study predicts that overlapping items between indirectly associated tasks are essential for relational memory, and sleep can reactivate pathways to and from overlapping items to the unlinked objects to strengthen these pathways and form new relational memories.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Experimental studies have shown that some types of associative memory, such as transitive inference and relational memory, can improve after sleep. Still, it remains unknown what specific mechanisms are responsible for these sleep-related changes. In this new work, we addressed this problem by building a thalamocortical network model that can learn relational memory tasks and that can be simulated in awake or sleep states. We found that memory traces learned in awake were replayed during slow waves of NREM sleep and revealed that replay increased connections to and from overlapping memory items to form new relational memories. Our work discovered specific mechanisms behind the role of sleep in associative memory and made testable predictions about how sleep augments associative learning.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Hippocampal Egr1-Dependent Neuronal Ensembles Negatively Regulate Motor Learning</a></h4>

              
                <p>Motor skills learning is classically associated with brain regions including cerebral and cerebellar cortices and basal ganglia nuclei. Less is known about the role of the hippocampus in the acquisition and storage of motor skills. Here, we show that mice receiving a long-term training in the accelerating rotarod display marked hippocampal transcriptional changes and reduced pyramidal neurons activity in the CA1 region when compared with naive mice. Then, we use mice in which neural ensembles are permanently labeled in an <I>Egr1</I> activity-dependent fashion. Using these mice, we identify a subpopulation of <I>Egr1</I>-expressing pyramidal neurons in CA1 activated in short-term (STT) and long-term (LTT) trained mice in the rotarod task. When <I>Egr1</I> is downregulated in the CA1 or these neuronal ensembles are depleted, motor learning is improved whereas their chemogenetic stimulation impairs motor learning performance. Thus, <I>Egr1</I> organizes specific CA1 neuronal ensembles during the accelerating rotarod task that limit motor learning. These evidences highlight the role of the hippocampus in the control of this type of learning and we provide a possible underlying mechanism.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> It is a major topic in neurosciences the deciphering of the specific circuits underlying memory systems during the encoding of new information. However, the potential role of the hippocampus in the control of motor learning and the underlying mechanisms has been poorly addressed. In the present work we show how the hippocampus responds to motor learning and how the <I>Egr1</I> molecule is one of the major responsible for such phenomenon controlling the rate of motor coordination performances.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Selective Inhibitory Circuit Dysfunction after Chronic Frontal Lobe Contusion</a></h4>

              
                <p>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of neurologic disability; the most common deficits affect prefrontal cortex-dependent functions such as attention, working memory, social behavior, and mental flexibility. Despite this prevalence, little is known about the pathophysiology that develops in frontal cortical microcircuits after TBI. We investigated whether alterations in subtype-specific inhibitory circuits are associated with cognitive inflexibility in a mouse model of frontal lobe contusion in both male and female mice that recapitulates aberrant mental flexibility as measured by deficits in rule reversal learning. Using patch-clamp recordings and optogenetic stimulation, we identified selective vulnerability in the non-fast-spiking and somatostatin-expressing (SOM+) subtypes of inhibitory neurons in layer V of the orbitofrontal cortex 2 months after injury. These subtypes exhibited reduced intrinsic excitability and a decrease in their synaptic output onto pyramidal neurons, respectively. By contrast, the fast-spiking and parvalbumin-expressing interneurons did not show changes in intrinsic excitability or synaptic output, respectively. Impairments in non-fast-spiking/SOM+ inhibitory circuit function were also associated with network hyperexcitability. These findings provide evidence for selective disruptions within specific inhibitory microcircuits that may guide the development of novel therapeutics for TBI.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> TBI frequently leads to chronic deficits in cognitive and behavioral functions that involve the prefrontal cortex, yet the maladaptive changes that occur in these cortical microcircuits are unknown. Our data indicate that alterations in subtype-specific inhibitory circuits, specifically vulnerability in the non-fast-spiking/somatostatin-expressing interneurons, occurs in the orbitofrontal cortex in the context of chronic deficits in reversal learning. These neurons exhibit reduced excitability and synaptic output, whereas the other prominent inhibitory population in layer V, the fast-spiking/parvalbumin-expressing interneurons as well as pyramidal neurons are not affected. Our work offers mechanistic insight into the subtype-specific function of neurons that may contribute to mental inflexibility after TBI.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">GABAergic CaMKII{alpha}+ Amygdala Output Attenuates Pain and Modulates Emotional-Motivational Behavior via Parabrachial Inhibition</a></h4>

              
                <p>Pain and emotion are strongly regulated by neurons in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA), a major output of the limbic system; yet, the neuronal signaling pathways underlying this modulation are incompletely understood. Here, we characterized a subpopulation of CeA neurons that express the CaMKII&alpha; gene (CeA<sup>CAM</sup> neurons) and project to the lateral parabrachial nucleus (LPBN), a brainstem region known for its critical role in distributing nociceptive and other aversive signals throughout the brain. In male Sprague Dawley rats, we show that CeA<sup>CAM</sup>-LPBN neurons are GABAergic and mostly express somatostatin. In anaesthetized rats, optogenetic stimulation of CeA<sup>CAM</sup>-LPBN projections inhibited responses of LPBN neurons evoked by electrical activation of A- and C-fiber primary afferents; this inhibition could be blocked by intra-LPBN application of the GABA<SUB>A</SUB> receptor antagonist bicuculline. CeA<sup>CAM</sup>-LPBN stimulation also dampened LPBN responses to noxious mechanical, thermal, and chemical stimuli. In behaving rats, optogenetic stimulation of CeA<sup>CAM</sup>-LPBN projections attenuated nocifensive responses to mechanical pressure and radiant heat, disrupted the ability of a noxious shock to drive aversive learning, reduced the defensive behaviors of thigmotaxis and freezing, induced place preference, and promoted food consumption in sated rats. Thus, we suggest that CeA<sup>CAM</sup>-LPBN projections mediate a form of analgesia that is accompanied by a shift toward the positive-appetitive pole of the emotional-motivational continuum. Since the affective state of pain patients strongly influences their prognosis, we envision that recruitment of this pathway in a clinical setting could potentially promote pain resilience and recovery.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Pain and emotion interact on multiple levels of the nervous system. Both positive and negative emotion may have analgesic effects. However, while the neuronal mechanisms underlying "stress-induced analgesia" have been the focus of many studies, the neuronal substrates underlying analgesia accompanied by appetitive emotional-motivational states have received far less attention. The current study focuses on a subpopulation of amygdala neurons that form inhibitory synapses within the brainstem lateral parabrachial nucleus (LPBN). We show that activation of these amygdalo-parabrachial projections inhibits pain processing, while also reducing behaviors related to negative affect and enhancing behaviors related to positive affect. We propose that recruitment of this pathway would benefit pain patients, many of whom suffer from psychological comorbidities such as anxiety and depression.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">NMDA Receptors in the Lateral Preoptic Hypothalamus Are Essential for Sustaining NREM and REM Sleep</a></h4>

              
                <p>The lateral preoptic (LPO) hypothalamus is a center for NREM and REM sleep induction and NREM sleep homeostasis. Although LPO is needed for NREM sleep, we found that calcium signals were, surprisingly, highest in REM sleep. Furthermore, and equally surprising, NMDA receptors in LPO were the main drivers of excitation. Deleting the NMDA receptor GluN1 subunit from LPO abolished calcium signals in all cells and produced insomnia. Mice of both sexes had highly fragmented NREM sleep-wake patterns and could not generate conventionally classified REM sleep. The sleep phenotype produced by deleting NMDA receptors depended on where in the hypothalamus the receptors were deleted. Deleting receptors from the anterior hypothalamic area (AHA) did not influence sleep-wake states. The sleep fragmentation originated from NMDA receptors on GABA neurons in LPO. Sleep fragmentation could be transiently overcome with sleeping medication (zolpidem) or sedatives (dexmedetomidine; Dex). By contrast, fragmentation persisted under high sleep pressure produced by sleep deprivation (SD), mice had a high propensity to sleep but woke up. By analyzing changes in  power, sleep homeostasis (also referred to as "sleep drive") remained intact after NMDA receptor ablation. We suggest NMDA glutamate receptor activation stabilizes firing of sleep-on neurons and that mechanisms of sleep maintenance differ from that of the sleep drive itself.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Insomnia is a common affliction. Most insomniacs feel that they do not get enough sleep, but in fact, often have good amounts of sleep. Their sleep, however, is fragmented, and sufferers wake up feeling unrefreshed. It is unknown how sleep is maintained once initiated. We find that in mice, NMDA-type glutamate receptors in the hypothalamus are the main drivers of excitation and are required for a range of sleep properties: they are, in fact, needed for both sustained NREM sleep periods, and REM sleep generation. When NMDA receptors are selectively reduced from inhibitory preoptic (PO) neurons, mice have normal total amounts of sleep but high sleep-wake fragmentation, providing a model for studying intractable insomnia.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Model Sharing in the Human Medial Temporal Lobe</a></h4>

              
                <p>Effective planning involves knowing where different actions take us. However, natural environments are rich and complex, leading to an exponential increase in memory demand as a plan grows in depth. One potential solution is to filter out features of the environment irrelevant to the task at hand. This enables a shared model of transition dynamics to be used for planning over a range of different input features. Here, we asked human participants (13 male, 16 female) to perform a sequential decision-making task, designed so that knowledge should be integrated independently of the input features (visual cues) present in one case but not in another. Participants efficiently switched between using a low-dimensional (cue independent) and a high-dimensional (cue specific) representation of state transitions. fMRI data identified the medial temporal lobe as a locus for learning state transitions. Within this region, multivariate patterns of BOLD responses were less correlated between trials with differing input features but similar state associations in the high dimensional than in the low dimensional case, suggesting that these patterns switched between separable (specific to input features) and shared (invariant to input features) transition models. Finally, we show that transition models are updated more strongly following the receipt of positive compared with negative outcomes, a finding that challenges conventional theories of planning. Together, these findings propose a computational and neural account of how information relevant for planning can be shared and segmented in response to the vast array of contextual features we encounter in our world.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Effective planning involves maintaining an accurate model of which actions take us to which locations. But in a world awash with information, mapping actions to states with the right level of complexity is critical. Using a new decision-making "heist task" in conjunction with computational modeling and fMRI, we show that patterns of BOLD responses in the medial temporal lobe&mdash;a brain region key for prospective planning&mdash;become less sensitive to the presence of visual features when these are irrelevant to the task at hand. By flexibly adapting the complexity of task-state representations in this way, state-action mappings learned under one set of features can be used to plan in the presence of others.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Pupil-Linked Arousal Response Reveals Aberrant Attention Regulation among Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder</a></h4>

              
                <p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder that is characterized by difficulties with social interaction and interpersonal communication. It has been argued that abnormal attentional function to exogenous stimuli precedes and contributes to the core ASD symptoms. Notably, the locus ceruleus (LC) and its noradrenergic projections throughout the brain modulate attentional function, but the extent to which this locus ceruleus&ndash;norepinephrine (LC&ndash;NE) system influences attention in individuals with ASD, who frequently exhibit dysregulated alerting and attention orienting, is unknown. We examined dynamic attention control in girls and boys with ASD at rest using the pupil dilation response (PDR) as a noninvasive measure of LC&ndash;NE activity. When gender- and age-matched neurotypical participants were passively exposed to an auditory stream, their PDR decreased for recurrent stimuli but remained sensitive to surprising deviant stimuli. In contrast, children with ASD showed less habituation to recurrent stimuli as well as a diminished phasic response to deviants, particularly those containing social information. Their tonic habituation impairment predicts their phasic orienting impairment, and both impairments correlated with the severity of ASD symptom. Because of the fact that these pupil-linked responses are observed when individuals passively listen without any task engagement, our findings imply that the intricate and dynamic attention allocation mechanism, mediated by the subcortical LC&ndash;NE system, is impaired in ASD.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Autistic individuals show attentional abnormalities to even simple sensory inputs, which emerge even before formal diagnosis. One possible mechanism behind these abnormalities is a malfunctioning pacemaker of their attention system, the locus ceruleus&ndash;norepinephrine pathway. Here we found, according to the pupillary response (a noradrenergic activity proxy), autistic children are hypersensitive to repeated sounds but hyposensitive to surprising deviant sounds when compared with age-matched controls. Importantly, hypersensitivity to repetitions predicts hyposensitivity to deviant sounds, and both abnormalities positively correlate to the severity of autistic symptoms. This provides strong evidence that autistic children have faulty noradrenergic regulation, which might underly the attentional atypicalities previously evidenced in various cortical responses in autistic individuals.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">A Spatiotemporal Map of Reading Aloud</a></h4>

              
                <p>Reading words aloud is a fundamental aspect of literacy. The rapid rate at which multiple distributed neural substrates are engaged in this process can only be probed via techniques with high spatiotemporal resolution. We probed this with direct intracranial recordings covering most of the left hemisphere in 46 humans (26 male, 20 female) as they read aloud regular, exception and pseudo-words. We used this to create a spatiotemporal map of word processing and to derive how broadband  activity varies with multiple word attributes critical to reading speed: lexicality, word frequency, and orthographic neighborhood. We found that lexicality is encoded earliest in mid-fusiform (mFus) cortex, and precentral sulcus, and is represented reliably enough to allow single-trial lexicality decoding. Word frequency is first represented in mFus and later in the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and inferior parietal sulcus (IPS), while orthographic neighborhood sensitivity resides solely in IPS. We thus isolate the neural correlates of the distributed reading network involving mFus, IFG, IPS, precentral sulcus, and motor cortex and provide direct evidence for parallel processes via the lexical route from mFus to IFG, and the sublexical route from IPS and precentral sulcus to anterior IFG.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Reading aloud depends on multiple complex cerebral computations: mapping from a written letter string on a page to a sequence of spoken sound representations. Here, we used direct intracranial recordings in a large cohort while they read aloud known and novel words, to track, across space and time, the progression of neural representations of behaviorally relevant factors that govern reading speed. We find, concordant with cognitive models of reading, that known and novel words are differentially processed through a lexical route, sensitive to frequency of occurrence of known words in natural language, and a sublexical route, performing letter-by-letter construction of novel words.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Sensory Evidence Accumulation Using Optic Flow in a Naturalistic Navigation Task</a></h4>

              
                <p>Sensory evidence accumulation is considered a hallmark of decision-making in noisy environments. Integration of sensory inputs has been traditionally studied using passive stimuli, segregating perception from action. Lessons learned from this approach, however, may not generalize to ethological behaviors like navigation, where there is an active interplay between perception and action. We designed a sensory-based sequential decision task in virtual reality in which humans and monkeys navigated to a memorized location by integrating optic flow generated by their own joystick movements. A major challenge in such closed-loop tasks is that subjects' actions will determine future sensory input, causing ambiguity about whether they rely on sensory input rather than expectations based solely on a learned model of the dynamics. To test whether subjects integrated optic flow over time, we used three independent experimental manipulations, unpredictable optic flow perturbations, which pushed subjects off their trajectory; gain manipulation of the joystick controller, which changed the consequences of actions; and manipulation of the optic flow density, which changed the information borne by sensory evidence. Our results suggest that both macaques (male) and humans (female/male) relied heavily on optic flow, thereby demonstrating a critical role for sensory evidence accumulation during naturalistic action-perception closed-loop tasks.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The temporal integration of evidence is a fundamental component of mammalian intelligence. Yet, it has traditionally been studied using experimental paradigms that fail to capture the closed-loop interaction between actions and sensations inherent in real-world continuous behaviors. These conventional paradigms use binary decision tasks and passive stimuli with statistics that remain stationary over time. Instead, we developed a naturalistic visuomotor visual navigation paradigm that mimics the causal structure of real-world sensorimotor interactions and probed the extent to which participants integrate sensory evidence by adding task manipulations that reveal complementary aspects of the computation.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Macrophage Migration Inhibitory Factor (MIF) Makes Complex Contributions to Pain-Related Hyperactivity of Nociceptors after Spinal Cord Injury</a></h4>

              
                <p>Neuropathic pain is a major, inadequately treated challenge for people with spinal cord injury (SCI). While SCI pain mechanisms are often assumed to be in the CNS, rodent studies have revealed mechanistic contributions from primary nociceptors. These neurons become chronically hyperexcitable after SCI, generating ongoing electrical activity that promotes ongoing pain. A major question is whether extrinsic chemical signals help to drive ongoing electrical activity after SCI. People living with SCI exhibit acute and chronic elevation of circulating levels of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), a cytokine implicated in preclinical pain models. Probable nociceptors isolated from male rats and exposed to an MIF concentration reported in human plasma (1 ng/ml) showed hyperactivity similar to that induced by SCI, although, surprisingly, a 10-fold higher concentration failed to increase excitability. Conditioned behavioral aversion to a chamber associated with peripheral MIF injection suggested that MIF stimulates affective pain. A MIF inhibitor, Iso-1, reversed SCI-induced hyperexcitability. Unlike chronic SCI-induced hyperexcitability, acute MIF-induced hyperexcitability was only partially abrogated by inhibiting ERK signaling. Unexpectedly, MIF concentrations that induced hyperactivity in nociceptors from naive animals, after SCI induced a long-lasting conversion from a highly excitable nonaccommodating type to a rapidly accommodating, hypoexcitable type, possibly as a homeostatic response to prolonged depolarization. Treatment with conditioned medium from cultures of DRG cells obtained after SCI was sufficient to induce MIF-dependent hyperactivity in neurons from naive rats. Thus, changes in systemic and DRG levels of MIF may help to maintain SCI-induced nociceptor hyperactivity that persistently promotes pain.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Chronic neuropathic pain is a major challenge for people with spinal cord injury (SCI). Pain can drastically impair quality of life, and produces substantial economic and social burdens. Available treatments, including opioids, remain inadequate. This study shows that the cytokine macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) can induce pain-like behavior and plays an important role in driving persistent ongoing electrical activity in injury-detecting sensory neurons (nociceptors) in a rat SCI model. The results indicate that SCI produces an increase in MIF release within sensory ganglia. Low MIF levels potently excite nociceptors, but higher levels trigger a long-lasting hypoexcitable state. These findings suggest that therapeutic targeting of MIF in neuropathic pain states may reduce pain and sensory dysfunction by curbing nociceptor hyperactivity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">SARS-CoV-2 and the role of close contact in transmission: a systematic review [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations, 1 not approved]</a></h4>

              
                Background: SARS-CoV-2 transmission has been reported to be associated with close contact with infected individuals. However, the mechanistic pathway for transmission in close contact settings is unclear. Our objective was to identify, appraise and summarise the evidence from studies assessing the role of close contact in SARS-CoV-2 transmission.  Methods: This review is part of an Open Evidence Review on Transmission Dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. We conduct ongoing searches using WHO Covid-19 Database, LitCovid, medRxiv, PubMed and Google Scholar; assess study quality based on the QUADAS-2 criteria and report important findings on an ongoing basis. Results: We included 278 studies: 258 primary studies and 20 systematic reviews. The settings for primary studies were predominantly in home/quarantine facilities (39.5%) and acute care hospitals (12%). The overall reporting quality of the studies was low-to-moderate. There was significant heterogeneity in design and methodology. The frequency of attack rates (PCR testing) varied between 2.1-75%; attack rates were highest in prison and wedding venues, and in households. The frequency of secondary attack rates was 0.3-100% with rates highest in home/quarantine settings. Three studies showed no transmission if the index case was a recurrent infection. Viral culture was performed in four studies of which three found replication-competent virus; culture results were negative where index cases had recurrent infections. Eighteen studies performed genomic sequencing with phylogenetic analysis – the completeness of genomic similarity ranged from 77-100%. Findings from systematic reviews showed that children were significantly less likely to transmit SARS-CoV-2 and household contact was associated with a significantly increased risk of infection. Conclusions: The evidence from published studies demonstrates that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted in close contact settings. The risk of transmission is greater in household contacts. There was a wide variation in methodology. Standardized guidelines for reporting transmission in close contact settings should be developed.

                Background: Conventional multi-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy (CMLC) has become the current ‘gold standard’ technique in gallbladder disease. Single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILC) has gained attention due to its benefits in improving patient cosmetic results and pain reduction. We aim to assess the latest evidence on the feasibility, safety and surgical outcomes of SILC and CMLC. Methods: We conducted searches for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in PubMed, PubMed Central (PMC), and Europe PMC between December 2011 and 2021. The latest search was conducted in January 2022. We analyzed several outcomes, including perioperative complications, estimated blood loss, operation time, conversion to open surgery, hospital stay, pain score, cosmesis, and days of return to work. Cochrane Risk of Bias (RoB) 2.0 tool was used to evaluate quality of studies. Mantel-Haenszel's formula and Inverse Variance method were conducted to synthesize results. This study was accomplished in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. Results: A total of 37 studies were eligible, with a total of 2,129 and 2,392 patients who underwent SILC and CMLC. Our study demonstrated a superiority of SILC for the visual analog score (VAS) at six hours post-operation [mean difference (MD) -0.58 (95% CI -1.11, -0.05), p=0.03], cosmesis one-month post-operation [standard MD 2.12 (95% CI 1.10, 3.13), p<0.0001], and cosmesis six months post-operation [standard MD 0.53 (95% CI 0.06, 0.99), p<0.0001]. Meanwhile, SILC showed a longer operation time [MD 10.45 (95% CI 6.74, 14.17), p<0.00001]. In terms of VAS at four time points (4, 8, 12, and 24 hours), perioperative complications, estimated blood loss, conversion to open surgery, hospital stay and days to return to work, SILC did not differ from CMLC. Conclusions: SILC is a safe, feasible and favorable procedure in terms of pain reduction and cosmetic results. The option between both procedures is based on surgeon preferences. Registration: PROSPERO (CRD42022306532; 23 February 2022).

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The role of biomarkers in the prediction of mortality in hospitalized patients for COVID-19 [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Despite the advances in the prognostic determinants in patients with COVID-19, it is not well known which hospitalized patients may course with an adverse outcome. The aim of this study was to identify biomarkers at hospital admission associated with increased risk of death in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Methods: Prospective study in patients with COVID-19 admitted to a hospital and followed until discharge or death. All patients underwent clinical evaluation and laboratory tests on the first day of admission. Results: 100 patients were included, with a mean age of 57 years and 19 died. The variables associated with higher mortality were age), platelet count, D-dimer and troponin. Platelet count was independently associated with mortality, with area under the curve: 0.74 [95% CI: 0.62 - 0.86; p = 0.001]. The area under the curve of D-dimer for death was 0.74 [95% CI: 0.62 - 0.86; p= 0.001]. Considering the Kaplan Meier curves for survival in the hospitalization, there was a significant difference in the curves for D-dimer cutoff point above or below 1.1 mg/L (Log-Rank, p=0.03). Conclusion: The levels of D-dimer and platelet count have good accuracy in the detection of increased risk of death in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Seroprevalence of herpes simplex virus type-2 among pregnant women in Wad Madani-Sudan: a cross sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Sexually transmitted diseases are known to pose a significant public health threat. Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) is a viral infection with high prevalence in Sudan, particularly among pregnant women. The aim of this study was to determine the seroprevalence of HSV-2 among pregnant women as well as their associated potential risk factors in Wad Madani-Sudan. Methods: In total, 92 pregnant women who attended the Maternity Hospital and Dr. Altigani Sedeeg Fertility Center at Wad Madani, AL-Gezira State, between April and August 2018 were included in this study. HSV-2 Immunoglobulins (IgG and IgM) were assayed by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique. Results: The seroprevalence of HSV-2 IgM and IgG were 35(38%) and 90(97.8%), respectively. A Higher prevalence of HSV-2 IgG 45(48.9%) and 13(14.1%) for IgM was detected in pregnant women aged 15-24 years old with a significant association between HSV-2 IgM and age distribution group (p-value=0.001).  HSV-2 IgM and IgG seropositivity were highest in the first trimester; 26(34.2%), and 75(81.5%), respectively. The highest rate of HSV-2 IgM was detected in 19 (20.7%) women with a history of abortion, while the highest rate of HSV-2 IgG was seen in 50 (54.3%) women without a history of abortion. The statistical analysis results did not reveal significant differences between gestational stages and history of abortion with the presence of HSV-2 antibodies. Conclusion: The prevalence of HSV-2 was significant among pregnant women in Wad Madani- Sudan. There was a strong association between HSV-2 IgM seropositivity and the age of pregnant women.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Returning to work at school during the COVID -19 pandemic, is it stressful for schoolteachers? Assessment of immediate psychological effects: a cross sectional study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The adoption of remote classes for students has been in vogue since the onset of the pandemic. Schools reopened in a phased manner after the second wave of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in India. Reverting to the regular face-to-face teaching for students became a challenge to the teachers and students, especially at times when there was an impending third wave on the way. The study aimed to assess the presence of symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress in teachers who attended reopened schools in the scenario of face-to-face classes. In addition, we studied the association of psychological symptoms with teachers' age groups, gender, school boards, and school institution type. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted between October to December 2021 after schools had reopened. Data was collected using Google Form questionnaires in 124 schoolteachers. The Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale - 21 Items (DASS-21) questionnaire assessed the psychological symptoms. Results: Of 124 schoolteachers, 108(87.1%) were female, 112 (90.3%) were from private institutions, and 70(56.5%) were from Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) school boards. The prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress in teachers was 30.6%, 45.2%, and 20.2%, respectively. Nearly 80% of the female teachers expressed depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms. Amongst all the age groups, symptoms were higher in 40-49 group. We found anxiety to be statistically significant when compared with gender (p-0.042). We found no statistically significant differences concerning age groups, school boards, or school institutions with any psychological symptoms. Conclusions: The prevalence of psychological symptoms was high among schoolteachers after schools reopened for regular face-to-face teaching. Gender was associated with anxiety in teachers. We agree that identifying teachers' symptoms and providing adequate psychological counseling/support would improve their mental health status and thereby the quality of teaching to students.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Gaze-dependent evidence accumulation predicts multi-alternative risky choice behaviour</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Felix Molter, Armin W. Thomas, Scott A. Huettel, Hauke R. Heekeren, Peter N. C. Mohr</p>

Choices are influenced by gaze allocation during deliberation, so that fixating an alternative longer leads to increased probability of choosing it. Gaze-dependent evidence accumulation provides a parsimonious account of choices, response times and gaze-behaviour in many simple decision scenarios. Here, we test whether this framework can also predict more complex context-dependent patterns of choice in a three-alternative risky choice task, where choices and eye movements were subject to attraction and compromise effects. Choices were best described by a gaze-dependent evidence accumulation model, where subjective values of alternatives are discounted while not fixated. Finally, we performed a systematic search over a large model space, allowing us to evaluate the relative contribution of different forms of gaze-dependence and additional mechanisms previously not considered by gaze-dependent accumulation models. Gaze-dependence remained the most important mechanism, but participants with strong attraction effects employed an additional similarity-dependent inhibition mechanism found in other models of multi-alternative multi-attribute choice.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A Bayesian method for identifying associations between response variables and bacterial community composition</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Adrian Verster, Nicholas Petronella, Judy Green, Fernando Matias, Stephen P. J. Brooks</p>

Determining associations between intestinal bacteria and continuously measured physiological outcomes is important for understanding the bacteria-host relationship but is not straightforward since abundance data (compositional data) are not normally distributed. To address this issue, we developed a fully Bayesian linear regression model (BRACoD; Bayesian Regression Analysis of Compositional Data) with physiological measurements (continuous data) as a function of a matrix of relative bacterial abundances. Bacteria can be classified as operational taxonomic units or by taxonomy (genus, family, etc.). Bacteria associated with the physiological measurement were identified using a Bayesian variable selection method: Stochastic Search Variable Selection. The output is a list of inclusion probabilities (p^) and coefficients that indicate the strength of the association (β^included) for each bacterial taxa. Tests with simulated communities showed that adopting a cut point value of p^ ≥ 0.3 for identifying included bacteria optimized the true positive rate (TPR) while maintaining a false positive rate (FPR) of ≤ 5%. At this point, the chances of identifying non-contributing bacteria were low and all well-established contributors were included. Comparison with other methods showed that BRACoD (at p^ ≥ 0.3) had higher precision and a higher TPR than a commonly used center log transformed LASSO procedure (clr-LASSO) as well as higher TPR than an off-the-shelf Spike and Slab method after center log transformation (clr-SS). BRACoD was also less likely to include non-contributing bacteria that merely correlate with contributing bacteria. Analysis of a rat microbiome experiment identified 47 operational taxonomic units that contributed to fecal butyrate levels. Of these, 31 were positively and 16 negatively associated with butyrate. Consistent with their known role in butyrate metabolism, most of these fell within the Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae. We conclude that BRACoD provides a more precise and accurate method for determining bacteria associated with a continuous physiological outcome compared to clr-LASSO. It is more sensitive than a generalized clr-SS algorithm, although it has a higher FPR. Its ability to distinguish genuine contributors from correlated bacteria makes it better suited to discriminating bacteria that directly contribute to an outcome. The algorithm corrects for the distortions arising from compositional data making it appropriate for analysis of microbiome data.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Differential activation of a frontoparietal network explains population-level differences in statistical learning from speech</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Joan Orpella, M. Florencia Assaneo, Pablo Ripollés, Laura Noejovich, Diana López-Barroso, Ruth de Diego-Balaguer, David Poeppel</p>

People of all ages display the ability to detect and learn from patterns in seemingly random stimuli. Referred to as statistical learning (SL), this process is particularly critical when learning a spoken language, helping in the identification of discrete words within a spoken phrase. Here, by considering individual differences in speech auditory–motor synchronization, we demonstrate that recruitment of a specific neural network supports behavioral differences in SL from speech. While independent component analysis (ICA) of fMRI data revealed that a network of auditory and superior pre/motor regions is universally activated in the process of learning, a frontoparietal network is additionally and selectively engaged by only some individuals (high auditory–motor synchronizers). Importantly, activation of this frontoparietal network is related to a boost in learning performance, and interference with this network via articulatory suppression (AS; i.e., producing irrelevant speech during learning) normalizes performance across the entire sample. Our work provides novel insights on SL from speech and reconciles previous contrasting findings. These findings also highlight a more general need to factor in fundamental individual differences for a precise characterization of cognitive phenomena.

In this issue of PLOS Biology, Kreher and colleagues show in a mouse model that in vivo, neurons and not only myelinating glia are primary effectors of disease progression in Krabbe disease. The neuron-specific model generated allows the unprecedented capacity to investigate the neuronal autonomous component of this disorder.

This Primer explores the implications of a PLOS Biology showing that in vivo, neurons (not only myelinating glia) are primary effectors of disease progression in Krabbe disease; the neuron-specific animal model described allows an unprecedented opportunity to investigate the neuronal-autonomous component of this disorder.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Lower serum BDNF as a predictor of post-stroke cognitive impairment in acute ischemic stroke patients [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Reduced level of serum BDNF in acute stroke patients is associated with poor outcomes. We aimed to identify the role of serum BDNF level as a predictor for post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI). Methods: This was a prospective study. We recruited acute ischemic stroke patients in Dr. Sardjito General Hospital Yogyakarta, Indonesia followed them up for 90 days (3 months). Serum BDNF was collected at day 5 and day 30 of stroke onset and measured by ELISA. Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was used to measure the cognitive function at 90 days of follow up. ROC curve was conducted to measure the cut-off point of the BDNF level. Factors independently associated with PSCI were analyzed by using stepwise regression. Results: Among 89 patients recruited, 60 patients (67.41%) developed PSCI. The mean age of PSCI and non-PSCI patients was 62.7 ± 9.5 and 57.5 ± 8.7, respectively (p = 0.01). Patients with dyslipidemia were less likely to develop PSCI (OR 0.19, 95%CI 0.06–0.56, p < 0.05). In addition, patients with day 5-serum BDNF level < 23.29 ng/mL were five times more likely to develop PSCI compared with their counterparts (OR 5.02, 95%CI 1.67–15.04, p < 0.05). Conclusions: Among acute ischemic stroke patients, those with serum BDNF <23.29 ng/mL had a higher risk of developing PSCI, while those with dyslipidemia had a lower risk of PSCI. This study suggests that BDNF could be a predictor of PSCI, allowing for earlier detection and better preventive strategies.

                Characterizing the somatic mutation landscape of a cohort of patients has become a routine task in cancer research in recent years. Such studies are often highly interdisciplinary, requiring iterative analysis that must be evaluated at each step by many researchers. Therefore, there is a growing need for reporting tools that can easily generate interactive reports for sharing data and results with collaborators. Here we present an R package, MAFDash, that tries to simplify summarization and visualization of mutation data from Mutation Annotation Format (MAF) files. The output HTML dashboard is a self-contained report that can be used for downstream analysis and sharing results. MAFDash is freely available on Github (https://github.com/CCBR/MAFDash).

                Background: Dengue virus (DENV) and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)) are two viral illnesses that require very distinct management protocols. Missed diagnosis and under reporting of DENV is predicted due to COVID-19 pandemic. Pregnancy is associated with increased fetal and maternal morbidity and mortality due to both illnesses. Co-infection need to be reported and studied to optimize the outcomes. Methods: This is a retrospective study on pregnant patients with COVID-19 and DENV co-infection conducted from the medical records from 1st of April 2021 to 1st of September 2021. Results: In this series four patients are described. Patient 1 is a diagnosed patient with immune thrombocytopenic purpura who was in remission. She developed DENV infection during recovery of SARS-CoV-2. She received intensive care unit (ICU) care during the leaking phase. Patient 2 had an uncomplicated miscarriage during the co-infection. Patient 3 was a patient with advanced maternal age with multiple co-morbidities. She did not progress into the leaking phase. Diagnosis of DENV was missed in patient 4 and she had a fetal death. Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 and DENV co-infection in pregnancy can be life threatening to the mother and can lead to adverse fatal outcomes. Timely diagnosis and multidisciplinary management are essential for better outcomes. Continuous data collection and reporting is advisable till the guidance is formed.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">Cognition through the lens of a body–brain dynamic system</a></h4>

              
                Continuous interactions between physiological body–brain rhythms influence how individuals act, perceive, and evaluate their environment. Despite increasing interest, the intricate interface between breathing, cardiac, neural rhythms, and cognitive function remains poorly understood. By evaluating current theoretical and empirical implications, we derive an integrative framework of a ‘body–brain dynamic system’ that combines a hidden hierarchical structure with dynamical state transitions. We propose that body–brain signals can interchangeably drive state- and task-specific coupling mechanisms which influence cognitive functions.

                In neuroscience, the term ‘causality’ is used to refer to different concepts, leading to confusion. Here we illustrate some of those variations, and we suggest names for them. We then introduce four ways to enhance clarity around causality in neuroscience.

                Neuronal wiring is facilitated by diverse synaptic adhesion proteins and their repertoire of alternatively spliced isoforms. In this issue of Neuron, Hauser et al. (2022) uncovered the role of a GPI-anchored neurexin 3 splice variant in inhibitory synapse development and dendritic inhibition.

                The drive to sleep is strongly influenced by time of day, with temporal information conveyed through the circadian clock. In pursuit of the neural mechanisms underlying this process, in this issue of Neuron, Sun et al. identify a novel circuit that links circadian output neurons to sleep-promoting neurons within the mushroom bodies.

                Corticostriatal circuits represent value and choice during value-guided decision making. In this issue of Neuron, Balewski et al. (2022) show that caudate nucleus and orbitofrontal cortex use distinct value signals during choice, which are consistent with two parallel valuation mechanisms, one fast, one slow.

                In this issue of Neuron, Dal Monte, Fan, and colleagues (Dal Monte et al., 2022) show that rhesus monkeys have a widely distributed and robust neuronal representation of social gaze: looking at others and where others are looking.

                My father was raised on a dairy and maple syrup farm in Northern Québec, Canada, in a small village, St. Cyrille de L’Islet. He was the eldest of seven children, now survived by his brother and five sisters. The day after my father died, I spoke with my father’s brother Luc. I asked, “Mon Oncle, qu’est que tu as fait aujourd’hui?” (Uncle, what did you do today?) He replied, “Biens, j’etais dans le bois.” (Well, I was in the forest.) This was answered with a tone of such obviousness that I knew immediately it had been foolish for me to ask the question.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Combining hypothesis- and data-driven neuroscience modeling in FAIR workflows</a></h4>

              
                Modeling in neuroscience occurs at the intersection of different points of view and approaches. Typically, hypothesis-driven modeling brings a question into focus so that a model is constructed to investigate a specific hypothesis about how the system works or why certain phenomena are observed. Data-driven modeling, on the other hand, follows a more unbiased approach, with model construction informed by the computationally intensive use of data. At the same time, researchers employ models at different biological scales and at different levels of abstraction. Combining these models while validating them against experimental data increases understanding of the multiscale brain. However, a lack of interoperability, transparency, and reusability of both models and the workflows used to construct them creates barriers for the integration of models representing different biological scales and built using different modeling philosophies. We argue that the same imperatives that drive resources and policy for data – such as the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles – also support the integration of different modeling approaches. The FAIR principles require that data be shared in formats that are Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. Applying these principles to models and modeling workflows, as well as the data used to constrain and validate them, would allow researchers to find, reuse, question, validate, and extend published models, regardless of whether they are implemented phenomenologically or mechanistically, as a few equations or as a multiscale, hierarchical system. To illustrate these ideas, we use a classical synaptic plasticity model, the Bienenstock–Cooper–Munro rule, as an example due to its long history, different levels of abstraction, and implementation at many scales.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The transcription factor RUNX2 drives the generation of human NK cells and promotes tissue residency</a></h4>

              
                Natural killer (NK) cells are innate lymphocytes that eliminate virus-infected and cancer cells by cytotoxicity and cytokine secretion. In addition to circulating NK cells, distinct tissue-resident NK subsets have been identified in various organs. Although transcription factors regulating NK cell development and function have been extensively studied in mice, the role of RUNX2 in these processes has not been investigated, neither in mice nor in human. Here, by manipulating RUNX2 expression with either knockdown or overexpression in human haematopoietic stem cell-based NK cell differentiation cultures, combined with transcriptomic and ChIP-sequencing analyses, we established that RUNX2 drives the generation of NK cells, possibly through induction of IL-2Rβ expression in NK progenitor cells. Importantly, RUNX2 promotes tissue residency in human NK cells. Our findings have the potential to improve existing NK cell-based cancer therapies and can impact research fields beyond NK cell biology, since tissue-resident subsets have also been described in other lymphocyte subpopulations.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Host-parasite coevolution promotes innovation through deformations in fitness landscapes</a></h4>

              
                During the struggle for survival, populations occasionally evolve new functions that give them access to untapped ecological opportunities. Theory suggests that coevolution between species can promote the evolution of such innovations by deforming fitness landscapes in ways that open new adaptive pathways. We directly tested this idea by using high-throughput gene editing-phenotyping technology (MAGE-Seq) to measure the fitness landscape of a virus, bacteriophage λ, as it coevolved with its host, the bacterium <i>Escherichia coli</i>. An analysis of the empirical fitness landscape revealed mutation-by-mutation-by-host-genotype interactions that demonstrate coevolution modified the contours of λ’s landscape. Computer simulations of λ’s evolution on a static versus shifting fitness landscape showed that the changes in contours increased λ’s chances of evolving the ability to use a new host receptor. By coupling sequencing and pairwise competition experiments, we demonstrated that the first mutation λ evolved en route to the innovation would only evolve in the presence of the ancestral host, whereas later steps in λ’s evolution required the shift to a resistant host. When time-shift replays of the coevolution experiment were run where host evolution was artificially accelerated, λ did not innovate to use the new receptor. This study provides direct evidence for the role of coevolution in driving evolutionary novelty and provides a quantitative framework for predicting evolution in coevolving ecological communities.

                In dopaminergic (DA) substantia nigra (SN) neurons Cav2.3 R-type Ca<sup>2+</sup>-currents contribute to somatodendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup>-oscillations. This activity may contribute to the selective degeneration of these neurons in Parkinson's disease (PD) since Cav2.3-knockout is neuroprotective in a PD mouse model. Here we show that in tsA-201-cells the membrane-anchored β2-splice variants β2a and β2e are required to stabilize Cav2.3 gating properties allowing sustained Cav2.3 availability during simulated pacemaking and enhanced Ca<sup>2+</sup>-currents during bursts. We confirmed the expression of β2a- and β2e-subunit transcripts in the mouse SN and in identified SN DA neurons. Patch-clamp recordings of mouse DA midbrain neurons in culture and SN DA neurons in brain slices revealed SNX-482-sensitive R-type Ca<sup>2+</sup>-currents with voltage-dependent gating properties that suggest modulation by β2a- and/or β2e-subunits. Thus, β-subunit alternative splicing may prevent a fraction of Cav2.3 channels from inactivation in continuously active, highly vulnerable SN DA neurons, thereby also supporting Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals contributing to the (patho)physiological role of Cav2.3 channels in PD.

                Naturalistic animal behavior exhibits a strikingly complex organization in the temporal domain, with variability arising from at least three sources: hierarchical, contextual, and stochastic. What neural mechanisms and computational principles underlie such intricate temporal features? In this review, we provide a critical assessment of the existing behavioral and neurophysiological evidence for these sources of temporal variability in naturalistic behavior. Recent research converges on an emergent mechanistic theory of temporal variability based on attractor neural networks and metastable dynamics, arising via coordinated interactions between mesoscopic neural circuits. We highlight the crucial role played by structural heterogeneities as well as noise from mesoscopic feedback loops in regulating flexible behavior. We assess the shortcomings and missing links in the current theoretical and experimental literature and propose new directions of investigation to fill these gaps.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Taste quality and hunger interactions in a feeding sensorimotor circuit</a></h4>

              
                Taste detection and hunger state dynamically regulate the decision to initiate feeding. To study how context-appropriate feeding decisions are generated, we combined synaptic resolution circuit reconstruction with targeted genetic access to specific neurons to elucidate a gustatory sensorimotor circuit for feeding initiation in adult <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. This circuit connects gustatory sensory neurons to proboscis motor neurons through three intermediate layers. Most neurons in this pathway are necessary and sufficient for proboscis extension, a feeding initiation behavior, and respond selectively to sugar taste detection. Pathway activity is amplified by hunger signals that act at select second-order neurons to promote feeding initiation in food-deprived animals. In contrast, the feeding initiation circuit is inhibited by a bitter taste pathway that impinges on premotor neurons, illuminating a local motif that weighs sugar and bitter taste detection to adjust behavioral outcome. Together, these studies reveal central mechanisms for the integration of external taste detection and internal nutritive state to flexibly execute a critical feeding decision.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Fibromyalgia patients with high levels of anti-satellite glia cell IgG antibodies present with more severe symptoms</a></h4>

              
                Objective: Transferring fibromyalgia patient IgG to mice induces pain-like behaviour and fibromyalgia IgG binds mouse and human satellite glia cells (SGCs). These findings suggest that autoantibodies could be part of fibromyalgia pathology. However, it is unknown how frequently fibromyalgia patients have anti-SGC antibodies and how anti-SGC antibodies associate with disease severity. Methods: We quantified serum or plasma anti-SGC IgG levels in two fibromyalgia cohorts from Sweden and Canada using an indirect immunofluorescence murine cell culture assay. Fibromyalgia serum IgG binding to human SGCs in human dorsal root ganglia tissue sections was assessed by immunofluorescence (n=14/group). Results: In the cell culture assay anti-SGC IgG levels were increased in both fibromyalgia cohorts compared to controls. Elevated anti-SGC IgG was associated with higher levels of self-reported pain in both cohorts, and higher fibromyalgia impact questionnaire scores and increased pressure sensitivity in the Swedish cohort. Anti-SGC IgG levels were not associated with fibromyalgia duration. Swedish FM patients were clustered into FM-severe and FM-mild groups and the FM-severe group had elevated anti-SGC IgG compared to the FM-mild and controls. Anti-SGC IgG levels detected in culture were positively correlated with increased binding to human SGCs. Moreover, the FM-severe group had elevated IgG binding to human SGCs compared to the FM-mild and control groups. Conclusions: A subset of fibromyalgia patients have elevated levels of anti-SGC antibodies, and the antibodies are associated with more severe fibromyalgia severity. Screening fibromyalgia patients for anti-SGC antibodies could provide a path to personalized treatment options that target autoantibodies and autoantibody production.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Mitochondrial complementation occurs in rat hippocampal axons and supports the synaptic vesicle cycle.</a></h4>

              
                Mitochondria exert powerful control over cellular physiology, contributing to ion homeostasis, energy production, and metabolite biosynthesis. Mitochondrial trafficking and function are vital to neurons, with organelle impairment or altered morphology observed in every neurodegenerative disorder studied. While this organelle and its biosynthetic products are critical for cellular function, decreased output and/or byproducts (e.g., free radicals), can be harmful, and organelle quality control (QC) mechanisms are required to maintain function and prevent a cascade of damage. Owing to its length and general lack of biosynthetic machinery, the axon is particularly sensitive to damage and there is little consensus regarding the details of mitochondrial QC mechanisms in this compartment. Here we investigate the basal, unstressed behavior of axonal mitochondria, focusing on mitochondrial trafficking and fusion to better understand potential QC mechanisms. We observed size and redox asymmetry of mitochondrial traffic in the axon, suggestive of an active QC mechanism. Importantly, we demonstrate, in detail, biochemical complementation of axonal mitochondria. Upon disruption of mitochondrial fusion, we observed an altered synaptic proteome, presynaptic calcium dyshomeostasis, decreased levels of exocytosis, and a reduction in synaptic vesicle recruitment from the reserve pool during extended stimulation. These results support an active mitochondrial trafficking and fusion related QC process that supports presynaptic physiology.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neurodevelopmental disorder associated mutations in TAOK1 reveal its function as a plasma membrane remodeling kinase</a></h4>

              
                Mutations in TAOK1, a serine-threonine kinase encoding gene are strongly associated with both autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and neurodevelopmental delay (NDD). However, molecular function of this evolutionarily conserved kinase and the mechanisms through which TAOK1 mutations lead to neuropathology are unknown. Here, we showed that TAOK1 is highly expressed in neurons within the brain, and has a functional role in remodeling the plasma membrane through direct association with phosphoinositides. We characterized four NDD-associated TAOK1 mutations, and demonstrated that these mutations render TAOK1 catalytically dead. Kinase dead TAOK1 mutants were aberrantly trapped in membrane-bound state, which induced exuberant membrane protrusions. Expression of TAOK1 disease mutants in hippocampal neurons led to abnormal growth of the dendritic arbor. The coiled-coil region C-terminal to the kinase domain are predicted to fold into a triple helix. We showed that this triple helix directly bound phospholipids, and was required for both TAOK1 membrane association and induction of aberrant protrusions. Further, TAOK1 mutants were rescued from their membrane-trapped state by exogenous expression of the isolated kinase domain. Utilizing mass-spectrometry, we identified critical residues in the triple helix phosphorylated by TAOK1 that autoregulated its plasma membrane association. These findings define a previously unknown function of TAOK1 as a unique plasma membrane remodeling kinase, and reveal the underlying mechanisms through which TAOK1 dysfunction leads to neurodevelopmental disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cortical Parvalbumin-positive Interneuron Development and Function are Altered in the APC Conditional Knockout Mouse Model of Infantile Spasm Syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Infantile Spasms syndrome (ISS) is a childhood epilepsy syndrome characterized by infantile or late onset spasms, abnormal neonatal EEG, and epilepsy. Few treatments exist for IS, clinical outcomes are poor, and the molecular and circuit-level etiologies of IS are not well understood. Multiple human ISS risk genes are linked to Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, a pathway which controls developmental transcriptional programs and promotes glutamatergic excitation via beta-catenin's role as a synaptic scaffold. We previously showed that deleting adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), a component of the beta-catenin destruction complex, in excitatory neurons (APC cKO mice, APCfl/fl x CaMKIIalphaCre) in mice increased beta-catenin levels in developing glutamatergic neurons and led to infantile behavioral spasms, abnormal neonatal EEG, and adult epilepsy. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the development of inhibitory GABAergic interneurons (INs) is disrupted in APC cKOs. IN dysfunction is implicated in human ISS, is a feature of other rodent models of ISS and may contribute to the manifestation of spasms and seizures. We found that parvalbumin positive INs (PV+INs), an important source of cortical inhibition, were decreased in number, underwent disproportionate developmental apoptosis, and had altered dendrite morphology at P9, the peak time of behavioral spasms. PV+INs received excessive excitatory input and their intrinsic ability to fire action potentials was reduced at all timepoints examined (P9, P14, P60). Subsequently, synaptic inhibition of pyramidal neurons was uniquely altered in the somatosensory cortex of APC cKO mice at all ages, with both decreased inhibition at P14 and enhanced inhibition at P9 and P60. These results indicate that inhibitory circuit dysfunction occurs in APC cKOs and, along with known changes in excitation, may contribute to ISS-related phenotypes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Common neural mechanisms control attention and working memory</a></h4>

              
                Although previous studies point to qualitative similarities between working memory (WM) and attention, the degree to which these two constructs rely on shared neural mechanisms remains unknown. Focusing on one such potentially shared mechanism, we tested the hypothesis that selecting an item within WM utilizes similar neural mechanisms as selecting a visible item via a shift of attention. We used fMRI and machine learning to decode both the selection among items visually available and the selection among items stored in WM in human subjects (both sexes). Patterns of activity in visual, parietal, and to a lesser extent frontal cortex predicted the locations of the selected items. Critically, these patterns were strikingly interchangeable; classifiers trained on data during attentional selection predicted selection from WM, and classifiers trained on data during selection from memory predicted attentional selection. Using models of voxel receptive fields, we visualized topographic population activity that revealed gain enhancements at the locations of the externally and internally selected items. Our results suggest that selecting among perceived items and selecting among items in WM share a common mechanism. This common mechanism, analogous to a shift of spatial attention, controls the relative gains of neural populations that encode behaviorally relevant information.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Somatostatin interneurons in auditory cortex regulate cortical representations and contribute to auditory perception</a></h4>

              
                As a major class of inhibitory neurons in the mammalian neocortex, somatostatin (SOM)-expressing GABAergic interneurons receive diverse inputs and target multiple types of local cortical neurons, representing a critical circuit component. Yet, the precise contribution of SOM interneurons to cortical circuit function and behavioral performance remains unclear. Here we address this using cell-type specific imaging and perturbation during an auditory perceptual decision task. Two-photon calcium imaging reveals that SOM interneurons exhibit task enhanced responses and stimulus category selectivity. Simultaneous optogenetic inactivation and two-photon imaging show that SOM interneurons exert divergent effects of either sharpening the sensory tuning or scaling down the tuning peak on different proportions of auditory cortical neurons. At behavioral level, inactivation of SOM interneurons reveals a specific contribution to perceptual discriminability. Our data delineate the role of SOM interneurons in cortical processing and auditory perception, linking cell-type specific cortical circuit computations with perceptual functions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dichotomous Intrinsic Properties of Adult Accumbens Medium Spiny Neurons Vanish in the Fragile X Mouse Model of Autism</a></h4>

              
                Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common cause of autism and inherited intellectual disability, is caused by the mutation of a single gene, fmr1, which encodes the Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). FXS patients suffer from cognitive, emotional, and social deficits indicative of dysfunction in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a structure central to the control of social behavior. The major cell type of the NAc, medium spiny neurons (MSNs), are differentiated in two subtypes based on their expression of either dopamine D1 or D2 receptors, their connectivity, and associated behavioral functions. Understanding how the absence of FMRP differentially affects the cellular properties of MSNs is a necessary step to categorize FXS cellular endophenotypes. To address this question, we comprehensively compared the intrinsic passive and active properties of MSN subtypes identified in a novel Fmr1-/y :: Drd1a-tdTomato mouse model allowing in-situ identification of MSN subtypes in FXS mice. Although fmr1 transcripts and their gene product, FMRP, were found in both MSNs subtypes, the results suggest cell-autonomous functions for Fmr1. The opposite membrane properties and action potential kinetics that normally discriminate D1- from D2-MSNs in WT mouse is either reversed or abolished in Fmr1-/y :: Drd1a-tdTomato mice. Multivariate analysis shed light on the compound effects of Fmr1 ablation by revealing how the phenotypic traits that distinguish each cell type in WT are modified in FXS. Together these data show that in Fragile X mice the normal dichotomy that characterizes NAc D1- and D2-MSNs is thrown out of balance, leading to a uniform phenotype that could underlie selected aspects of the pathology.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Learning efficient representations of heterogeneity in attractors for working memory</a></h4>

              
                Natural stimulus distributions often exhibit biases that we may learn to predict what we will observe next. Correspondingly, humans performing delayed estimation tasks are biased in favor of more commonly represented stimuli (e.g., common colors in visual tasks). These systematic biases may emerge from attractors in neural ensemble activity representing memoranda during delay periods. However, it is unclear how these heterogeneous representations are learned and how they may be represented in the brain. Here, we present a recurrently coupled neural network model that can learn heterogeneous input distributions via a combination of long term potentiation and homeostatic plasticity, generating an underlying potential landscape that governs the preferred positions of a bump attractor on a ring. The resulting spatially-heterogeneous synaptic network probabilistically represents the experienced stimulus history of the environment. We validate this theory using recently published response data from a delayed estimation task in which the distribution of stimuli was heterogeneous. Our results suggest that models that learn heterogeneities in the stimulus distribution explain the data more often than models for which connectivity is uniform throughout the duration of the experiment.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Towards a mesoscale physical modeling framework for stereotactic-EEG recordings</a></h4>

              
                Stereotactic-EEG (SEEG) and scalp EEG recordings can be modeled using mesoscale neural mass population models (NMM). However, the relationship between those mathematical models and the physics of the measurements is unclear. In addition, it is challenging to represent SEEG data by combining NMMs and volume conductor models due to the intermediate spatial scale represented by these measurements. Approach: We provide a framework combining the multi- compartmental modeling formalism and a detailed geometrical model to simulate the transmembrane currents that appear in a layer 3, 5 and 6 pyramidal cells due to a synaptic input. With this approach, it is possible to realistically simulate the current source density (CSD) depth profile inside a cortical patch due to inputs localized into a single cortical layer and the consequent voltage measured by two SEEG contacts using a volume conductor model. Based on this approach, we built a framework to connect the activity of a NMM with a volume conductor model and we simulated an example as a proof of concept. Main results: CSD depends strongly on the distribution of the synaptic inputs onto the different cortical layers and the equivalent current dipole strengths display considerable differences (of up to a factor of four in magnitude in our example). Thus, the inputs coming from different neural populations do not contribute equally to the electrophysiological recordings. A direct consequence of this is that the raw output of neural mass models is not a good proxy for electrical recordings. We also show that the simplest CSD model that can accurately reproduce SEEG measurements can be constructed from discrete monopolar sources (one per cortical layer). Significance: Our results highlight the importance of including a physical model in NMMs to represent measurements. We provide a framework connecting microscale neuron models with the neural mass formalism and with physical models of the measurement process that can improve the accuracy of predicted electrophysiological recordings.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Competition between endogenous and exogenous attention delays the selection of task-relevant working memory content.</a></h4>

              
                Working memory (WM) is a capacity- and duration-limited system that forms a temporal bridge between sensory phenomena and action. Capacity limits in WM necessitate the existence of external selection mechanisms that control access to this system (i.e., input gating), while changing behavioral demands necessitate the existence of internal selection mechanisms that prioritize existing WM representations for action (i.e., output gating). Whether similar mechanisms mediate WM input and output gating is unclear. We examined this possibility by exploiting a well-known distinction between top-down (endogenous) and bottom-up (exogenous) selection. Specifically, we examined how endogenous and exogenous factors compete to control the selection of WM content by examining their effects on EEG decoding performance. We found no evidence for a reflexive selection of task-irrelevant WM content when endogenous and exogenous factors conflicted. Instead, the selection of task-relevant WM content was delayed when these factors conflicted compared to when they were aligned. Thus, unlike external attention where the real-time balance of competition between endogenous and exogenous factors determines what information is selected, the selection of task-relevant WM content is delayed until competition between endogenous and exogenous factors is resolved.

Here we report the generation of a stable human RPE cell line with POLDIP2 knockout using CRISPR/Cas, providing an in vitro model to investigate the functions of POLDIP2. We conducted functional studies on the POLDIP2 knockout cell line and showed that they retained normal levels of cell proliferation, cell viability, phagocytosis and autophagy . Also, we performed RNA sequencing to profile the transcriptome of POLDIP2 knockout cells. Our results highlighted significant changes in genes involved in immune response, complement activation, oxidative damage and vascular development. We showed that loss of POLDIP2 causes a reduction in mitochondrial superoxide levels, which is consistent with the upregulation of the mitochondrial superoxide dismutase SOD2. In conclusion, this study demonstrates a novel link between POLDIP2 and SOD2, which supports a potential role of POLDIP2 in regulating oxidative stress in AMD pathology.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Making memories last: The peripheral effect of direct current stimulation on strengthening memories</a></h4>

              
                Most memories that are formed are forgotten, while others are retained longer and are subject to memory stabilization. We show that non-invasive transcutaneous electrical stimulation of the greater occipital nerve (NITESGON) using direct current during learning elicited a long-term memory effect. However, it did not trigger an immediate effect on learning. A neurobiological model of long-term memory proposes a mechanism by which memories that are initially unstable can be strengthened through subsequent novel experiences. In a series of studies, we demonstrate NITESGON's capability to boost the retention of memories when applied shortly before, during or shortly after the time of learning by enhancing memory consolidation via activation and communication in and between the locus coeruleus pathway and hippocampus by modulating dopaminergic input. These findings may have a significant impact for neurocognitive disorders that inhibit memory consolidation such as Alzheimer's disease.

                The process by which sensory evidence contributes to perceptual choices requires an understanding of its transformation into decision variables. Here, we address this issue by evaluating the neural representation of acoustic information in auditory cortex-recipient parietal cortex while gerbils either performed an auditory discrimination task or while they passively listened to identical acoustic stimuli. During task performance, decoding performance of simultaneously recorded parietal neurons reflected psychometric sensitivity. In contrast, decoding performance during passive listening was significantly reduced. Principal component and geometric analyses each revealed the emergence of decision-relevant, linearly separable manifolds, but only during task engagement. Finally, using a clustering analysis, we found subpopulations of neurons that may reflect the encoding of separate segments during task performance: stimulus integration and motor preparation or execution. Taken together, our findings demonstrate how parietal cortex neurons integrate and transform encoded auditory information to guide sound-driven perceptual decisions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Communication dynamics in the human connectome shape the cortex-wide propagation of direct electrical stimulation</a></h4>

              
                Communication between gray matter regions underpins all facets of brain function. To date, progress in understanding large-scale neural communication has been hampered by the inability of current neuroimaging techniques to track signaling at whole-brain, high-spatiotemporal resolution. Here, we use 2.77 million intracranial EEG recordings, acquired following 29,055 single-pulse electrical stimulations in a total of 550 individuals, to study inter-areal communication in the human brain. We found that network communication models---computed on structural connectivity inferred from diffusion MRI---can explain the propagation of direct, focal electrical stimulation through white matter, measured at millisecond time scales. Building on this finding, we show that a parsimonious statistical model comprising structural, functional and spatial factors can accurately and robustly predict cortex-wide effects of brain stimulation (out-of-sample R2=54%). Our work contributes towards the biological validation of concepts in network neuroscience and provides insight into how white matter connectivity shapes inter-areal signaling. We anticipate that our findings will have implications for research on macroscale neural information processing and the design of brain stimulation paradigms.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Peri-saccadic visual sensitivity is higher in the upper visual field</a></h4>

              
                Visual neural processing is distributed among a multitude of sensory and sensory-motor brain areas exhibiting varying degrees of functional specializations and spatial representational anisotropies. Such diversity raises the question of how perceptual performance is determined, at any one moment in time, during natural active visual behavior. Here, exploiting a known dichotomy between the primary visual cortex and superior colliculus in representing either the upper or lower visual field, we asked whether peri-saccadic visual sensitivity is dominated by one or the other spatial anisotropy. Humans detected peri-saccadic upper visual field stimuli significantly better than lower visual field stimuli, contrary to known perceptual superiority in the lower visual field during steady-state gaze fixation. Consistent with this, peri-saccadic superior colliculus visual responses were also significantly stronger in the upper visual field than in the lower visual field. Thus, peri-saccadic visual sensitivity reflects oculomotor, rather than visual, map spatial anisotropies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Effects of Face Repetition on Ventral Visual Stream Connectivity using Dynamic Causal Modelling of fMRI data</a></h4>

              
                Stimulus repetition normally causes reduced neural activity in brain regions that process that stimulus. Some theories claim that this "repetition suppression" reflects local mechanisms such as neuronal fatigue or sharpening within a region, whereas other theories claim that it results from changed connectivity between regions, following changes in synchrony or top-down predictions. In this study, we applied dynamic causal modelling (DCM) on a public fMRI dataset involving repeated presentations of faces and scrambled faces to test whether repetition affected local (self-connections) and/or between-region connectivity in left and right early visual cortex (EVC), occipital face area (OFA) and fusiform face area (FFA). Face "perception" (faces versus scrambled faces) modulated nearly all connections, within and between regions, including direct connections from EVC to FFA, supporting a non-hierarchical view of face processing. Face "recognition" (familiar versus unfamiliar faces) modulated connections between EVC and OFA/FFA, particularly in the left hemisphere. Most importantly, immediate and delayed repetition of stimuli were also best captured by modulations of connections between EVC and OFA/FFA, but not self-connections of OFA/FFA, consistent with synchronization or predictive coding theories.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">High-order thalamic and motor cortex inputs integrate sublinearly into tuft dendrites of pyramidal neurons in mouse somatosensory cortex</a></h4>

              
                Tuft dendrites of pyramidal neurons housed in layer 1 of the neocortex form extensive excitatory synaptic connections with long-range cortical and high-order thalamic axons, along with diverse inhibitory inputs. Recently, we reported that synapses from the vibrissal primary motor cortex (vM1) and posterior medial thalamic nucleus (POm) are spatially clustered together in the same set of distal dendrites, suggesting a close functional interaction. In this study, we evaluated how these two types of synapses interact with each other using in vivo two-photon Ca2+ imaging and electrophysiology. We observed that dendritic Ca2+ responses could be efficiently evoked by electrical stimulation of POm or vM1 in the overlapping set of dendritic branches, rejecting the idea of branch-wise origin-selective synaptic wiring. Surprisingly, the Ca2+ responses upon coincident POm and vM1 stimulation summed sublinearly. We attribute this sublinearity to mutual inhibition via inhibitory neurons because synaptic currents generated by POm and vM1 also integrated sublinearly, but pharmacologically isolated direct synaptic currents summed linearly. Inhibitory neurons receiving POm inputs in the superficial cortical layer negatively regulated vM1-evoked responses. Finally, POm and vM1 innervated overlapping but distinct populations of somatostatin-expressing inhibitory neurons. Thus, POm and vM1 inputs negatively modulate each other in the mouse somatosensory cortex.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Uncertainty alters the balance between incremental learning and episodic memory</a></h4>

              
                A key question in decision making is how humans arbitrate between competing learning and memory systems to maximize reward. We address this question by probing the balance between the effects, on choice, of incremental trial-and-error learning versus episodic memories of individual events. Although a rich literature has studied incremental learning in isolation, the role of episodic memory in decision making has only recently drawn focus, and little research disentangles their separate contributions. We hypothesized that the brain arbitrates rationally between these two systems, relying on each in circumstances to which it is most suited, as indicated by uncertainty. We tested this hypothesis by directly contrasting contributions of episodic and incremental influence to decisions, while manipulating the relative uncertainty of incremental learning using a well-established manipulation of reward volatility. Across two large, independent samples of young adults, participants traded these influences off rationally, depending more on episodic information when incremental summaries were more uncertain. These results support the proposal that the brain optimizes the balance between different forms of learning and memory according to their relative uncertainties and elucidate the circumstances under which episodic memory informs decisions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">On the automaticity of visual statistical learning</a></h4>

              
                Humans can extract regularities from their environment, enabling them to recognize and predict sequences of events. The process of regularity extraction is called "statistical learning" and is generally thought to occur rapidly and automatically; that is, regularities are extracted from repeated stimulus presentations, without intent or awareness, as long as the stimuli are attended. We hypothesized that visual statistical learning is not entirely automatic, even when stimuli are attended, and that the learning depends on the extent to which viewers process the relationships between stimuli. To test this, we measured statistical learning performance across seven conditions in which participants (N=774) viewed image sequences. As task instructions across conditions increasingly required participants to attend to relationships between stimuli, their learning performance increased from chance to robust levels. We conclude that the learning observed in visual statistical learning paradigms is, for the most part, not automatic and requires more than passively attending to stimuli.

                How are we able to learn new behaviors without disrupting previously learned ones? To understand how the brain achieves this, we used a brain-computer interface (BCI) learning paradigm, which enables us to detect the presence of a memory of one behavior while performing another. We found that learning to use a new BCI map altered the neural activity that monkeys produced when they returned to using a familiar BCI map, in a way that was specific to the learning experience. That is, learning left a "memory trace." This memory trace co-existed with proficient performance under the familiar map, primarily by altering dimensions of neural activity that did not impact behavior. Such a memory trace could provide the neural underpinning for the joint learning of multiple motor behaviors without interference.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A novel closed-loop control algorithm to disrupt pathological neuronal oscillations - implementation and validation in vitro</a></h4>

              
                Adaptive feedback control of neuronal activity is a powerful technique for both revealing and repairing neuronal function, but our knowledge on its effective implementation is still very limited. Presently, electrical brain stimulation, a well-stablished therapeutic to address neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease and epilepsy, typically relies on open-loop protocols. However, electrical stimulation should adapt to the neuronal activity and control the pathological dynamics with minimal perturbations. Here we tested for the first time in neuronal populations (in vitro), a popular control technique used in multiple computational studies to disrupt pathological neuronal oscillations - Delayed Feedback Control (DFC). We show that DFC may worsen the oscillatory behaviour, promoting faster bursting. Alternatively, we developed and validated an alternative method, adaptive DFC (aDFC), which monitors the ongoing periodicity and self-tunes accordingly. aDFC disrupts the collective neuronal oscillation and leads to a decrease in network synchrony, making it a better candidate for therapeutic neurostimulation.

	<p>Nicotine and tobacco product (NTP) use has escalated, largely due to the advent of e-cigarettes. The NTP administration method (i.e., combustible cigarette, e-cigarette) may be an important differentiator. We assessed young adult substance use history, nicotine attitudes, mental health, and neurocognition by the NTP use method. Emerging adults (16&amp;amp;ndash;22 year olds) were divided into combustible NTP users (Combustible+ = 79, had used any combustible NTP in the last 6 months), non-combustible users (E-Cig = 43, had used non-combustible NTP, in the past 6 months), and NTP Na&amp;amp;iuml;ve (n = 79; had not used NTP in the past 6 months) based on past 6-month NTP use patterns. Participants completed self-report and objective neurocognition measures. Analysis of covariance assessed mental health and neurocognition by group, controlling for confounds and correcting for multiple comparisons. Nicotine groups reported more favorable attitudes toward combustible cigarette and e-cigarette use, with taste as the primary reason for e-cigarette use. Combustible+ reported more nicotine dependence and craving. Substance use differed by group, with Combustible+ using the most NTP, alcohol, and cannabis. Nicotine groups reported higher depression and stress symptoms; male Combustible+ reported higher depression symptoms than other same-gender groups. Groups did not differ on neurocognition, though cannabis use was associated with inaccurate emotional Stroop responses. Overall, research suggests that young adult combustible users are likely qualitatively different from non-combustible users. Understanding the unique characteristics related to NTP product use will help guide intervention and prevention development.</p>

	<p>The blood&amp;amp;ndash;brain barrier (BBB) mediates cellular and molecular passage between the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral circulation. Compromised BBB integrity has been linked to neurocognitive deficits in multiple diseases and various infections, including those associated with HIV-1 infection. Understanding the impact of exposure to pharmaceuticals, such as those utilized for pain management by patients suffering from CNS disease, on BBB regulation and function is clinically important. In this study, we modelled two different BBB systems; a primary human co-culture and a cell line monoculture. These systems were both exposed to three daily repeat doses of morphine and examined for alterations to BBB integrity via permeability, PBMC transmigration, and chemokine gradient changes. We did not find any significant changes to either BBB system with repeat morphine dosing, suggesting that repeat morphine exposure may not play a significant role in BBB changes.</p>

	<p>Brain tissue oxygenation (PbtO2)-guided therapy can improve the neurological outcome of traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients. With several Phase-III ongoing studies, most of the existing evidence is based on before-after cohort studies and a phase-II randomized trial. The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of PbtO2-guided therapy in a single-center cohort. We performed a retrospective analysis of consecutive severe TBI patients admitted to our center who received either intracranial pressure (ICP) guided therapy (from January 2012 to February 2016) or ICP/PbtO2-guided therapy (February 2017 to December 2019). A genetic matching was performed based on covariates including demographics, comorbidities, and severity scores on admission. Intracranial hypertension (IH) was defined as ICP &amp;amp;gt; 20 mmHg for at least 5 min. Brain hypoxia (BH) was defined as PbtO2 &amp;amp;lt; 20 mmHg for at least 10 min. IH and BH were targeted by specific interventions. Mann&amp;amp;ndash;Whitney U and Fisher&amp;amp;rsquo;s exact tests were used to assess differences between groups. A total of 35 patients were matched in both groups: significant differences in the occurrence of IH (ICP 85.7% vs. ICP/PbtO2 45.7%, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01), ICU length of stay [6 (3&amp;amp;ndash;13) vs. 16 (9&amp;amp;ndash;25) days, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01] and Glasgow Coma Scale at ICU discharge [10 (5&amp;amp;ndash;14) vs. 13 (11&amp;amp;ndash;15), p = 0.036] were found. No significant differences in ICU mortality and Glasgow Outcome Scales at 3 months were observed. This study suggests that the role of ICP/PbtO2-guided therapy should await further confirmation in well-conducted large phase III studies.</p>

	<p>(1) Background: The emergence of white matter lesions in the central nervous system (CNS) can lead to diagnostic dilemmas. They are a common radiological symptom and their patterns may overlap CNS or systemic diseases and provoke underdiagnosis or misdiagnosis. The aim of the study was to assess factors influencing the underdiagnosis of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) as well as to estimate NMOSD epidemiology in Lubelskie voivodeship, Poland. (2) Methods: This retrospective study included 1112 patients, who were made a tentative or an established diagnosis of acute or subacute onset of neurological deficits. The evaluation was based on medical history, neurological examination, laboratory and radiographic results and fulfilment of diagnosis criteria. (3) Results: Up to 1.62 percent of patients diagnosed with white matter lesions and up to 2.2% of the patients previously diagnosed with MS may suffer from NMOSD. The duration of delayed diagnosis is longer for males, despite the earlier age of onset. Seropositive cases for antibodies against aquaporin-4 have worse prognosis for degree of disability. (4) Conclusions: Underdiagnosis or misdiagnosis in NMOSD still remains a problem in clinical practice and has important implications for patients. The incorrect diagnosis is caused by atypical presentation or NMOSD-mimics; however, covariates such as gender, onset and diagnosis age may also have an influence.</p>

	<p>(1) Background: The combined n-back + Go/NoGo paradigm was used to investigate whether audiovisual interactions interfere with or facilitate WM. (2) Methods: College students were randomly assigned to perform the working memory task based on either a single (visual or auditory) or dual (audiovisual) stimulus. Reaction times, accuracy, and WM performance were compared across the two groups to investigate effects of audiovisual interactions. (3) Results: With low cognitive load (2-back), auditory stimuli had no effect on visual working memory, whereas visual stimuli had a small effect on auditory working memory. With high cognitive load (3-back), auditory stimuli interfered (large effect size) with visual WM, and visual stimuli interfered (medium effect size) with auditory WM. (4) Conclusions: Audiovisual effects on WM follow the resource competition theory, and the cognitive load of a visual stimulus is dominated by competition; vision always interferes with audition, and audition conditionally interferes with vision. With increased visual cognitive load, competitive effects of audiovisual interactions were more obvious than those with auditory stimuli. Compared with visual stimuli, audiovisual stimuli showed significant interference only when visual cognitive load was high. With low visual cognitive load, the two stimulus components neither facilitated nor interfered with the other in accordance with a speed&amp;amp;ndash;accuracy trade-off.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Stimulus presentation can enhance spiking irregularity across subcortical and cortical regions</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Saleh Fayaz, Mohammad Amin Fakharian, Ali Ghazizadeh</p>

Stimulus presentation is believed to quench neural response variability as measured by fano-factor (FF). However, the relative contributions of within-trial spike irregularity and trial-to-trial rate variability to FF fluctuations have remained elusive. Here, we introduce a principled approach for accurate estimation of spiking irregularity and rate variability in time for doubly stochastic point processes. Consistent with previous evidence, analysis showed stimulus-induced reduction in rate variability across multiple cortical and subcortical areas. However, unlike what was previously thought, spiking irregularity, was not constant in time but could be enhanced due to factors such as bursting abating the quench in the post-stimulus FF. Simulations confirmed plausibility of a time varying spiking irregularity arising from within and between pool correlations of excitatory and inhibitory neural inputs. By accurate parsing of neural variability, our approach reveals previously unnoticed changes in neural response variability and constrains candidate mechanisms that give rise to observed rate variability and spiking irregularity within brain regions.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">nAdder: A scale-space approach for the 3D analysis of neuronal traces</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Minh Son Phan, Katherine Matho, Emmanuel Beaurepaire, Jean Livet, Anatole Chessel</p>

Tridimensional microscopy and algorithms for automated segmentation and tracing are revolutionizing neuroscience through the generation of growing libraries of neuron reconstructions. Innovative computational methods are needed to analyze these neuronal traces. In particular, means to characterize the geometric properties of traced neurites along their trajectory have been lacking. Here, we propose a local tridimensional (3D) scale metric derived from differential geometry, measuring for each point of a curve the characteristic length where it is fully 3D as opposed to being embedded in a 2D plane or 1D line. The larger this metric is and the more complex the local 3D loops and turns of the curve are. Available through the GeNePy3D open-source Python quantitative geometry library (https://genepy3d.gitlab.io), this approach termed nAdder offers new means of describing and comparing axonal and dendritic arbors. We validate this metric on simulated and real traces. By reanalysing a published zebrafish larva whole brain dataset, we show its ability to characterize different population of commissural axons, distinguish afferent connections to a target region and differentiate portions of axons and dendrites according to their behavior, shedding new light on the stereotypical nature of neurites’ local geometry.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">ATRPred: A machine learning based tool for clinical decision making of anti-TNF treatment in rheumatoid arthritis patients</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Bodhayan Prasad, Cathy McGeough, Amanda Eakin, Tan Ahmed, Dawn Small, Philip Gardiner, Adrian Pendleton, Gary Wright, Anthony J. Bjourson, David S. Gibson, Priyank Shukla</p>

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune condition, characterised by joint pain, damage and disability, which can be addressed in a high proportion of patients by timely use of targeted biologic treatments. However, the patients, non-responsive to the treatments often suffer from refractoriness of the disease, leading to poor quality of life. Additionally, the biologic treatments are expensive. We obtained plasma samples from N = 144 participants with RA, who were about to commence anti-tumour necrosis factor (anti-TNF) therapy. These samples were sent to Olink Proteomics, Uppsala, Sweden, where proximity extension assays of 4 panels, containing 92 proteins each, were performed. A total of n = 89 samples of patients passed the quality control. The preliminary analysis of plasma protein expression values suggested that the RA population could be divided into two distinct molecular sub-groups (endotypes). However, these broad groups did not predict response to anti-TNF treatment, but were significantly different in terms of gender and their disease activity. We then labelled these patients as responders (n = 60) and non-responders (n = 29) based on the change in disease activity score (DAS) after 6 months of anti-TNF treatment and applied machine learning (ML) with a rigorous 5-fold nested cross-validation scheme to filter 17 proteins that were significantly associated with the treatment response. We have developed a ML based classifier ATRPred (anti-TNF treatment response predictor), which can predict anti-TNF treatment response in RA patients with 81% accuracy, 75% sensitivity and 86% specificity. ATRPred may aid clinicians to direct anti-TNF therapy to patients most likely to receive benefit, thus save cost as well as prevent non-responsive patients from refractory consequences. ATRPred is implemented in R.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Critically ill COVID-19 patients with neutralizing autoantibodies against type I interferons have increased risk of herpesvirus disease</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Idoia Busnadiego, Irene A. Abela, Pascal M. Frey, Daniel A. Hofmaenner, Thomas C. Scheier, Reto A. Schuepbach, Philipp K. Buehler, Silvio D. Brugger, Benjamin G. Hale</p>

Autoantibodies neutralizing the antiviral action of type I interferons (IFNs) have been associated with predisposition to severe Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Here, we screened for such autoantibodies in 103 critically ill COVID-19 patients in a tertiary intensive care unit (ICU) in Switzerland. Eleven patients (10.7%), but no healthy donors, had neutralizing anti-IFNα or anti-IFNα/anti-IFNω IgG in plasma/serum, but anti-IFN IgM or IgA was rare. One patient had nonneutralizing anti-IFNα IgG. Strikingly, all patients with plasma anti-IFNα IgG also had anti-IFNα IgG in tracheobronchial secretions, identifying these autoantibodies at anatomical sites relevant for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Longitudinal analyses revealed patient heterogeneity in terms of increasing, decreasing, or stable anti-IFN IgG levels throughout the length of hospitalization. Notably, presence of anti-IFN autoantibodies in this critically ill COVID-19 cohort appeared to predict herpesvirus disease (caused by herpes simplex viruses types 1 and 2 (HSV-1/-2) and/or cytomegalovirus (CMV)), which has been linked to worse clinical outcomes. Indeed, all 7 tested COVID-19 patients with anti-IFN IgG in our cohort (100%) suffered from one or more herpesviruses, and analysis revealed that these patients were more likely to experience CMV than COVID-19 patients without anti-IFN autoantibodies, even when adjusting for age, gender, and systemic steroid treatment (odds ratio (OR) 7.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.14 to 46.31, <i>p</i> = 0.036). As the IFN system deficiency caused by neutralizing anti-IFN autoantibodies likely directly and indirectly exacerbates the likelihood of latent herpesvirus reactivations in critically ill patients, early diagnosis of anti-IFN IgG could be rapidly used to inform risk-group stratification and treatment options.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Selfish centromeres and the wastefulness of human reproduction</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Laurence D. Hurst</p>

Many human embryos die in utero owing to an excess or deficit of chromosomes, a phenomenon known as aneuploidy; this is largely a consequence of nondisjunction during maternal meiosis I. Asymmetries of this division render it vulnerable to selfish centromeres that promote their own transmission, these being thought to somehow underpin aneuploidy. In this essay, I suggest that these vulnerabilities provide only half the solution to the enigma. In mammals, as in utero and postnatal provisioning is continuous, the costs of early death are mitigated. With such reproductive compensation, selection can favour a centromere <i>because</i> it induces lethal aneuploidy: if, when taken towards the polar body, it instead kills the embryo via aneuploidy, it gains. The model is consistent with the observation that reduced dosage of a murine drive suppressor induces aneuploidy and with the fact that high aneuploidy rates in vertebrates are seen exclusively in mammals. I propose further tests of this idea. The wastefulness of human reproduction may be a price we pay for nurturing our offspring.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Neuron-specific ablation of the Krabbe disease gene galactosylceramidase in mice results in neurodegeneration</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Conlan Kreher, Jacob Favret, Nadav I. Weinstock, Malabika Maulik, Xinying Hong, Michael H. Gelb, Lawrence Wrabetz, M. Laura Feltri, Daesung Shin</p>

Krabbe disease is caused by a deficiency of the lysosomal galactosylceramidase (GALC) enzyme, which results in the accumulation of galactosylceramide (GalCer) and psychosine. In Krabbe disease, the brunt of demyelination and neurodegeneration is believed to result from the dysfunction of myelinating glia. Recent studies have shown that neuronal axons are both structurally and functionally compromised in Krabbe disease, even before demyelination, suggesting a possible neuron-autonomous role of GALC. Using a novel neuron-specific <i>Galc</i> knockout (CKO) model, we show that neuronal <i>Galc</i> deletion is sufficient to cause growth and motor coordination defects and inflammatory gliosis in mice. Furthermore, psychosine accumulates significantly in the nervous system of neuron-specific <i>Galc</i>-CKO. Confocal and electron microscopic analyses show profound neuro-axonal degeneration with a mild effect on myelin structure. Thus, we prove for the first time that neuronal GALC is essential to maintain and protect neuronal function independently of myelin and may directly contribute to the pathogenesis of Krabbe disease.

                Background: Overall child health depends on nutrition and its related practices. At the family level, responsibility of child feeding lies with both parents. There is no uniform and systematic way to determine and assess the practices of fathers in infant and young child feeding (IYCF). Also, there is a paucity of evidence related to interventions for fathers in improving their practices and involvement in the feeding of their infant or young child (aged less than two years). Methods: This was a community-based randomized control trial, conducted among 120 fathers with infants and/or young children in Dakshina Kannada District of Karnataka. Fathers with poor level of involvement and practices towards IYCF, during the initial assessment, were included as the study participants. For the intervention, a module in the flipchart format was developed. Simple randomization technique was used to allot the participants into two groups - intervention and control. Participants in the intervention group received module intervention, in addition to the care which they received routinely, and the control group received only routine care. The participants in the intervention group were paid a monthly visit to implement the module, for six months. The post-intervention assessment was done at the end of 6 months. Results: A total of 117 participants provided post-intervention data. The mean age was 34.7 (+/- 5.48) years in the intervention group and 34.36 years (+/- 5.26) in the control group. The intervention group showed significantly higher improvement in knowledge, attitude, and practice components at 6 months (p<0.05), in both unadjusted and adjusted models. Conclusions: The extent of increase in practice and involvement in child feeding was clearly higher among the intervention group. The module developed was successful in improving the practices of fathers in feeding their infants and young children.

                Background: Depression, stress, and anxiety were found in a large number of medical undergraduate students, indicating a neglected aspect of their psychology that required immediate attention. The goal of this study was to find out the prevalence of depression among medical students, as well as potential psychosocial and behavioral predictors for depression.  Methods:   This cross-sectional study was conducted from July to November 2021 among 840 randomly selected medical students from four medical colleges using stratified random sampling. Data were collected using a semi-structured, self-administered questionnaire and were analyzed through the SPSS v.23 software. Multiple regression was performed to assess the effect of several behavioral and psychosocial factors on depression.   Results: Among the 840 study participants, 55.7% (n= 468) were female and 44.3% (n= 372) were male. According to the data, the prevalence of depression, anxiety, perceived stress among medical students was found to be 28.8%, 65% and 85% respectively. A strong link was found between depression and anxiety, stress, poor sleep quality, poor academic performance, and a negative social and romantic relationship status.   Conclusions: A significant number of medical students are depressed. In order to prevent and treat depression, medical students should be screened for depression and its associated factors.

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a parasomnia characterized by polysomnography-confirmed REM sleep without atonia and dream-enacting behaviors. This disorder is considered a prodromal syndrome of alpha-synucleinopathies like Parkinson's disease (PD), where it affects more than 50% of PD patients. The underlying pathology of RBD has been generally understood to involve the pontine nuclei within the brainstem. However, the complete pathophysiology beyond the brainstem remains unclear as does its relationship with PD pathology. Therefore, this review aims to survey the neuroimaging literature involving PET, SPECT, and MR imaging techniques to provide an updated understanding of the neuro-chemical, structural, and functional changes in both RBD and PD patients comorbid with RBD. This review found neuroimaging evidence that indicate alterations to the dopaminergic and cholinergic system, blood perfusion, and glucose metabolism in both RBD patients and PD patients with RBD. Beyond the brainstem, structural and functional changes were found to involve the nigrostriatal system, limbic system, and the cortex—suggesting that RBD is a multi-systemic neurodegenerative process. Future investigations are encouraged to follow RBD patients longitudinally using multimodal imaging techniques to enhance our understanding of this parasomnia disorder. Uncovering which individuals are most likely to develop an alpha-synuclein disorder in the prodromal phase will improve patient outcomes and potentially aid in the development of novel treatments for patients affected by RBD.</p>

Pelgrom et al. demonstrate that DC-specific mTORC1 deficiency potentiates immunization-induced CD8+ T cell responses. This is linked to alterations in DC metabolism and increased immunogenicity of an EpCAM+ cDC1 subpopulation. Thus, targeting mTORC1 may help to boost vaccination responses.
