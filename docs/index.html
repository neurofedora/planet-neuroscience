<p>Anti-LINGO-1 antibody could improve the behavioral performance of APP/PS1 mice in Morris water maze and Y-maze. The positive effects of anti-LINGO-1 antibody on the cognition of APP/PS1 mice might be related to the anti-LINGO-1 antibody-induced promotion of the differentiation, maturation, and myelination of oligodendrocytes in the hippocampus. The results indicated that LINGO-1 might be a promising target in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Leucine-rich repeat and immunoglobulin-like domain-containing nogo receptor-interacting protein 1 (LINGO-1), a negative regulator of oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination, is associated with cognitive function, and its expression is highly upregulated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Anti-LINGO-1 antibody treatment can effectively antagonize the negative regulatory effect of LINGO-1. In this study, we aim to assess the effect of anti-LINGO-1 antibody treatment on cognition and hippocampal oligodendrocytes in an AD transgenic animal model. First, 10-month-old male amyloid-β (Aβ) protein precursor (APP)/presenilin 1 (PS1) mice were administered anti-LINGO-1 antibody for 8 weeks. Then, learning and memory abilities were assessed with the Morris water maze (MWM) and Y-maze tests, and Aβ deposition and hippocampal oligodendrocytes were investigated by immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and stereology. We found that anti-LINGO-1 antibody alleviated the deficits in spatial learning and memory abilities and working and reference memory abilities, decreased the density of LINGO-1 positive cells, decreased Aβ deposition, significantly increased the number of mature oligodendrocytes and the density of myelin, reversed the abnormal increases in the number of oligodendrocyte lineage cells and the densities of oligodendrocytes precursor cells in APP/PS1 mice. Our results provide evidence that LINGO-1 might be involved in the process of oligodendrocyte dysmaturity in the hippocampus of AD mice, and that antagonizing LINGO-1 can alleviate cognitive deficits in APP/PS1 mice and decrease Aβ deposition and promote oligodendrocyte differentiation and maturation in the hippocampus of these mice. Our findings suggest that changes in LINGO-1 and oligodendrocytes in the hippocampus play important roles in the pathogenesis of AD and that antagonizing LINGO-1 might be a potential therapeutic strategy for AD.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Timing of Splenectomy after Acute Spinal Cord Injury</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating condition. Splenectomy may play a protective role in the development of SCI. However, little is known about whether the timing of splenectomy affects the outcome after SCI. Investigation into splenectomy after SCI would provide insight into how the timing can be selected following SCI to improve neurologic outcomes. Rats were randomized into a sham group, a nonsplenectomized group (NonSPX), four splenectomized groups with the surgery performed immediately, 6 h, 12 h, and 24 h after SCI (SPX0, SPX6, SPX12, and SPX24, respectively). Rats were subjected to severe contusive SCI at the level of the third thoracic vertebra. At different time points following SCI, Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) score was used to assess the recovery of injury. The animals in each group were randomly selected for tissue collection at days 3, 14, and 28 after surgery. Then, immunohistochemistry of immunologic cells was performed and inflammatory mediators were determined. Our study showed that splenectomy within 6 h after SCI improved BBB scores as compared with splenectomy more than 12 h after SCI, and decrease the immune cell responses to SCI. Protein levels of interleukin (IL)-1&beta; and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&alpha; were significantly elevated in nonsplenectomized group compared with sham group. No difference was observed in IL-10 at the lesion site between splenectomized and nonsplenectomized groups at 3 d post-SCI. The study demonstrates that splenectomy within 6 h after SCI would lessen the development of SCI and improve outcome.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Does the impact of medical publications vary by disease indication and publication type? An exploration using a novel, value-based, publication metric framework: the EMPIRE Index [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The EMPIRE (EMpirical Publication Impact and Reach Evaluation) Index is a value-based, multi-component metric framework to assess the impact of medical publications in terms of relevance to different stakeholders. It comprises three component scores (social, scholarly and societal impact), each incorporating related altmetrics that indicate a different aspect of engagement with the publication. Here, we present an exploratory investigation of whether publication types or disease indications influence EMPIRE Index scores. Methods: Article-level metrics were extracted and EMPIRE Index scores were calculated for 5825 journal articles published from 1 May 2017 to 1 May 2018, representing 12 disease indications (chosen to reflect a wide variety of common and rare diseases with a variety of aetiologies) and five publication types. Results: There were significant differences in scores between article types and disease indications. Median (95% CI) social and scholarly impact scores ranged from 1.2 (0.3–1.6) to 4.8 (3.1–6.6), respectively, for phase 3 clinical trials, and from 0.3 (0.3–0.4) to 2.3 (1.9–2.6), respectively, for observational studies. Social and scholarly impact scores were highest for multiple sclerosis publications and lowest for non-small cell lung cancer publications. Systematic reviews achieved greater impact than regular reviews. Median trends in the social impact of different disease areas matched the level of public interest as assessed through Google search interest. Although most articles did not register societal impact, mean societal impact scores were highest for migraine publications. Conclusions: The EMPIRE Index successfully identified differences in impact by disease area and publication type, which supports the notion that the impact of each publication needs to be evaluated in the context of these factors, and potentially others. These findings should be considered when using the EMPIRE Index to assess publication impact.

Project-based learning (PBL) is a dynamic student-centred teaching method that encourages students to solve real-life problems while fostering engagement and critical thinking. Here, we report on a PBL course on metabolic network modelling that has been running for several years within the Master in Integrated Systems Biology (MISB) at the University of Luxembourg. This 2-week full-time block course comprises an introduction into the core concepts and methods of constraint-based modelling (CBM), applied to toy models and large-scale networks alongside the preparation of individual student projects in week 1 and, in week 2, the presentation and execution of these projects. We describe in detail the schedule and content of the course, exemplary student projects, and reflect on outcomes and lessons learned. PBL requires the full engagement of students and teachers and gives a rewarding teaching experience. The presented course can serve as a role model and inspiration for other similar courses.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Colon stroma mediates an inflammation-driven fibroblastic response controlling matrix remodeling and healing</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Guadalupe J. Jasso, Alok Jaiswal, Mukund Varma, Tyler Laszewski, Angelo Grauel, Abdifatah Omar, Nilsa Silva, Glenn Dranoff, Jeffrey A. Porter, Keith Mansfield, Viviana Cremasco, Aviv Regev, Ramnik J. Xavier, Daniel B. Graham</p>

Chronic inflammation is often associated with the development of tissue fibrosis, but how mesenchymal cell responses dictate pathological fibrosis versus resolution and healing remains unclear. Defining stromal heterogeneity and identifying molecular circuits driving extracellular matrix deposition and remodeling stands to illuminate the relationship between inflammation, fibrosis, and healing. We performed single-cell RNA-sequencing of colon-derived stromal cells and identified distinct classes of fibroblasts with gene signatures that are differentially regulated by chronic inflammation, including IL-11–producing inflammatory fibroblasts. We further identify a transcriptional program associated with <i>trans</i>-differentiation of mucosa-associated fibroblasts and define a functional gene signature associated with matrix deposition and remodeling in the inflamed colon. Our analysis supports a critical role for the metalloprotease Adamdec1 at the interface between tissue remodeling and healing during colitis, demonstrating its requirement for colon epithelial integrity. These findings provide mechanistic insight into how inflammation perturbs stromal cell behaviors to drive fibroblastic responses controlling mucosal matrix remodeling and healing.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">The NKCC1 ion transporter modulates microglial phenotype and inflammatory response to brain injury in a cell-autonomous manner</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Krisztina Tóth, Nikolett Lénárt, Péter Berki, Rebeka Fekete, Eszter Szabadits, Balázs Pósfai, Csaba Cserép, Ahmad Alatshan, Szilvia Benkő, Dániel Kiss, Christian A. Hübner, Attila Gulyás, Kai Kaila, Zsuzsanna Környei, Ádám Dénes</p>

The NKCC1 ion transporter contributes to the pathophysiology of common neurological disorders, but its function in microglia, the main inflammatory cells of the brain, has remained unclear to date. Therefore, we generated a novel transgenic mouse line in which microglial NKCC1 was deleted. We show that microglial NKCC1 shapes both baseline and reactive microglia morphology, process recruitment to the site of injury, and adaptation to changes in cellular volume in a cell-autonomous manner via regulating membrane conductance. In addition, microglial NKCC1 deficiency results in NLRP3 inflammasome priming and increased production of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), rendering microglia prone to exaggerated inflammatory responses. In line with this, central (intracortical) administration of the NKCC1 blocker, bumetanide, potentiated intracortical lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced cytokine levels. In contrast, systemic bumetanide application decreased inflammation in the brain. Microglial NKCC1 KO animals exposed to experimental stroke showed significantly increased brain injury, inflammation, cerebral edema, and, worse, neurological outcome. Thus, NKCC1 emerges as an important player in controlling microglial ion homeostasis and inflammatory responses through which microglia modulate brain injury. The contribution of microglia to central NKCC1 actions is likely to be relevant for common neurological disorders.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Evaluation of the rapid, multi-country, parallel process, multi-tasking approach to startup of short-term technical assistance to improve service delivery in newborn and child health in the context of USAID’s Zika response in four Eastern and Southern Car</a></h4>

              
                Background: In 2018, the USAID Applying Science to Strengthen and Improve Systems (ASSIST) Project started a new partnership with four Eastern and Southern Caribbean countries impacted by the Zika virus: Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, St. Kitts and Nevis, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines.  The goal of the project was to provide short-term technical assistance (STTA) to strengthen the health systems’ capacity to detect newborns and young children potentially affected by Zika and to address their health needs.  To meet these objectives, ASSIST developed an innovative approach based on its existing model for service delivery improvement. This novel approach is known as Rapid, Multi-country, Parallel Process, Multi-tasking Approach for a Project Startup (RMPP-MAPS).  An evaluation was conducted to document the STTA startup activities, to identify enabling and constraining factors, and to capture lessons learned. Methods: An external consultant conducted remote in-depth interviews with individuals involved in the startup using semi-structured interview guides and retrieved data from the review of project documents. Results: Using RMPP-MAPS, the ASSIST Project successfully implemented the startup for complex STTA in four countries within less than four months, spanning mid-May to early September 2018. Project milestones included achieving buy-in from stakeholders, co-developing the technical scope and materials, and rapidly executing critical operational functions.  Dedicated project teams, country leaderships, and local champions were essential to overcoming the main challenges, which included a condensed timeframe, lack of in-country offices, and country-level factors such as a shortage of health care workers and a weak health infrastructure.  Conclusions: The RMPP-MAPS is a feasible and resource-efficient mechanism of interest to implementers, donors, and low and middle-income countries facing temporal and financial limitations to rapidly addressing public health priorities.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Prevalence of cancer as a comorbid in COVID-19 patients and their characteristics: a meta-analysis study [version 2; peer review: 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Cancer patients are considered susceptible to coronavirus disease (COVID-19) due to an immunosuppressive state. This study determined the prevalence of cancer as a comorbid in COVID-19 patients, severe events, case fatality rate, history of anticancer therapy associated with severe events, and type of cancer in cancer patients with COVID-19 in the world. Methods: This study used a meta-analysis study approach, sourcing studies from various countries related to cancer and COVID-19. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were established to select studies. A PRISMA flowchart was presented to assess the selection process. Data from inclusion studies were analyzed using Review Manager 5.4. Results: The prevalence of cancer as a comorbid in COVID-19 patients was 4.63% (95% CI, 3.78-5.49%) worldwide. The lowest prevalence was the Asian study group with 2.36% (95% CI, 1.86-2.87%) and the highest prevalence was the European study group with 10.93% (95% CI, 6.62-15.24%). About 43.26% (95% CI, 34.71-51.80%) of COVID-19 patients with cancer as comorbid experienced severe events of COVID-19. In total, 58.13% (95% CI, 42.79-73.48%) of COVID-19 patients with cancer as a comorbid who in the last month had a history of anticancer therapy experienced severe events. The prevalence of lung cancer in cancer patients with COVID-19 was 20.23% (95% CI, 7.67-32.78%). Forest plots are also presented related to the results of meta-analysis research. Conclusions: High prevalence of cancer as a comorbid among COVID-19 patients indicates the susceptibility of cancer patients to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Cancer as a comorbid in COVID-19 patients and use of anticancer therapy increase severe events of COVID-19.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">DNA barcoding for the discrimination of Uncaria gambir and its closely related species using internal transcribed spacer genes [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Uncaria gambir is one Uncaria species that exclusively grows in Indonesia. The phytochemical constituents of this species have been widely explored and its extracts are used as traditional medicine. However, the relationship between Uncaria gambir and other Uncaria species is still unknown. DNA barcoding was used in this study to reveal this relationship. Methods: Genomic DNA was isolated from four main cultivated variants of Uncaria gambir species in Indonesia. ITS primer was used to amplify the specific gene region. Genetic distance analysis was carried out on Uncaria gambir and 12 other Uncaria species. A phylogenetic tree was created to determine the relationship among Uncaria species using the maximum likelihood method. Results: The ITS primer successfully amplified the ITS region in Uncaria gambir. Genetic distance and phylogenetic tree analyses showed that Uncaria gambir has a close relationship with Uncaria scandens, Uncaria yunnanensis, and Uncaria macrophylla which is also indicated by Interspecific distance analysis. Conclusions: Although the DNA barcoding gap is absent in genetic distance analysis, the phylogenetic tree analysis from the ITS region can differentiate Uncaria gambir from other Uncaria species.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Accuracy of radiographic and protrusive occlusal record methods in determining condylar guidance angles: a systematic review and meta-analysis [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The objective of this systematic review was to compare the accuracy of radiographic and protrusive occlusal record (POR) methods in determining horizontal condylar guidance (HCG) angles in dentate and edentulous patients. Methods: Studies assessing condylar guiding angles in dentulous/partially edentulous and totally edentulous patients free of temporomandibular disorders using both radiographic and protrusive occlusal record methods were included. A comprehensive search with PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science, Google Scholar and Open Grey databases was done. Two reviewers extracted the data after eligibility assessment. Study quality was examined using the NIH quality assessment tool and graded based on tooth selection, number of root canals assessed, study environment, number of observers, test reliability report, validation approach, validation criteria, and validity reliability. A meta-analysis of pooled data, subgroups and sensitivity analysis was performed using RevMan (P<0.05). Results: The qualitative synthesis contained 33 papers, 32 of which were included in the meta-analysis. The standardised mean difference between the radiographic and protrusive occlusal record methods for right and left HCG angle in dentate patients was 0.68 [0.37, 0.98] and 0.63 [0.32, 0.95], respectively, and for right and left HCG angle in edentulous patients was 0.80 [0.36, 1.24] and 0.66 [0.18, 1.15], indicating a statistically significant difference (p<0.05). Conclusions: Clinical variability among the selected studies could not be completely avoided and the sample sizes were limited, resulting in a lack of statistical power. To rule out potential causes of heterogeneity, subgroup and sensitivity analyses were done separately for dentate and edentulous individuals for the right and left HCG angle. The present systematic review and meta-analysis concluded that for the dentate and edentulous patients, the right and left HCG angle values determined by radiographic method showed statistically significant difference as compared to the protrusive occlusal records.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A population of in silico models identifies the interplay between Nav 1.8 conductance and potassium currents as key in regulating human dorsal root ganglion neuron excitability [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The Nav 1.8 sodium channel has a key role in generating repetitive action potentials in nociceptive human dorsal root ganglion neurons. Nav 1.8 is differentiated from other voltage-gated sodium channels by its unusually slow inactivation kinetics and depolarised voltage-dependence of activation. These features are particularly pronounced in the human Nav 1.8 channel and allow the channel to remain active during repolarisation. Gain-of-function mutations in Nav 1.8 have been linked to neuropathic pain and selective blockers of Nav 1.8 have been developed as potential new analgesics. However, it is not well understood how modulating the Nav 1.8 conductance alters neuronal excitability and how this depends on the balance of other ion channels expressed by nociceptive neurons. Methods: To investigate this, we developed a novel computational model of the human dorsal root ganglion neuron and used it to construct a population of models that mimicked inter-neuronal heterogeneity in ionic conductances and action potential morphology Results: By simulating changes to the Nav 1.8 conductance in the population of models, we found that moderately increasing the Nav 1.8 conductance led to increased firing rate, as expected, but increasing Nav 1.8 conductance beyond an inflection point caused firing rate to decrease. We found that the delayed rectifier and M-type potassium conductances were also critical for determining neuronal excitability. In particular, altering the delayed rectifier potassium conductance shifted the position of the Nav 1.8 inflection point and therefore the relationship between Nav 1.8 conductance and firing rate. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the effects of modulating Nav 1.8 in a nociceptive neuron can depend significantly on other conductances, particularly potassium conductances.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Large bone defect reconstruction in lower extremities with ipsilateral transposition fibular graft with combined inlay and onlay technique using plate and screw fixation (fibula pro tibia technique) [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer revi</a></h4>

              
                Introduction: Management of large bone defect is a challenging problem. Hahns, in 1884, introduced the first use of fibula pro tibia to bridge a large defect of the tibia due to chronic osteomyelitis. In this case, we did a transposition of the ipsilateral fibular with inlay and onlay technique using a locking plate and screw into the defect of the tibia. Case presentation: A 20-year-old male came to our emergency department at RSUD Dr. Saiful Anwar, Malang, Indonesia with an open fracture grade III B of his left lower leg. We found a large defect of the tibia approximately 7.5 cm after regular wound care for ten months. Then, we performed ipsilateral transposition fibular graft with combined inlay and onlay technique using a locking plate and screw fixation. No infections occurred and there was progressive callus formation with extending ossification along the periosteal tissue in the four-month postoperative evaluation. There was no leg length discrepancy, and the union sign showed that the patient could achieve full range of movement (ROM) and walk with crutches without pain with a Lower Extremity Functional Scale (LEFS) score of 62. Discussion: Contralateral fibula graft carries a high risk of endangering the unaffected limb. The ipsilateral fibula can be utilized to replace the missing segment with minimal morbidity. The purpose of combining ipsilateral fibular transport with the inlay and onlay technique is to minimalize the gap defect between fracture fragments, therefore enhancing the union rate of the bone. Conclusion: The fibula pro tibia technique can be used as an alternative treatment option for large gap bone defects in lower extremities with minimal complication.

Furthermore, complementary to ACE2, both sialic acid (SA) molecules and CD147 proved relevant host receptors for SARS-CoV-2 entry, which explains the viral attack to multiple types of cells, including erythrocytes, endothelium and neural tissue. Several authors advocated that cell ferroptosis may be the core and final cell degenerative mechanism. Methods: a literature research was performed in several scientific search engines, such as PubMed Central, Cochrane Library, Chemical Abstract Service. More than 500 articles were retrieved until mid-December 2021, to highlight the available evidence about the investigated issues. Results: based on COVID-19 literature data, we have highlighted a few pathophysiological mechanisms, associated with virus-based cation dysmetabolism, multi-organ attack, mitochondria degeneration and ferroptosis. Our suggested elucidated pathological sequence is: a) spike protein subunit S1 docking with sialylated membrane glycoproteins/receptors (ACE2, CD147), and S2 subunit fusion with the lipid layer; b) cell membrane morpho-functional changes due to the consequent electro-chemical variations and viroporin action, which induce an altered ion channel function and intracellular cation accumulation; c) additional intracellular iron concentration due to a deregulated hepcidin-ferroportin axis, with higher hepcidin levels. Viral invasion may also affect erythrocytes/erythroid precursors, endothelial cells and macrophages, through SA and CD147 receptors, with relative hemoglobin and iron/calcium dysmetabolism. AB0 blood group, hemochromatosis, or environmental elements may represent possible factors which affect individual susceptibility to COVID-19.     Conclusions: our literature analysis confirms the combined role of SA molecules, ACE2, CD147, viroporins and hepcidin in determining the cation dysmetabolism and final ferroptosis in the cells infected by SARS-CoV-2. The altered ion channels and electrochemical gradients of the cell membrane have a pivotal role in the virus entry and cell dysmetabolism, with subsequent multi-organ immune-inflammatory degeneration and erythrocyte/hemoglobin alterations.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Adaptation of the periplasm to maintain spatial constraints essential for cell envelope processes and cell viability</a></h4>

              
                The cell envelope of Gram-negative bacteria consists of two membranes surrounding a periplasm and peptidoglycan layer. Molecular machines spanning the cell envelope depend on spatial constraints and load-bearing forces across the cell envelope and surface. The mechanisms dictating spatial constraints across the cell envelope remain incompletely defined. In <i>Escherichia coli</i>, the coiled-coil lipoprotein Lpp contributes the only covalent linkage between the outer membrane and the underlying peptidoglycan layer. Using proteomics, molecular dynamics and a synthetic lethal screen we show that lengthening Lpp to the upper limit does not change the spatial constraint, but is accommodated by other factors which thereby become essential for viability. Our findings demonstrate <i>E. coli</i> expressing elongated Lpp does not simply enlarge the periplasm in response, but the bacteria accommodate by a combination of tilting Lpp and reducing the amount of the covalent bridge. By genetic screening we identified all of the genes in <i>E. coli</i> that become essential in order to enact this adaptation, and by quantitative proteomics discovered that very few proteins need to be up- or down-regulated in steady-state levels in order to accommodate the longer Lpp. We observed increased levels of factors determining cell stiffness, a decrease in membrane integrity, an increase membrane vesiculation and a dependance on otherwise non-essential tethers to maintain lipid transport and peptidoglycan biosynthesis. Further this has implications for understanding how spatial constraint across the envelope controls processes such as flagellum-driven motility, cellular signaling and protein translocation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Multi-omics investigation of Clostridioides difficile-colonized patients reveals pathogen and commensal correlates of C. difficile pathogenesis</a></h4>

              
                <i>Clostridioides difficile</i> infection (CDI) imposes a substantial burden on the health care system in the United States. Understanding the biological basis for the spectrum of <i>C. difficile</i>-related disease manifestations is imperative to improving treatment and prevention of CDI. Here, we investigate the correlates of asymptomatic <i>C. difficile</i> colonization using a multi-omics approach. We compared the fecal microbiome and metabolome profiles of patients with CDI versus asymptomatically colonized patients, integrating clinical and pathogen factors into our analysis. We found that CDI patients were more likely to be colonized by strains with the binary toxin (CDT) locus or strains of ribotype 027, which are often hypervirulent. We find that microbiomes of asymptomatically colonized patients are significantly enriched for species in the class Clostridia relative to those of symptomatic patients. Relative to CDI microbiomes, asymptomatically colonized patient microbiomes were enriched with sucrose degradation pathways encoded by commensal Clostridia, in addition to glycoside hydrolases putatively involved in starch and sucrose degradation. Fecal metabolomics corroborates the carbohydrate degradation signature: we identify carbohydrate compounds enriched in asymptomatically colonized patients relative to CDI patients. Further, we reveal that across <i>C. difficile</i> isolates, the carbohydrates sucrose, rhamnose, and lactulose do not serve as robust growth substrates in vitro, consistent with their enriched detection in our metagenomic and metabolite profiling of asymptomatically colonized individuals. We conclude that pathogen genetic variation may be strongly related to disease outcome. More interestingly, we hypothesize that in asymptomatically colonized individuals, carbohydrate metabolism by other commensal Clostridia may prevent CDI by inhibiting <i>C. difficile</i> proliferation. These insights into <i>C. difficile</i> colonization and putative commensal competition suggest novel avenues to develop probiotic or prebiotic therapeutics against CDI.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Legionella pneumophila modulates host energy metabolism by ADP-ribosylation of ADP/ATP translocases</a></h4>

              
                The intracellular pathogen <i>Legionella pneumophila</i> delivers more than 330 effectors into host cells by its Dot/Icm secretion system. Those effectors direct the biogenesis of the <i>Legionella</i>-containing vacuole (LCV) that permits its intracellular survival and replication. It has long been documented that the LCV is associated with mitochondria and a number of Dot/Icm effectors have been shown to target to this organelle. Yet, the biochemical function and host cell target of most of these effectors remain unknown. Here, we found that the Dot/Icm substrate Ceg3 (Lpg0080) is a mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase that localizes to the mitochondria in host cells where it attacks ADP/ATP translocases by ADP-ribosylation, and blunts their ADP/ATP exchange activity. The modification occurs on the second arginine residue in the -RRRMMM- element, which is conserved among all known ADP/ATP carriers from different organisms. Our results reveal modulation of host energy metabolism as a virulence mechanism for <i>L. pneumophila</i>.

                The Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 protein complex is one of the first responders to DNA double strand breaks. Studies have shown that the catalytic activities of the evolutionarily conserved Mre11-Rad50 (MR) core complex depend on an ATP-dependent global conformational change that takes the macromolecule from an open, extended structure in the absence of ATP to a closed, globular structure when ATP is bound. We have previously identified an additional ‘partially open’ conformation using Luminescence Resonance Energy Transfer (LRET) experiments. Here, a combination of LRET and the molecular docking program HADDOCK was used to further investigate this partially open state and identify three conformations of MR in solution: closed, partially open, and open, which are in addition to the extended, apo conformation. Mutants disrupting specific Mre11-Rad50 interactions within each conformation were used in nuclease activity assays on a variety of DNA substrates to help put the three states into a functional perspective.  LRET data collected on MR bound to DNA demonstrate that the three conformations also exist when nuclease substrates are bound. These models were further supported with SAXS data which corroborate the presence of multiple states in solution. Together, the data suggest a mechanism for the nuclease activity of the MR complex along the DNA.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Vaccine-induced COVID-19 mimicry syndrome</a></h4>

              
                To fight the Covid-19 pandemic caused by the RNA virus SARS-CoV-2 a global vaccination campaign is in progress to achieve the immunization of billions of people mainly with adenoviral vector- or mRNA-based vaccines, all of which encode the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. In some rare cases, cerebral venous sinus thromboses (CVST) have been reported as a severe side effect occurring 4 to 14 days after the first vaccination and were often accompanied by thrombocytopenia. Besides CVST, splanchnic vein thromboses (SVT) and other thromboembolic events have been observed. These events only occurred following vaccination with adenoviral vector-based vaccines but not following vaccination with mRNA-based vaccines. Meanwhile, scientists have proposed an immune-based pathomechanism and the condition has been coined Vaccine-induced Immune Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia (VITT). Here, we describe an unexpected mechanism that could explain thromboembolic events occurring with DNA-based but not with RNA-based vaccines. We show that DNA-encoded mRNA coding for Spike protein can be spliced in a way that the transmembrane anchor of Spike is lost, so that nearly full-length Spike is secreted from cells. Secreted Spike variants could potentially initiate severe side effects when binding to cells via the ACE2 receptor. Avoiding such splicing events should become part of a rational vaccine design to increase safety of prospective vaccines.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Gut Microbial Trimethylamine is Elevated in Alcohol-Associated Hepatitis and Contributes to Ethanol-Induced Liver Injury in Mice</a></h4>

              
                There is mounting evidence that microbes resident in the human intestine contribute to diverse alcohol-associated liver diseases (ALD) including the most deadly form known as alcohol-associated hepatitis (AH). However, mechanisms by which gut microbes synergize with excessive alcohol intake to promote liver injury are poorly understood. Furthermore, whether drugs that selectively target gut microbial metabolism can improve ALD has never been tested. We used liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry to quantify the levels of microbe and host choline co-metabolites in healthy controls and AH patients, finding elevated levels of the microbial metabolite trimethylamine (TMA) in AH. In subsequent studies, we treated mice with non-lethal bacterial choline TMA lyase (CutC/D) inhibitors to blunt gut microbe-dependent production of TMA in the context of chronic ethanol administration. Indices of liver injury were quantified by complementary RNA sequencing, biochemical, and histological approaches. In addition, we examined the impact of ethanol consumption and TMA lyase inhibition on gut microbiome structure via 16S rRNA sequencing. We show the gut microbial choline metabolite trimethylamine (TMA) is elevated in AH patients and correlates with reduced hepatic expression of the TMA oxygenase flavin-containing monooxygenase 3 (FMO3). Provocatively, we find that small molecule inhibition of gut microbial CutC/D activity protects mice from ethanol-induced liver injury. CutC/D inhibitor-driven improvement in ethanol-induced liver injury is associated with distinct reorganization of the gut microbiome and host liver transcriptome. The microbial metabolite TMA is elevated in patients with AH, and inhibition of TMA production from gut microbes can protect mice from ethanol-induced liver injury.

                The human brain is a complex network of anatomically interconnected brain areas. Spontaneous neural activity is constrained by this architecture, giving rise to patterns of statistical dependencies between the activity of remote neural elements. The non-trivial relationship between structural and functional connectivity poses many unsolved challenges about cognition, disease, development, learning and aging. While numerous studies have focused on statistical relationships between edge weights in anatomical and functional networks, less is known about dependencies between their modules and communities. In this work, we investigate and characterize the relationship between anatomical and functional modular organization of the human brain, developing a novel multi-layer framework that expands the classical concept of multi-layer modularity optimization. By simultaneously mapping anatomical and functional networks estimated from different subjects into communities, this approach allows us to carry out a multi-subject and multi-modal analysis of the brain's modular organization. Here, we investigate the relationship between anatomical and functional modules during resting state, finding unique and shared structures. The proposed framework constitutes a methodological advance in the context of multi-layer network analysis and paves the way to further investigate the relationship between structural and functional network organization in clinical cohorts, during cognitively demanding tasks, and in developmental or lifespan studies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Preparing for the unknown: How working memory provides a link between perception and anticipated action</a></h4>

              
                What mechanisms underlie the transfer of a working memory representation into a higher-level code for guiding future actions? Electrophysiological correlates of attentional selection and motor preparation processes within working memory were investigated in two retrospective cuing tasks. In the first experiment, participants stored the orientation and location of a grating. Subsequent feature cues (selective vs. neutral) indicated which feature would be the target for later report. The oscillatory response in the mu and beta frequency range with an estimated source in the sensorimotor cortex contralateral to the responding hand was used as correlate of motor preparation. Mu/beta suppression was stronger following the selective feature cues compared to the neutral cue, demonstrating that purely feature-based selection is sufficient to form a prospective motor plan. In the second experiment, another retrospective cue was included to study whether knowledge of the task at hand is necessary to initiate motor preparation. Following the feature cue, participants were cued to either compare the stored feature(s) to a probe stimulus (recognition task) or to adjust the memory probe to match the target feature (continuous report task). An analogous suppression in the mu frequency range was observed following a selective feature cue, even though the task at hand was not specified yet. Further, a subsequent selective task cue again elicited a mu/beta suppression, which was stronger after a continuous report task cue. This indicates that working memory is able to flexibly store different types of information in higher-level mental codes to provide optimal prerequisites for all required action possibilities.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Temporal learning modulates post-interval ERPs in a categorization task with hidden reference durations.</a></h4>

              
                The investigation of time-related activity in human electrophysiological activity has recently expanded from signals during the estimated interval to post-interval activity. Previous findings show timing-associated event-related potentials (ERPs) in both early (~150ms) and late positive components (LPC; ~300ms) post-interval signals. However, it is still unclear whether and what aspects of temporal information these different patterns of EEG activity are capturing, especially, if these signals are associated with interval duration or other task parameters. In the present work, we designed a modified temporal categorization task to investigate if participants' adaptation to a changing decisional context led to changes in post-interval ERPs. Participants had to learn a hidden reference duration on each block to categorize the presented target intervals correctly. We found an early posterior N200 potential correlated to target durations and decisional context. A central LPC, which interacted with duration and learning of the hidden reference, predicted behavioural responses. Our findings add to the current evidence that interval duration modulates post-interval activity in timing categorization tasks and shows that late signals are associated with interval duration and decisional context.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Weighting of celestial and terrestrial cues in the monarch butterfly central complex</a></h4>

              
                Monarch butterflies rely on external cues for orientation during their annual long-distance migration from Northern US and Canada to Central Mexico. These external cues can be celestial cues, such as the sun or polarized light, which are processed in the internal compass of the brain, termed the central complex (CX). Previous research typically focused on how individual simulated celestial cues are encoded in the butterfly's CX. However, in nature, the butterflies perceive several celestial cues at the same time and need to integrate them to effectively use the compound of all cues for orientation. In addition, a recent behavioral study revealed that monarch butterflies can rely on terrestrial cues, such as the panoramic skyline, for orientation and use them in combination with the sun to maintain a directed flight course. How the CX encodes a combination of celestial and terrestrial cues and how they are weighted in the butterfly's CX is still unknown. Here, we examined how input neurons of the CX, termed TL neurons, combine celestial and terrestrial information. While recording intracellularly from the neurons, we presented a sun stimulus and polarized light to the butterflies as well as a simulated sun and a panoramic scene simultaneously. Our results show that celestial cues are integrated linearly in these cells, while the combination of the sun and a panoramic skyline did not always follow a linear integration of action potential rates. Interestingly, while the weighting between the sun and polarized light was invariant between individual input neurons, it varied strongly when the sun stimulus and the panoramic skyline were presented simultaneously. Taken together, this dynamic weighting between celestial and terrestrial cues may allow the butterflies to flexibly set their cue preference during navigation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Stimulus Whitening Improves the Efficiency of Reverse Correlation</a></h4>

              
                Human perception depends upon internal representations of the environment that help to organize the raw information available from the senses by acting as reference patterns. Internal representations are widely characterized using reverse correlation, a method capable of producing unconstrained estimates of the representation itself, all on the basis of simple responses to random stimuli. Despite its advantages, reverse correlation is often infeasible to apply because the number of stimulus-response trials needed to provide an accurate estimate is typically very large. Prior approaches have aimed to overcome this sampling inefficiency by incorporating prior knowledge of the representation, which biases the estimate and ultimately limits the essential power of reverse correlation. The present approach, however, improves efficiency via stimulus whitening, a statistical procedure that decorrelates stimuli, making them less redundant, and commensurately more favorable for efficient estimation of an arbitrary target. We provide a mathematical justification for whitening, and demonstrate in simulation that whitening provides greater than 85% improvement in efficiency for a given estimation accuracy, and also a two- to five-fold increase in accuracy for a given sample size. Improving the efficiency of reverse correlation may enable a broader scope of investigations into individual variability and potential universality of perceptual mechanisms.

                Enlarged perivascular spaces (PVS) are considered a biomarker for vascular pathology and has been observed in several neurological disorders and in normal aging; however, the age-related changes in PVS structure across the normative lifespan are not well understood. We sought to characterize the relationship between PVS anatomical characteristics and age in a large cohort (~1400) between 8 and 90 years of age from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) Lifespan datasets. PVS from the white matter regions and the basal ganglia (BG) were automatically segmented and quantified from vesselness maps derived from multimodal structural MRI data. PVS burden increased from childhood to advancing age in both the white matter and BG and was reflected by increasing PVS volume fraction (VF), count and mean cross-sectional diameter and decreasing mean solidity, with elevated PVS burden in males compared to females. Within white matter regions, PVS burden in childhood significantly predicted the rate of PVS expansion across the lifespan (t(66)=-12.15, p<.001, R2=.69), where regions with low PVS VF in childhood undergo rapid growth (e.g., temporal regions) and regions with high PVS VF in childhood undergo slowed growth (e.g., limbic regions). PVS anatomical alterations across the lifespan was not significantly associated with working memory performance. Together, our findings of spatially-varying patterns of PVS enlargement across the lifespan constitutes a feature of normal aging and may reflect alterations to waste clearance functionality. These results provide a normative reference for the spatial distribution of PVS enlargement patterns from which pathological alterations can be compared.

                Alzheimer's disease (AD) is becoming increasingly prevalent worldwide. It represents one of greatest medical challenge as no pharmacologic treatments are available today that can slow or stop the disease progression. Over time, hippocampal and cerebral atrophy, a core feature of AD, results in an amnestic syndrome, whose severity is linked with the extent of neuron loss. Astrocytes play crucial functions within neuronal circuits. The strategic localization of these glial cells allows them to closely interact with neurons, to provide metabolic and functional support, and to regulate interstitial solute composition. Astrocytes are resilient cells contrary to neurons. In our study, we exploited astrocytes as tools to protect the neuronal function in an AD mouse model. We targeted their mitochondria, central to cellular energy metabolism, in the hippocampus and overexpressed the mitochondrial uncoupling protein UCP4, which improves neuronal survival in vitro. We found that this treatment efficiently prevents hippocampal atrophy and neuronal dendritic architecture alteration in AD mice. It also averts aberrant neuronal excitability and alterations of metabolite levels, both altered in AD. Finally, UCP4 overexpression allowed preserving episodic-like memory in AD mice, which is the end goal of future AD therapies. Overall, our results show that targeting astrocyte and their mitochondria is an effective strategy for rescuing neurons facing AD-related stress at early stages of the disease which bears high translational potential.

                In the "double-drift" illusion, local motion within a window moving in the periphery alters the windows perceived path. The illusion is strong even when the eyes track a target whose motion matches the window so that the stimulus remains stable on the retina. This implies that the illusion involves the integration of retinal signals with non-retinal eye-movement signals. To identify where in the brain this integration occurs, we measured BOLD fMRI responses in visual cortex while subjects experienced the double drift illusion. We identified a number of cortical areas that responded more strongly during the illusion, but only in area hMT+ was it possible to decode the illusory trajectory. Our results provide evidence for a perceptual representation in human visual cortex that is not linked to retinal position.

The neural pathways underlying this apparent stomach-brain synchrony is also unclear. Here, we performed functional magnetic resonance imaging while simultaneously recording body-surface gastric slow waves from anesthetized rats in the fasting vs. postprandial conditions and performed a bilateral cervical vagotomy to assess the role of the vagus nerve. The coherence between brain fMRI signals and gastric slow waves was found in a distributed gastric network, including subcortical and cortical regions in the sensory, motor, and limbic systems. The stomach-brain coherence was largely reduced by the bilateral vagotomy and was different between the fasting and fed states. These findings suggest that the vagus nerve mediates the spontaneous coherence between brain activity and gastric slow waves, which is likely a signature of real-time stomach-brain interactions. However, its functional significance remains to be established.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A murine Wac model exhibits phenotypes relevant to DeSanto-Shinawi Syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Several monogenic syndromes are associated with neurodevelopmental changes that result in cognitive impairments, including autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and seizures. Limited studies and resources are available to make meaningful headway into the underlying mechanisms that result in these symptoms. One such example, DeSanto-Shinawi Syndrome (DESSH), is a rare disorder caused by mutations in the WAC gene. Those diagnosed with DESSH experience craniofacial alterations as well as cognitive symptoms that include autism, ADHD and seizures. However, no thorough studies from a mammalian model exist to understand how these changes occur. To overcome this, we generated constitutive murine Wac mutants and assessed phenotypes that are relevant to humans diagnosed with DESSH. Wac mutants have craniofacial, anatomical, behavioral and seizure susceptibility that are relevant to DESSH; this new model is suited to study some of the core symptoms of DESSH and the biology of Wac.

                The metabolic pathway of [6,6'-2H2]-labeled glucose was investigated with two different techniques. The first technique used direct detection of deuterium applying Deuterium Metabolic Imaging (DMI). The second technique used the indirect detection of deuterium with proton MR spectroscopy (MRS) called Quantitative Exchanged-label Turnover (QELT) MRS. For the first time, time-resolved data was acquired for both techniques in the same healthy human subjects and directly compared. The time-curves were used in a kinetic model to estimate rates of the metabolic pathway of glucose. Two different kinetic models were compared. One included only DMI data, the second one combined DMI and QELT. For the first model, a tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle rate of 0.69 {+/-} 0.10 mol{middle dot}min-1{middle dot}g-1 was determined. For the second model, the estimated TCA cycle rate was 0.68 {+/-} 0.12 mol{middle dot}min-1{middle dot}g-1. In addition, the rate of glutamine synthesis from glutamate could be estimated with model 2 (0.51 {+/-} 0.15 mol{middle dot}min-1{middle dot}g-1). The sensitivity of both methods was evaluated and compared to alternative techniques.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">BOLD cofluctuation 'events' are predicted from static functional connectivity</a></h4>

              
                Recent work identified single time points ("events") of high regional cofluctuation in functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) which contain more large-scale brain network information than other, low cofluctuation time points. This suggested that events might be a discrete, temporally sparse signal which drives functional connectivity (FC) over the timeseries. However, a different, not yet explored possibility is that network information differences between time points are driven by sampling variability on a constant, static, noisy signal. Using a combination of real and simulated data, we examined the relationship between cofluctuation and network structure and asked if this relationship was unique, or if it could arise from sampling variability alone. First, we show that events are not discrete - there is a gradually increasing relationship between network structure and cofluctuation; ~50% of samples show very strong network structure. Second, using simulations we show that this relationship is predicted from sampling variability on static FC. Finally, we show that randomly selected points can capture network structure about as well as events, largely because of their temporal spacing. Together, these results suggest that, while events exhibit particularly strong representations of static FC, there is little evidence that events are unique timepoints that drive FC structure. Instead, a parsimonious explanation for the data is that events arise from a single static, but noisy, FC structure.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Entorhinal layer 6b subplate neurons govern spatial learning and memory</a></h4>

              
                The mammalian hippocampal formation (HF) plays a key role in several higher brain functions, such as spatial coding, learning and memory. Its simple circuit architecture is often viewed as a trisynaptic loop, processing input originating from the superficial layers of the entorhinal cortex (EC) in a linear fashion, and sending it back to its deeper layers. Here, we show that contrary to this canonical view, excitatory neurons in the deepest layer of the mouse EC, exhibiting the unique morphology and molecular profile of layer 6b cortical subplate neurons (SPNs), project to all sub-regions comprising the HF, with a preference towards CA3 pyramidal neurons, and receive input from the CA1, thalamus and claustrum. Furthermore, their output is characterized by unique slow-decaying excitatory post-synaptic currents (EPSCs), capable of driving plateau-like potentials in their target cells. Optogenetic inhibition of the EC-6b pathway markedly affects spatial coding in CA1 pyramidal neurons, while cell ablation impairs not only acquisition of new spatial memories, but also degradation of previously acquired ones. Our results provide the first evidence of a functional role for the cortical layer 6b neurons in the adult brain and elucidate a critical novel element determining cortico-hippocampal activity patterns.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The way of the light: how visual information reaches the auditory cortex in congenitally deaf adults</a></h4>

              
                Human and animal studies on cross-modal plasticity under congenital deafness suggest that early auditory cortex plays a significant role in the processing of visual information when congenitally deprived from its typical (auditory) input. However, the pathway by which early auditory cortex is fed with visual information is still understudied. Here we focused on addressing how visual information reaches the auditory cortex under congenital deafness. We put forth a mechanistic model that proposes that different corticocortical and subcortical connections play a central role in rerouting visual information to the early auditory cortex of congenitally deaf individuals. Specifically, we show, using Representational Connectivity Analysis (RCA) and Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM), that connections from the right superior colliculus to the right inferior colliculus, as well as connections from right early visual cortical regions to the right early auditory cortex play a role in rerouting visual information to early auditory cortex in congenitally deaf individuals. These findings shed light on how visual information reaches the early auditory cortex of deaf individuals - specifically, they suggest that neuroplasticity reshapes subcortical connections in order to re-route visual information to the auditory stream.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Enhanced anticipatory biasing of visuospatial attention in deaf native-signing adults indexed by alpha-band (8-14 Hz) oscillatory neural activity</a></h4>

              
                Deaf people show increased visuospatial attention abilities, especially towards peripheral inputs, but the neural mechanisms of these heightened abilities are not yet understood. In hearing individuals, topographically-specific alpha-band oscillatory activity (8-14 Hz) over parieto-occipital regions has been associated with active suppression of irrelevant locations. Here, we asked whether increases in this spatially-specific anticipatory oscillatory mechanism might underpin enhanced visuospatial attention abilities in deaf individuals, on the premise that deaf people might be more adept at transiently engaging and disengaging attentional processes involved in processing peripheral inputs. An alternative hypothesis was that deaf individuals might not produce lateralized alpha-band activity, because of the need to continuously monitor the periphery due to the absence of an auxiliary auditory spatial alerting system. High-density electroencephalography was recorded from 20 deaf native signers and 20 hearing non-signers performing a cued covert visuospatial attention task. Deaf participants responded significantly more rapidly and accurately and showed highly typical alpha-band lateralization during the cue-target interval of the task. Topographic analysis showed a greater extent of alpha-band anticipatory activity over right parietal scalp, suggesting sequestration of extra-visual attentional circuits (i.e., unused auditory regions), and post-hoc analysis pointed to substantially earlier onset of this activity during the cue-target interval. The presence of cue-evoked anticipatory alpha lateralization in deaf participants suggests that they are rapidly engaging and disengaging attentional processes involved in orienting attention to the periphery. The earlier and more extensive engagement of these anticipatory oscillatory processes may contribute to the improved visuospatial performance observed in these individuals.

	<p>Verbal Fluency Tests (VFT) are one of the most common neuropsychological tasks used in bipolar disorder (BD) and schizophrenia (SZ) research. Recently, a new VFT analysis method based on graph theory was developed. Interpreting spoken words as nodes and every temporal connection between consecutive words as edges, researchers created graph structures, allowing the extraction of more data from participants&amp;amp;rsquo; speech, called Speech Graph Attributes (SGA). The aim of our study was to compare speech graphs, derived from Phonemic and Semantic VFT, between SZ, BD, and healthy controls (HC). Twenty-nine SZ patients, twenty-nine BD patients, and twenty-nine HC performed Semantic and Phonemic VFT. Standard measures (SM) and 13 SGA were analyzed. SZ patients&amp;amp;rsquo; Semantic VFT graphs showed lower total word count and correct responses. Their graphs presented less nodes and edges, higher density, smaller diameter, average shortest path (ASP), and largest strongly connected component than the HC group. SM did not differentiate BD and HC groups, and patients&amp;amp;rsquo; Semantic VFT graphs presented smaller diameter and ASP than HC. None of the parameters differentiated BD and SZ patients. Our results encourage the use of speech graph analysis, as it reveals verbal fluency alterations that remained unnoticed in the routine comparisons of groups with the use SM.</p>

	<p>The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether there are associations between polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) blood levels, reading/writing performance and performance in neuropsychological tasks. Moderate to strong correlations were found between PUFA levels (specific omega-6/omega-3 ratios) and reading/writing abilities, and the former and neuropsychological test scores. Mediation models analyzing the direct and indirect effects of PUFA on reading and writing scores showed that the effects of fatty acids on learning measures appear to be direct rather than mediated by the investigated visual and auditory neuropsychological mechanisms. The only significant indirect effect was found for the difference in accuracy between the left and right visual fields in visual-spatial cueing tasks, acting as a mediator for the effect of PUFA ratios on writing accuracy. Regression analyses, by contrast, confirmed the roles of phonological awareness and other visual attentional factors as predictors of reading and writing skills. Such results confirm the crucial role of visual-spatial attention mechanisms in reading and writing, and suggest that visual low-level mechanisms may be more sensitive to the effects of favorable conditions related to the presence of higher omega-3 blood levels.</p>

	<p>Falling is a frequent and major clinical problem among older adults, as well as in patients with chronic cerebrovascular diseases (CVD). At present, sequential (mixed) and simultaneously (dual-task) motor-cognitive trainings are the best approaches to affording patients more autonomy in their everyday motor independence while reducing fall risks and consequences. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of an advanced and innovative dual-task motor-cognitive rehabilitation program on fall risks in vulnerable older persons with chronic CVD. To this purpose, 26 consecutive older fallers with chronic CVD were recruited, and completed a mixed motor-cognitive or a dual-task motor-cognitive training program. Each patient also underwent two test evaluations to assess balance, gait, fear of falling, and walking performance at pre-and post-intervention. We found that our experimental motor-cognitive dual-task rehabilitation program could be an effective method to improve walking balance, gait, walking speed, and fear of falling, while reducing the risk of falls in older people with chronic CVD. Furthermore, results show that the simultaneous motor-cognitive training is more effective than the sequential motor-cognitive training. Therefore, our study brings innovative data, which can contribute positively to the management of this population.</p>

	<p>(1) Background: Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is one of the promising risk genes for schizophrenia (SZ), a disease with prominent dysregulation of miRNA networks. Here, we present a study of miRNA-BDNF co-expression changes in peripheral blood of SZ patients. (2) Methods: The expression levels of the BDNF mRNA and three validated binding miRNAs&amp;amp;mdash;miR-124-3p, miR-132-3p, and miR-206&amp;amp;mdash;were quantified in the blood of 48 healthy controls and 32 SZ patients before and after 12 weeks of treatment. The co-expression patterns were evaluated in the three groups. (3) Results: The expression levels of BDNF were significantly downregulated in SZ patients compared to the controls. After the treatment, the expression levels of BDNF were upregulated, while the expression levels of the three miRNAs were downregulated. Co-expression analyses showed positive correlations of this network in the SZ patients, while weak negative correlations were observed in the healthy controls. After the 12-week treatment, the overall correlation between BDNF and the three miRNAs reached the levels comparable to the healthy controls. (4) Conclusions: Our findings suggest the involvement of the miRNA-BDNF network in the onset and treatment of SZ.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Lyso-Lipid-Induced Oligodendrocyte Maturation Underlies Restoration of Optic Nerve Function</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Protein hyperdeimination and deficiency of lyso-phospholipids (LPC 18:1) has been associated with the pathology of demyelinating disease in both humans and mice. We uncovered interesting biology of LPC 18:1, in which LPC 18:1 induced optic nerve function restoration through oligodendrocyte maturation and remyelination in mouse model systems. Our <I>in vitro</I> studies show LPC 18:1 protection against neuron-ectopic hyperdeimination and stimulation of oligodendrocyte maturation, while <I>in vivo</I> investigations recorded optic nerve function improvement following optic nerve injections of LPC 18:1, in contrast with LPC 18:0. Thus, just a change in a single bond renders a dramatic alternation in biological function. The incorporation of isobaric C13-histidine in newly synthesized myelin proteins and quantitative proteome shifts are consistent with remyelination underlying restoration in optic nerve function. These results suggest that exogenous LPC 18:1 may provide a therapeutic avenue for stemming vision loss in demyelinating diseases.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">DSCAM Deficiency Leads to Premature Spine Maturation and Autism-like Behaviors</a></h4>

              
                <p>Mutations in some cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) cause abnormal synapse formation and maturation, and serve as one of the potential mechanisms of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Recently, <I>DSCAM</I> (Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule) was found to be a high-risk gene for autism. However, it is still unclear how DSCAM contributes to ASD. Here, we show that DSCAM expression was downregulated following synapse maturation, and that DSCAM deficiency caused accelerated dendritic spine maturation during early postnatal development. Mechanistically, the extracellular domain of DSCAM interacts with neuroligin1 (NLGN1) to block the NLGN1-neurexin1&beta; (NRXN1&beta;) interaction. DSCAM extracellular domain was able to rescue spine overmaturation in <I>DSCAM</I> knockdown neurons. Precocious spines in DSCAM-deficient mice showed increased glutamatergic transmission in the developing cortex and induced autism-like behaviors, such as social novelty deficits and repetitive behaviors. Thus, DSCAM might be a repressor that prevents premature spine maturation and excessive glutamatergic transmission, and its deficiency could lead to autism-like behaviors. Our study provides new insight into the potential pathophysiological mechanisms of ASDs.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> <I>DSCAM</I> is not only associated with Down syndrome but is also a strong autism risk gene based on large-scale sequencing analysis. However, it remains unknown exactly how DSCAM contributes to autism. In mice, either neuron- and astrocyte-specific or pyramidal neuron-specific DSCAM deficiencies resulted in autism-like behaviors and enhanced spatial memory. In addition, DSCAM knockout or knockdown in pyramidal neurons led to increased dendritic spine maturation. Mechanistically, the extracellular domain of DSCAM binds to NLGN1 and inhibits NLGN1-NRXN1&beta; interaction, which can rescue abnormal spine maturation induced by DSCAM deficiency. Our research demonstrates that DSCAM negatively modulates spine maturation, and that DSCAM deficiency leads to excessive spine maturation and autism-like behaviors, thus providing new insight into a potential pathophysiological mechanism of autism.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Rapid Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Reveals That TRPV4 Channels Promote Dysregulation of Neuronal Na+ in Ischemia</a></h4>

              
                <p>Fluorescence imaging is an indispensable method for analysis of diverse cellular and molecular processes, enabling, for example, detection of ions, second messengers, or metabolites. Intensity-based approaches, however, are prone to artifacts introduced by changes in fluorophore concentrations. This drawback can be overcome by fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) based on time-correlated single-photon counting. FLIM often necessitates long photon collection times, resulting in strong temporal binning of dynamic processes. Recently, rapidFLIM was introduced, exploiting ultra-low dead-time photodetectors together with rapid electronics. Here, we demonstrate the applicability of rapidFLIM, combined with new and improved correction schemes, for spatiotemporal fluorescence lifetime imaging of low-emission fluorophores in a biological system. Using tissue slices of hippocampi of mice of either sex, loaded with the Na<sup>+</sup> indicator ING2, we show that improved rapidFLIM enables quantitative, dynamic imaging of neuronal Na<sup>+</sup> signals at a full-frame temporal resolution of 0.5 Hz. Induction of transient chemical ischemia resulted in unexpectedly large Na<sup>+</sup> influx, accompanied by considerable cell swelling. Both Na<sup>+</sup> loading and cell swelling were dampened on inhibition of TRPV4 channels. Together, rapidFLIM enabled the spatiotemporal visualization and quantification of neuronal Na<sup>+</sup> transients at unprecedented speed and independent from changes in cell volume. Moreover, our experiments identified TRPV4 channels as hitherto unappreciated contributors to neuronal Na<sup>+</sup> loading on metabolic failure, suggesting this pathway as a possible target to ameliorate excitotoxic damage. Finally, rapidFLIM will allow faster and more sensitive detection of a wide range of dynamic signals with other FLIM probes, most notably those with intrinsic low-photon emission.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> FLIM is an indispensable method for analysis of cellular processes. FLIM often necessitates long photon collection periods, requiring the sacrifice of temporal resolution at the expense of spatial information. Here, we demonstrate the applicability of the recently introduced rapidFLIM for quantitative, dynamic imaging with low-emission fluorophores in brain slices. RapidFLIM, combined with improved correction schemes, enabled intensity-independent recording of neuronal Na<sup>+</sup> transients at unprecedented full-frame rates of 0.5 Hz. It also allowed quantitative imaging independent from changes in cell volume, revealing a surprisingly strong and hitherto uncovered contribution of TRPV4 channels to Na<sup>+</sup> loading on energy failure. Collectively, our study thus provides a novel, unexpected insight into the mechanisms that are responsible for Na<sup>+</sup> changes on energy depletion.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Lunatic Fringe-GFP Marks Lamina-Specific Astrocytes That Regulate Sensory Processing</a></h4>

              
                <p>Astrocytes are the most abundant glial cell in the brain and perform a wide range of tasks that support neuronal function and circuit activities. There is emerging evidence that astrocytes exhibit molecular and cellular heterogeneity; however, whether distinct subpopulations perform these diverse roles remains poorly defined. Here we show that the Lunatic Fringe-GFP (Lfng-GFP) bacteria artificial chromosome mouse line from both sexes specifically labels astrocyte populations within lamina III and IV of the dorsal spinal cord. Transcriptional profiling of Lfng-GFP<sup>+</sup> astrocytes revealed unique molecular profiles, featuring an enriched expression of Notch- and Wnt- pathway components. Leveraging CRE-DOG viral tools, we ablated Lfng-GFP<sup>+</sup> astrocytes, which decreased neuronal activity in lamina III and IV and impaired mechanosensation associated with light touch. Together, our findings identify Lfng-GFP<sup>+</sup> astrocytes as a unique subpopulation that occupies a distinct anatomic location in the spinal cord and directly contributes to neuronal function and sensory responses.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Astrocytes are the most abundant glial cell in the CNS, and their interactions with neurons are essential for brain function. However, understanding the functional diversity of astrocytes has been hindered because of the lack of reporters that mark subpopulations and genetic tools for accessing them. We discovered that the Lfng-GFP reporter mouse labels a laminae-specific subpopulation of astrocytes in the dorsal spinal cord and that ablation of these astrocytes reduces glutamatergic synapses. Further analysis revealed that these astrocytes have a role in maintaining sensory-processing circuity related to light touch.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Structure of Long-Range Direct and Indirect Spinocerebellar Pathways as Well as Local Spinal Circuits Mediating Proprioception</a></h4>

              
                <p>Proprioception, the sense of limb and body position, generates a map of the body that is essential for proper motor control, yet we know little about precisely how neurons in proprioceptive pathways are wired. Defining the anatomy of secondary neurons in the spinal cord that integrate and relay proprioceptive and potentially cutaneous information from the periphery to the cerebellum is fundamental to understanding how proprioceptive circuits function. Here, we define the unique anatomic trajectories of long-range direct and indirect spinocerebellar pathways as well as local intersegmental spinal circuits using genetic tools in both male and female mice. We find that Clarke's column neurons, a major contributor to the direct spinocerebellar pathway, has mossy fiber terminals that diversify extensively in the cerebellar cortex with axons terminating bilaterally, but with no significant axon collaterals within the spinal cord, medulla, or cerebellar nuclei. By contrast, we find that two of the indirect pathways, the spino-lateral reticular nucleus and spino-olivary pathways, are in part, derived from cervical <I>Atoh1</I>-lineage neurons, whereas thoracolumbar <I>Atoh1</I>-lineage neurons project mostly locally within the spinal cord. Notably, while cervical and thoracolumbar <I>Atoh1</I>-lineage neurons connect locally with motor neurons, no Clarke's column to motor neuron connections were detected. Together, we define anatomic differences between long-range direct, indirect, and local proprioceptive subcircuits that likely mediate different components of proprioceptive-motor behaviors.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We define the anatomy of long-range direct and indirect spinocerebellar pathways as well as local spinal proprioceptive circuits. We observe that mossy fiber axon terminals of Clarke's column neurons diversify proprioceptive information across granule cells in multiple lobules on both ipsilateral and contralateral sides, sending no significant collaterals within the spinal cord, medulla, or cerebellar nuclei. Strikingly, we find that cervical spinal cord <I>Atoh1</I>-lineage neurons form mainly the indirect spino-lateral reticular nucleus and spino-olivary tracts and thoracolumbar <I>Atoh1</I>-lineage neurons project locally within the spinal cord, whereas only a few <I>Atoh1</I>-lineage neurons form a direct spinocerebellar tract.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Sparser and Less Efficient Hippocampal-Prefrontal Projections account for Developmental Network Dysfunction in a Model of Psychiatric Risk Mediated by Gene-Environment Interaction</a></h4>

              
                <p>Precise information flow from the hippocampus (HP) to prefrontal cortex (PFC) emerges during early development and accounts for cognitive processing throughout life. On flip side, this flow is selectively impaired in mental illness. In mouse models of psychiatric risk mediated by gene-environment interaction (GE), the prefrontal-hippocampal coupling is disrupted already shortly after birth. While this impairment relates to local miswiring in PFC and HP, it might be also because of abnormal connectivity between the two brain areas. Here, we test this hypothesis by combining <I>in vivo</I> electrophysiology and optogenetics with in-depth tracing of projections and monitor the morphology and function of hippocampal afferents in the PFC of control and GE mice of either sex throughout development. We show that projections from the hippocampal CA1 area preferentially target layer 5/6 pyramidal neurons and interneurons, and to a lesser extent layer 2/3 neurons of prelimbic cortex (PL), a subdivision of PFC. In neonatal GE mice, sparser axonal projections from CA1 pyramidal neurons with decreased release probability reach the PL. Their ability to entrain layer 5/6 oscillatory activity and firing is decreased. These structural and functional deficits of hippocampal-prelimbic connectivity persist, yet are less prominent in prejuvenile GE mice. Thus, besides local dysfunction of HP and PL, weaker connectivity between the two brain areas is present in GE mice throughout development.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Poor cognitive performance in mental disorders comes along with prefrontal-hippocampal dysfunction. Recent data from mice that model the psychiatric risk mediated by gene-environment (GE) interaction identified the origin of deficits during early development, when the local circuits in both areas are compromised. Here, we show that sparser and less efficient connectivity as well as cellular dysfunction are the substrate of the weaker excitatory drive from hippocampus (HP) to prefrontal cortex (PFC) as well as of poorer oscillatory coupling between the two brain areas in these mice. While the structural and functional connectivity deficits persist during the entire development, their magnitude decreases with age. The results add experimental evidence for the developmental miswiring hypothesis of psychiatric disorders.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Effects of Light Isoflurane Anesthesia on Organization of Direction and Orientation Selectivity in the Superficial Layer of the Mouse Superior Colliculus</a></h4>

              
                <p>The superior colliculus (SC) is the midbrain center for integrating visual and multimodal sensory information. Neurons in the SC exhibit direction and orientation selectivity. Recent studies reported that neurons with similar preferences formed clusters in the mouse SC (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B2">Ahmadlou and Heimel, 2015</cross-ref>; <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B22">Feinberg and Meister, 2015</cross-ref>; <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B20">de Malmazet et al., 2018</cross-ref>; <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B38">Li et al., 2020</cross-ref>). However, it remains controversial as to how these clusters are organized within the SC (<cross-ref type="bib" refid="B31">Inayat et al., 2015</cross-ref>; <cross-ref type="bib" refid="B16">Chen et al., 2021</cross-ref>). Here, we found that different brain states (i.e., awake or anesthetized with isoflurane) changed the selectivity of individual SC neurons and organizations of the neuronal population in both male and female mice. Using two-photon Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging, we examined both individual neuronal responses and the spatial patterns of their population responses. Under isoflurane anesthesia, orientation selectivity increased and a larger number of orientation-selective cells were observed when compared with the awake condition, whereas the proportions of direction-selective cells were similar in both conditions. Furthermore, direction- and orientation-selective cells located at closer positions showed more similar preferences, and cluster-like spatial patterns were enhanced. Inhibitory responses of direction-selective neurons were also reduced under isoflurane anesthesia. Thus, the changes in the spatial organization of response patterns were considered to be because of changes in the balance of excitation and inhibition, with excitation dominance, in the local circuits. These results provide new insights into the possibility that the functional organization of feature selectivity in the brain is affected by brain state.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Recent large-scale recording studies are changing our view of visual maps in the superior colliculus (SC), including findings of cluster-like localizations of direction- and orientation-selective neurons. However, results from several laboratories are conflicting regarding the presence of cluster-like organization. Here, we demonstrated that light isoflurane anesthesia affected the direction- and orientation-tuning properties in the mouse superficial SC and that their cluster-like localization pattern was enhanced by the anesthesia. Furthermore, the effect of anesthesia on direction selectivity appeared to be different in the excitatory and inhibitory populations in the SC. Our results suggest that the functional organization of direction and orientation selectivity might be regulated by the excitation&ndash;inhibition balance that depends on the brain state.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Perceptual Texture Dimensions Modulate Neuronal Response Dynamics in Visual Cortical Area V4</a></h4>

              
                <p>Texture is an important visual attribute for surface pattern discrimination and therefore object segmentation, but the neural bases of texture perception are largely unknown. Previously, we demonstrated that the responses of V4 neurons to naturalistic texture patches are sensitive to four key features of human texture perception: coarseness, directionality, regularity, and contrast. To begin to understand how distinct texture perception emerges from the dynamics of neuronal responses, in 2 macaque monkeys (1 male, 1 female), we investigated the relative contribution of the four texture attributes to V4 responses in terms of the strength and timing of response modulation. We found that the different feature dimensions are associated with different temporal dynamics. Specifically, the response modulation associated with directionality and regularity was significantly delayed relative to that associated with coarseness and contrast, suggesting that the latter are fundamentally simpler feature dimensions. The population of texture-selective neurons could be grouped into multiple clusters based on the combination of feature dimensions encoded, and those subpopulations displayed distinct temporal dynamics characterized by the weighted combinations of multiple features. Finally, we applied a population decoding approach to demonstrate that texture category information can be obtained from short temporal windows across time. These results demonstrate that the representation of different perceptually relevant texture features emerge over time in the responses of V4 neurons. The observed temporal organization provides a framework to interpret how the processing of surface features unfolds in early and midlevel cortical stages, and could ultimately inform the interpretation of perceptual texture dynamics.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> To delineate how neuronal responses underlie our ability to perceive visual textures, we related four key perceptual dimensions (coarseness, directionality, regularity, and contrast) of naturalistic textures to the strength and timing of modulation of neuronal responses in area V4, an intermediate stage in the form-processing, ventral visual pathway. Our results provide the first characterization of V4 temporal dynamics for texture encoding along perceptually defined axes.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Respiration, Heartbeat, and Conscious Tactile Perception</a></h4>

              
                <p>Previous studies have shown that timing of sensory stimulation during the cardiac cycle interacts with perception. Given the natural coupling of respiration and cardiac activity, we investigated here their joint effects on tactile perception. Forty-one healthy female and male human participants reported conscious perception of finger near-threshold electrical pulses (33% null trials) and decision confidence while electrocardiography, respiratory activity, and finger photoplethysmography were recorded. Participants adapted their respiratory cycle to expected stimulus onsets to preferentially occur during late inspiration/early expiration. This closely matched heart rate variation (sinus arrhythmia) across the respiratory cycle such that most frequent stimulation onsets occurred during the period of highest heart rate probably indicating highest alertness and cortical excitability. Tactile detection rate was highest during the first quadrant after expiration onset. Interindividually, stronger respiratory phase-locking to the task was associated with higher detection rates. Regarding the cardiac cycle, we confirmed previous findings that tactile detection rate was higher during diastole than systole and newly specified its minimum at 250&ndash;300 ms after the R-peak corresponding to the pulse wave arrival in the finger. Expectation of stimulation induced a transient heart deceleration which was more pronounced for unconfident decision ratings. Interindividually, stronger poststimulus modulations of heart rate were linked to higher detection rates. In summary, we demonstrate how tuning to the respiratory cycle and integration of respiratory-cardiac signals are used to optimize performance of a tactile detection task.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Mechanistic studies on perception and cognition tend to focus on the brain neglecting contributions of the body. Here, we investigated how respiration and heartbeat influence tactile perception: respiration phase-locking to expected stimulus onsets corresponds to highest heart rate (and presumably alertness/cortical excitability) and correlates with detection performance. Tactile detection varies across the heart cycle with a minimum when the pulse reaches the finger and a maximum in diastole. Taken together with our previous finding of unchanged early event-related potentials across the cardiac cycle, we conclude that these effects are not a peripheral physiological artifact but a result of cognitive processes that model our body's internal state, make predictions to guide behavior, and might also tune respiration to serve the task.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Language Recovery after Brain Injury: A Structural Network Control Theory Study</a></h4>

              
                <p>Aphasia recovery after stroke depends on the condition of the remaining, extralesional brain network. Network control theory (NCT) provides a unique, quantitative approach to assess the interaction between brain networks. In this longitudinal, large-scale, whole-brain connectome study, we evaluated whether controllability measures of language-related regions are associated with treated aphasia recovery. Using probabilistic tractography and controlling for the effects of structural lesions, we reconstructed whole-brain diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) connectomes from 68 individuals (20 female, 48 male) with chronic poststroke aphasia who completed a three-week language therapy. Applying principles of NCT, we computed regional (1) average and (2) modal controllability, which decode the ability of a region to (1) spread control input through the brain network and (2) to facilitate brain state transitions. We tested the relationship between pretreatment controllability measures of 20 language-related left hemisphere regions and improvements in naming six months after language therapy using multiple linear regressions and a parsimonious elastic net regression model with cross-validation. Regional controllability of the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) pars opercularis, pars orbitalis, and the anterior insula were associated with treatment outcomes independently of baseline aphasia severity, lesion volume, age, education, and network size. Modal controllability of the IFG pars opercularis was the strongest predictor of treated aphasia recovery with cross-validation and outperformed traditional graph theory, lesion load, and demographic measures. Regional NCT measures can reflect the status of the residual language network and its interaction with the remaining brain network, being able to predict language recovery after aphasia treatment.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Predicting and understanding language recovery after brain injury remains a challenging, albeit a fundamental aspect of human neurology and neuroscience. In this study, we applied network control theory (NCT) to fully harness the concept of brain networks as dynamic systems and to evaluate their interaction. We studied 68 stroke survivors with aphasia who underwent imaging and longitudinal behavioral assessments coupled with language therapy. We found that the controllability of the inferior frontal regional network significantly predicted recovery in language production six months after treatment. Importantly, controllability outperformed traditional demographic, lesion, and graph-theoretical measures. Our findings shed light on the neurobiological basis of human language and can be translated into personalized rehabilitation approaches.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Increasing Central Serotonin with 5-hydroxytryptophan Disrupts the Inhibition of Social Gaze in Nonhuman Primates</a></h4>

              
                <p>To competently navigate the world, individuals must flexibly balance distinct aspects of social gaze, orienting toward others and inhibiting orienting responses, depending on the context. These behaviors are often disrupted amongst patient populations treated with serotonergic drugs. However, those in the field lack a clear understanding of how the serotonergic system mediates social orienting and inhibiting behaviors. Here, we tested how increasing central concentrations of serotonin with the direct precursor 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) would modulate the ability of rhesus macaques (both sexes) to use eye movements to flexibly orient to, or inhibit orienting to, faces. Systemic administrations of 5-HTP effectively increased central serotonin levels and impaired flexible orientation and inhibition. Critically, 5-HTP selectively impaired the ability of monkeys to inhibit orienting to face images, whereas it similarly impaired orienting to face and control images. 5-HTP also caused monkeys to perseverate on their gaze responses, making them worse at flexibly switching between orienting and inhibiting behaviors. Furthermore, the effects of 5-HTP on performance correlated with a constriction of the pupil, an increased time to initiate trials, and an increased reaction time, suggesting that the disruptive effects of 5-HTP on social gaze behaviors are likely driven by a downregulation of arousal and motivational states. Together, these findings provide causal evidence for a modulatory relationship between 5-HTP and social gaze behaviors in nonhuman primates and offer translational insights for the role of the serotonergic system in social gaze.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Behavioral changes arising from pharmacological agents that target serotonergic functions are complex and difficult to predict. Here, we examined the causal impacts of administering the direct precursor of serotonin, 5-HTP, on orienting and inhibiting social gaze in nonhuman primates. 5-HTP increased central concentrations of serotonin and selectively impaired the ability of monkeys to inhibit orienting to faces while similarly impairing the ability of monkeys to orient to face and control images. These behavioral gaze impairments were systematically associated with a downregulation of arousal and motivational states, indexed by pupil constriction, increased time to initiate trials, and increased reaction time. These findings provide a causal link between 5-HTP and social gaze behaviors in nonhuman primates and provide translational insights about serotonergic interventions.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Attention Differentially Affects Acoustic and Phonetic Feature Encoding in a Multispeaker Environment</a></h4>

              
                <p>Humans have the remarkable ability to selectively focus on a single talker in the midst of other competing talkers. The neural mechanisms that underlie this phenomenon remain incompletely understood. In particular, there has been longstanding debate over whether attention operates at an early or late stage in the speech processing hierarchy. One way to better understand this is to examine how attention might differentially affect neurophysiological indices of hierarchical acoustic and linguistic speech representations. In this study, we do this by using encoding models to identify neural correlates of speech processing at various levels of representation. Specifically, we recorded EEG from fourteen human subjects (nine female and five male) during a "cocktail party" attention experiment. Model comparisons based on these data revealed phonetic feature processing for attended, but not unattended speech. Furthermore, we show that attention specifically enhances isolated indices of phonetic feature processing, but that such attention effects are not apparent for isolated measures of acoustic processing. These results provide new insights into the effects of attention on different prelexical representations of speech, insights that complement recent anatomic accounts of the hierarchical encoding of attended speech. Furthermore, our findings support the notion that, for attended speech, phonetic features are processed as a distinct stage, separate from the processing of the speech acoustics.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Humans are very good at paying attention to one speaker in an environment with multiple speakers. However, the details of how attended and unattended speech are processed differently by the brain is not completely clear. Here, we explore how attention affects the processing of the acoustic sounds of speech as well as the mapping of those sounds onto categorical phonetic features. We find evidence of categorical phonetic feature processing for attended, but not unattended speech. Furthermore, we find evidence that categorical phonetic feature processing is enhanced by attention, but acoustic processing is not. These findings add an important new layer in our understanding of how the human brain solves the cocktail party problem.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">Feeling of Ownership over an Embodied Avatar's Hand Brings About Fast Changes of Fronto-Parietal Cortical Dynamics</a></h4>

              
                <p>When we look at our body parts, we are immediately aware that they belong to us and we rarely doubt about the integrity, continuity, and sense of ownership of our body. Despite this certainty, immersive virtual reality (IVR) may lead to a strong feeling of embodiment over an artificial body part seen from a first-person perspective (1PP). Although such feeling of ownership (FO) has been described in different situations, it is not yet understood how this phenomenon is generated at neural level. To track the real-time brain dynamics associated with FO, we delivered transcranial magnetic stimuli over the hand region in the primary motor cortex (M1) and simultaneously recorded electroencephalography (EEG) in 19 healthy volunteers (11 male/8 female) watching IVR renderings of anatomically plausible (full-limb) versus implausible (hand disconnected from the forearm) virtual limbs. Our data show that embodying a virtual hand is temporally associated with a rapid drop of cortical activity of the onlookers' hand region in the M1 contralateral to the observed hand. Spatiotemporal analysis shows that embodying the avatar's hand is also associated with fast changes of activity within an interconnected fronto-parietal circuit ipsilateral to the brain stimulation. Specifically, an immediate reduction of connectivity with the premotor area is paralleled by an enhancement in the connectivity with the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) which is related to the strength of ownership illusion ratings and thus likely reflects conscious feelings of embodiment. Our results suggest that changes of bodily representations are underpinned by a dynamic cross talk within a highly-plastic, fronto-parietal network.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Observing an avatar's body part from a first-person perspective (1PP) induces an illusory embodiment over it. What remains unknown are the cortical dynamics underpinning the embodiment of artificial agents. To shed light on the physiological mechanisms of embodiment we used a novel approach that combines noninvasive stimulation of the cortical motor-hand area and whole-scalp electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings in people observing an embodied artificial limb. We found that just before the illusion started, there is a decrease of activity of the motor-hand area accompanied by an increase of connectivity with the parietal region ipsilateral to the stimulation that reflects the ratings of the embodiment illusion. Our results suggest that changes of bodily representations are underpinned by a dynamic cross talk within a fronto-parietal circuit.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/rss/current.xml">GCH1 Deficiency Activates Brain Innate Immune Response and Impairs Tyrosine Hydroxylase Homeostasis</a></h4>

              
                <p>The Parkinson's disease (PD) risk gene GTP cyclohydrolase 1 (GCH1) catalyzes the rate-limiting step in tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) synthesis, an essential cofactor in the synthesis of monoaminergic neurotransmitters. To investigate the mechanisms by which GCH1 deficiency may contribute to PD, we generated a loss of function zebrafish <I>gch1</I> mutant (<I>gch1</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup>), using CRISPR/Cas technology. <I>gch1</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> zebrafish develop marked monoaminergic neurotransmitter deficiencies by 5 d postfertilization (dpf), movement deficits by 8 dpf and lethality by 12 dpf. Tyrosine hydroxylase (Th) protein levels were markedly reduced without loss of ascending dopaminergic (DAergic) neurons. L-DOPA treatment of <I>gch1</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> larvae improved survival without ameliorating the motor phenotype. RNAseq of <I>gch1</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> larval brain tissue identified highly upregulated transcripts involved in innate immune response. Subsequent experiments provided morphologic and functional evidence of microglial activation in <I>gch1</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup>. The results of our study suggest that GCH1 deficiency may unmask early, subclinical parkinsonism and only indirectly contribute to neuronal cell death via immune-mediated mechanisms. Our work highlights the importance of functional validation for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) risk factors and further emphasizes the important role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of PD.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Genome-wide association studies have now identified at least 90 genetic risk factors for sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD). Zebrafish are an ideal tool to determine the mechanistic role of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) risk genes in a vertebrate animal model. The discovery of GTP cyclohydrolase 1 (GCH1) as a genetic risk factor for PD was counterintuitive, GCH1 is the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of dopamine (DA), mutations had previously been described in the non-neurodegenerative movement disorder dopa-responsive dystonia (DRD). Rather than causing DAergic cell death (as previously hypothesized by others), we now demonstrate that GCH1 impairs tyrosine hydroxylase (Th) homeostasis and activates innate immune mechanisms in the brain and provide evidence of microglial activation and phagocytic activity.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Students’ Satisfaction Of Online Learning In Oman [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Due to the development facilitated by modern technology, the world has become a small village with instantly changing methods of education. Online education has become an alternative method for course delivery used by colleges and universities globally.   Methods: The population of this study was N=564 students enrolled in asynchronous online learning at the College of Sharia Sciences in the Sultanate of Oman for the academic year 2020-2021. The survey instruments from “The Student Satisfaction Survey” developed by Strachota (2006) were utilized in this study. The survey included items in the following categories: demographics, learner instructor's interaction, learner-peer interaction, and lastly general satisfaction. The researcher reformulated the questions to suit the target group and some questions were changed to suit the target audience.  Results: Remarkably, the data show that there is no direct relationship between demographic factors and student satisfaction with asynchronous online learning. On the other hand, there is a strong and noticeable relationship between students' satisfaction with asynchronous online learning and student-instructor interaction. There is also a correlation between students' satisfaction with asynchronous online learning and student-peer interaction.   Conclusions: The students of the College of Sharia Sciences are on the whole very satisfied with asynchronous online learning; they consider it a very successful experience and recommend its use by students in other educational institutions.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The effect of betel habits on blood glucose levels in the Karo ethnic community, Karo district [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Betel is a hereditary tradition from the ancestors of the Batak-Karo tribe, Indonesia. Karo people believe that betel is their unifier. The betel process begins with concocting a mixture of ingredients such as betel leaf, lime, gambier, areca nut, and with/without tobacco addition, then chewed slowly. Our previous study showed that gambier extracts (Uncaria gambier Roxb), can reduce blood glucose levels (BGL) in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients. This study aimed to analyze whether the habit of chewing betel can affect BGL in the Karo ethnic community in the Karo district. Methods: In total, 48 participants from the Karo community were divided into 4 groups (n=12 per group), namely: I. non-T2DM participants without betel habits; II. non-T2DM participants with betel habit; III. T2DM participants without betel habit and IV. T2DM participants with betel habit. The sampling technique was consecutive sampling. Data were collected by interviews and blood sampling (fasted and 2 hours postprandial (2hPP)). The collected data were analyzed by ANOVA then post hoc Bonferroni with a significance level of p-value <0.05. Results: This study showed that fasting BGL had no difference in non-T2DM participants without betel habit (group-I) compared to non-T2DM participants with betel habit (group-II) (84.33±12.32 vs 81.00± 4,84), and T2DM participants without betel habit (group-III) compared to T2DM participants with betel habit (group-IV) (196.25± 104.81 vs 150.00 ± 42.45), p>0.05. On the other hand, there was a significant difference in BGL 2hPP in group T2DM participants with betel habit compared to all groups (p<0.05). T2DM participants without betel habit group had the highest BGL levels compared to other groups. Conclusions: This study concluded that the habit of chewing betel containing gambier is effective in restraining the rate of increase in blood glucose levels. Further research is needed to see the mechanism.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">AIME: Autoencoder-based integrative multi-omics data embedding that allows for confounder adjustments</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Tianwei Yu</p>

In the integrative analyses of omics data, it is often of interest to extract data representation from one data type that best reflect its relations with another data type. This task is traditionally fulfilled by linear methods such as canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and partial least squares (PLS). However, information contained in one data type pertaining to the other data type may be complex and in nonlinear form. Deep learning provides a convenient alternative to extract low-dimensional nonlinear data embedding. In addition, the deep learning setup can naturally incorporate the effects of clinical confounding factors into the integrative analysis. Here we report a deep learning setup, named Autoencoder-based Integrative Multi-omics data Embedding (AIME), to extract data representation for omics data integrative analysis. The method can adjust for confounder variables, achieve informative data embedding, rank features in terms of their contributions, and find pairs of features from the two data types that are related to each other through the data embedding. In simulation studies, the method was highly effective in the extraction of major contributing features between data types. Using two real microRNA-gene expression datasets, one with confounder variables and one without, we show that AIME excluded the influence of confounders, and extracted biologically plausible novel information. The R package based on Keras and the TensorFlow backend is available at https://github.com/tianwei-yu/AIME.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Machine learning-driven identification of drugs inhibiting cytochrome P450 2C9</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Elodie Goldwaser, Catherine Laurent, Nathalie Lagarde, Sylvie Fabrega, Laure Nay, Bruno O. Villoutreix, Christian Jelsch, Arnaud B. Nicot, Marie-Anne Loriot, Maria A. Miteva</p>

Cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) is a major drug-metabolizing enzyme that represents 20% of the hepatic CYPs and is responsible for the metabolism of 15% of drugs. A general concern in drug discovery is to avoid the inhibition of CYP leading to toxic drug accumulation and adverse drug–drug interactions. However, the prediction of CYP inhibition remains challenging due to its complexity. We developed an original machine learning approach for the prediction of drug-like molecules inhibiting CYP2C9. We created new predictive models by integrating CYP2C9 protein structure and dynamics knowledge, an original selection of physicochemical properties of CYP2C9 inhibitors, and machine learning modeling. We tested the machine learning models on publicly available data and demonstrated that our models successfully predicted CYP2C9 inhibitors with an accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of approximately 80%. We experimentally validated the developed approach and provided the first identification of the drugs vatalanib, piriqualone, ticagrelor and cloperidone as strong inhibitors of CYP2C9 with IC values <18 μM and sertindole, asapiprant, duvelisib and dasatinib as moderate inhibitors with IC50 values between 40 and 85 μM. Vatalanib was identified as the strongest inhibitor with an IC50 value of 0.067 μM. Metabolism assays allowed the characterization of specific metabolites of abemaciclib, cloperidone, vatalanib and tarafenacin produced by CYP2C9. The obtained results demonstrate that such a strategy could improve the prediction of drug-drug interactions in clinical practice and could be utilized to prioritize drug candidates in drug discovery pipelines.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Dose-dependent thresholds of dexamethasone destabilize CAR T-cell treatment efficacy</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Alexander B. Brummer, Xin Yang, Eric Ma, Margarita Gutova, Christine E. Brown, Russell C. Rockne</p>

Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy is potentially an effective targeted immunotherapy for glioblastoma, yet there is presently little known about the efficacy of CAR T-cell treatment when combined with the widely used anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressant glucocorticoid, dexamethasone. Here we present a mathematical model-based analysis of three patient-derived glioblastoma cell lines treated <i>in vitro</i> with CAR T-cells and dexamethasone. Advanced <i>in vitro</i> experimental cell killing assay technologies allow for highly resolved temporal dynamics of tumor cells treated with CAR T-cells and dexamethasone, making this a valuable model system for studying the rich dynamics of nonlinear biological processes with translational applications. We model the system as a nonautonomous, two-species predator-prey interaction of tumor cells and CAR T-cells, with explicit time-dependence in the clearance rate of dexamethasone. Using time as a bifurcation parameter, we show that (1) dexamethasone destabilizes coexistence equilibria between CAR T-cells and tumor cells in a dose-dependent manner and (2) as dexamethasone is cleared from the system, a stable coexistence equilibrium returns in the form of a Hopf bifurcation. With the model fit to experimental data, we demonstrate that high concentrations of dexamethasone antagonizes CAR T-cell efficacy by exhausting, or reducing the activity of CAR T-cells, and by promoting tumor cell growth. Finally, we identify a critical threshold in the ratio of CAR T-cell death to CAR T-cell proliferation rates that predicts eventual treatment success or failure that may be used to guide the dose and timing of CAR T-cell therapy in the presence of dexamethasone in patients.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Glial immune-related pathways mediate effects of closed head traumatic brain injury on behavior and lethality in Drosophila</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Bart van Alphen, Samuel Stewart, Marta Iwanaszko, Fangke Xu, Keyin Li, Sydney Rozenfeld, Anujaianthi Ramakrishnan, Taichi Q. Itoh, Shiju Sisobhan, Zuoheng Qin, Bridget C. Lear, Ravi Allada</p>

In traumatic brain injury (TBI), the initial injury phase is followed by a secondary phase that contributes to neurodegeneration, yet the mechanisms leading to neuropathology in vivo remain to be elucidated. To address this question, we developed a <i>Drosophila</i> head-specific model for TBI termed <i>Drosophila</i> Closed Head Injury (dCHI), where well-controlled, nonpenetrating strikes are delivered to the head of unanesthetized flies. This assay recapitulates many TBI phenotypes, including increased mortality, impaired motor control, fragmented sleep, and increased neuronal cell death. TBI results in significant changes in the transcriptome, including up-regulation of genes encoding antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). To test the in vivo functional role of these changes, we examined TBI-dependent behavior and lethality in mutants of the master immune regulator NF-κB, important for AMP induction, and found that while sleep and motor function effects were reduced, lethality effects were enhanced. Similarly, loss of most AMP classes also renders flies susceptible to lethal TBI effects. These studies validate a new <i>Drosophila</i> TBI model and identify immune pathways as in vivo mediators of TBI effects.

                Introduction: The impact of PM2.5 ambient air pollution exposure on morbimortality has been documented; however, for Latin American cities, there are no calculations of the economic burden. The objective of the study was to estimate the costs of attributable burden disease to PM2.5 ambient air pollution exposure in Medellín, Colombia. Methods: The costs were assessed using the cost-of-illness approach and the human capital approach, which include direct medical costs and indirect costs due to loss of productivity. To estimate the value of the lost years of production the salaries established in the Great Integrated Household Survey carried out in September 2016 by the National Administrative Department of Statistics of Colombia were used. The PYWL were calculated taking as a reference the 57 years to age of death for female and 62 years for male. For both, an alternative scenario was proposed to account for the cost of working years by changing the reference age to 80 years. Results: A total of 5540 potential years of working life lost due to premature deaths attributed to exposure to PM2.5 was calculated. The costs of attributable morbimortality to PM2.5 exposure in Medellín totaled 86,0 million dollars in baseline scenario and 281,2 million dollars in alternative scenario. Which represented 0.091% of the gross domestic product of Colombia and 0.627% of that from the Department of Antioquia. The highest percentage of the costs associated with the loss of productivity originated in the premature death of the population over 50 years of age, both due to chronic and acute events. Discussion: The costs of mortality represented 80% of the total. PM2.5 ambient air pollution exposure generates significant costs associated with the loss of years of working life, due to acute infections and chronic diseases of respiratory tract and ischemic heart diseases

                The Regional Student Group Turkey (RSG-Turkey) is officially associated with the International Society for Computational Biology (ISCB) Student Council (SC). At the RSG-Turkey, we aim to contribute to the early-career researchers in computational biology and bioinformatics fields by providing opportunities for improving their academic and technical skills in the field. Over the last ten years, we have built a well-known student-driven academic society in Turkey that organizes numerous events every year and continues to grow with over 650 current members. Celebrating the 10th anniversary of RSG-Turkey, in this communication, we share our experiences, five main lessons we learned, and the steps to establish a long-standing academic community: having a clear mission, building a robust structure, effective communication, turning challenges into opportunities, and building collaborations. We believe that our experiences can help students and academics establish long-standing communities in fast-developing areas like bioinformatics.

                Background: Holter electrocardiogram (ECG) is the gold standard for ambulatory monitoring of atrial fibrillation (AF) but it is insufficient because of its limited recording time. A wearable ECG with a medical-grade dry textile electrode is a promising technology to remedy this limitation. This pilot study aimed to simultaneously compare the wearable and Holter ECGs for ambulatory monitoring in a clinical setting. Methods: This prospective observational study enrolled 18 patients who underwent AF ablation. One day after AF ablation, ambulatory ECG was obtained for three hours simultaneously using both the wearable and Holter ECG devices. Automatic ECG interpretations between devices were compared with correlation and agreement analyses. Results: Simultaneous ECG monitoring demonstrated a comparable analysis time and total heart beats between the two devices. Almost complete correlation and agreement were also demonstrated in all clinically relevant testing aspects except in R-wave amplitude (r = 0.743, p < .001). AF was detected in three patients. AF duration was the same in both ECG devices in two patients with continuous AF. In the remaining patient with intermittent AF, AF duration was shortened by 0.6% with the wearable ECG as compared to that with the Holter ECG. Conclusions: Simultaneous ECG comparison revealed a high consistency between the wearable and Holter ECG devices. The results of this study warrant further clinical studies for long-term monitoring of ambulatory ECG after AF ablation.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Sonification of weather data as a non-human-centric artistic approach [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background - In the mid-20th century, the emergence of sound studies demonstrated a shift of research interest in sonic practitioners. This field gains its prevalence by expanding the boundaries of prevailing conception through proposing alternative creative approaches in sound art practices. Methods – Two methods were presented – listening and sounding to promote creative sound making. The first method, listening involves soundwalking and recording sound from the external environments. These recordings were then re-evaluated and post-processed in audio editing software. The second method, sounding involves the creation of a weather data sonification system in Pure Data environment, in which the perceptual experience from the first method was taken into consideration. Result – First method enables the genesis of creative idiosyncrasies, such as preferences and ideas through the sonic perception of environmental events. In this process, noise and weather were identified as environmental components that share similar sensible qualities. Thus, noise is a prevalent medium that inspires the creation of sound generators in the sonification system presented in this paper. The sonic output of data sonification reveals an analogical connection between weather data and sonic parameters, in which changes in data values result in changes in acoustic properties. These outputs deliver different sensibilities based on their data parameters; sonification of temperature data might suggest an alarming effect to the listener. Conclusion – The proposed methods were intricately linked, suggesting environmental events to be perceived and realized through a non-scientific perspective. By highlighting aesthetic possibilities of environmental components, this paper presents an alternative perspective in contrast with the human-centric worldview through the creation of sonic works.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">‘The great publication race’ vs ‘abandon paper counting’: Benchmarking ECR publication and co-authorship rates over past 50 years to inform research evaluation [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Publication and co-authorship rates have been increasing over decades. In response, calls are being made to restrict the number of publications included in research evaluations. Yet there is little evidence to guide publication expectations and inform research evaluation for early career researchers (ECRs). Methods: Here we examine the early career publication and co-authorship records between 1970 and 2019 of >140,000 authors of 2.8 million publications, to identify how publication and co-authorship rates have changed over the last 50 years. This examination is conducted in order to develop benchmarks of median publication rates for sensibly evaluating ECR research productivity, and to explore success in meeting these benchmarks with different co-authorship strategies using regression models. Results: Publication rates of multidisciplinary ECRs publishing in Nature, Science and PNAS have increased by 46% over the last 50 years and that publications rates in a set of disciplinary journals have increased by 105%. Co-authorship rates have increased even more, particularly for the multidisciplinary sample which now has 572% more co-authors per publication. Benchmarks based on median publication rates for all authors increased from one publication per year at the start of a career, to four publications per year after 10 years of publishing, and one first-author publication across all years. The probability of meeting these benchmarks increases when authors publish with different co-authors, and first authorship rates decrease for ECRs with many co-authors per publication. Conclusion: This evidence could be used to inform sensible publishing expectations for ECRs and the institutions they work for, and to inform calls to limit the number of publications produced by researchers and those used in research evaluations.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Personality typologies of smokers and excessive drinkers: a cross-sectional survey of respondents in the BBC Lab UK Study [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Several personality traits have been linked to addictive behaviours, including smoking and excessive drinking. We hypothesised that the combination of low conscientiousness, high extraversion and high neuroticism would be synergistically associated with smoking, excessive drinking and both behaviours combined. Methods: Respondents aged 16+ years (N=363,454) were surveyed between 2009-2013 as part of the BBC Lab UK Study, with no restrictions on geographical location. Respondents provided information about sociodemographic characteristics, personality traits, and smoking and alcohol consumption. A series of multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted. Results: No significant three-way but significant two-way interactive effects were observed. The association of high extraversion with smoking was more pronounced in those with high (vs. low) conscientiousness (ORadj=1.51, 95% CI=1.46, 1.56, p<.001; ORadj=1.38, 95% CI=1.35, 1.42, p<.001). The association of high extraversion with excessive drinking was more pronounced in those with low (vs. high) conscientiousness (ORadj=1.70, 95% CI=1.67, 1.74, p<.001; ORadj=1.60, 95% CI=1.56, 1.63, p<.001). The association of high extraversion with both behaviours combined was more pronounced in those with high (vs. low) conscientiousness (ORadj=1.74, 95% CI=1.65, 1.83, p<.001; ORadj=1.62, 95% CI= 1.56, 1.68, p<.001). Results remained largely robust in sensitivity analyses. Conclusions: In a large international survey, we identified two-way ‘personality typologies’ that are associated with greater odds of smoking, excessive drinking and both behaviours combined. The results may be useful for the tailoring of behaviour change interventions to at-risk individuals.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Parkinson Disease and Subthalamic Nucleus Deep Brain Stimulation: Cognitive Effects in GBA Mutation Carriers</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study was undertaken to compare the rate of change in cognition between glucocerebrosidase (<i>GBA</i>) mutation carriers and noncarriers with and without subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) in Parkinson disease.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Clinical and genetic data from 12 datasets were examined. Global cognition was assessed using the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (MDRS). Subjects were examined for mutations in <i>GBA</i> and categorized as <i>GBA</i> carriers with or without DBS (<i>GBA</i>+DBS+, <i>GBA</i>+DBS-), and noncarriers with or without DBS (<i>GBA</i>-DBS+, <i>GBA</i>-DBS-). <i>GBA</i> mutation carriers were subcategorized according to mutation severity (risk variant, mild, severe). Linear mixed modeling was used to compare rate of change in MDRS scores over time among the groups according to <i>GBA</i> and DBS status and then according to <i>GBA</i> severity and DBS status.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Data were available for 366 subjects (58 <i>GBA</i>+DBS+, 82 <i>GBA</i>+DBS-, 98 <i>GBA</i>-DBS+, and 128 <i>GBA</i>-DBS- subjects), who were longitudinally followed (range = 36–60 months after surgery). Using the MDRS, <i>GBA</i>+DBS+ subjects declined on average 2.02 points/yr more than <i>GBA</i>-DBS- subjects (95% confidence interval [CI] = −2.35 to −1.69), 1.71 points/yr more than <i>GBA</i>+DBS- subjects (95% CI = −2.14 to −1.28), and 1.49 points/yr more than <i>GBA</i>-DBS+ subjects (95% CI = −1.80 to −1.18).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Although not randomized, this composite analysis suggests that the combined effects of <i>GBA</i> mutations and STN-DBS negatively impact cognition. We advise that DBS candidates be screened for <i>GBA</i> mutations as part of the presurgical decision-making process. We advise that <i>GBA</i> mutation carriers be counseled regarding potential risks associated with STN-DBS so that alternative options may be considered. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

                How do brains represent multiple tasks? The authors use artificial neural networks to derive a computational theory of neural coding and validate its predictions in recordings of human and macaque brains. The findings suggest that task-specific information is represented along orthogonal coding axes, which minimizes interference and maximizes robustness to noise.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Predicting bacterial promoter function and evolution from random sequences</a></h4>

              
                Predicting function from sequence is a central problem of biology. Currently, this is possible only locally in a narrow mutational neighborhood around a wildtype sequence rather than globally from any sequence. Using random mutant libraries, we developed a biophysical model that accounts for multiple features of σ<sup>70</sup> binding bacterial promoters to predict constitutive gene expression levels from any sequence. We experimentally and theoretically estimated that 10–20% of random sequences lead to expression and ~80% of non-expressing sequences are one mutation away from a functional promoter. The potential for generating expression from random sequences is so pervasive that selection acts against σ<sup>70</sup>-RNA polymerase binding sites even within inter-genic, promoter-containing regions. This pervasiveness of σ<sup>70</sup>-binding sites implies that emergence of promoters is not the limiting step in gene regulatory evolution. Ultimately, the inclusion of novel features of promoter function into a mechanistic model enabled not only more accurate predictions of gene expression levels, but also identified that promoters evolve more rapidly than previously thought.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Simultaneous brain, brainstem and spinal cord pharmacological-fMRI reveals involvement of an endogenous opioid network in attentional analgesia</a></h4>

              
                Pain perception is decreased by shifting attentional focus away from a threatening event. This attentional analgesia engages parallel descending control pathways from anterior cingulate (ACC) to locus coeruleus, and ACC to periaqueductal grey (PAG) - rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM), indicating possible roles for noradrenergic or opioidergic neuromodulators. To determine which pathway modulates nociceptive activity in humans we used simultaneous whole brain-spinal cord pharmacological-fMRI (N=39) across three sessions. Noxious thermal forearm stimulation generated somatotopic-activation of dorsal horn (DH) whose activity correlated with pain report and mirrored attentional pain modulation. Activity in an adjacent cluster reported the interaction between task and noxious stimulus. Effective connectivity analysis revealed that ACC interacts with PAG and RVM to modulate spinal cord activity. Blocking endogenous opioids with Naltrexone impairs attentional analgesia and disrupts RVM-spinal and ACC-PAG connectivity. Noradrenergic augmentation with Reboxetine did not alter attentional analgesia. Cognitive pain modulation involves opioidergic ACC-PAG-RVM descending control which suppresses spinal nociceptive activity.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Juxtacellular opto-tagging of hippocampal CA1 neurons in freely moving mice</a></h4>

              
                Neural circuits are made of a vast diversity of neuronal cell types. While immense progress has been made in classifying neurons based on morphological, molecular, and functional properties, understanding how this heterogeneity contributes to brain function during natural behavior has remained largely unresolved. In the present study, we combined the juxtacellular recording and labeling technique with optogenetics in freely moving mice. This allowed us to selectively target molecularly defined cell classes for in vivo single-cell recordings and morphological analysis. We validated this strategy in the CA1 region of the mouse hippocampus by restricting Channelrhodopsin expression to Calbindin-positive neurons. Directly versus indirectly light-activated neurons could be readily distinguished based on the latencies of light-evoked spikes, with juxtacellular labeling and post hoc histological analysis providing ‘ground-truth’ validation. Using these opto-juxtacellular procedures in freely moving mice, we found that Calbindin-positive CA1 pyramidal cells were weakly spatially modulated and conveyed less spatial information than Calbindin-negative neurons – pointing to pyramidal cell identity as a key determinant for neuronal recruitment into the hippocampal spatial map. Thus, our method complements current in vivo techniques by enabling optogenetic-assisted structure–function analysis of single neurons recorded during natural, unrestrained behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Clp protease and antisense RNA jointly regulate the global regulator CarD to mediate mycobacterial starvation response</a></h4>

              
                Under starvation conditions, bacteria tend to slow down their translation rate by reducing rRNA synthesis, but the way they accomplish that may vary in different bacteria. In <i>Mycobacterium</i> species, transcription of rRNA is activated by the RNA polymerase (RNAP) accessory transcription factor CarD, which interacts directly with RNAP to stabilize the RNAP-promoter open complex formed on rRNA genes. The functions of CarD have been extensively studied, but the mechanisms that control its expression remain obscure. Here, we report that the level of CarD was tightly regulated when mycobacterial cells switched from nutrient-rich to nutrient-deprived conditions. At the translational level, an antisense RNA of <i>carD</i> (AscarD) was induced in a SigF-dependent manner to bind with <i>carD</i> mRNA and inhibit CarD translation, while at the post-translational level, the residual intracellular CarD was quickly degraded by the Clp protease. AscarD thus worked synergistically with Clp protease to decrease the CarD level to help mycobacterial cells cope with the nutritional stress. Altogether, our work elucidates the regulation mode of CarD and delineates a new mechanism for the mycobacterial starvation response, which is important for the adaptation and persistence of mycobacterial pathogens in the host environment.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Binocular visual experience and sleep promote visual cortex plasticity and restore binocular vision in a mouse model of amblyopia</a></h4>

              
                Amblyopia arises from an altered balance of input from the two eyes to the binocular zone of primary visual cortex (bV1) during childhood, causing long-lasting visual impairment. Amblyopia is commonly treated by patching the dominant eye, however, the relative impacts of monocular vs. binocular visual experiences on restoration of bV1 function remains unclear. Moreover, while sleep has been implicated in V1 plasticity in response to vision loss, its role in recovery from amblyopia is unknown. We used monocular deprivation (MD) in juvenile mice to model amblyopia in bV1. We compared recovery of visual responses for the two eyes among bV1 regular spiking (RS, putative principal) neurons and fast-spiking (FS, putative parvalbumin-expressing [PV+]) interneurons after identical-duration, identical-quality binocular recovery (BR) or monocular, reverse occlusion (RO) experiences. We find that BR is quantitatively superior to RO with respect to renormalizing both bV1 populations visual responses. However, this recovery was seen only in freely-sleeping mice; post-BR sleep deprivation prevented functional recovery. Thus, both binocular visual experience and subsequent sleep are required to optimally renormalize bV1 responses in a mouse model of amblyopia.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Abnormal CCK/CB1R axon targeting in mouse models of dystroglycanopathy</a></h4>

              
                Dystroglycan (Dag1) is a cell adhesion molecule that links the extracellular matrix to the actin cytoskeleton, and is critical for normal muscle and brain development. Mutations in Dag1 or the genes required for its functional glycosylation result in dystroglycanopathy, which is characterized by a wide range of phenotypes including muscle weakness, brain defects, and cognitive impairments. Whereas Dystroglycans role in muscle and early brain development are well defined, much less is known about its role at later stages of neural circuit development including synapse formation and refinement. Recent work has found that selective deletion of Dag1 from pyramidal neurons leads to a loss of presynaptic CCK+ inhibitory neurons (INs) early in development. In this study, we investigated how IN development is affected in multiple mouse models of dystroglycanopathy. Widespread forebrain deletion of Dag1 or Pomt2, which is required for Dystroglycan glycosylation, recapitulates brain phenotypes seen in severe forms of dystroglycanopathy. CCK+ INs were present in Dag1 and Pomt2 mutant mice, but their axons failed to properly target the somatodendritic compartment of pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus. In contrast, CCK+ IN axon targeting was largely normal in mouse models of mild dystroglycanopathy with partially reduced Dystroglycan glycosylation (B4Gat1,Fkrp). Furthermore, the intracellular domain of Dystroglycan appears to be dispensable for CCK+ IN axon targeting. Collectively, these data show that synaptic defects are a hallmark of severe dystroglycanopathy.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cognitive Deficits and Altered Cholinergic Innervation in Young Adult Mice Carrying a Parkinson's Disease LRRK2-G2019S Knockin Mutation</a></h4>

              
                Impaired executive function is a common and debilitating non-motor symptom of idiopathic and hereditary Parkinson's disease (PD), but there is little understanding of the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms and circuits. The G2019S mutation in the kinase domain of leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) greatly increases risk for late-onset PD, and non-manifesting LRRK2-G2019S carriers also exhibit early and significant cognitive impairment. Here, we subjected young adult mice carrying a Lrrk2-G2019S knockin mutation to touchscreen-based operant tasks that measure attention, goal-directed learning and cognitive flexibility, all of which rely on prefrontal-striatal connectivity and are strongly modulated by cholinergic innervation. In a visuospatial attention task, mutant mice exhibited significantly more omissions and longer response latencies than controls that could not be attributed to deficits in motivation, visual sensory perception per se or locomotion, thereby suggesting impairment in divided attention and slower information processing speed. Pretreating mice with the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor donepezil normalized both higher omission rates and longer reward latencies in the mutants, but did not affect any performance metric in controls. Strikingly, cholinergic fiber density in mPFC and dorsomedial striatum was significantly sparser in mutants than in controls, while further behavioral interrogation of the mutants revealed significant impairments in action-outcome associations but preserved cognitive flexibility. These data suggest that the G2019S mutation impacts cholinergic innervation and impairs corticostriatal network function in young adulthood that may contribute to early PD-associated cognitive deficits.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">CGRP Administration into the Cerebellum Evokes Migraine-like Behaviors Predominately in Female Mice</a></h4>

              
                The neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a major player in migraine pathophysiology. Previous preclinical studies demonstrated that intracerebroventricular administration of CGRP caused migraine-like behaviors in mice, but the sites of action in the brain remain unidentified. The cerebellum has the most CGRP binding sites in the central nervous system and is increasingly recognized as both a sensory and motor integration center. The objective of this study was to test whether the cerebellum, particularly the medial cerebellar nuclei (MN), might be a site of CGRP action. In this study, CGRP was directly injected into the right MN of C57BL/6J mice via a cannula. A battery of behavioral tests was done to assess migraine-like behaviors. CGRP caused light aversion measured as decreased time in the light zone even with dim light. The mice also spent more time resting in the dark zone, but not the light, along with decreased rearing and transitions between zones. These behaviors were similar for both sexes. In contrast, significant responses to CGRP were seen only with female mice in the open field assay, von Frey test, and automated squint assay, indicating anxiety, tactile hypersensitivity, and spontaneous pain, respectively. In male mice, the responses had the same trend as females but did not reach statistical significance. No detectable effect of CGRP on gait was observed in either sex. These results suggest that CGRP in the MN causes light aversion in males, while in females, light aversion is accompanied by increased anxiety, tactile hypersensitivity, and spontaneous pain. A caveat is that we cannot exclude contributions from other cerebellar regions in addition to the MN due to diffusion of the injected peptide. These results reveal the cerebellum as a new site of CGRP actions that may contribute to migraine pathophysiology and possibly its prevalence in females.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">No evidence from complementary data sources of a direct projection from the mouse anterior cingulate area to the hippocampal formation</a></h4>

              
                The connectivity and interplay between the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus underpin a number of key cognitive processes, with changes in these interactions being implicated in both neurodevelopmental as well as neurodegenerative conditions. Understanding the precise cellular connections through which this circuit is organised is, therefore, vital for understanding these same processes. Overturning earlier findings, a recent study described a novel excitatory projection from anterior cingulate cortex to hippocampus. We sought to validate this unexpected finding using multiple, complementary methods: anterograde and retrograde anatomical tracing, using both anterograde and retrograde AAVs and monosynaptic rabies tracing. Additionally, an extensive data search of the Allen Projection Brain Atlas database was conducted to find the stated projection within any of the deposited anatomical studies, as an independent verification of our own results. However, we failed to find any evidence of a direct, monosynaptic projection from mouse anterior cingulate cortex to the hippocampus proper.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The role of the orbitofrontal cortex in creating cognitive maps</a></h4>

              
                We use internal models of the external world to guide behavior, but little is known about how these cognitive maps are created. The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is typically thought to access these maps to support model-based decision-making, but it has recently been proposed that its critical contribution may be instead to integrate information into existing and new models. We tested between these alternatives using an outcome-specific devaluation task and a high-potency chemogenetic approach. We found that selectively inactivating OFC principal neurons when rats learned distinct cue-outcome associations, but prior to outcome devaluation, disrupted subsequent model-based inference, confirming that the OFC is critical for creating new cognitive maps. However, OFC inactivation surprisingly led to generalized devaluation. Using a novel reinforcement learning framework, we demonstrate that this effect is best explained not by a switch to a model-free system, as would be traditionally assumed, but rather by a circumscribed deficit in defining credit assignment precision during model construction. We conclude that the critical contribution of the OFC to learning is regulating the specificity of associations that comprise cognitive maps.

	<p>Stroke is one of the leading causes of human disability globally. Motor function deficits resulting from a stroke affect the entire body, but relatively often it is the upper limbs that remain ineffective, which is very limiting in everyday life activities. The finding in neurorehabilitation that trunk control contributes to upper limb function is relatively common but has not been confirmed in clinical trials. This observational prospective study aims to analyze the effect of the position of the trunk and the affected upper limb on the coordination and grip strength of the affected dominant and non-dominant hand and wrist in people after ischemic stroke. The research was carried out at the Department of Neurological Rehabilitation, on a group of 60 patients with acute ischemic stroke. A Hand Tutor device and a hand dynamometer were used for the main measurements of the motor coordination parameters (maximum range of motion, frequency of movement) and the grip strength of the dominant and non-dominant upper limb. The patients were examined in two positions: sitting without back support and lying on the back with stabilization of the upper limb. Higher and relevant results were observed in the non-dominant hand, in the supine position in terms of motor coordination parameters of the fingers (p = 0.019; p = 0.011) and wrist (p = 0.033), and grip strength (p = 0.017). Conclusions: The laying position and stabilization of the affected upper limb in the acute phase following ischemic stroke is more beneficial for the coordination of movements and grip strength of the non-dominant hand.</p>

	<p>Background: The study provides real-world data on the impact of Huntington&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (HD) from the perspective of individuals with HD (IHD) and care partners (HD-CP) and contextualizes these results relative to Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) and the general population (GP). Methods: Cross-sectional survey of IHD and HD-CP in the US (July 2019&amp;amp;ndash;August 2019) conducted using the Rare Patient Voice panel. Data for individuals with Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease (IPD), the general population (GP), and respective care partners (PD-CP; GP-CP) came from the 2018 US National Health and Wellness Survey. Outcomes included demographics, mental health, clinical characteristics, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Results: IHD had greater comorbid anxiety (IHD = 51.2%, IPD = 28.8%, GP = 2.0%), and HD-CP had greater comorbid anxiety (HD-CP = 52.5%, PD-CP = 28.6%, GP-CP = 19.6%) and depression (HD-CP = 65.0%, PD-CP = 29.9%, GP-CP = 19.6%), relative to other cohorts (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Respective of their GP cohorts, IHD exhibited lower HRQoL (EQ-5D: 0.66 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.21 vs. 0.81 &amp;amp;plusmn; 0.17) and greater depression (PHQ-9: 11.59 &amp;amp;plusmn; 7.20 vs. 5.85 &amp;amp;plusmn; 6.71), whereas HD-CP exhibited greater depression only (PHQ-9: 6.84 &amp;amp;plusmn; 6.38 vs. 4.15 &amp;amp;plusmn; 5.58) (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). No differences were observed between HD/HD-CP and PD/PD-CP cohorts on PHQ-9 or HRQoL. Conclusions: HD has a significant burden on patients and care partners, which is higher than GP. Notably, anxiety and depression were greater among HD vs. PD, despite similar HRQoL.</p>

	<p>Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is caused by the rupture of blood vessels in the brain. The excessive activation of glial cells and the infiltration of numerous inflammatory cells are observed during bleeding. Thrombin is a key molecule that triggers neuroinflammation in the ICH brain. In this study, we focused on lipoxin A4 (LXA4), an arachidonic acid metabolite that has been reported to suppress inflammation and cell migration. LXA4 and BML-111, an agonist of the LXA4 receptor/formyl peptide receptor 2 (ALX/FPR2), suppressed microglial activation; LXA4 strongly inhibited the migration of neutrophil-like cells in vitro. ALX/FPR2 was expressed on neutrophils in the ICH mouse brain and the daily administration of BML-111 attenuated the motor coordination dysfunction and suppressed the production of proinflammatory cytokines in the ICH mouse brain. On the other hand, BML-111 did not show a significant reduction in the number of microglia and neutrophils. These results suggest that systemic administration of ALX/FPR2 agonists may suppress the neuroinflammatory response of microglia and neutrophils without a change in cell numbers. Additionally, their combination with molecules that reduce cell numbers, such as modulators of leukotriene B4 signaling, may be required in future studies.</p>

	<p>Infection can be a common complication following bifrontal craniotomy with skull base osteotomies given the potential violation of sinuses and entry into the nasal structures. Our objective was to examine our series of patients who underwent a bifrontal craniotomy with skull base osteotomies and describe the infection rate. We propose the bifrontal osteoplastic flap as an adjunct to infection prevention. A retrospective single-center study of a patient database was performed. Twenty patients were identified. Fifty-five percent were male. The mean age was 55.7 &amp;amp;plusmn; 13.9 years. The most common indications for surgery were esthesioneuroblastomas (35%) and anterior skull base meningiomas (30%). Six patients (30%) developed an infection, 1 patient (5%) developed a CSF leak, and no patients developed a mucocele. All 6 infected cases had nasal pathology with intracranial extension, they all received chemoradiation post-operatively and were all combined cases with otorhinolaryngology. Eighty-three percent of these patients required a craniectomy and all of them required long-term IV antibiotics. Infection is not uncommon after a bifrontal craniotomy with skull base osteotomies and the use of the bifrontal osteoplastic flap in cases where the risk of infection is high, i.e., esthesioneuroblastomas surgery, may help reduce said risk and lead to better patient outcomes.</p>

	<p>Background: Whether gender differences exist in late-onset of Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (LOAD) treated with cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) is not fully understood. This study investigated demographic and pharmacological characteristics in LOAD patients to determine gender differences in LOAD patients treated with ChEIs alone and ChEIs with other medications. Methods: This 5-year retrospective data analysis included 9290 LOAD AD patients with 2949 men patients and 6341 women. Potential predictors of demographic and pharmacological characteristics associated gender differences in patients treated with and without ChEIs therapy were determined using univariate analysis, while multivariable models adjusted for demographic and pharmacological variables. Results: In the adjusted analysis, men patients with LOAD that presented with a history of alcohol use (ETOH) (OR = 1.339, 95% CI, 1.072&amp;amp;ndash;1.672, p = 0.010), treated with second generation antipsychotics (SGAs) (OR = 1.271, 95% CI, 1.003&amp;amp;ndash;1.610, p = 0.047), citalopram (OR = 5.103, 95% CI, 3.423&amp;amp;ndash;7.607, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), memantine (OR = 4.409, 95% CI, 3.704&amp;amp;ndash;5.249, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), and buspirone (OR = 2.166, 95% CI, 1.437&amp;amp;ndash;3.264, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) were more likely to receive ChEIs therapy, whereas older men were less likely to be treated with ChEIs therapy. Women who were African Americans (OR = 1.387, 95% CI, 1.168&amp;amp;ndash;1.647, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), that received memantine (OR = 3.412, 95% CI, 3.034&amp;amp;ndash;3.837, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRIs) (OR = 1.143, 95% CI, 1.016&amp;amp;ndash;1.287, p = 0.026), and a history of ETOH (OR = 2.109, 95% CI, 1.724&amp;amp;ndash;2.580, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001) were more likely to receive ChEIs therapy, whereas older women were less likely to receive ChEIs therapy. Conclusion: In both men and women patients, those with increasing age were less likely to be treated with ChEI therapy, while patients treated with memantine were also likely to receive ChEI therapy. Our findings highlight the importance for clinicians to optimize ChEI in LOAD to improve treatment effectiveness and eliminate gender differences in ChEI therapy.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Mechanism of miR-132-3p Promoting Neuroinflammation and Dopaminergic Neurodegeneration in Parkinsons Disease</a></h4>

              
                <p>The major pathology in Parkinson&rsquo;s disease (PD) is neuron injury induced by degeneration of dopaminergic neurons and the activation of microglial cells. The objective of this study is to determine the effect and mechanism of miR-132-3p in regulating neuroinflammation and the degeneration of dopaminergic neuron in PD. The expressions of miR-132-3p in brain tissues of PD patients, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced BV-2 cells and 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD mouse models were detected. The effect of miR-132-3p and GLRX in cell viability, apoptosis and inflammation was verified in BV-2 cells. The activation of Iba1 in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and the loss of tyrosine hydroxylase were detected in PD mouse models and the mobility of mouse models was assessed as well. The targeting relationship between miR-132-3p and GLRX was confirmed by RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) and dual luciferase reporter gene assay. Elevated expression of miR-132-3p and decreased expression of GLRX were found in PD patients and cells models. Overexpression of miR-132-3p can induce activation of microglial cells, which can be reversed by GLRX overexpression. Collected evidence in both cell model and mouse models showed the effect of miR-132-3p in enhancing the activation of microglial cells and the loss of microglia cells, which was achieved by mediating GLRX.</p>

                Mass spectrometry imaging is a promising tool complement to the histology study for evaluation of presence of different tissue types in the sample. To make this method faster, more accurate and precise we have presented earlier the cosine similarity measure maps (CSMM). The method provides the spatial distribution of cosine similarity measure metrics between chosen MSI pixel and the rest of the image. In cases when samples under test are heterogeneous and not guaranteed to have clear clusters with distinct borders, it is interesting to analyze the heterogeneity, area borders and their sensitivity to reference CSMM pixel selection. Here we present the software for interactive building of CSMM for different parameters, their visual analysis and saving such CSMM in publication-ready quality without additional programming. Source code, example datasets, binaries, and other information are available at https://github.com/EvgenyZhvansky/Interactive_CSMM.

                Cow's milk is currently the most consumed product worldwide. However, due to various direct and indirect contamination sources, different chemical and microbiological contaminants have been found in cow's milk. This review details the main contaminants found in cow's milk, referring to the sources of contamination and their impact on human health. A comparative approach highlights the poor efficacy and effects of the pasteurization process with other methods used in the treatment of cow's milk. Despite pasteurization and related techniques being the most widely applied to date, they have not demonstrated efficacy in eliminating contaminants. New technologies have appeared as alternative treatments to pasteurization. However, in addition to causing physicochemical changes in the raw material, their efficacy is not total in eliminating chemical contaminants, suggesting the need for new research to find a solution that contributes to improving food safety.

     alt="High associative neuron numbers could drive cognitive performance in corvid species"/>
<p>Corvids possess cognitive skills, matching those of nonhuman primates. Here we investigated the number of neurons and their distribution over six telencephalic areas in three corvid and three non-corvid species to check, if higher amounts of neurons in associative areas could drive cognitive performance in corvids. Indeed, neuron numbers in the associative mesopallium and nidopallium were twice as high in corvids in comparison to non-corvids possibly contributing to cognitive flexibility and complexity in these species.

</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Corvids possess cognitive skills, matching those of nonhuman primates. However, how these species with their small brains achieve such feats remains elusive. Recent studies suggest that cognitive capabilities could be based on the total numbers of telencephalic neurons. Here we extend this hypothesis further and posit that especially high neuron counts in associative pallial areas drive flexible, complex cognition. If true, avian species like corvids should specifically accumulate neurons in the avian associative areas meso- and nidopallium. To test the hypothesis, we analyzed the neuronal composition of telencephalic areas in corvids and noncorvids (chicken, pigeons, and ostriches—the species with the largest bird brain). The overall number of pallial neurons in corvids was much higher than in chicken and pigeons and comparable to those of ostriches. However, neuron numbers in the associative mesopallium and nidopallium were twice as high in corvids and, in correlation with these associative areas, the corvid subpallium also contained high neuron numbers. These findings support our hypothesis that large absolute numbers of associative pallial neurons contribute to cognitive flexibility and complexity and are key to explain why crows are smart. Since meso-/nidopallial and subpallial areas scale jointly, it is conceivable that associative pallio-striatal loops play a similar role in executive decision making as described in primates.</p>

     alt="Neural organization of the third optic neuropil, the lobula, in the highly visual semiterrestrial crab Neohelice granulata"/>
<p>The manuscript presents a detailed description, derived from Golgi-impregnated preparations, of the layered organization and the small columnar elements that compose the third optic neuropil, the lobula of a semiterrestrial crab.

</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The visual neuropils (lamina, medulla, and lobula complex) of malacostracan crustaceans and hexapods have many organizational principles, cell types, and functional properties in common. Information about the cellular elements that compose the crustacean lobula is scarce especially when focusing on small columnar cells. Semiterrestrial crabs possess a highly developed visual system and display conspicuous visually guided behaviors. In particular, <i>Neohelice granulata</i> has been previously used to describe the cellular components of the first two optic neuropils using Golgi impregnation technique. Here, we present a comprehensive description of individual elements composing the third optic neuropil, the lobula, of that same species. We characterized a wide variety of elements (140 types) including input terminals and lobula columnar, centrifugal, and input columnar elements. Results reveal a very dense and complex neuropil. We found a frequently impregnated input element (suggesting a supernumerary cartridge representation) that arborizes in the third layer of the lobula and that presents four variants each with ramifications organized following one of the four cardinal axes suggesting a role in directional processing. We also describe input elements with two neurites branching in the third layer, probably connecting with the medulla and lobula plate. These facts suggest that this layer is involved in the directional motion detection pathway in crabs. We analyze and discuss our findings considering the similarities and differences found between the layered organization and components of this crustacean lobula and the lobula of insects.</p>
