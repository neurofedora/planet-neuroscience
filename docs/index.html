<p>by Peter Neri</p>

Contrast is the most fundamental property of images. Consequently, any comprehensive model of biological vision must incorporate this attribute and provide a veritable description of its impact on visual perception. Current theoretical and computational models predict that vision should modify its characteristics at low contrast: for example, it should become broader (more lowpass) to protect from noise, as often demonstrated by individual neurons. We find that the opposite is true for human discrimination of elementary image elements: vision becomes sharper, not broader, as contrast approaches threshold levels. Furthermore, it suffers from increased internal variability at low contrast and it transitions from a surprisingly linear regime at high contrast to a markedly nonlinear processing mode in the low-contrast range. These characteristics are hard-wired in that they happen on a single trial without memory or expectation. Overall, the empirical results urge caution when attempting to interpret human vision from the standpoint of optimality and related theoretical constructs. Direct measurements of this phenomenon indicate that the actual constraints derive from intrinsic architectural features, such as the co-existence of complex-cell-like and simple-cell-like components. Small circuits built around these elements can indeed account for the empirical results, but do not appear to operate in a manner that conforms to optimality even approximately. More generally, our results provide a compelling demonstration of how far we still are from securing an adequate computational account of the most basic operations carried out by human vision.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/p892OX1e4bY" width="1" />

                <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/QFEh9jEk6cU/article">Regulation of harvester ant foraging as a closed-loop excitable system</a></h4>

<p>by Renato Pagliara, Deborah M. Gordon, Naomi Ehrich Leonard</p>

Ant colonies regulate activity in response to changing conditions without using centralized control. Desert harvester ant colonies forage for seeds, and regulate foraging to manage a tradeoff between spending and obtaining water. Foragers lose water while outside in the dry air, but ants obtain water by metabolizing the fats in the seeds they eat. Previous work shows that the rate at which an outgoing forager leaves the nest depends on its recent rate of brief antennal contacts with incoming foragers carrying food. We examine how this process can yield foraging rates that are robust to uncertainty and responsive to temperature and humidity across minute-to-hour timescales. To explore possible mechanisms, we develop a low-dimensional analytical model with a small number of parameters that captures observed foraging behavior. The model uses excitability dynamics to represent response to interactions inside the nest and a random delay distribution to represent foraging time outside the nest. We show how feedback from outgoing foragers returning to the nest stabilizes the incoming and outgoing foraging rates to a common value determined by the volatility of available foragers. The model exhibits a critical volatility above which there is sustained foraging at a constant rate and below which foraging stops. To explain how foraging rates adjust to temperature and humidity, we propose that foragers modify their volatility after they leave the nest and become exposed to the environment. Our study highlights the importance of feedback in the regulation of foraging activity and shows how modulation of volatility can explain how foraging activity responds to conditions and varies across colonies. Our model elucidates the role of feedback across many timescales in collective behavior, and may be generalized to other systems driven by excitable dynamics, such as neuronal networks.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/QFEh9jEk6cU" width="1" />

Abstract
<p>Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of inherited mental retardation and the most common known cause of autism. Loss of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) in mice (<i>Fmr1</i> KO) leads to altered synaptic and circuit maturation in the hippocampus that is correlated with alterations in hippocampal-dependent behaviors. Previous studies have demonstrated that loss of FMRP increased the rate of proliferation of progenitor cells and altered their fate specification in adult <i>Fmr1</i> KO mice. While these studies clearly demonstrate a role for FMRP in adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus, it is not known whether the functional synaptic maturation and integration of adult-born dentate granule cells (abDGCs) into hippocampal circuits is affected in <i>Fmr1</i> KO mice. Here, we used retroviral labeling to birthdate abDGCs in <i>Fmr1</i> KO mice which allowed us to perform targeted patch clamp recording to measure the development of synaptic inputs to these neurons at precise time points after differentiation. The frequency and amplitude of spontaneous GABAergic events increased over the first three weeks after differentiation; however, this normal development of GABAergic synapses was not altered in <i>Fmr1</i> KO mice. Furthermore, the relatively depolarized GABA reversal potential (<i>E</i><sub>GABA</sub>) in immature abDGCs was unaffected by loss of FMRP as was the development of dendritic arbor of the adult generated neurons. These studies systematically characterized the functional development of abDGCs during the first four weeks after differentiation and demonstrate that the maturation of GABAergic synaptic inputs to these neurons is not grossly affected by the loss of FMRP.</p>

Klein et al. (1) suggest that defined daily doses (DDDs) are not a perfect outcome measure of antibiotic prescribing, particularly for penicillins (39% of total DDDs in 2015 for broad-spectrum penicillins). We identified the same limitations as illustrated by the results of our study (2), which measured the bias of...<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/_dMslhkBVH4" width="1" />

The central concern in ref. 1 that the “timing of the policy shock is incorrect for key regions” is false. We received confirmation from the Ministry of Environmental Protection’s representative who authored the policy document issued on February 27, 2013.

<p>The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) constitutes an interface through which chemical
cues can reach and modulate the activity of neurons located at the epithelial
boundary within the entire nervous system. Here, we investigate the role and
functional connectivity of a class of GABAergic sensory neurons contacting the
CSF in the vertebrate spinal cord and referred to as CSF-cNs. The remote
activation of CSF-cNs was shown to trigger delayed slow locomotion in the
zebrafish larva, suggesting that these cells modulate components of locomotor
central pattern generators (CPGs). Combining anatomy, electrophysiology, and
optogenetics in vivo, we show that CSF-cNs form active GABAergic synapses onto
V0-v glutamatergic interneurons, an essential component of locomotor CPGs. We
confirmed that activating CSF-cNs at rest induced delayed slow locomotion in
the fictive preparation. In contrast, the activation of CSF-cNs promptly
inhibited ongoing slow locomotion. Moreover, selective activation of rostral
CSF-cNs during ongoing activity disrupted rostrocaudal propagation of
descending excitation along the spinal cord, indicating that CSF-cNs primarily
act at the premotor level. Altogether, our results demonstrate how a spinal
GABAergic sensory neuron can tune the excitability of locomotor CPGs in a
state-dependent manner by projecting onto essential components of the
excitatory premotor pool.

<p>Finite Element Modeling (FEM) has been widely used to model the electric
field distribution, to study the interaction between stimulation electrodes and
neural tissue. However, due to the insufficient computational capability to
represent neural tissue down to an atom-level, the existing FEM fails to model
the real electric field that is perpendicular to neuron membrane to initiate an
action potential. Thus, to reveal the real electrode-tissue interactions, we
developed a circuit to model transmembrane voltage waveforms. Here, we show a
distributed-parameter circuit model to systematically study how
electrode-tissue interaction is affected by electrode position, input current
waveform, and biological structures in the neuromuscular system. Our model
explains and predicts various phenomena in neuromuscular stimulation, guides
new stimulation electrode and method design, and more importantly, facilitates
a fundamental understanding of the physical process during electrode-tissue
interaction. In our model, myelin is assumed to be inductive. The voltage
waveform resonance caused by this inductive myelin accounts for the much lower
stimulation threshold to activate motoneurons than muscle fibers, which is
observed with in vivo measurements. These findings confirmed the feasibility of
studying electrode-tissue interaction using a proper distributed-parameter
circuit. Our current application on the neuromuscular system also raises the
possibility that this distributed-parameter circuit model could potentially be
applied to study other neural tissues, including the Peripheral Nervous System
(PNS) and the Central Nervous System (CNS).

<p>Encoding and decoding models are widely used in systems, cognitive, and
computational neuroscience to make sense of brain-activity data. However, the
interpretation of their results requires care. Decoding models can help reveal
whether particular information is present in a brain region in a format the
decoder can exploit. Encoding models make comprehensive predictions about
representational spaces. In the context of sensory systems, encoding models
enable us to test and compare brain-computational models, and thus directly
constrain computational theory. Encoding and decoding models typically include
fitted linear-model components. Sometimes the weights of the fitted linear
combinations are interpreted as reflecting, in an encoding model, the
contribution of different sensory features to the representation or, in a
decoding model, the contribution of different measured brain responses to a
decoded feature. Such interpretations can be problematic when the predictor
variables or their noise components are correlated and when priors (or
penalties) are used to regularize the fit. Encoding and decoding models are
evaluated in terms of their generalization performance. The correct
interpretation depends on the level of generalization a model achieves (e.g. to
new response measurements for the same stimuli, to new stimuli from the same
population, or to stimuli from a different population). Significant decoding or
encoding performance of a single model (at whatever level of generality) does
not provide strong constraints for theory. Many models must be tested and
inferentially compared for analyses to drive theoretical progress.

<p>Recent crowdsourcing experiments have shown that true contextuality of the
kind found in quantum mechanics can also be present in human behavior. In these
experiments simple human choices were aggregated over large numbers of
respondents, with each respondent dealing with a single context (set of
questions asked). In this paper we present experimental evidence of
contextuality in individual human behavior, in a psychophysical experiment with
repeated presentations of visual stimuli in randomly varying contexts
(arrangements of stimuli). The analysis is based on the
Contextuality-by-Default (CbD) theory whose relevant aspects are reviewed in
the paper. CbD allows one to detect contextuality in the presence of direct
influences, i.e., when responses to the same stimuli have different
distributions in different contexts. The experiment presented is also the first
one in which contextuality is demonstrated for responses that are not
dichotomous, with five options to choose among. CbD requires that random
variables representing such responses be dichotomized before they are subjected
to contextuality analysis. A theorem says that a system consisting of all
possible dichotomizations of responses has to be contextual if these responses
violate a certain condition, called nominal dominance. In our experiment
nominal dominance was violated in all data sets, with very high statistical
reliability established by bootstrapping.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/42628">Arterial smooth muscle cell PKD2 (TRPP1) channels regulate systemic blood pressure</a></h4>

Systemic blood pressure is determined, in part, by arterial smooth muscle cells (myocytes). Several Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) channels are proposed to be expressed in arterial myocytes, but it is unclear if these proteins control physiological blood pressure and contribute to hypertension <i>in vivo</i>. We generated the first inducible, smooth muscle-specific knockout mice for a TRP channel, namely for PKD2 (TRPP1), to investigate arterial myocyte and blood pressure regulation by this protein. Using this model, we show that intravascular pressure and α<sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptors activate PKD2 channels in arterial myocytes of different systemic organs. PKD2 channel activation in arterial myocytes leads to an inward Na<sup>+</sup> current, membrane depolarization and vasoconstriction. Inducible, smooth muscle cell-specific PKD2 knockout lowers both physiological blood pressure and hypertension and prevents pathological arterial remodeling during hypertension. Thus, arterial myocyte PKD2 controls systemic blood pressure and targeting this TRP channel reduces high blood pressure.

Dietary fatty acids are the main building blocks for cell membranes in animals, and mechanisms must therefore exist that compensate for dietary variations. We isolated <i>C. elegans</i> mutants that improved tolerance to dietary saturated fat in a sensitized genetic background, including eight alleles of the novel gene <i>fld-1</i> that encodes a homolog of the human TLCD1 and TLCD2 transmembrane proteins. FLD-1 is localized on plasma membranes and acts by limiting the levels of highly membrane-fluidizing long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid-containing phospholipids. Human TLCD1/2 also regulate membrane fluidity by limiting the levels of polyunsaturated fatty acid-containing membrane phospholipids. FLD-1 and TLCD1/2 do not regulate the synthesis of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids but rather limit their incorporation into phospholipids. We conclude that inhibition of FLD-1 or TLCD1/2 prevents lipotoxicity by allowing increased levels of membrane phospholipids that contain fluidizing long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/39780">Endothelial-specific FoxO1 depletion prevents obesity-related disorders by increasing vascular metabolism and growth</a></h4>

Impaired angiogenesis is a hallmark of metabolically dysfunctional adipose tissue in obesity. However, the underlying mechanisms restricting angiogenesis within this context remain ill-defined. Here, we demonstrate that induced endothelial-specific depletion of the transcription factor Forkhead Box O1 (FoxO1) in male mice led to increased vascular density in adipose tissue. Upon high-fat diet feeding, endothelial cell FoxO1-deficient mice exhibited even greater vascular remodeling in the visceral adipose depot, which was paralleled with a healthier adipose tissue expansion, higher glucose tolerance and lower fasting glycemia concomitant with enhanced lactate levels. Mechanistically, FoxO1 depletion increased endothelial proliferative and glycolytic capacities by upregulating the expression of glycolytic markers, which may account for the improvements at the tissue level ultimately impacting whole-body glucose metabolism. Altogether, these findings reveal the pivotal role of FoxO1 in controlling endothelial metabolic and angiogenic adaptations in response to high-fat diet and a contribution of the endothelium to whole-body energy homeostasis.

Subgenomic flaviviral RNA (sfRNA) accumulates during infection due to incomplete degradation of viral genomes and interacts with cellular proteins to promote infection. Here we identify host proteins that bind the Zika virus (ZIKV) sfRNA. We identified fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) as a ZIKV sfRNA-binding protein and confirmed this interaction in cultured cells and mouse testes. Depletion of FMRP elevated viral translation and enhanced ZIKV infection, indicating that FMRP is a ZIKV restriction factor. We further observed that an attenuated ZIKV strain compromised for sfRNA production was disproportionately stimulated by FMRP knockdown, suggesting that ZIKV sfRNA antagonizes FMRP activity. Importantly, ZIKV infection and expression of ZIKV sfRNA upregulated endogenous FMRP target genes in cell culture and ZIKV-infected mice. Together, our observations identify FMRP as a ZIKV restriction factor whose activity is antagonized by the sfRNA. Interaction between ZIKV and FMRP has significant implications for the pathogenesis of ZIKV infections.

Neurodevelopmental trajectories are shaped by interactions between coordinated biological processes and individual experiences throughout ontogeny, yet the specific genetic and environmental impact on brain development is enigmatic. Here, we map the genetic architectures of cognitive traits and psychiatric disorders onto the brain, show that such canonical genetic maps are associated with individual normative patterns in youths, and provide evidence that trauma exposure and parental education may alter this relationship.

Inflammation contributes to tissue repair and restoration of function after infection or injury. However, some forms of inflammation can cause tissue damage and disease, particularly if inappropriately activated, excessive, or not resolved adequately. The mechanisms that prevent excessive or chronic inflammation are therefore important to understand. This is particularly important in the central nervous system where some effects of inflammation can have particularly harmful consequences, including irreversible damage. An increasing number of neurological disorders, both acute and chronic, and their complications are associated with aberrant neuroinflammatory activity. Here we describe a model of self-limiting acute brain inflammation optimised to study mechanisms underlying inflammation resolution. Inflammation was induced by intracerebral injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and the temporal profile of key cellular and molecular changes were defined during the progression of the inflammatory response. The kinetics of accumulation and loss of neutrophils in the brain enabled well demarcated phases of inflammation to be operatively defined, including induction and resolution phases. Microglial reactivity and accumulation of monocyte-derived macrophages were maximal at the onset of and during the resolution phase. We profiled the transcriptome-wide gene expression changes at representative induction and resolution timepoints and used gene coexpression network analysis to identify gene clusters. This revealed a distinct cluster of genes associated with inflammation resolution that were induced selectively or maximally during this phase and indicated an active programming of gene expression that may drive resolution as has been described in other tissues. Induction of gene networks involved in lysosomal function, lipid metabolism and a comparative switch to MHC-II antigen presentation (relative to MHC-I during induction) were prominent during the resolution phase. The restoration and/or further induction of microglial homeostatic signature genes was notable during the resolution phase. We propose the current model as a tractable reductionist system to complement more complex models for further understanding how inflammation resolution in the brain is regulated and as a platform for in vivo testing/screening of candidate resolution-modifying interventions. Our data highlight how resolution involves active cellular and transcriptome reprogramming and identify candidate gene networks associated with resolution-phase adaptations that warrant further study.

When consumed with foods, mint, mustard and chili peppers generate pronounced oral thermosensations. Here we recorded responses in mouse trigeminal ganglion neurons to investigate interactions between thermal sensing and the active ingredients of these plants--menthol, allyl isothiocyanate (AITC), and capsaicin, respectively--at concentrations found in foods and commercial hygiene products. We carried out in vivo confocal calcium imaging of trigeminal ganglia in which neurons express GCaMP3 or GCAMP6s and recorded their responses to oral stimulation with thermal and the above chemesthetic stimuli. In the V3 (oral sensory) region of the ganglion, thermoreceptive neurons accounted for ~10% of imaged neurons. We categorized them into 3 distinct classes: cool-responsive and warm-responsive thermosensors, and nociceptors (responsive only to temperatures [≥]43-45o). Menthol, AITC, and capsaicin also elicited robust calcium responses that differed markedly in their latencies and durations. Most of the neurons that responded to these chemesthetic stimuli were also thermosensitive. Capsaicin and AITC increased the numbers of warm-responding neurons and shifted the nociceptor threshold to lower temperatures. Menthol attenuated the responses in all classes of thermoreceptors. Our data show that while individual neurons may respond to a narrow temperature range (or even bimodally), taken collectively, the population is able to report on graded changes of temperature. Our findings also substantiate an explanation for the thermal sensations experienced when one consumes pungent spices or mint.

Human brain has developed mechanisms to efficiently decode sensory information according to perceptual categories of high prevalence in the environment, such as faces, symbols, objects. Neural activity produced within localized brain networks has been associated with the process that integrates both sensory bottom-up and cognitive top-down information processing. Yet, how specifically the different types and components of neural responses reflect the local networks' selectivity for categorical information processing is still unknown. By mimicking the decoding of the sensory information with machine learning we can obtain accurate artificial decoding models. Having the artificial system functionally on par with the biological one we can analyze the mechanics of the artificial system to gain insights into the inner workings of its biological counterpart. In this work we train a Random Forest classification model to decode eight perceptual categories from visual stimuli given a broad spectrum of human intracranial signals 4-150 Hz obtained during a visual perception task, and analyze which of the spectral features the algorithm deemed relevant to the perceptual decoding. We show that network selectivity for a single or multiple categories in sensory and non-sensory cortices is related to specific patterns of power increases and decreases in both low 4-50 Hz and high 50-150 Hz frequency bands. We demonstrate that the locations and patterns of activity that are identified by the algorithm not only coincide with the known spectro-spatial signatures, but extend our knowledge by uncovering additional spectral signatures describing neural mechanisms of visual category perception in human brain.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease in which the formation of extracellular aggregates of amyloid beta peptide, intraneuronal tau neurofibrillary tangles and microglial activation are major pathological hallmarks. One of the key molecules involved in microglial activation is galectin-3 (gal3), and we demonstrate here for the first time a key role of gal3 in AD pathology. Gal3 was highly upregulated in the brains of AD patients and 5xFAD (familial Alzheimer's disease) mice, and found specifically expressed in microglia associated with A{beta} plaques. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in the LGALS3 gene, which encodes gal3, were associated to an increased risk of AD. Gal3 deletion in 5xFAD mice attenuated microglia-associated immune responses, particularly those associated with TLR and TREM2/DAP12 signaling. In vitro data demonstrated the requirement of gal3 to fully activate microglia in response to fibrillar A{beta}. Gal3 deletion decreased the A{beta} burden in 5xFAD mice and improved cognitive behavior. Electron microscopy of gal3 in AD mice demonstrated i) a preferential expression of gal3 by plaque-associated microglia, ii) its presence in the extracellular space and iii) its association to A{beta} plaques. Low concentrations (1 nM) of pure gal3 promoted cross-seeding fibrilization of pure A{beta}. Importantly, a single intrahippocampal injection of gal3 along with A{beta} monomers in WT mice was sufficient to induce the formation of insoluble A{beta} aggregates that were absent when gal3 was lacking. High-resolution microscopy (STORM) demonstrated close co-localization of gal3 and TREM2 in microglial processes, and a direct interaction was shown by a fluorescence anisotropy assay involving the gal3 CRD domain. Furthermore, gal3 stimulated the TREM2-DAP12 signaling pathway. In conclusion, we provide evidence that gal3 is a central regulator of microglial immune response in AD. It drives proinflammatory activation and A{beta} aggregation, as well as acting as an endogenous ligand to TREM2, a key receptor driving microglial response under disease conditions. Gal3 inhibition may, hence, be a potential pharmacological approach to counteract AD.

<p>by Rory G. Townsend, Pulin Gong</p>

There is growing evidence that population-level brain activity is often organized into propagating waves that are structured in both space and time. Such spatiotemporal patterns have been linked to brain function and observed across multiple recording methodologies and scales. The ability to detect and analyze these patterns is thus essential for understanding the working mechanisms of neural circuits. Here we present a mathematical and computational framework for the identification and analysis of multiple classes of wave patterns in neural population-level recordings. By drawing a conceptual link between spatiotemporal patterns found in the brain and coherent structures such as vortices found in turbulent flows, we introduce velocity vector fields to characterize neural population activity. These vector fields are calculated for both phase and amplitude of oscillatory neural signals by adapting optical flow estimation methods from the field of computer vision. Based on these velocity vector fields, we then introduce order parameters and critical point analysis to detect and characterize a diverse range of propagating wave patterns, including planar waves, sources, sinks, spiral waves, and saddle patterns. We also introduce a novel vector field decomposition method that extracts the dominant spatiotemporal structures in a recording. This enables neural data to be represented by the activity of a small number of independent spatiotemporal modes, providing an alternative to existing dimensionality reduction techniques which separate space and time components. We demonstrate the capabilities of the framework and toolbox with simulated data, local field potentials from marmoset visual cortex and optical voltage recordings from whole mouse cortex, and we show that pattern dynamics are non-random and are modulated by the presence of visual stimuli. These methods are implemented in a MATLAB toolbox, which is freely available under an open-source licensing agreement.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/_y4dI44JGZA" width="1" />

<p>by Hayden Tronnolone, Jennifer M. Gardner, Joanna F. Sundstrom, Vladimir Jiranek, Stephen G. Oliver, Benjamin J. Binder</p>

Many microbes are studied by examining colony morphology via two-dimensional top-down images. The quantification of such images typically requires each pixel to be labelled as belonging to either the colony or background, producing a binary image. While this may be achieved manually for a single colony, this process is infeasible for large datasets containing thousands of images. The software Tool for Analysis of the Morphology of Microbial Colonies (TAMMiCol) has been developed to efficiently and automatically convert colony images to binary. TAMMiCol exploits the structure of the images to choose a thresholding tolerance and produce a binary image of the colony. The images produced are shown to compare favourably with images processed manually, while TAMMiCol is shown to outperform standard segmentation methods. Multiple images may be imported together for batch processing, while the binary data may be exported as a CSV or MATLAB MAT file for quantification, or analysed using statistics built into the software. Using the in-built statistics, it is found that images produced by TAMMiCol yield values close to those computed from binary images processed manually. Analysis of a new large dataset using TAMMiCol shows that colonies of <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> reach a maximum level of filamentous growth once the concentration of ammonium sulfate is reduced to 200 μM. TAMMiCol is accessed through a graphical user interface, making it easy to use for those without specialist knowledge of image processing, statistical methods or coding.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/aOVC22Kfiw0" width="1" />

<p>by Edouard A. Hay, Raghuveer Parthasarathy</p>

Three-dimensional microscopy is increasingly prevalent in biology due to the development of techniques such as multiphoton, spinning disk confocal, and light sheet fluorescence microscopies. These methods enable unprecedented studies of life at the microscale, but bring with them larger and more complex datasets. New image processing techniques are therefore called for to analyze the resulting images in an accurate and efficient manner. Convolutional neural networks are becoming the standard for classification of objects within images due to their accuracy and generalizability compared to traditional techniques. Their application to data derived from 3D imaging, however, is relatively new and has mostly been in areas of magnetic resonance imaging and computer tomography. It remains unclear, for images of discrete cells in variable backgrounds as are commonly encountered in fluorescence microscopy, whether convolutional neural networks provide sufficient performance to warrant their adoption, especially given the challenges of human comprehension of their classification criteria and their requirements of large training datasets. We therefore applied a 3D convolutional neural network to distinguish bacteria and non-bacterial objects in 3D light sheet fluorescence microscopy images of larval zebrafish intestines. We find that the neural network is as accurate as human experts, outperforms random forest and support vector machine classifiers, and generalizes well to a different bacterial species through the use of transfer learning. We also discuss network design considerations, and describe the dependence of accuracy on dataset size and data augmentation. We provide source code, labeled data, and descriptions of our analysis pipeline to facilitate adoption of convolutional neural network analysis for three-dimensional microscopy data.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/yuhOvXjwIEI" width="1" />

<p>by Agustina Razetti, Caroline Medioni, Grégoire Malandain, Florence Besse, Xavier Descombes</p>

The confined and crowded environment of developing brains imposes spatial constraints on neuronal cells that have evolved individual and collective strategies to optimize their growth. These include organizing neurons into populations extending their axons to common target territories. How individual axons interact with each other within such populations to optimize innervation is currently unclear and difficult to analyze experimentally <i>in vivo</i>. Here, we developed a stochastic model of 3D axon growth that takes into account spatial environmental constraints, physical interactions between neighboring axons, and branch formation. This general, predictive and robust model, when fed with parameters estimated on real neurons from the <i>Drosophila</i> brain, enabled the study of the mechanistic principles underlying the growth of axonal populations. First, it provided a novel explanation for the diversity of growth and branching patterns observed <i>in vivo</i> within populations of genetically identical neurons. Second, it uncovered that axon branching could be a strategy optimizing the overall growth of axons competing with others in contexts of high axonal density. The flexibility of this framework will make it possible to investigate the rules underlying axon growth and regeneration in the context of various neuronal populations.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/z8xWedFl4Tk" width="1" />

<p>by Lei Liu, Guang Shi, D. Thirumalai, Changbong Hyeon</p>

We investigate spatiotemporal dynamics of human interphase chromosomes by employing a heteropolymer model that incorporates the information of human chromosomes inferred from Hi-C data. Despite considerable heterogeneities in the chromosome structures generated from our model, chromatins are organized into crumpled globules with space-filling (SF) statistics characterized by a single universal scaling exponent (<i>ν</i> = 1/3), and this exponent alone can offer a quantitative account of experimentally observed, many different features of chromosome dynamics. The local chromosome structures, whose scale corresponds to that of topologically associated domains (∼ 0.1 − 1 Mb), display dynamics with a fast relaxation time (≲ 1 − 10 sec); in contrast, the long-range spatial reorganization of the entire chromatin (≳O ( 10 2 ) Mb) occurs on a much slower time scale (≳ hour), providing the dynamic basis of cell-to-cell variability and glass-like behavior of chromosomes. Biological activities, modeled using stronger isotropic white noises added to active loci, accelerate the relaxation dynamics of chromatin domains associated with the low frequency modes and induce phase segregation between the active and inactive loci. Surprisingly, however, they do not significantly change the dynamics at local scales from those obtained under passive conditions. Our study underscores the role of chain organization of chromosome in determining the spatiotemporal dynamics of chromatin loci.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bmoR37BPBlw" width="1" />

<p>by Luhao Zhang, Maodong Li, Zhirong Liu</p>

Intrinsically disordered proteins/regions (IDPs/IDRs) are prevalent in allosteric regulation. It was previously thought that intrinsic disorder is favorable for maximizing the allosteric coupling. Here, we propose a comprehensive ensemble model to compare the roles of both order-order transition and disorder-order transition in allosteric effect. It is revealed that the MWC pathway (order-order transition) has a higher probability than the EAM pathway (disorder-order transition) in allostery, suggesting a complicated role of IDPs/IDRs in regulatory proteins. In addition, an analytic formula for the maximal allosteric coupling response is obtained, which shows that too stable or too unstable state is unfavorable to endow allostery, and is thus helpful for rational design of allosteric drugs.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/n_64NmyYPwU" width="1" />

Abstract<p>Spinal cord injury (SCI) perturbs many physiological systems. The circadian system helps maintain homeostasis throughout the body by synchronizing physiological and behavioural functions to predictable daily events. Whether disruption of these coordinated daily rhythms contributes to SCI-associated pathology remains under-studied. Here, we hypothesized that SCI in rats would dysregulate several prominent circadian outputs including glucocorticoids, core temperature, activity, neuroinflammation, and circadian gene networks. Female and male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to clinically relevant thoracic (T-) 9 moderate contusion SCI (or laminectomy sham surgery). Diurnal measures – including rhythms of plasma corticosterone (CORT), body temperature and activity (using small implanted transmitters), and intraspinal circadian and inflammatory gene expression – were studied prior to and post-surgery. SCI caused overall increases and disrupted rhythms of the major rodent glucocorticoid, CORT. Pre-surgery and sham rats displayed expected rhythms in body temperature and activity, whereas rats with SCI had blunted daily rhythms in body temperature and activity. In parallel, SCI disrupted intraspinal rhythms of circadian clock gene expression. Circadian clock genes can act as transcriptional regulators of inflammatory pathways. Indeed, SCI rats also showed dysregulated rhythms in inflammatory gene expression in both the epicenter and distal spinal cord. Our data show that moderate SCI in rats causes wide-ranging diurnal rhythm dysfunction, which is severe at acute time points, and gradually recovers over time. Normalizing post-SCI diurnal rhythms could enhance recovery of homeostasis and quality-of-life.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Spinal cord injury (SCI) can cause physiologic dysfunction throughout the body. Internal physiologic function is typically synchronized with the environment through the circadian system. Despite the crucial roles of the spinal cord and the circadian system in optimizing whole-body function, it remains unclear whether SCI alters diurnal rhythms. Here, we hypothesized that SCI would disrupt key circadian output and feedback mechanisms. Moderate SCI in rats caused widespread disruption of diurnal measures – including glucocorticoids, body temperature, locomotor activity, and intraspinal clock and inflammatory gene expression. We identify the circadian system as a novel potential target for SCI therapies.</p>

Abstract<p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) begins several decades before the onset of clinical symptoms, at a time when women may still undergo reproductive cycling. Whether ovarian functions alter substrates of AD pathogenesis is unknown. Here we show that ovarian cycles stages significantly modulate AD-related alterations in neural network patterns, cognitive impairments, and pathogenic protein production in the hAPP-J20 mouse model of AD. Female hAPP mice spent more time in estrogen-dominant cycle stages and these ovarian stages worsened AD-related network dysfunction and cognitive impairments. In contrast, progesterone-dominant stages and gonadectomy attenuated these AD-related deficits. Further studies revealed a direct role for estradiol in stimulating neural network excitability and susceptibility to seizures in hAPP mice. Understanding dynamic effects of the ovarian cycle on the female nervous system in disease, including AD, is of critical importance and may differ from effects on a healthy brain. The pattern of ovarian cycle effects on disease-related networks, cognition, and pathogenic protein expression may be relevant to young women at risk for AD.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is insidious and begins several decades before clinical symptoms. For women, this means that pathophysiological changes could occur in the brain during the reproductive life-stage – prior to the cessation of ovarian function. Whether ovarian functions alter substrates of AD pathogenesis is unknown. We show that ovarian cycles are altered in a mouse model of AD and that ovarian cycle stage contributes to AD-related network and cognitive impairments. Investigating network activity, cognition, seizures, and other manifestations of brain function across the reproductive cycle stages in cycling women could reveal differential patterns in the brain at risk for AD compared to normal aging – and potentially open the door for preventative therapies and early treatment in women at risk for AD.</p>

Abstract
<p>Light-sheet microscopy (LSM) has proven a useful tool in neuroscience to image whole brains with high frame rates at cellular resolution and, in combination with tissue clearing methods, is often employed to reconstruct the cyto-architecture over the intact mouse brain. Inherently to LSM, however, residual opaque objects, always present to some extent even in extremely well optically cleared samples, cause stripe artifacts, which, in the best case, severely affect image homogeneity and, in the worst case, completely obscure features of interest. Here, demonstrating two example applications in intact optically cleared mouse brains, we report how Bessel beams reduce streaking artifacts and produce high-fidelity structural data for the brain-wide morphology of neuronal and vascular networks. We found that a third of the imaged volume of the brain was affected by strong striated image intensity inhomogeneity and, furthermore, a significant amount of information content lost with Gaussian illumination was accessible when interrogated with Bessel beams. In conclusion, Bessel beams produce high-fidelity structural data of improved image homogeneity and might significantly relax demands placed on the automated tools to count, trace, or segment fluorescent features of interest.</p>

<p>Dementia and especially Alzheimer's disease (AD) are the most common causes
of cognitive decline in elderly people. A spread of the above mentioned mental
health problems in aging societies is causing a significant medical and
economic burden in many countries around the world. According to a recent World
Health Organization (WHO) report, it is approximated that currently, worldwide,
about 47 million people live with a dementia spectrum of neurocognitive
disorders. This number is expected to triple by 2050, which calls for possible
application of AI-based technologies to support an early screening for
preventive interventions and a subsequent mental wellbeing monitoring as well
as maintenance with so-called digital-pharma or beyond a pill therapeutical
approaches. This paper discusses our attempt and preliminary results of
brainwave (EEG) techniques to develop digital biomarkers for dementia progress
detection and monitoring. We present an information geometry-based
classification approach for automatic EEG-derived event related responses
(ERPs) discrimination of low versus high task-load auditory or tactile stimuli
recognition, of which amplitude and latency variabilities are similar to those
in dementia. The discussed approach is a step forward to develop AI, and
especially machine learning (ML) approaches, for the subsequent application to
mild-cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD diagnostics.

<p>Similarities between the non-deterministic nature of quantum theory and the
unpredictable patterns of human cognition and decision making have been
observed and commented on many times since the invention of Quantum Mechanics
in the first part of the 20th century. Niels Bohr himself took note of the
parallels.[3] In fact, an entire field of study, Quantum Cognition, has been
borne from the study of this analogy. [3] However, many of the attempts to
model human behavior with quantum mechanics con ate the identity of a particle
with its own wavefunction, which is incorrect and invalidates the analogy. In
this paper, we seek to make explicit this error, make necessary corrections,
and then deepen the analogy. We do this by creating a Quantum Decision Theory
that directly parallels Richard Feynman's novel formulation of quantum
mechanics published in 1948 at Cornell University: Space-Time Approach to
Non-Relativistic Quantum Mechanics".

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/40868">Attention periodically samples competing stimuli during binocular rivalry</a></h4>

The attentional sampling hypothesis suggests that attention rhythmically enhances sensory processing when attending to a single (~8 Hz), or multiple (~4 Hz) objects. Here we investigated whether attention samples sensory representations that are not part of the conscious percept during binocular rivalry. When crossmodally cued toward a conscious image, subsequent changes in consciousness occurred at ~8 Hz, consistent with rates of undivided attentional sampling. However, when attention was cued toward the suppressed image, changes in consciousness slowed to ~3.5 Hz, indicating the division of attention away from the conscious visual image. In the electroencephalogram, we found that at attentional sampling frequencies, the strength of inter-trial phase-coherence over fronto-temporal and parieto-occipital regions correlated with changes in perception. When cues were not task-relevant, these effects disappeared, confirming that perceptual changes were dependent upon the allocation of attention, and that attention can flexibly sample away from a conscious image in a task-dependent manner.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/39981">Molecular pathway analysis towards understanding tissue vulnerability in spinocerebellar ataxia type 1</a></h4>

The neurodegenerative disorder spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) affects the cerebellum and inferior olive, though previous research has focused primarily on the cerebellum. As a result, it is unknown what molecular alterations are present in the inferior olive, and whether these changes are found in other affected tissues. This study addresses these questions for the first time using two different SCA1 mouse models. We found that differentially regulated genes in the inferior olive segregated into several biological pathways. Comparison of the inferior olive and cerebellum demonstrates that vulnerable tissues in SCA1 are not uniform in their gene expression changes, and express largely discrete but some commonly enriched biological pathways. Importantly, we also found that brain region-specific differences occur early in disease initiation and progression, and they are shared across the two mouse models of SCA1. This suggests different mechanisms of degeneration at work in the inferior olive and cerebellum.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/39865">Biosynthesis of histone messenger RNA employs a specific 3' end endonuclease</a></h4>

Replication dependent (RD) core histone mRNA produced during S-phase is the only known protein-coding mRNA presenting a 3' stem-loop instead of the otherwise universal polyA tail. A metallo β-lactamase (MBL) fold enzyme, cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor 73 (CPSF73), is proposed to be the sole endonuclease responsible for 3' end processing of both mRNA classes. We report cellular, genetic, biochemical, substrate selectivity, and crystallographic studies providing evidence that an additional endoribonuclease, MBL domain containing protein 1 (MBLAC1), is selective for 3' processing of RD histone pre-mRNA during the S-phase of the cell cycle. Depletion of MBLAC1 in cells significantly affects cell cycle progression thus identifying MBLAC1 as a new type of S-phase specific cancer target.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/27706">Global transcriptional analysis identifies a novel role for SOX4 in tumor-induced angiogenesis</a></h4>

The expression of the transcription factor <i>SOX4</i> is increased in many human cancers, however, the pro-oncogenic capacity of SOX4 can vary greatly depending on the type of tumor. Both the contextual nature and the mechanisms underlying the pro-oncogenic SOX4 response remain unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that in mammary tumorigenesis, the SOX4 transcriptional network is dictated by the epigenome and is enriched for pro-angiogenic processes. We show that SOX4 directly regulates endothelin-1 (ET-1) expression and can thereby promote tumor-induced angiogenesis both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, in breast tumors, SOX4 expression correlates with blood vessel density and size, and predicts poor-prognosis in patients with breast cancer. Our data provide novel mechanistic insights into context-dependent SOX4 target gene selection, and uncover a novel pro-oncogenic role for this transcription factor in promoting tumor-induced angiogenesis. These findings establish a key role for SOX4 in promoting metastasis through exploiting diverse pro-tumorigenic pathways.

In a sample of 39 children with ADHD and 34 age- and IQ-matched TD children, we found that cortical thickness and surface area differences were predominantly observed in the frontal cortex. Furthermore, a path analysis revealed that a <span style="font-style: italic;">COMT</span> genotype affected abnormal development of the frontal cortex in terms of both cortical thickness and surface area and was associated with working memory changes in children with ADHD. Our study confirms that the role of <span style="font-style: italic;">COMT</span> in ADHD is not restricted to the development of behavior but may also affect the cortical thickness and surface area.

Itch is a distinct aversive sensation that elicits a strong urge to scratch. Despite recent advances in our understanding of the peripheral basis of itch, we know very little regarding how central neural circuits modulate acute and chronic itch processing. Here we establish the causal contributions of defined periaqueductal gray (PAG) neuronal populations in itch modulation. Chemogenetic manipulations demonstrate bidirectional modulation of scratching by neurons in the PAG. Fiber photometry studies show that activity of GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons in the PAG is modulated in an opposing manner during chloroquine-evoked scratching. Furthermore, activation of PAG GABAergic neurons or inhibition of glutamatergic neurons resulted in attenuation of scratching in both acute and chronic pruritis. Surprisingly, PAG GABAergic neurons, but not glutamatergic neurons, seem to encode the aversive component of itch. Thus, the PAG represents a neuromodulatory hub that regulates both the sensory and affective aspects of acute and chronic itch.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/486191v1?rss=1">Visual mismatch negativity to disappearing parts of objects and textures</a></h4>

Visual mismatch negativity (vMMN), an event-related signature of automatic detection of events violating sequential regularities is traditionally investigated to the onset of frequent (standard) and rare (deviant) events. In a previous study [4] we obtained vMMN to vanishing parts of continuously presented objects (diamonds with diagonals), and we concluded that the offset-related vMMN is a model of sensitivity to irregular partial occlusion of objects. In the present study we replicated the previous results, but to test the object-related interpretation we applied a new condition with a set of separate visual stimuli: a texture of bars with two orientations. In the texture condition (offset of bars with irregular vs. regular orientation) we obtained vMMN, showing that the continuous presence of objects is unnecessary for offset-related vMMN. However, unlike in the object-related condition, reappearance of the previously vanishing lines also elicited vMMN. In a formal way reappearance of the stimuli is an event with probability 1.0, and according to the results, object condition reappearance is an expected event. However, offset and onset of texture elements seems to be treated separately by the system underlying vMMN. As an advantage of the present method, the whole stimulus set during the inter-stimulus interval saturates the visual structures sensitive to stimulus input. Accordingly, the offset-related vMMN is less sensitive to low-level adaptation difference between the deviant and standard stimuli.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/486134v1?rss=1">Transcranial ultrasound selectively biases decision-making in primates</a></h4>

Transcranial focused ultrasound has the promise to evolve into a transformative noninvasive way to modulate activity of neuronal circuits deep in the brain. The approach may enable systematic and causal mapping of how individual brain circuits are involved in specific behaviors and behavioral disorders. Previous studies demonstrated neuromodulatory potential, but the effect polarity, size, and spatial specificity have been difficult to assess. Here, we engaged non-human primates (macaca mulatta) in an established task that provides a well defined framework to characterize the neuromodulatory effects. In this task, subjects decide whether to look at a right or a left target, guided by one the targets appearing first. Previous studies showed that excitation/inhibition of oculomotor circuits leads to contralateral/ipsilateral biases in this choice behavior. We found that brief, low-intensity ultrasound stimuli (300 ms, 0.6 MPa, 270 kHz) delivered to the animals' left/right frontal eye fields bias the animals' decisions to the right/left visual hemifield. The effect was modest, about on the order of that produced when injecting moderate amounts of potent neuromodulatory drugs into the same regions in this task. The polarity of the effects suggested a neuronal excitation within the stimulated regions. No effects were observed when we applied the same stimuli to control brain regions not involved in oculomotor target selection. Together, using an established paradigm, we found that transcranial ultrasound is capable of modulating neurons to the extent of biasing choice behavior of non-human primates. A demonstration of tangible, double-dissociated effects on behavior of primates constitutes a critical step toward applying this noninvasive neuromodulation method in investigations of how specific neural circuits are involved in specific behaviors or disease signs.

Manipulating feeding circuits in freely moving animals is challenging, in part because the timing of sensory inputs is affected by the animal's behavior. To address this challenge in Drosophila, we developed the Sip-Triggered Optogenetic Behavior Enclosure ("STROBE"). The STROBE is a closed-looped system for real-time optogenetic activation of feeding flies, designed to evoke neural excitation coincident with food contact. We demonstrate that optogenetic stimulation of sweet sensory neurons in the STROBE drives attraction to tasteless food, while activation of bitter sensory neurons promotes avoidance. Moreover, feeding behavior in the STROBE is modified by the fly's internal state, as well as the presence of chemical taste ligands. We also find that mushroom body dopaminergic neurons and their respective post-synaptic partners drive opposing feeding behaviors following activation. Together, these results establish the STROBE as a new tool for dissecting fly feeding circuits and suggest a role for mushroom body circuits in processing naive taste responses.

Taste responses in the rodent primary gustatory cortex (GC) span this sensorimotor divide, progressing through a series of firing rate epochs that culminate in the emergence of palatability-related firing. Population analyses reveal palatability-related activity to appear through sudden and coherent ensemble transitions that, despite occuring between 0.5s and 1.5s on individual trials, reliably precede gaping onset by 200-300ms. Here, we tested whether these transitions actually drive gaping, delivering 0.5s perturbations of GC at various points in tasting trials. Perturbations significantly delayed gaping, but only when they arrived before palatability coding. Thus, perturbation had no impact on trials in which the transition had already occurred, but the identical perturbation delayed gaping on trials in which it hadn't. Our results suggest a distributed attractor network model of taste processing, and a dynamical role for cortex in driving motor behavior.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/485813v1?rss=1">Norepinephrine improves attentional orienting in a predictive context</a></h4>

The role of norepinephrine (NE) in visuo-spatial attention remains poorly understood. Our goal was to identify the attentional processes under the influence of NE and to characterize these influences. We tested the effects of atomoxetine injections (ATX), a NE-reuptake inhibitor that boosts the level of NE in the brain, on seven monkeys performing a saccadic cued task in which cues and distractors were used to manipulate spatial attention. We found that when the cue accurately predicted the location of the upcoming cue in 80% of the trials, ATX consistently improved attentional orienting, as measured from reaction times (RTs). These effects were best accounted for by a faster accumulation rate in the valid trials, rather than by a change in the decision threshold. By contrast, the effect of ATX on alerting and distractor interference was more mitigated. Finally, we also found that, under ATX, RTs to non-cued targets were longer when these were presented separately from cued targets. This suggests that the impact of NE on visuo-spatial attention depends on the context, such that the adaptive changes elicited by the highly informative value of the cues in the most frequent trials were accompanied by a cost in the less frequent trials.

Coupling of neuronal oscillations may reflect and facilitate the communication between neuronal populations. Two primary neuronal coupling modes have been described: phase-coupling and amplitude-coupling. Theoretically, both coupling modes are independent, but so far, their neuronal relationship remains unclear. Here, we combined MEG, source-reconstruction and simulations to systematically compare cortical phase-coupling and amplitude-coupling patterns in the human brain. Importantly, we took into account a critical bias of amplitude-coupling measures due to phase-coupling. We found differences between both coupling modes across a broad frequency range and most of the cortex. Furthermore, by combining empirical measurements and simulations we ruled out that these results were caused by methodological biases, but instead reflected genuine neuronal amplitude coupling. Overall, our results suggest that cortical phase- and amplitude-coupling patterns result from distinct neural mechanisms. Furthermore, our findings highlight and clarify the compound nature of amplitude coupling measures.

                <h4><a href="http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/485250v1?rss=1">Modulation of fear generalization by the zona incerta</a></h4>

Fear expressed towards threat-associated stimuli is an adaptive behavioral response. In contrast, the generalization of fear responses toward non-threatening cues is maladaptive and a debilitating dimension of trauma- and anxiety-related disorders. Expressing fear to appropriate stimuli and suppressing fear generalization requires integration of relevant sensory information and motor output. While thalamic and sub-thalamic brain regions play important roles in sensorimotor integration, very little is known about the contribution of these regions to the phenomenon of fear generalization. In this study, we sought to determine whether fear generalization could be modulated by the zona incerta (ZI), a sub-thalamic brain region that influences sensory discrimination, defensive responses, and retrieval of fear memories. To do so, we combined differential intensity-based auditory fear conditioning protocols in mice with C-FOS immunohistochemistry and DREADD-based manipulation of neuronal activity in the ZI. C-FOS immunohistochemistry revealed an inverse relationship between ZI activation and fear generalization with the ZI being less active in animals that generalized fear. In agreement with this relationship, chemogenetic inhibition of the ZI resulted in fear generalization, while chemogenetic activation of the ZI suppressed fear generalization. Furthermore, targeted stimulation of GABAergic cells in the ZI reduced fear generalization. To conclude, our data suggest that stimulation of the ZI could be used to treat fear generalization in the context of trauma- and anxiety-related disorders.

The regulation of feeding plays a key role in determining the fitness of animals through its impact on nutrition. Elucidating the circuit basis of feeding and related behaviors is an important goal in neuroscience. We recently used a system for closed-loop optogenetic manipulation of neurons contingent on the flys feeding behavior to dissect the impact of a specific subset of taste neurons on yeast feeding (Steck et al., 2018). Here we describe the development and validation of this system, which we term the optoPAD. We use the optoPAD to induce appetitive and aversive effects on feeding by activating or inhibiting gustatory neurons in closed loop - effectively creating virtual taste realities. The use of optogenetics allowed us to vary the dynamics and probability of stimulation in single flies and assess the impact on feeding behavior quantitatively and with high throughput. These data demonstrate that the optoPAD is a powerful tool to dissect the circuit basis of feeding behavior, allowing the efficient implementation of sophisticated behavioral paradigms to study the mechanistic basis of animals adaptation to dynamic environments.

RNA editing is vital for neurodevelopment and the maintenance of normal neuronal function. We surveyed the global landscape and genetic regulation of RNA editing across several hundred schizophrenia and control postmortem brain samples from the CommonMind Consortium covering two regions, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and anterior cingulate cortex. In schizophrenia, RNA editing sites encoding AMPA glutamate receptors and post-synaptic density genes were less edited, while more editing was detected in sites implicated in translational initiation. These sites replicate between brain regions, map to 3UTRs, enrich for common sequence motifs and coincide for RNA binding proteins crucial for neurodevelopment. Importantly, these findings cross-validate in hundreds of non-overlapping DLPFC samples. Furthermore, ~30% of RNA editing sites associate with cis-regulatory variants (edQTLs). Fine-mapping edQTLs with schizophrenia GWAS loci revealed co-localization of 11 edQTLs with 6 GWAS loci. This supports a causal role of RNA editing in risk for schizophrenia. Our findings illustrate widespread altered RNA editing in schizophrenia and its genetic regulation, and shed light onto RNA editing-mediated mechanisms in schizophrenia neuropathology.

SARM1 (sterile  and HEAT/armadillo motifs containing protein) is a member of the MyD88 (myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88) family which mediates innate immune responses. Because inactivation of SARM1 prevents various forms of axonal degeneration, we tested whether it might protect against prion-induced neurotoxicity. Instead, we found that SARM1 deficiency exacerbates the progression of prion pathogenesis. This deleterious effect was not due to SARM1-dependent modulation of prion-induced neuroinflammation, since microglial activation, astrogliosis and brain cytokine profiles were not altered by SARM1 deficiency. Whole-transcriptome analyses indicated that SARM1 deficiency led to strong, selective overexpression of the pro-apoptotic gene XAF1 (X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis-associated factor 1). Consequently, the activity of proapoptotic caspases and neuronal death were enhanced in prion-infected SARM1-/- mice. These results point to an unexpected function of SARM1 as a regulator of prion-induced neurodegeneration, and suggest that XAF1 might constitute a therapeutic target in prion disease.

In social contexts individuals frequently act as social chameleons, synchronizing their responses with those of others. Such synchrony is believed to play an important role, promoting mutual emotional and social states. However, synchrony in facial signals, which serve as the main communicative channel between people, has not been systematically studied. To address this gap, we investigated the social spread of smiling dynamics in a naturalistic social setting and assessed its affiliative function. We also studied whether smiling synchrony between people is linked with convergence in their autonomic and emotional responses. To that aim we measured moment-by-moment changes in zygomatic electromyography and cardiovascular activity in dyads of previously unacquainted participants, who co-viewed emotional movies together. We found a robust, dyad-specific, zygomatic synchrony in co-viewing participants, after controlling for movie-driven effects. During the positive movie, zygomatic synchrony co-varied with cardiovascular synchrony and with convergence in positive feelings. No such links were found for the negative movie. Centrally, zygomatic synchrony in both emotional contexts predicted subsequently reported affiliative feelings of dyad members. These results demonstrate that a naturally unfolding smiling behavior is highly contagious. They further suggest that zygomatic synchrony functions as a social facilitator, eliciting affiliation towards previously unknown others.

Spontaneous otoacoustic emissions (SOAEs) are weak sounds that emanate from the ears of tetrapods in the absence of acoustic stimulation. These emissions are an epiphenomenon of the active process of the inner ear, which enhances the sensitivity of the auditory system to weak sounds, but their mechanism of production remains a matter of debate. To understand the relationship between SOAEs that we recorded simultaneously from the two ears of the tokay gecko, we developed a mathematical model of the eardrums as noisy nonlinear oscillators coupled by the air within the mouth of a lizard. We found that binaural emissions could be strongly correlated: some emissions occurred at the same frequency in both ears and were highly synchronized. Suppression of the emissions in one ear often changed the amplitude or shifted the frequency of emissions in the other. Decreasing the frequency of emissions from one ear by lowering its temperature usually reduced the frequency of the contralateral emissions. By according with the model, the results indicate that some SOAEs are generated bilaterally through acoustic coupling across the oral cavity. The model predicts that sound localization through the acoustic coupling between ears is influenced by the active processes of both ears.

Behavioral adaptations during performance rely on predicting and evaluating the consequences of our actions through action monitoring. Previous studies revealed that proprioceptive and exteroceptive signals contribute to error-monitoring processes, which are implemented in the posterior medial frontal cortex. Interestingly, errors trigger changes in autonomic nervous system activity such as pupil dilation or heartbeat deceleration. Yet, the contribution of implicit interoceptive signals of bodily states to error-monitoring during ongoing performance has been overlooked. This is more surprising given the evidence on the relevance of interoceptive signals for the modulation of perceptual, affective and cognitive processes. We investigated whether cardiovascular interoceptive signals influence the neural correlates of error processing during performance, with an emphasis on the early stages of error processing. We recorded participants' electroencephalography and electrocardiogram during the performance of highly-trained music pieces in musicians. Previous event-related potential (ERP) studies revealed that pitch errors during skilled musical performance are preceded by an error detection signal, the pre-error-negativity (preERN), and followed by a later error positivity (PE). In this study, by combining ERP, source localization and multivariate pattern classification analysis, we found that the error-correct ERP waveform had a larger amplitude within 40-100 ms following errors in the systolic period of the cardiac cycle. This component could be decoded from single-trials, was dissociated from the preERN and PE, and stemmed from the inferior parietal cortex, which is a region implicated in cardiac autonomic regulation. In addition, the cardiac phase influenced behavioral alterations resulting from errors, with a smaller post-error slowing and less perturbed velocity in keystrokes following pitch errors in the systole phase of the cardiac cycle. This study provides the first evidence of preconscious visceral information modulating neural and behavioral responses related to early error monitoring during skilled performance.

Purpose: Fiber tracking with diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging has become an essential tool for estimating in vivo brain white matter architecture. Fiber tracking results are sensitive to the choice of processing method and tracking criteria. Phantom studies provide concrete quantitative comparisons of methods relative to absolute ground truths, yet do not capture variabilities because of in vivo physiological factors. Methods: To date, a large-scale reproducibility analysis has not been performed for the assessment of the newest generation of tractography algorithms with in vivo data. Reproducibility does not assess the validity of a brain connection however it is still of critical importance because it describes the variability for an algorithm in group studies. The ISMRM 2017 TraCED challenge was created to fulfill the gap. The TraCED dataset consists of a single healthy volunteer scanned on two different scanners of the same manufacturer. The multi-shell acquisition included b-values of 1000, 2000 and 3000 s/mm2 with 20, 45 and 64 diffusion gradient directions per shell, respectively. Results: Nine international groups submitted 46 tractography algorithm entries. The top five submissions had high ICC &gt; 0.88. Reproducibility is high within these top 5 submissions when assessed across sessions or across scanners. However, it can be directly attributed to containment of smaller volume tracts in larger volume tracts. This holds true for the top five submissions where they are contained in a specific order. While most algorithms are contained in an ordering there are some outliers. Conclusion: The different methods clearly result in fundamentally different tract structures at the more conservative specificity choices (i.e., volumetrically smaller tractograms). The data and challenge infrastructure remain available for continued analysis and provide a platform for comparison.

Cerebellar granule cells are a popular target of neuroanatomical hyperbole, being so small and so numerous. Early theorists proposed unique roles for this vast cell population, ideas that continue to be tested through contemporary approaches. In 2017, a cluster of empirical and theoretical papers offered a fresh and singular look into the functions of granule cells and the computational advantages of their idiosyncratic circuit organization.

Locomotion is generated by intrinsically oscillating circuits in the spinal cord that are modulated by information from the brain and periphery. In their seminal 1987 publication, Buchanan and Grillner provided for the first time evidence for excitatory spinal neurons receiving inputs from descending commands and sensory afferents, and synapsing onto motoneurons and commissural inhibitory interneurons. These critical findings established the circuit model for central pattern generators incorporating excitatory interneurons’ role in the rhythm-production mechanism.

The Hedgehog (Hh) pathway is a highly conserved signaling system regulating a range of developmental processes. A 1997 paper by Goodrich and colleagues provided major contributions to understanding the Hh pathway by mutating the gene encoding the Hh receptor, Patched, and thereby developing a mouse model for a human cancer predisposition syndrome, known as Gorlin syndrome. These studies provided one of the first genetically engineered mouse models for brain tumors.

Across the animal kingdom, odors are known as potent stimuli that directly steer behavior. In 2007, Hitoshi Sakano and colleagues used the power of mouse genetics to manipulate the odor map in the olfactory bulb. Elegant behavioral, anatomical, and physiological analyses revealed an apparent dichotomy in how the brain interprets the odor map. Their work paved a way to think of behavioral contingencies as part of early olfactory processing, highlighting innate and learned pathways.

<p>by Joanne C. Van Slooten, Sara Jahfari, Tomas Knapen, Jan Theeuwes</p>

Cognition can reveal itself in the pupil, as latent cognitive processes map onto specific pupil responses. For instance, the pupil dilates when we make decisions and these pupil size fluctuations reflect decision-making computations during and after a choice. Surprisingly little is known, however, about how pupil responses relate to decisions driven by the learned value of stimuli. This understanding is important, as most real-life decisions are guided by the outcomes of earlier choices. The goal of this study was to investigate which cognitive processes the pupil reflects during value-based decision-making. We used a reinforcement learning task to study pupil responses during value-based decisions and subsequent decision evaluations, employing computational modeling to quantitatively describe the underlying cognitive processes. We found that the pupil closely tracks reinforcement learning processes independently across participants and across trials. Prior to choice, the pupil dilated as a function of trial-by-trial fluctuations in value beliefs about the to-be chosen option and predicted an individual’s tendency to exploit high value options. After feedback a biphasic pupil response was observed, the amplitude of which correlated with participants’ learning rates. Furthermore, across trials, early feedback-related dilation scaled with value uncertainty, whereas later constriction scaled with signed reward prediction errors. These findings show that pupil size fluctuations can provide detailed information about the computations underlying value-based decisions and the subsequent updating of value beliefs. As these processes are affected in a host of psychiatric disorders, our results indicate that pupillometry can be used as an accessible tool to non-invasively study the processes underlying ongoing reinforcement learning in the clinic.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/5hv21urPU1s" width="1" />

<p>by Wei Wang, Shanzhuo Zhang, Haibo Ni, Clifford J. Garratt, Mark R. Boyett, Jules C. Hancox, Henggui Zhang</p>

Cardiac electrical alternans (CEA), manifested as T-wave alternans in ECG, is a clinical biomarker for predicting cardiac arrhythmias and sudden death. However, the mechanism underlying the spontaneous transition from CEA to arrhythmias remains incompletely elucidated. In this study, multiscale rabbit ventricular models were used to study the transition and a potential role of <i>I</i><sub>Na</sub> in perpetuating such a transition. It was shown CEA evolved into either concordant or discordant action potential (AP) conduction alternans in a homogeneous one-dimensional tissue model, depending on tissue AP duration and conduction velocity (CV) restitution properties. Discordant alternans was able to cause conduction failure in the model, which was promoted by impaired sodium channel with either a reduced or increased channel current. In a two-dimensional homogeneous tissue model, a combined effect of rate- and curvature-dependent CV broke-up alternating wavefronts at localised points, facilitating a spontaneous transition from CEA to re-entry. Tissue inhomogeneity or anisotropy further promoted break-up of re-entry, leading to multiple wavelets. Similar observations have also been seen in human atrial cellular and tissue models. In conclusion, our results identify a mechanism by which CEA spontaneously evolves into re-entry without a requirement for premature ventricular complexes or pre-existing tissue heterogeneities, and demonstrated the important pro-arrhythmic role of impaired sodium channel activity. These findings are model-independent and have potential human relevance.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ulraRupDlYg" width="1" />

Toxicity is an important factor in failed drug development, and its efficient identification and prediction is a major challenge in drug discovery. We have explored the potential of microscopy images of fluorescently labeled nuclei for the prediction of toxicity based on nucleus pattern recognition. Deep learning algorithms obtain abstract representations of images through an automated process, allowing them to efficiently classify complex patterns, and have become the state-of-the art in machine learning for computer vision. Here, deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) were trained to predict toxicity from images of DAPI-stained cells pre-treated with a set of drugs with differing toxicity mechanisms. Different cropping strategies were used for training CNN models, the nuclei-cropping-based Tox_CNN model outperformed other models classifying cells according to health status. Tox_CNN allowed automated extraction of feature maps that clustered compounds according to mechanism of action. Moreover, fully automated region-based CNNs (RCNN) were implemented to detect and classify nuclei, providing per-cell toxicity prediction from raw screening images. We validated both Tox_(R)CNN models for detection of pre-lethal toxicity from nuclei images, which proved to be more sensitive and have broader specificity than established toxicity readouts. These models predicted toxicity of drugs with mechanisms of action other than those they had been trained for and were successfully transferred to other cell assays. The Tox_(R)CNN models thus provide robust, sensitive, and cost-effective tools for <i>in vitro</i> screening of drug-induced toxicity. These models can be adopted for compound prioritization in drug screening campaigns, and could thereby increase the efficiency of drug discovery.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rKs-Qld8OJg" width="1" />

<p>Levodopa‐induced dyskinesia is a common complication in Parkinson disease. Pathogenic mechanisms include phasic stimulation of dopamine receptors, nonphysiological levodopa‐to‐dopamine conversion in serotonergic neurons, hyperactivity of corticostriatal glutamatergic transmission, and overstimulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on dopamine‐releasing axons. Delay in initiating levodopa is no longer recommended, as dyskinesia development is a function of disease duration rather than cumulative levodopa exposure. We review current and in‐development treatments for peak‐dose dyskinesia but suggest that improvements in levodopa delivery alone may reduce its future prevalence. Ann Neurol 2018</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Cortical gray matter (GM) pathology, involving demyelination and neurodegeneration, associated with meningeal inflammation, could be important in determining disability progression in multiple sclerosis (MS). However, we need to know more about how cortical demyelination, neurodegeneration, and meningeal inflammation contribute to pathology at early stages of MS to better predict long‐term outcome.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Tissue blocks from short disease duration MS (n = 12, median disease duration = 2 years), progressive MS (n = 21, disease duration = 25 years), non‐diseased controls (n = 11), and other neurological inflammatory disease controls (n = 6) were quantitatively analyzed by immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and in situ hybridization.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Cortical GM demyelination was extensive in some cases of acute MS (range = 1–48% of total cortical GM), and subpial lesions were the most common type (62%). The numbers of activated (CD68<sup>+</sup>) microglia/macrophages were increased in cases with subpial lesions, and the density of neurons was significantly reduced in acute MS normal appearing and lesion GM, compared to controls (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.005). Significant meningeal inflammation and lymphoid‐like structures were seen in 4 of 12 acute MS cases. The extent of meningeal inflammation correlated with microglial/macrophage activation (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), but not the area of cortical demyelination, reflecting the finding that lymphoid‐like structures were seen adjacent to GM lesions as well as areas of partially demyelinated/remyelinated, cortical GM.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our findings demonstrate that cortical demyelination, neuronal loss, and meningeal inflammation are notable pathological hallmarks of acute MS and support the need to identify early biomarkers of this pathology to better predict outcome. Ann Neurol 2018</p>

<p>We conducted a European‐only and transancestral genome‐wide association meta‐analysis in 72,147 stroke patients and 823,869 controls using data from UK Biobank (UKB) and the MEGASTROKE consortium. We identified an exonic polymorphism in <i>NOS3</i> (rs1799983, p.Glu298Asp; <i>p</i> = 2.2E‐8, odds ratio [OR] = 1.05, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.04–1.07) and variants in an intron of <i>COL4A1</i> (rs9521634; <i>p</i> = 3.8E‐8, OR = 1.04, 95% CI = 1.03–1.06) and near <i>DYRK1A</i> (rs720470; <i>p</i> = 6.1E‐9, OR = 1.05, 95% CI = 1.03–1.07) at genome‐wide significance for stroke. Effect sizes of known stroke loci were highly correlated between UKB and MEGASTROKE. Using Mendelian randomization, we further show that genetic variation in the nitric oxide synthase–nitric oxide pathway in part affects stroke risk via variation in blood pressure.

<p>Patients with visual snow syndrome (VS) suffer from a debilitating continuous visual disturbance of unknown mechanism. The present study tested the hypothesis of dysfunctional visual processing using visual evoked potentials. Eighteen patients were compared to age‐matched migraineurs (M) and healthy controls (C) using 2‐way analysis of variance with group (VS, M, C) and gender as factors. Visual evoked potentials from patients with VS demonstrated increased N145 latency (in milliseconds, VS: 152.7 ± 7.9 vs M: 145.3 ± 9.8 vs C: 145.5 ± 9.4; <i>F</i> = 3.28; <i>p</i> = 0.046) and reduced N75–P100 amplitudes (in microvolts, VS: 7.4 ± 3.5 vs M: 12.5 ± 4.7 vs C: 10.8 ± 3.4; <i>F</i> = 3.16; <i>p</i> = 0.051). Dunnett post hoc analysis was significant for all comparisons between VS and controls. These findings are in agreement with the idea that the primary disturbance in VS is a dysfunction of the visual association cortex. Ann Neurol 2018</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Approximately 5% of cerebral small vessel diseases are hereditary, which include <i>COL4A1/COL4A2</i>‐related disorders. <i>COL4A1/COL4A2</i> encode type IV collagen α1/2 chains in the basement membranes of cerebral vessels. <i>COL4A1/COL4A2</i> mutations impair the secretion of collagen to the extracellular matrix, thereby resulting in vessel fragility. The diagnostic yield for <i>COL4A1/COL4A2</i> variants is around 20 to 30%, suggesting other mutated genes might be associated with this disease. This study aimed to identify novel genes that cause <i>COL4A1/COL4A2</i>‐related disorders.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Whole exome sequencing was performed in 2 families with suspected <i>COL4A1/COL4A2</i>‐related disorders. We validated the role of <i>COLGALT1</i> variants by constructing a 3‐dimensional structural model, evaluating collagen β (1‐O) galactosyltransferase 1 (ColGalT1) protein expression and ColGalT activity by Western blotting and collagen galactosyltransferase assays, and performing in vitro RNA interference and rescue experiments.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Exome sequencing demonstrated biallelic variants in <i>COLGALT1</i> encoding ColGalT1, which was involved in the post‐translational modification of type IV collagen in 2 unrelated patients: c.452 T &gt; G (p.Leu151Arg) and c.1096delG (p.Glu366Argfs*15) in Patient 1, and c.460G &gt; C (p.Ala154Pro) and c.1129G &gt; C (p.Gly377Arg) in Patient 2. Three‐dimensional model analysis suggested that p.Leu151Arg and p.Ala154Pro destabilized protein folding, which impaired enzymatic activity. ColGalT1 protein expression and ColGalT activity in Patient 1 were undetectable. RNA interference studies demonstrated that reduced ColGalT1 altered COL4A1 secretion, and rescue experiments showed that mutant <i>COLGALT1</i> insufficiently restored COL4A1 production in cells compared with wild type.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Biallelic <i>COLGALT1</i> variants cause cerebral small vessel abnormalities through a common molecular pathogenesis with <i>COL4A1/COL4A2</i>‐related disorders. Ann Neurol 2018</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The trigeminal autonomic reflex plays an important role in primary headache syndromes. Noninvasive vagal nerve stimulation (nVNS) may be an effective modulator of this reflex.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Twenty‐two healthy volunteers underwent kinetic oscillation stimulation (KOS) of the left nostril as a reliable trigger of the trigeminal autonomic reflex. Previous to KOS, left cervical nVNS, sham simulation, or no stimulation was applied. Lacrimation was quantified using the standardized Schirmer ll test.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Treatment with cervical nVNS significantly reduced lacrimation between no stimulation and nVNS on the ipsilateral side (minute 5: <i>p</i> = 0.026, η<i>p</i>
   <sup>2</sup> = 0.85, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.39–18.04; no stimulation: minute 5, 14.4 ± 9.3 mm; nVNS: minute 5, 4.7 ± 8.6 mm, mean ± standard deviation) as well as between sham stimulation and nVNS (minute 5: <i>p</i> = 0.030, η<i>p</i>
   <sup>2</sup> = 0.85, 95% CI = 1.04–17.24; sham: minute 5, 13.9 ± 6.4 mm). On the contralateral side, no significant increase between baseline and KOS was observed for nVNS (minute 5: <i>p</i> = 0.614, <i>d</i> = 0.12, 95% CI = −7.09 to 4.31; minute 5, 1.4 ± 11.5 mm) compared to both sham stimulation (minute 5: <i>p</i> = 0.023, <i>d</i> = 0.57, 95% CI = −11.46 to −0.96; minute 5, 6.2 ± 10.9 mm) and no stimulation (minute 5: <i>p</i> &lt; 0.030, <i>d</i> = 0.62, 95% CI = −13.45 to −0.81; minute 5, 7.1 ± 11.4 mm).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Cervical nVNS resulted in a robust bilateral reduction of provoked lacrimation. This effect could be mediated either by direct bilateral activation of structures such as the nucleus of the solitary tract or by a top‐down modulation via the hypothalamus. Ann Neurol 2018</p>

<p>To understand how neural networks process information, it is important to
investigate how neural network dynamics varies with respect to different
stimuli. One challenging task is to design efficient statistical approaches to
analyze multiple spike train data obtained from a short recording time. Based
on the development of high-dimensional statistical methods, it is able to deal
with data whose dimension is much larger than the sample size. However, these
methods often require statistically independent samples to start with, while
neural data are correlated over consecutive sampling time bins. We develop an
approach to pretreat neural data to become independent samples over time by
transferring the correlation of dynamics for each neuron in different sampling
time bins into the correlation of dynamics among different dimensions within
each sampling time bin. We verify the method using simulation data generated
from Integrate-and-fire neuron network models and a large-scale network model
of primary visual cortex within a short time, e.g., a few seconds. Our method
may offer experimenters to use the advantage of the development of statistical
methods to analyze high-dimensional neural data.

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12245">Effect of time of day on reward circuitry: Further thoughts on methods, prompted by Steel et al 2018. (arXiv:1811.12245v1 [q-bio.NC])</a></h4>

<p>The normative interplay between circadian and reward function is well
understood in animal models, and is of growing interest as an aetiological
explanation in psychopathologies. While circadian modulation of reward function
has been demonstrated in human behavioural data, a key gap is lack information
at the neural level. In 2017, we published results of a first step in
addressing this lacuna, demonstrating a diurnal rhythm in fMRI-measured reward
activation. In 2018, Steel et al wrote a constructive critique of our findings,
and the aim of this paper is to outline how future research could improve on
our first proof-of-concept study. Key challenges include addressing divergent
and convergent validity (by addressing non-reward neural variation, and testing
for absence of variation in threat-related pathways), preregistration and power
analysis to protect against false positives, wider range of fMRI methods (to
directly test our post-hoc hypothesis of some form of reward prediction error,
and multiple phases of reward), the parallel collection of behavioural data
(particularly self-reported positive affect, and actigraphically measured
activity) to illuminate the nature of the reward activation across the day, and
some attempt to parse out circadian versus homeostatic/masking influences on
any observed diurnal rhythm in neural reward activation.

<p>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are commonly thought to recognise
objects by learning increasingly complex representations of object shapes. Some
recent studies hint to a more important role of image textures. We here put
these conflicting hypotheses to a quantitative test by evaluating CNNs and
human observers on images with a texture-shape cue conflict. We show that
ImageNet-trained CNNs are strongly biased towards recognising textures rather
than shapes, which is in stark contrast to human behavioural evidence and
reveals fundamentally different classification strategies. We then demonstrate
that the same standard architecture (ResNet-50) that learns a texture-based
representation on ImageNet is able to learn a shape-based representation
instead when trained on "Stylized-ImageNet", a stylized version of ImageNet.
This provides a much better fit for human behavioural performance in our
well-controlled psychophysical lab setting (nine experiments totalling 48,560
psychophysical trials across 97 observers) and comes with a number of
unexpected emergent benefits such as improved object detection performance and
previously unseen robustness towards a wide range of image distortions,
highlighting advantages of a shape-based representation.

<p>We study the statistical properties of the stationary firing-rate states of a
neural network model with quenched disorder. The model has arbitrary size,
discrete-time evolution equations and binary firing rates, while the topology
and the strength of the synaptic connections are randomly generated from known,
generally arbitrary, probability distributions. We derived semi-analytical
expressions of the occurrence probability of the stationary states and the mean
multistability diagram of the model, in terms of the distribution of the
synaptic connections and of the external stimuli to the network. Our
calculations rely on the probability distribution of the bifurcation points of
the stationary states with respect to the external stimuli, which can be
calculated in terms of the permanent of special matrices, according to extreme
value theory. While our semi-analytical expressions are exact for any size of
the network and for any distribution of the synaptic connections, we also
specialized our calculations to the case of statistically-homogeneous
multi-population networks. In the specific case of this network topology, we
calculated analytically the permanent, obtaining a compact formula that
outperforms of several orders of magnitude the
Balasubramanian-Bax-Franklin-Glynn algorithm. To conclude, by applying the
Fisher-Tippett-Gnedenko theorem, we derived asymptotic expressions of the
stationary-state statistics of multi-population networks in the
large-network-size limit, in terms of the Gumbel (double exponential)
distribution. We also provide a Python implementation of our formulas and some
examples of the results generated by the code.

<p>Stochastic resonance is a non-linear phenomenon, in which the sensitivity of
signal detectors can be enhanced by adding random noise to the detector input.
Here, we demonstrate that noise can also improve the information flux in
recurrent neural networks. In particular, we show for the case of three-neuron
motifs that the mutual information between successive network states can be
maximized by adding a suitable amount of noise to the neuron inputs. This
striking result suggests that noise in the brain may not be a problem that
needs to be suppressed, but indeed a resource that is dynamically regulated in
order to optimize information processing.

<p>The field of brain-computer interfaces is poised to advance from the
traditional goal of controlling prosthetic devices using brain signals to
combining neural decoding and encoding within a single neuroprosthetic device.
Such a device acts as a "co-processor" for the brain, with applications ranging
from inducing Hebbian plasticity for rehabilitation after brain injury to
reanimating paralyzed limbs and enhancing memory. We review recent progress in
simultaneous decoding and encoding for closed-loop control and plasticity
induction. To address the challenge of multi-channel decoding and encoding, we
introduce a unifying framework for developing brain co-processors based on
artificial neural networks and deep learning. These "neural co-processors" can
be used to jointly optimize cost functions with the nervous system to achieve
desired behaviors ranging from targeted neuro-rehabilitation to augmentation of
brain function.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/41301">The spatial separation of processing and transport functions to the interior and periphery of the Golgi stack</a></h4>

It is unclear how the two principal functions of the Golgi complex, processing and transport, are spatially organized. Studying such spatial organization by optical imaging is challenging, partially due to the dense packing of stochastically oriented Golgi stacks. Using super-resolution microscopy and markers such as Giantin, we developed a method to identify en face and side views of individual nocodazole-induced Golgi mini-stacks. Our imaging uncovered that Golgi enzymes preferentially localize to the cisternal interior, appearing as a central disk or inner-ring, whereas components of the trafficking machinery reside at the periphery of the stack, including the cisternal rim. Interestingly, conventional secretory cargos appeared at the cisternal interior during their intra-Golgi trafficking and transiently localized to the cisternal rim before exiting the Golgi. In contrast, bulky cargos were found only at the rim. Our study therefore directly demonstrates the spatial separation of processing and transport functions within the Golgi complex.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/41090">Rejection of immunogenic tumor clones is limited by clonal fraction</a></h4>

Tumors often co-exist with T cells that recognize somatically mutated peptides presented by cancer cells on major histocompatibility complex I (MHC-I). However, it is unknown why the immune system fails to eliminate immune-recognizable neoplasms before they manifest as frank disease. To understand the determinants of MHC-I peptide immunogenicity in nascent tumors, we tested the ability of thousands of MHC-I ligands to cause tumor subclone rejection in immunocompetent mice by use of a new ‘PresentER’ antigen presentation platform. Surprisingly, we show that immunogenic tumor antigens do not lead to immune-mediated cell rejection when the fraction of cells bearing each antigen (‘clonal fraction’) is low. Moreover, the clonal fraction necessary to lead to rejection of immunogenic tumor subclones depends on the antigen. These data indicate that tumor neoantigen heterogeneity has an underappreciated impact on immune elimination of cancer cells and has implications for the design of immunotherapeutics such as cancer vaccines.

Vertebrate pelvic reduction is a classic example of repeated evolution. Recurrent loss of pelvic appendages in sticklebacks has previously been linked to natural mutations in a pelvic enhancer that maps upstream of <i>Pitx1</i>. The sequence of this upstream <i>PelA</i> enhancer is not conserved to mammals, so we have surveyed a large region surrounding the mouse <i>Pitx1</i> gene for other possible hind limb control sequences. Here we identify a new pelvic enhancer, <i>PelB</i>, that maps downstream rather than upstream of <i>Pitx1. PelB</i> drives expression in the posterior portion of the developing hind limb, and deleting the sequence from mice alters the size of several hind limb structures. <i>PelB</i> sequences are broadly conserved from fish to mammals. A wild stickleback population lacking the pelvis has an insertion/deletion mutation that disrupts the structure and function of <i>PelB</i>, suggesting that changes in this ancient enhancer contribute to evolutionary modification of pelvic appendages in nature.

The discovery of genetic forms of Parkinson’s disease (PD) has highlighted the importance of the autophagy/lysosomal and mitochondrial/oxidative stress pathways in disease pathogenesis. However, recently identified PD-linked genes, including DNAJC6 (auxilin), SYNJ1 (synaptojanin 1), and the PD risk gene SH3GL2 (endophilin A1), have also highlighted disruptions in synaptic vesicle endocytosis (SVE) as a significant contributor to disease pathogenesis. Additionally, the roles of other PD genes such as LRRK2, PRKN, and VPS35 in the regulation of SVE are beginning to emerge.

<p>by Brandon M. Butler, I. Can Kazan, Avishek Kumar, S. Banu Ozkan</p>

The conformational dynamics of proteins is rarely used in methodologies used to predict the impact of genetic mutations due to the paucity of three-dimensional protein structures as compared to the vast number of available sequences. Until now a three-dimensional (3D) structure has been required to predict the conformational dynamics of a protein. We introduce an approach that estimates the conformational dynamics of a protein, without relying on structural information. This <i>de novo</i> approach utilizes coevolving residues identified from a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) using Potts models. These coevolving residues are used as contacts in a Gaussian network model (GNM) to obtain protein dynamics. B-factors calculated using sequence-based GNM (Seq-GNM) are in agreement with crystallographic B-factors as well as theoretical B-factors from the original GNM that utilizes the 3D structure. Moreover, we demonstrate the ability of the calculated B-factors from the Seq-GNM approach to discriminate genomic variants according to their phenotypes for a wide range of proteins. These results suggest that protein dynamics can be approximated based on sequence information alone, making it possible to assess the phenotypes of nSNVs in cases where a 3D structure is unknown. We hope this work will promote the use of dynamics information in genetic disease prediction at scale by circumventing the need for 3D structures.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/wxCLJAXCQQo" width="1" />

<p>by Holger Mohr, Katharina Zwosta, Dimitrije Markovic, Sebastian Bitzer, Uta Wolfensteller, Hannes Ruge</p>

Trial-and-error learning is a universal strategy for establishing which actions are beneficial or harmful in new environments. However, learning stimulus-response associations solely via trial-and-error is often suboptimal, as in many settings dependencies among stimuli and responses can be exploited to increase learning efficiency. Previous studies have shown that in settings featuring such dependencies, humans typically engage high-level cognitive processes and employ advanced learning strategies to improve their learning efficiency. Here we analyze in detail the initial learning phase of a sample of human subjects (N = 85) performing a trial-and-error learning task with deterministic feedback and hidden stimulus-response dependencies. Using computational modeling, we find that the standard Q-learning model cannot sufficiently explain human learning strategies in this setting. Instead, newly introduced deterministic response models, which are theoretically optimal and transform stimulus sequences unambiguously into response sequences, provide the best explanation for 50.6% of the subjects. Most of the remaining subjects either show a tendency towards generic optimal learning (21.2%) or at least partially exploit stimulus-response dependencies (22.3%), while a few subjects (5.9%) show no clear preference for any of the employed models. After the initial learning phase, asymptotic learning performance during the subsequent practice phase is best explained by the standard Q-learning model. Our results show that human learning strategies in the presented trial-and-error learning task go beyond merely associating stimuli and responses via incremental reinforcement. Specifically during initial learning, high-level cognitive processes support sophisticated learning strategies that increase learning efficiency while keeping memory demands and computational efforts bounded. The good asymptotic fit of the Q-learning model indicates that these cognitive processes are successively replaced by the formation of stimulus-response associations over the course of learning.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/PG_zAuAfJnk" width="1" />

To map the neural substrate of mental function, cognitive neuroimaging relies on controlled psychological manipulations that engage brain systems associated with specific cognitive processes. In order to build comprehensive atlases of cognitive function in the brain, it must assemble maps for many different cognitive processes, which often evoke overlapping patterns of activation. Such data aggregation faces contrasting goals: on the one hand finding correspondences across vastly different cognitive experiments, while on the other hand precisely describing the function of any given brain region. Here we introduce a new analysis framework that tackles these difficulties and thereby enables the generation of brain atlases for cognitive function. The approach leverages ontologies of cognitive concepts and multi-label brain decoding to map the neural substrate of these concepts. We demonstrate the approach by building an atlas of functional brain organization based on 30 diverse functional neuroimaging studies, totaling 196 different experimental conditions. Unlike conventional brain mapping, this functional atlas supports robust <i>reverse inference</i>: predicting the mental processes from brain activity in the regions delineated by the atlas. To establish that this reverse inference is indeed governed by the corresponding concepts, and not idiosyncrasies of experimental designs, we show that it can accurately decode the cognitive concepts recruited in new tasks. These results demonstrate that aggregating independent task-fMRI studies can provide a more precise global atlas of selective associations between brain and cognition.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/5NpxV5X7aGY" width="1" />

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Traditionally, angiographic vasospasm (aVS) has been thought to cause delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). However, successful treatment of aVS alone does not result in improved neurological outcome. Therefore, there may be other potential causes of poor neurological outcome, including spreading depolarization (SD). A recent study showed beneficial effects of cilostazol on DCI and neurological outcome. The present prospective clinical trial and experimental study focused on effects of cilostazol on SDs.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Fifty aSAH patients were treated with clip ligation and randomly assigned to a cilostazol (n = 23) or control group (n = 27). Effects of cilostazol on DCI, aVS, and SDs, measured with subdural electrodes, were examined. The effect of cilostazol on SD‐induced perfusion deficits (spreading ischemia) was assessed in an aSAH‐mimicking model.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>There was a trend for less DCI in the cilostazol group, but it did not reach our threshold for statistical significance (13.0% vs 40.0%, odds ratio = 0.266, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.059–1.192, <i>p</i> = 0.084). However, the total SD‐induced depression duration per recording day (22.2 vs 30.2 minutes, β = −251.905, 95% CI = −488.458 to −15.356, <i>p</i> = 0.043) and the occurrence of isoelectric SDs (0 vs 4 patients, β = −0.916, 95% CI = −1.746 to −0.085, <i>p</i> = 0.037) were significantly lower in the cilostazol group. In rats, cilostazol significantly shortened SD‐induced spreading ischemia compared to vehicle (Student <i>t</i> test, difference = 30.2, 95% CI = 5.3–55.1, <i>p</i> = 0.020).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Repair of the neurovascular response to SDs by cilostazol, as demonstrated in the aSAH‐mimicking model, may be a promising therapy to control DCI. Ann Neurol 2018; 1–13</p>

Abstract<p>Abnormal gamma band power across cortex and striatum is an important phenotype of Huntington's disease (HD) in both patients and animal models, but neither the origin nor the functional relevance of this phenotype is well understood. Here, we analyzed local field potential (LFP) activity in freely behaving, symptomatic R6/2 and Q175 mouse models and corresponding wild-type (WT) controls. We focused on periods of quiet rest, which show strong gamma activity in HD mice. Simultaneous recording from motor cortex and its target area in dorsal striatum in the R6/2 model revealed exaggerated functional coupling over that observed in WT between the phase of delta frequencies (1-4 Hz) in cortex and striatum and striatal amplitude modulation of low gamma frequencies (25-55 Hz) (i.e. "phase amplitude coupling"), but no evidence that abnormal cortical activity alone can account for the increase in striatal gamma power. Both HD mouse models had stronger coupling of gamma amplitude to delta phase and more uni-modal phase distributions than their WT counterparts. To assess the possible role of striatal fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs) in these phenomena, we developed a computational model based on additional striatal recordings from Q175 mice. Changes in peak gamma frequency and power ratio were readily reproduced by our computational model, accounting for several experimental findings reported in the literature. Our results suggest that HD is characterized by both a reorganization of cortico-striatal drive and specific population changes related to intra-striatal synaptic coupling.</p><p><b>Significance statement</b> In HD, functional impairments first impact movement (chorea, dyskinesia) and cognition (executive functions, abstract thinking). Neuronal dysfunction associated with deficits appear first in cerebral cortex and striatum, which displays abnormally strong power in the low gamma band (25-55 Hz). Fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs) are a neuronal subtype putatively capable of forming networks that resonate at the gamma frequency. Here we show that FSI networks can implement an early routing bias for more abundant neuronal subtypes in striatum. Specifically, by analyzing <i>in vivo</i> electrophysiological recordings from HD mice at rest when gamma is strong and using computational modeling, we identify coupling changes between cortex and striatum sufficient to generate periods of abnormal FSI network gamma in response to slow wave cortical inputs.</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>N‐acetylcysteine (NAC) is a clinically approved thiol‐containing redox modulatory compound currently in trials for many neurological and psychiatric disorders. Although generically labeled as an “antioxidant,” poor understanding of its site(s) of action is a barrier to its use in neurological practice. Here, we examined the efficacy and mechanism of action of NAC in rodent models of hemorrhagic stroke.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Hemin was used to model ferroptosis and hemorrhagic stroke in cultured neurons. Striatal infusion of collagenase was used to model intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) in mice and rats. Chemical biology, targeted lipidomics, arachidonate 5‐lipoxygenase (ALOX5) knockout mice, and viral‐gene transfer were used to gain insight into the pharmacological targets and mechanism of action of NAC.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>NAC prevented hemin‐induced ferroptosis by neutralizing toxic lipids generated by arachidonate‐dependent ALOX5 activity. NAC efficacy required increases in glutathione and is correlated with suppression of reactive lipids by glutathione‐dependent enzymes such as glutathione <i>S</i>‐transferase. Accordingly, its protective effects were mimicked by chemical or molecular lipid peroxidation inhibitors. NAC delivered postinjury reduced neuronal death and improved functional recovery at least 7 days following ICH in mice and can synergize with clinically approved prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> (PGE<sub>2</sub>).</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>NAC is a promising, protective therapy for ICH, which acted to inhibit toxic arachidonic acid products of nuclear ALOX5 that synergized with exogenously delivered protective PGE<sub>2</sub> in vitro and in vivo. The findings provide novel insight into a target for NAC, beyond the generic characterization as an antioxidant, resulting in neuroprotection and offer a feasible combinatorial strategy to optimize efficacy and safety in dosing of NAC for treatment of neurological disorders involving ferroptosis such as ICH.

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The spectrum of clinical symptom changes during the course of Parkinson disease (PD). Levodopa therapy, while offering remarkable control of classical motor symptoms, causes abnormal involuntary movements as the disease progresses. This levodopa‐induced dyskinesia (LID) has been associated with abnormal cortical plasticity. Because slow wave activity (SWA) of nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep underlies adjustment of cortical excitability, we sought to elucidate the relationship between this physiological process and LID.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Thirty‐six patients at different stages of PD underwent whole‐night video polysomnography–high‐density electroencephalography (vPSG‐hdEEG), preceded by 1 week of actigraphy. To represent the broad spectrum of the disease, patients were divided into 3 groups by disease stage—(1) de novo (n = 9), (2) advanced (n = 13), and (3) dyskinetic (DYS; n = 14)—were compared to an age‐matched control group (n = 12). The SWA‐NREM content of the vPSG‐hdEEG was then temporally divided into 10 equal parts, from T1 to T10, and power and source analyses were performed. T2‐T3‐T4 were considered early sleep and were compared to T7‐T8‐T9, representing late sleep.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We found that all groups, except the DYS group, manifested a clear‐cut SWA decrease between early and late sleep.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our data demonstrate a strong pathophysiological association between sleep and PD. Given that SWA may be a surrogate for synaptic strength, our data suggest that DYS patients do not have adequate synaptic downscaling. Further analysis is needed to determine the effect of drugs that can enhance cortical SWA in LID. Ann Neurol 2018; 1–13</p>

<p>Many neurodegenerative diseases are recognized to include a disconnection
syndrome initiated by the neuronal atrophy process. In Alzheimer's disease
(AD), the progressive destruction of axonal pathways leads to aberrant network
reconfigurations both at the structural and functional level. In such network
reorganization, the core and peripheral nodes appear to be crucial for the
prediction of clinical outcome due to their ability to influence large-scale
functional integration. However, the role of the different types of brain
connectivity in such prediction still remains unclear. Using a multiplex
network approach we integrated information from DWI, fMRI and MEG brain
connectivity to extract an enriched description of the core-periphery structure
in a group of AD patients and age-matched controls. Results showed that the
regional coreness - i.e., the probability of a region to be in the multiplex
core - was mainly driven by DWI structural connectivity with significant
contributions of fMRI and MEG functional connectivity, respectively at 0.1-0.3
Hz and 8-10 Hz. At the global scale, we showed that the coreness significantly
decreased in AD patients as a result of the randomization process initiated by
the neurodegeneration. At the local scale, the most impacted areas were in the
core of the network - including temporal, parietal and occipital areas - while
we reported compensatory increments for the peripheral regions in the
sensorimotor system. Finally, these multiplex network changes significantly
predicted the cognitive and memory impairment of patients as measured
respectively by the MMSE and FCSRT clinical scores. Taken together these
results indicate that a more accurate description of neurodegenerative diseases
can be obtained from the multimodal integration of neuroimaging-derived network
data.

<p>Slow waves (SWs) occur both during natural sleep and anesthesia and are
universal across species. Even though electrophysiological recordings have been
largely used to characterize brain states, they are limited in the spatial
resolution and cannot target specific neuronal population. Recently,
large-scale optical imaging techniques coupled with functional indicators
overcame these restrictions. Here we combined wide-field fluorescence
microscopy and a transgenic mouse model expressing a calcium indicator
(GCaMP6f) in excitatory neurons to study SW propagation over the meso-scale
under ketamine anesthesia. We developed "de novo" a versatile analysis pipeline
to quantify the spatio-temporal propagation of the SWs in the frequency band
[0.5, 4] Hz. Moreover, we designed a computational simulator based on a simple
theoretical model, which takes into account the statistics of neural activity,
the response of fluorescence proteins and the slow waves dynamics. The
simulator was capable of synthesizing artificial signals that could reliably
reproduce several features of the SWs observed in vivo. Comparison of
preliminary experimental and simulated data shows the robustness of the
analysis tools and its potential to uncover mechanistic insights of the Slow
Wave Activity (SWA).

<p>Developmental dyslexia is characterized by the inability to acquire typical
reading and writing skills. Dyslexia has been frequently linked to cerebral
cortex alterations; however recent evidence also points towards sensory
thalamus dysfunctions: dyslexics showed reduced responses in the left auditory
thalamus (medial geniculate body, MGB) during speech processing in contrast to
neurotypical readers. In addition, in the visual modality, dyslexics have
reduced structural connectivity between the left visual thalamus (lateral
geniculate nucleus, LGN) and V5/MT, a cerebral cortex region involved in visual
movement processing. Higher LGN-V5/MT connectivity in dyslexics was associated
with the faster rapid naming of letters and numbers (RANln), a measure that is
highly correlated with reading proficiency. We here tested two hypotheses that
were directly derived from these previous findings. First, we tested the
hypothesis that dyslexics have reduced structural connectivity between the left
MGB and the auditory motion-sensitive part of the left planum temporale (mPT).
Second, we hypothesized that the amount of left mPT-MGB connectivity correlates
with dyslexics RANln scores. Using diffusion tensor imaging based probabilistic
tracking we show that male adults with developmental dyslexia have reduced
structural connectivity between the left MGB and the left mPT, confirming the
first hypothesis. Stronger left mPT-MGB connectivity was not associated with
faster RANnl scores in dyslexics, but in neurotypical readers. Our findings
provide first evidence that reduced cortico-thalamic connectivity in the
auditory modality is a feature of developmental dyslexia, and that it may also
impact on reading related cognitive abilities in neurotypical readers.

<p>Resting-state functional Arterial Spin Labeling (rs-fASL) in clinical daily
practice and academic research stay discreet compared to resting-state BOLD.
However, by giving direct access to cerebral blood flow maps, rs-fASL leads to
significant clinical subject scaled application as CBF can be considered as a
biomarker in common neuropathology. Our work here focuses on the link between
overall quality of rs-fASL and duration of acquisition. To this end, we
consider subject self-Default Mode Network (DMN), and assess DMN quality
depletion compared to a gold standard DMN depending on the duration of
acquisition.

<p>Computational models of the respiratory central pattern generator (rCPG) are
usually based on biologically-plausible Hodgkin Huxley neuron models. Such
models require numerous parameters and thus are prone to overfitting. The HH
approach is motivated by the assumption that the biophysical properties of
neurons determine the network dynamics. Here, we implement the rCPG using
simpler Izhikevich resonate-and-fire neurons. Our rCPG model generates a
3-phase respiratory motor pattern based on established connectivities and can
reproduce previous experimental and theoretical observations. Further, we
demonstrate the flexibility of the model by testing whether intrinsic bursting
properties are necessary for rhythmogenesis. Our simulations demonstrate that
replacing predicted mandatory bursting properties of pre-inspiratory neurons
with spike adapting properties yields a model that generates comparable
respiratory activity patterns. The latter supports our view that the importance
of the exact modeling parameters of specific respiratory neurons is
overestimated.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/40843">Neural activity related to volitional regulation of cortical excitability</a></h4>

To date there exists no reliable method to non-invasively upregulate or downregulate the state of the resting human motor system over a large dynamic range. Here we show that an operant conditioning paradigm which provides neurofeedback of the size of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) in response to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), enables participants to self-modulate their own brain state. Following training, participants were able to robustly increase (by 83.8%) and decrease (by 30.6%) their MEP amplitudes. This volitional up-versus downegulation of corticomotor excitability caused an increase of late-cortical disinhibition (LCD), a TMS derived read-out of presynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub> disinhibition, which was accompanied by an increase of gamma and a decrease of alpha oscillations in the trained hemisphere. This approach paves the way for future investigations into how altered brain state influences motor neurophysiology and recovery of function in a neurorehabilitation context.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/40308">Evolutionary pathways of repeat protein topology in bacterial outer membrane proteins</a></h4>

Outer membrane proteins (OMPs) are the proteins in the surface of Gram-negative bacteria. These proteins have diverse functions but a single topology: the β-barrel. Sequence analysis has suggested that this common fold is a β-hairpin repeat protein, and that amplification of the β-hairpin has resulted in 8-26-stranded barrels. Using an integrated approach that combines sequence and structural analyses we find events in which non-amplification diversification also increases barrel strand number. Our network-based analysis reveals strand-number evolutionary pathways, including one that progresses from a primordial 8-stranded barrel to 16-strands and further, to 18-strands. Among these are mechanisms of strand number accretion without domain duplication, like a loop-to-hairpin transition. These mechanisms illustrate perpetuation of repeat protein topology without genetic duplication, likely induced by the hydrophobic membrane. Finally, we find that the evolutionary trace is particularly prominent in the C-terminal half of OMPs, implicating this region in the nucleation of OMP folding.

Acquired resistance to endocrine therapy remains a significant clinical burden for breast cancer patients. Somatic mutations in the <i>ESR1</i> (estrogen receptor alpha (ERα)) gene ligand-binding domain (LBD) represent a recognized mechanism of acquired resistance. Antiestrogens with improved efficacy versus tamoxifen might overcome the resistant phenotype in ER+ breast cancers. Bazedoxifene (BZA) is a potent antiestrogen that is clinically approved for use in hormone replacement therapies. We found that BZA possesses improved inhibitory potency against the Y537S and D538G ERα mutants compared to tamoxifen and has additional inhibitory activity in combination with the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib. In addition, comprehensive biophysical and structural biology studies show BZA's selective estrogen receptor degrading (SERD) properties that override the stabilizing effects of the Y537S and D538G ERα mutations.

Sequencing of the T cell receptor repertoire is a powerful tool for deeper study of immune response, but the unique structure of this type of data makes its meaningful quantification challenging. We introduce a new method, the Gamma-GPD spliced threshold model, to address this difficulty. This biologically interpretable model captures the distribution of the TCR repertoire, demonstrates stability across varying sequencing depths, and permits comparative analysis across any number of sampled individuals. We apply our method to several datasets and obtain insights regarding the differentiating features in the T cell receptor repertoire among sampled individuals across conditions. We have implemented our method in the open-source R package powerTCR.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/1HPkiYuzOtM" width="1" />

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>To investigate the association between serum soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (sTREM2), a soluble type of an innate immune receptor expressed on the microglia, and the risk of dementia.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>A total of 1,349 Japanese community‐residents aged 60 and older without dementia were followed prospectively for 10 years (2002‐2012). Serum sTREM2 levels were quantified by using an enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay and divided into quartiles. Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) of serum sTREM2 levels on the risk of dementia.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>During the follow‐up, 300 subjects developed all‐cause dementia; 193 had Alzheimer's disease (AD), and 85 had vascular dementia (VaD). The age‐ and sex‐adjusted incidences of all‐cause dementia, AD, and VaD elevated significantly with higher serum sTREM2 levels (all P for trend &lt;0.012). These associations were not altered after adjustment for confounding factors, including high‐sensitive C‐reactive protein. Subjects with the highest quartile of serum sTREM2 levels had significantly higher multivariable‐adjusted risks of developing all‐cause dementia, AD, and VaD than those with the lowest quartile (HR=2.03, 95% CI=1.39‐2.97, P&lt;0.001 for all‐cause dementia; HR=1.62, 95% CI=1.02‐2.55, P=0.04 for AD; HR=2.85, 95% CI=1.35‐6.02, P=0.006 for VaD). No significant heterogeneity in the association of serum sTREM2 levels with the development of dementia was observed among the other risk‐factor subgroups (all P for heterogeneity &gt;0.11).</p>


<h2>Interpretations</h2>
<p>The present findings suggest a significant association between increased serum sTREM2 levels and the risk of developing all‐cause dementia, AD, and VaD in the general elderly Japanese population.</p>

<p>The koniocellular (K) layers of the primate dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus house a variety of visual receptive field types, not all of which have been fully characterized. Here we made single-cell recordings targeted to the K layers of diurnal New World monkeys (marmosets). A subset of recorded cells was excited by both increments and decrements of light intensity (on/off-cells). Histological reconstruction of the location of these cells confirmed that they are segregated to K layers; we therefore refer to these cells as K-on/off cells. The K-on/off cells show high contrast sensitivity, strong bandpass spatial frequency tuning, and their response magnitude is strongly reduced by stimuli larger than the excitatory receptive field (silent suppressive surrounds). Stationary counterphase gratings evoke unmodulated spike rate increases or frequency-doubled responses in K-on/off cells; such responses are largely independent of grating spatial phase. The K-on/off cells are not orientation or direction selective. Some (but not all) properties of K-on/off cells are consistent with those of local-edge-detector/impressed-by-contrast cells reported in studies of cat retina and geniculate, and broad-thorny ganglion cells recorded in macaque monkey retina. The receptive field properties of K-on/off cells and their preferential location in the ventral K layers (K1 and K2) make them good candidates for the direct projection from geniculate to extrastriate cortical area MT/V5. If so, they could contribute to visual information processing in the dorsal ("where" or "action") visual stream.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We characterize cells in an evolutionary ancient part of the visual pathway in primates. The cells are located in the lateral geniculate nucleus (the main visual afferent relay nucleus), in regions called koniocellular layers that are known to project to extrastriate visual areas as well as primary visual cortex. The cells show high contrast sensitivity and rapid, transient responses to light onset and offset. Their properties suggest they could contribute to visual processing in the dorsal ("where" or "action") visual stream.</p>

<p>Predictive motor control is essential to achieve rapid and precise motor action in all vertebrates. Visuomotor transformations have been a popular model system to study the underlying neural mechanisms, in particular, the role of the cerebellum in both predictive and gain adaptations. In all species, large-field visual motion produces an involuntary conjugate ocular movement facilitating gaze stabilization called the optokinetic response. Gain adaptation can be induced by prolonged optokinetic visual stimulation; and if the visual stimulation is temporally periodic, predictive behavior emerges. Two predictive timing components were identifiable in this behavior. The first was prediction of stimulus initiation (when to move) and the other was stimulus termination (when to stop). We designed visual training that allowed us to evaluate initiation and termination independently that included the recording of cerebellar activity followed by acute and chronic cerebellar removal in goldfish of both sexes. We found that initiation and termination predictions were present in the cerebellum and more robust than conflicting visual sensory signals. Each prediction could be acquired independently, and both the acquisition and maintenance of each component were cerebellar-dependent. Subsequent analysis of the neuronal connectivity strongly supports the hypothesis that the acquired eye velocity behaviors were dependent on feedforward velocity buildup signals from the brainstem, but the adaptive timing mechanism itself originates within the circuitry of the cerebellum.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Predictive and rapid motor control is essential in our daily life, such as in the playing of musical instruments or sports. The current work evaluates timing of a visuomotor behavior shown to be similar in humans as well as goldfish. Given the latter species' known brainstem cerebellar neuronal connectivity and experimental advantage, it was possible to demonstrate the cerebellum to be necessary for acquisition and maintenance of both the initiation and termination components of when to move and to stop. All evidence in this study points to the adaptive predictive control site to lie within the cerebellar circuitry.</p>

<p>Reward-related stimuli can potently influence behavior; for example, exposure to drug-paired cues can trigger drug use and relapse in people with addictions. Psychological mechanisms that generate such outcomes likely include cue-induced cravings and attentional biases. Recent animal data suggest another candidate mechanism: reward-paired cues can enhance risky decision making, yet whether this translates to humans is unknown. Here, we examined whether sensory reward-paired cues alter decision making under uncertainty and risk, as measured respectively by the Iowa Gambling Task and a two-choice lottery task. In the cued versions of both tasks, gain feedback was augmented with reward-concurrent audiovisual stimuli. Healthy human volunteers (53 males, 78 females) performed each task once, one with and the other without cues (cued Iowa Gambling Task/uncued Vancouver Gambling Task: <i>n</i> = 63; uncued Iowa Gambling Task/cued Vancouver Gambling Task: <i>n</i> = 68), with concurrent eye-tracking. Reward-paired cues did not affect choice on the Iowa Gambling Task. On the two-choice lottery task, the cued group displayed riskier choice and reduced sensitivity to probability information. The cued condition was associated with reduced eye fixations on probability information shown on the screen and greater pupil dilation related to decision and reward anticipation. This pupil effect was unrelated to the risk-promoting effects of cues: the degree of pupil dilation for risky versus risk-averse choices did not differ as a function of cues. Together, our data show that sensory reward cues can promote riskier decisions and have additional and distinct effects on arousal.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Animal data suggest that reward-paired cues can promote maladaptive reward-seeking by biasing cost-benefit decision making. Whether this finding translates to humans is unknown. We examined the effects of salient reward-paired audiovisual cues on decision making under risk and uncertainty in human volunteers. Cues had risk-promoting effects on a risky choice task and independently increased task-related arousal as measured by pupil dilation. By demonstrating risk-promoting effects of cues in human participants, our data identify a mechanism whereby cue reactivity could translate into maladaptive behavioral outcomes in people with addictions.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/48/10349?rss=1">Synaptotoxicity in Alzheimer's Disease Involved a Dysregulation of Actin Cytoskeleton Dynamics through Cofilin 1 Phosphorylation</a></h4>

<p>Amyloid-β (Aβ) drives the synaptic impairment and dendritic spine loss characteristic of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but how Aβ affects the actin cytoskeleton remains unknown and contentious. The actin-binding protein, cofilin-1 (cof1), is a major regulator of actin dynamics in dendritic spines, and is subject to phospho-regulation by multiple pathways, including the Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) pathway. While cof1 is implicated as a driver of the synaptotoxicity characteristic of the early phases of AD pathophysiology, questions remain about the molecular mechanisms involved. Cofilin-actin rods are observed in neurons exposed to Aβ oligomers (Aβo) and in tissue from AD patients, and others have described an increased cofilin phosphorylation (p-cof1) in AD patients. Here, we report elevated p-cof1 of the postsynaptic enriched fraction of synaptosomes from cortical samples of male APP/PS1 mice and human AD cases of either sex. In primary cortical neurons, Aβo induced rapid actin stabilization and increased p-cof1 in the postsynaptic compartment of excitatory synapses within 30 min. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching of actin-GFP and calcium imaging in live neurons expressing active or inactive cof1 mutants suggest that cof1 phosphorylation is necessary and sufficient for Aβo-induced synaptic impairment via actin stabilization before the reported formation of cofilin-actin rods. Moreover, the clinically available and well-tolerated ROCK inhibitor, fasudil, prevented Aβo-induced actin stabilization, synaptic impairment, and synaptic loss by blocking cofilin phosphorylation. Aβo also blocked the LTP-induced insertion of the AMPAR subunit, GluA1, at the postsynaptic density, in a fasudil-sensitive manner. These data support an important role for ROCKs and cofilin in mediating Aβ-induced synaptic impairment.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> We report that amyloid-β oligomers rapidly induce aberrant stabilization of F-actin within dendritic spines, which impairs synaptic strength and plasticity. Activation of the Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) pathway results in phosphorylation of cof1 and is sufficient to mediate Aβo-induced actin stabilization synaptic impairment and synaptic loss. Further, the ROCK inhibitor, fasudil, prevents cofilin phosphorylation, acute synaptic disruption, and synaptotoxicity in primary cortical neurons. Together, the herein presented data provide strong support for further study of the ROCK pathway as a therapeutic target for the cognitive decline and synaptotoxicity in Alzheimer's disease.</p>

<p>The extent to which subjective awareness influences reward processing, and thereby affects future decisions, is currently largely unknown. In the present report, we investigated this question in a reinforcement learning framework, combining perceptual masking, computational modeling, and electroencephalographic recordings (human male and female participants). Our results indicate that degrading the visibility of the reward decreased, without completely obliterating, the ability of participants to learn from outcomes, but concurrently increased their tendency to repeat previous choices. We dissociated electrophysiological signatures evoked by the reward-based learning processes from those elicited by the reward-independent repetition of previous choices and showed that these neural activities were significantly modulated by reward visibility. Overall, this report sheds new light on the neural computations underlying reward-based learning and decision-making and highlights that awareness is beneficial for the trial-by-trial adjustment of decision-making strategies.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The notion of reward is strongly associated with subjective evaluation, related to conscious processes such as "pleasure," "liking," and "wanting." Here we show that degrading reward visibility in a reinforcement learning task decreases, without completely obliterating, the ability of participants to learn from outcomes, but concurrently increases subjects' tendency to repeat previous choices. Electrophysiological recordings, in combination with computational modeling, show that neural activities were significantly modulated by reward visibility. Overall, we dissociate different neural computations underlying reward-based learning and decision-making, which highlights a beneficial role of reward awareness in adjusting decision-making strategies.</p>

<p>Botulinum neurotoxin Type A (BoNT/A) is an effective treatment for several movement disorders, including spasticity and dystonia. BoNT/A acts by cleaving synaptosomal-associated protein of 25 kDa (SNAP-25) at the neuromuscular junction, thus blocking synaptic transmission and weakening overactive muscles. However, not all the therapeutic benefits of the neurotoxin are explained by peripheral neuroparalysis, suggesting an action of BoNT/A on central circuits. Currently, the specific targets of BoNT/A central activity remain unclear. Here, we show that catalytically active BoNT/A is transported to the facial nucleus (FN) after injection into the nasolabial musculature of rats and mice. BoNT/A-mediated cleavage of SNAP-25 in the FN is prevented by intracerebroventricular delivery of antitoxin antibodies, demonstrating that BoNT/A physically leaves the motoneurons to enter second-order neurons. Analysis of intoxicated terminals within the FN shows that BoNT/A is transcytosed preferentially into cholinergic synapses. The cholinergic boutons containing cleaved SNAP-25 are associated with a larger size, suggesting impaired neuroexocytosis. Together, the present findings indicate a previously unrecognized source of reduced motoneuron drive after BoNT/A via blockade of central, excitatory cholinergic inputs. These data highlight the ability of BoNT/A to selectively target and modulate specific central circuits, with consequent impact on its therapeutic effectiveness in movement disorders.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Botulinum neurotoxins are among the most potent toxins known. Despite this, their specific and reversible action prompted their use in clinical practice to treat several neuromuscular pathologies (dystonia, spasticity, muscle spasms) characterized by hyperexcitability of peripheral nerve terminals or even in nonpathological applications (i.e., cosmetic use). Substantial experimental and clinical evidence indicates that not all botulinum neurotoxin Type A (BoNT/A) effects can be explained solely by the local action (i.e., silencing of the neuromuscular junction). In particular, there are cases in which the clinical benefit exceeds the duration of peripheral neurotransmission blockade. In this study, we demonstrate that BoNT/A is transported to facial motoneurons, released, and internalized preferentially into cholinergic terminals impinging onto the motoneurons. Our data demonstrate a direct central action of BoNT/A.</p>

<p>Task- and phase-dependent reflex modulation during locomotion is well established, but we do not know the signals driving this modulation. To determine whether signals related to left–right symmetry of the locomotor pattern modulate cutaneous reflexes, we stimulated the superficial peroneal nerve in five intact female cats and in four spinal-transected cats (spinal cats, two males and two females) during split-belt locomotion at different left–right speeds. We compared cutaneous reflexes evoked in three ipsilateral and two contralateral hindlimb muscles during split-belt locomotion with those evoked during tied-belt (equal left–right speeds) locomotion at matched speeds of the slow and fast limbs. Our results showed similar phase-dependent modulation of cutaneous reflexes during tied-belt and split-belt locomotion in intact and spinal cats. During tied-belt locomotion in intact cats, an increase in speed significantly increased reflex modulation from minimum to maximum values, whereas in spinal cats, we observed a significant decrease. However, in all muscles of intact and spinal cats, split-belt locomotion significantly reduced reflex modulation compared with tied-belt locomotion independently of which limb was stepping on the slow or fast belt. Additionally, reflex modulation correlated more with spatial left–right symmetry, as opposed to a temporal one, in intact and spinal cats. Our results indicate that signals related to left–right symmetry reduce cutaneous reflex modulation independently of speed via a spinal mechanism. We propose that asymmetric sensory feedback from the left and right legs alters the state of the spinal network, thereby reducing cutaneous reflexes to prevent inputs from destabilizing a potentially unstable pattern.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> When we contact an obstacle during walking, receptors in the skin send signals to the CNS to alter the trajectory of the leg to maintain balance. This response, or reflex, is different when the leg is in the air and when it is contacting the ground. The reflex also differs when we walk at different speeds. Here, we investigated this reflex when the left and right legs were walking at different speeds on a split-belt treadmill in cats. We show that the reflex is smaller during split-belt locomotion compared with when both legs are walking at equal speeds. We propose that the spinal locomotor network controlling walking reduces the reflex response to optimize balance when gait is unstable.</p>

<p>The past decade has seen a large number of neuroimaging studies focused on the anticorrelated functional relationship between the default mode network (DMN) and the dorsal attention network (DAN). Due principally to the low temporal resolution of functional neuroimaging modalities, the fast-neuronal dynamics across these networks remain poorly understood. Here we report novel human intracranial electrophysiology data from six neurosurgical patients (four males) with simultaneous coverage of well characterized nodes of the DMN and DAN. Subjects performed an arithmetic processing task, shown previously to evoke reliable deactivations (below baseline) in the DMN, and activations in the DAN. In this cohort, we show that DMN deactivations lag DAN activations by approximately 200 ms. Our findings suggest a clear temporal order of processing across the two networks during the current task and place the DMN further than the DAN in a plausible information-processing hierarchy.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The human brain contains an intrinsic and strictly organized network architecture. Our understanding of the interplay across association networks has relied primarily on the slow fluctuations of the hemodynamic response, and as such it has lacked essential evidence regarding the temporal dynamics of activity across these networks. The current study presents evidence from high spatiotemporal methods showing that well studied areas of the default mode network display delayed task-induced activity relative to divergent responses in dorsal attention network nodes. This finding provides direct and critical evidence regarding the temporal chronology of neuronal events across opposing brain networks.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/48/10295?rss=1">Dissociable Neural Systems for Recognizing Places and Navigating through Them</a></h4>

<p>When entering an environment, we can use the present visual information from the scene to either recognize the kind of place it is (e.g., a kitchen or a bedroom) or navigate through it. Here we directly test the hypothesis that these two processes, what we call "scene categorization" and "visually-guided navigation", are supported by dissociable neural systems. Specifically, we manipulated task demands by asking human participants (male and female) to perform a scene categorization, visually-guided navigation, and baseline task on images of scenes, and measured both the average univariate responses and multivariate spatial pattern of responses within two scene-selective cortical regions, the parahippocampal place area (PPA) and occipital place area (OPA), hypothesized to be separably involved in scene categorization and visually-guided navigation, respectively. As predicted, in the univariate analysis, PPA responded significantly more during the categorization task than during both the navigation and baseline tasks, whereas OPA showed the complete opposite pattern. Similarly, in the multivariate analysis, a linear support vector machine achieved above-chance classification for the categorization task, but not the navigation task in PPA. By contrast, above-chance classification was achieved for both the navigation and categorization tasks in OPA. However, above-chance classification for both tasks was also found in early visual cortex and hence not specific to OPA, suggesting that the spatial patterns of responses in OPA are merely inherited from early vision, and thus may be epiphenomenal to behavior. Together, these results are evidence for dissociable neural systems involved in recognizing places and navigating through them.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> It has been nearly three decades since Goodale and Milner demonstrated that recognizing objects and manipulating them involve distinct neural processes. Today we show the same is true of our interactions with our environment: recognizing places and navigating through them are neurally dissociable. More specifically, we found that a scene-selective region, the parahippocampal place area, is active when participants are asked to categorize a scene, but not when asked to imagine navigating through it, whereas another scene-selective region, the occipital place area, shows the exact opposite pattern. This double dissociation is evidence for dissociable neural systems within scene processing, similar to the bifurcation of object processing described by Goodale and Milner (1992).</p>

<p>In mammals respiratory-locked hippocampal rhythms are implicated in the scaffolding and transfer of information between sensory and memory networks. These oscillations are entrained by nasal respiration and driven by the olfactory bulb. They then travel to the piriform cortex where they propagate further downstream to the hippocampus and modulate neural processes critical for memory formation. In humans, bypassing nasal airflow through mouth-breathing abolishes these rhythms and impacts encoding as well as recognition processes thereby reducing memory performance. It has been hypothesized that similar behavior should be observed for the consolidation process, the stage between encoding and recognition, were memory is reactivated and strengthened. However, direct evidence for such an effect is lacking in human and nonhuman animals. Here we tested this hypothesis by examining the effect of respiration on consolidation of episodic odor memory. In two separate sessions, female and male participants encoded odors followed by a 1 h awake resting consolidation phase where they either breathed solely through their nose or mouth. Immediately after the consolidation phase, memory for odors was tested. Recognition memory significantly increased during nasal respiration compared with mouth respiration during consolidation. These results provide the first evidence that respiration directly impacts consolidation of episodic events, and lends further support to the notion that core cognitive functions are modulated by the respiratory cycle.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Memories pass through three main stages in their development: encoding, consolidation, and retrieval. Growing evidence from animal and human studies suggests that respiration plays an important role in the behavioral and neural mechanisms associated with encoding and recognition. Specifically nasal, but not mouth, respiration entrains neural oscillations that enhance encoding and recognition processes. We demonstrate that respiration also affects the consolidation stage. Breathing through the nose compared with the mouth during consolidation enhances recognition memory. This demonstrates, first, that nasal respiration is important during the critical period were memories are reactivated and strengthened. Second, it suggests that the neural mechanisms responsible may emerge from nasal respiration.</p>

<p>Neurons of the CNS elaborate highly branched dendritic arbors that host numerous dendritic spines, which serve as the postsynaptic platform for most excitatory synapses. The actin cytoskeleton plays an important role in dendrite development and spine formation, but the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Tropomodulins (Tmods) are a family of actin-binding proteins that cap the slow-growing (pointed) end of actin filaments, thereby regulating the stability, length, and architecture of complex actin networks in diverse cell types. Three members of the Tmod family, Tmod1, Tmod2, and Tmod3 are expressed in the vertebrate CNS, but their function in neuronal development is largely unknown. In this study, we present evidence that Tmod1 and Tmod2 exhibit distinct roles in regulating spine development and dendritic arborization, respectively. Using rat hippocampal tissues from both sexes, we find that Tmod1 and Tmod2 are expressed with distinct developmental profiles: Tmod2 is expressed early during hippocampal development, whereas Tmod1 expression coincides with synaptogenesis. We then show that knockdown of Tmod2, but not Tmod1, severely impairs dendritic branching. Both Tmod1 and Tmod2 are localized to a distinct subspine region where they regulate local F-actin stability. However, the knockdown of Tmod1, but not Tmod2, disrupts spine morphogenesis and impairs synapse formation. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that regulation of the actin cytoskeleton by different members of the Tmod family plays an important role in distinct aspects of dendrite and spine development.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> The Tropomodulin family of molecules is best known for controlling the length and stability of actin myofilaments in skeletal muscles. While several Tropomodulin members are expressed in the brain, fundamental knowledge about their role in neuronal function is limited. In this study, we show the unique expression profile and subcellular distribution of Tmod1 and Tmod2 in hippocampal neurons. While both Tmod1 and Tmod2 regulate F-actin stability, we find that they exhibit isoform-specific roles in dendrite development and synapse formation: Tmod2 regulates dendritic arborization, whereas Tmod1 is required for spine development and synapse formation. These findings provide novel insight into the actin regulatory mechanisms underlying neuronal development, thereby shedding light on potential pathways disrupted in a number of neurological disorders.</p>

<p>Brainstem locus ceruleus neurons (LCn) are among the first neurons across the lifespan to evidence tau pathology, and LCn are implicated in tau propagation throughout the cortices. Yet, events influencing LCn tau are poorly understood. Activated persistently across wakefulness, LCn experience significant metabolic stress in response to chronic short sleep (CSS). Here we explored whether CSS influences LCn tau and the biochemical, neuroanatomical, and/or behavioral progression of tauopathy in male and female P301S mice. CSS in early adult life advanced the temporal progression of neurobehavioral impairments and resulted in a lasting increase in soluble tau oligomers. Intriguingly, CSS resulted in an early increase in AT8 and MC1 tau pathology in the LC. Over time tau pathology, including tangles, was evident in forebrain tau-vulnerable regions. Sustained microglial and astrocytic activation was observed as well. Remarkably, CSS resulted in significant loss of neurons in the two regions examined: the basolateral amygdala and LC. A second, distinct form of chronic sleep disruption, fragmentation of sleep, during early adult life also increased tau deposition and imparted early neurobehavioral impairment. Collectively, the findings demonstrate that early life sleep disruption has important lasting effects on the temporal progression in P301S mice, influencing tau pathology and hastening neurodegeneration, neuroinflammation, and neurobehavioral impairments.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Chronic short sleep (CSS) is pervasive in modern society. Here, we found that early life CSS influences behavioral, biochemical, and neuroanatomic aspects of the temporal progression of tauopathy in a mouse model of the P301S tau mutation. Specifically, CSS hastened the onset of motor impairment and resulted in a greater loss of neurons in both the locus ceruleus and basolateral/lateral amygdala. Importantly, despite a protracted recovery opportunity after CSS, mice evidenced a sustained increase in pathogenic tau oligomers, and increased pathogenic tau in the locus ceruleus and limbic system nuclei. These findings unveil early life sleep habits as an important determinant in the progression of tauopathy.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/48/10244?rss=1">Differentiation of Human Medial Prefrontal Cortex Activity Underlies Long-Term Resistance to Forgetting in Memory</a></h4>

<p>It is well known that distributing study events over time leads to better memory over long time scales, compared with massing study events together. One explanation for such long-term resistance to forgetting is that distributed study leads to neural differentiation in memory, which supports retrieval of past experiences by disambiguating highly similar memory representations. Neuroanatomical models of episodic memory retrieval propose that the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) work together to enable retrieval of behaviorally appropriate memories. However, it is not known how representations in these regions jointly support resistance to forgetting long after initial learning. Using fMRI, we measured differentiation in retrieved memory representations following an extended delay in male and female human participants. After 1 week, word–object associations were better remembered if studied across 2 d (overnight), allowing associations to be learned in distinct temporal contexts, compared with learning within a single day (same day). MPFC retrieval patterns showed differentiation for overnight relative to same day memories, whereas hippocampal patterns reflected associative retrieval success. Overnight memory differentiation in MPFC was higher for associative than item memories and higher than differentiation assessed over a brain-wide set of retrieval-active voxels. The memory-related difference in MPFC pattern differentiation correlated with memory success for overnight learning and with hippocampal–MPFC functional connectivity. These results show that learning information across days leads to differentiated MPFC memory representations, reducing forgetting after 1 week, and suggest this arises from persistent interactions between MPFC and hippocampus.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Neural activity in both the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) has been linked to memory-related representations, but prior work has not examined how these representations support episodic memory retrieval over extended time scales that are characteristic of everyday retrieval. We show that differentiation in MPFC activity 1 week after encoding is higher for retrieved information learned across 2 d compared with within a single day. In hippocampus, differentiation was greater for detailed memory retrieval but was not influenced by whether information had been learned over 1 or 2 d. Differentiation in MPFC predicted behavioral robustness to forgetting and was correlated with hippocampal–MPFC connectivity. The results suggest that context-based differentiation supports robust long-term memory via persistent MPFC–hippocampal interactions.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.11040">Modelling zebrafish collective behaviours with multilayer perceptrons optimised by evolutionary algorithms. (arXiv:1811.11040v1 [q-bio.NC])</a></h4>

<p>Collective movements are pervasive behaviours among social organisms and have
led to the development of many models. However, modelling animal trajectories
and social interactions in simple bounded environments remains a challenge.
Moreover, advances in the understanding of the sensory-motor loop and the
information processing by animals are leading to revisions of the traditional
assumptions made in decision-making algorithms. In this context, we develop a
methodology based on artificial neural networks (ANN) to describe the
collective motion of small zebrafish groups in a bounded environment. Although
ANN models are commonly used in artificial systems they are still
under-explored to model animal collective behaviours. Here, we present a
methodology to calibrate Multilayer Perceptrons by learning from real fish
experimental data. The ANNs are trained using either supervised learning or
various forms of evolutionary reinforcement learning methods (using the CMA-ES
and NSGA-III algorithms). We reveal that ANN models trained using evolutionary
methods are capable of generating realistic collective motions for groups of 5
zebrafish including the tank wall effects, a feature that is lacking in
previous models. Finally, we also discuss the benefits of optimised ANNs as
candidates for driving robotic lure with biologically realistic behaviour, a
method that is becoming increasingly popular to gather data and validate
assumptions on collective behaviours.

                <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/42870">Neural dynamics at successive stages of the ventral visual stream are consistent with hierarchical error signals</a></h4>

Ventral visual stream neural responses are dynamic, even for static image presentations. However, dynamical neural models of visual cortex are lacking as most progress has been made modeling static, time-averaged responses. Here, we studied population neural dynamics during face detection across three cortical processing stages. Remarkably, ~30 milliseconds after the initially evoked response, we found that neurons in intermediate level areas decreased their responses to typical configurations of their preferred face parts relative to their response for atypical configurations even while neurons in higher areas achieved and maintained a preference for typical configurations. These hierarchical neural dynamics were inconsistent with standard feedforward circuits. Rather, recurrent models computing prediction errors between stages captured the observed temporal signatures. This model of neural dynamics, which simply augments the standard feedforward model of online vision, suggests that neural responses to static images may encode top-down prediction errors in addition to bottom-up feature estimates.

<p>by Lina Meinecke, Praveer P. Sharma, Huijing Du, Lei Zhang, Qing Nie, Thomas F. Schilling</p>

How does pattern formation occur accurately when confronted with tissue growth and stochastic fluctuations (noise) in gene expression? Dorso-ventral (D-V) patterning of the mandibular arch specifies upper versus lower jaw skeletal elements through a combination of Bone morphogenetic protein (Bmp), Endothelin-1 (Edn1), and Notch signaling, and this system is highly robust. We combine NanoString experiments of early D-V gene expression with live imaging of arch development in zebrafish to construct a computational model of the D-V mandibular patterning network. The model recapitulates published genetic perturbations in arch development. Patterning is most sensitive to changes in Bmp signaling, and the temporal order of gene expression modulates the response of the patterning network to noise. Thus, our integrated systems biology approach reveals non-intuitive features of the complex signaling system crucial for craniofacial development, including novel insights into roles of gene expression timing and stochasticity in signaling and gene regulation.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/nw45cvIUcgA" width="1" />

<p>by Oliver M. Crook, Claire M. Mulvey, Paul D. W. Kirk, Kathryn S. Lilley, Laurent Gatto</p>

Analysis of the spatial sub-cellular distribution of proteins is of vital importance to fully understand context specific protein function. Some proteins can be found with a single location within a cell, but up to half of proteins may reside in multiple locations, can dynamically re-localise, or reside within an unknown functional compartment. These considerations lead to uncertainty in associating a protein to a single location. Currently, mass spectrometry (MS) based spatial proteomics relies on supervised machine learning algorithms to assign proteins to sub-cellular locations based on common gradient profiles. However, such methods fail to quantify uncertainty associated with sub-cellular class assignment. Here we reformulate the framework on which we perform statistical analysis. We propose a Bayesian generative classifier based on Gaussian mixture models to assign proteins probabilistically to sub-cellular niches, thus proteins have a probability distribution over sub-cellular locations, with Bayesian computation performed using the expectation-maximisation (EM) algorithm, as well as Markov-chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC). Our methodology allows proteome-wide uncertainty quantification, thus adding a further layer to the analysis of spatial proteomics. Our framework is flexible, allowing many different systems to be analysed and reveals new modelling opportunities for spatial proteomics. We find our methods perform competitively with current state-of-the art machine learning methods, whilst simultaneously providing more information. We highlight several examples where classification based on the support vector machine is unable to make any conclusions, while uncertainty quantification using our approach provides biologically intriguing results. To our knowledge this is the first Bayesian model of MS-based spatial proteomics data.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/xZZza2iv30E" width="1" />

<p>by Jun Li, Wei Zhu, Jun Wang, Wenfei Li, Sheng Gong, Jian Zhang, Wei Wang</p>

Quality assessment is essential for the computational prediction and design of RNA tertiary structures. To date, several knowledge-based statistical potentials have been proposed and proved to be effective in identifying native and near-native RNA structures. All these potentials are based on the inverse Boltzmann formula, while differing in the choice of the geometrical descriptor, reference state, and training dataset. Via an approach that diverges completely from the conventional statistical potentials, our work explored the power of a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN)-based approach as a quality evaluator for RNA 3D structures, which used a 3D grid representation of the structure as input without extracting features manually. The RNA structures were evaluated by examining each nucleotide, so our method can also provide local quality assessment. Two sets of training samples were built. The first one included 1 million samples generated by high-temperature molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and the second one included 1 million samples generated by Monte Carlo (MC) structure prediction. Both MD and MC procedures were performed for a non-redundant set of 414 RNAs. For two training datasets (one including only MD training samples and the other including both MD and MC training samples), we trained two neural networks, named RNA3DCNN_MD and RNA3DCNN_MDMC, respectively. The former is suitable for assessing near-native structures, while the latter is suitable for assessing structures covering large structural space. We tested the performance of our method and made comparisons with four other traditional scoring functions. On two of three test datasets, our method performed similarly to the state-of-the-art traditional scoring function, and on the third test dataset, our method was far superior to other scoring functions. Our method can be downloaded from https://github.com/lijunRNA/RNA3DCNN.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/JE7z7RP6F5Y" width="1" />

                <h4><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.10431">Two Cognitive Transitions Underlying the Capacity for Cultural Evolution. (arXiv:1811.10431v1 [q-bio.NC])</a></h4>

<p>This paper proposes that the distinctively human capacity for cumulative,
adaptive, open-ended cultural evolution came about through two
temporally-distinct cognitive transitions. First, the origin of Homo-specific
culture over two MYA was made possible by the onset of a finer-grained
associative memory that allowed episodes to be encoded in greater detail. This
in turn meant more overlap amongst the distributed representations of these
episodes, such that they could more readily evoke one another through
self-triggered recall (STR). STR enabled representational redescription, the
chaining of thoughts and actions, and the capacity for a stream of thought.
Second, fully cognitive modernity following the appearance of anatomical
modernity after 200,000 BP, was made possible by the onset of contextual focus
(CF): the ability to shift between an explicit convergent mode conducive to
logic and refinement of ideas, and an implicit divergent mode conducive to
free-association, viewing situations from radically new perspectives, concept
combination, analogical thinking, and insight. This paved the way for an
integrated, creative internal network of understandings, and behavioral
modernity. We discuss feasible neural mechanisms for this two-stage proposal,
and outline how STR and CF differ from other proposals. We provide
computational evidence for the proposal obtained with an agent-based model of
cultural evolution in which agents invent ideas for actions and imitate the
fittest of their neighbors' actions. Mean fitness and diversity of actions
across the artificial society increased with STR, and even more so with CF, but
CF was only effective if STR was already in place. CF was most effective
following a change in task, which supports its hypothesized role in escaping
mental fixation. The proposal is discussed in the context of transition theory
in the life sciences.

<p>by Letícia Stock, Juliana Hosoume, Leonardo Cirqueira, Werner Treptow</p>

The direct-site hypothesis assumes general anesthetics bind ion channels to impact protein equilibrium and function, inducing anesthesia. Despite advancements in the field, a first principle all-atom demonstration of this structure-function premise is still missing. We focus on the clinically used sevoflurane interaction to anesthetic-sensitive Kv1.2 mammalian channel to resolve if sevoflurane binds protein’s well-characterized open and closed structures in a conformation-dependent manner to shift channel equilibrium. We employ an innovative approach relying on extensive docking calculations and free-energy perturbation of all potential binding sites revealed by the latter, and find sevoflurane binds open and closed structures at multiple sites under complex saturation and concentration effects. Results point to a non-trivial interplay of site and conformation-dependent modes of action involving distinct binding sites that increase channel open-probability at diluted ligand concentrations. Given the challenge in exploring more complex processes potentially impacting channel-anesthetic interaction, the result is revealing as it demonstrates the process of multiple anesthetic binding events alone may account for open-probability shifts recorded in measurements.<img alt="" height="1" src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/R7l5I-sNaNM" width="1" />

Abstract<p>A subset of neurons in the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN) function as respiratory chemoreceptors by regulating depth and frequency of breathing in response to changes in tissue CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup>. The activity of chemosensitive RTN neurons is also subject to modulation by CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup>-dependent purinergic signaling. However, mechanisms contributing to purinergic regulation of RTN chemoreceptors are not entirely clear. Recent evidence suggests adenosine inhibits RTN chemoreception <i>in vivo</i> by activation of A1 receptors. The goal of this study was to characterize effects of adenosine on chemosensitive RTN neurons and identify intrinsic and synaptic mechanisms underlying this response. Cell-attached recordings from RTN chemoreceptors in slices from rat or wild-type mouse pups (mixed sex) show that exposure to adenosine (1 µM) inhibits chemoreceptor activity by an A1 receptor-dependent mechanism. However, exposure to a selective A1 receptor antagonist (DPCPX, 30 nM) alone did not potentiate CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup>-stimulated activity, suggesting activation of A1 receptors does not limit chemoreceptor activity under these reduced conditions. Whole-cell voltage-clamp from chemosensitive RTN neurons show that exposure to adenosine activated an inward rectifying K<sup>+</sup> conductance, and at the network level, adenosine preferentially decreased frequency of excitatory but not inhibitory postsynaptic currents. These results show that adenosine activation of A1 receptors inhibits chemosensitive RTN neurons by direct activation of a GIRK-like conductance, and presynaptically, by suppression of excitatory synaptic input to chemoreceptors.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Adenosine is a potent modulator of all aspects of breathing including chemoreception at the level of the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN); however, mechanisms by which adenosine regulates activity of RTN chemoreceptors is not known. Here, we show that adenosine activation of A1 receptors inhibits RTN neurons by activation of an inward rectifying K<sup>+</sup> conductance, and by selective suppression of excitatory synaptic input to chemoreceptors. These results identify a GIRK-like conductance as the first target of purinergic signaling in chemosensitive RTN neurons. This work may also have clinical relevance since A1 receptor antagonists like caffeine are used to treat respiratory problems in premature infancy.</p>

Abstract<p>The <i>Drosophila</i> Giant Fiber (GF) escape circuit is an extensively studied model for neuron connectivity and function. Researchers have long taken advantage of the simple linear neuronal pathway, which begins at peripheral sensory modalities, travels through the central GF Interneuron (GFI) to motor neurons, and terminates on wing/leg muscles. This circuit is more complex than it seems however, as there exists a complex web of coupled neurons connected to the GFI, which widely innervate the thoracic ganglion. Here, we define four new neuron clusters dye-coupled to the central GFI, which we name GF Coupled (GFC) 1-4. We identify new transgenic Gal4 drivers that express specifically in these neurons, and map both neuronal architecture and synaptic polarity. GFC1-4 share a central site of GFI connectivity, the Inframedial Bridge (IB), where the neurons each form electrical synapses. Targeted apoptotic ablation of GFC1 reveals a key role for proper development of the GF circuit, including the maintenance of GFI connectivity with upstream and downstream synaptic partners. GFC1 ablation frequently results in loss of one GFI, which is always compensated for by contralateral innervation from a branch of the persisting GFI axon. Overall, this work reveals extensively coupled interconnectivity within the GF circuit, and the requirement of coupled neurons for circuit development. Identification of this large population of electrically-coupled neurons in this classic model, and the ability to genetically manipulate these electrically synapsed neurons, expands the GF system capabilities for the nuanced, sophisticated circuit dissection necessary for deeper investigations into brain formation.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Genetic model neural circuits with individually identifiable neurons help us understand how nervous systems wire together during development, and then operate through coordinated chemical and electrical signaling. The <i>Drosophila</i> Giant Fiber circuit has long served as such a model, due to large neuron size, genetic malleability and easily visualized behavioral output: a jump in response to a threat. This study unveils new members of this circuit, all of which synapse with the circuit at one site on the central Giant Fiber Interneuron. We use new tools to identify and transgenically manipulate these neurons and show that these neurons are required for proper circuit development. This study provides a detailed circuit map for further dissection of neuronal connectivity and electrically-coupled communication.</p>

Abstract<p>Obesogenic diets lead to overeating and obesity by inducing the expression of genes involved in hedonic and homeostatic responses in specific brain regions. However, how the effects on gene expression are coordinated in the brain so far remains largely unknown. In our study, we provided mice with access to energy-dense diet, which induced overeating and overweight, and we explored the transcriptome changes across the main regions involved in feeding and energy balance: hypothalamus, frontal cortex and striatum. Interestingly, we detected two regulatory processes: a switch-like regulation with differentially expressed genes changing over 1.5-fold, and "fine-tuned" subtler changes of genes whose levels correlated with body weight and behavioral changes. We found that genes in both categories were positioned within specific topologically associating domains (TADs), which were often differently regulated across different brain regions. These TADs were enriched in genes relevant for the physiological and behavioral observed changes. Our results suggest that chromatin structure coordinates diet-dependent transcriptional regulation.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Mice fed with free-choice access to chocolate mixture become overweight and compulsive, recapitulating what happens during obesity. For the first time, we correlated these physical and behavioural changes with the transcriptome in the frontal cortex and the striatum, involved in the hedonic "liking" associated to eating, and the hypothalamus, involved in the homeostasic regulation of food intake. We detected two groups of genes: some transcript were strongly deregulated in term of fold changes; while others were only subtly deregulated but were especially correlating with measurements associated with body-weight and compulsivity. These genes were not randomly distributed, but were positioned in chromatin domains, many of which rich in genes differentially co-regulated across brain areas.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0008-18.2018v1?rss=1">Hierarchical Cognition causes Task Related Deactivations but not just in Default Mode Regions</a></h4>

Abstract<p>The well-known deactivation of the Default Mode Network (DMN) during external tasks is usually thought to reflect the suppression of internally directed mental activity during external attention. In 3 experiments with human participants we organized sequences of task events identical in their attentional and control demands into larger task episodes. We found that DMN deactivation across such sequential events was never constant, but was maximum at the beginning of the episode, then decreased gradually across the episode, reaching baseline towards episode completion, with the final event of the episode eliciting an activation. Crucially, this pattern of activity was not limited to a fixed set of DMN regions but, across experiments, was shown by a variable set of regions expected to be uninvolved in processing the ongoing task. This change in deactivation across sequential but identical events showed that the deactivation cannot be related to attentional/control demands which were constant across the episode, instead it has to be related to some episode related load that was maximal at the beginning and then decreased gradually as parts of the episode got executed. We argue that this load resulted from cognitive programs through which the entire episode was hierarchically executed as one unit. At the beginning of task episodes, programs related to their entire duration is assembled, causing maximal deactivation. As execution proceeds, elements within the program related to the completed parts of the episode dismantle, thereby decreasing the program load and causing a decrease in deactivation.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> We prepare breakfasts and write emails, and not individually execute their many component acts. The current study suggests that cognitive entities that enable such hierarchical execution of goal-directed behavior may cause the ubiquitously seen deactivation during external task execution. Further, while this deactivation has previously been associated with a defined set of the so called default mode regions, current study demonstrates that deactivation is shown by <i>any</i> region not <i>currently</i> involved in task execution, and in certain task episodes can even include attention related fronto-parietal regions as well as primary sensory and motor regions.</p>

This paper uses voxelwise modeling to show that individual voxels in human scene-selective areas are tuned for the orientations and distances of surfaces. Simple 2D features cannot explain this tuning, and the model can reconstruct 3D scenes from fMRI activity.

Tang et al. demonstrate that adult NSCs act as a niche for the maturation of newborn neurons through the section of PTN. PTN activates AKT signaling to promote the morphological maturation and synaptic integration of newborn neurons through the ALK receptor.

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25384?af=R">Six‐months assessment of a hand prosthesis with intraneural tactile feedback</a></h4>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Hand amputation is a highly disabling event, which significantly affects quality of life. An effective hand replacement can be achieved if the user, in addition to motor functions, is provided with the sensations that are naturally perceived while grasping and moving. Intraneural peripheral electrodes have shown promising results toward the restoration of the sense of touch. However, the long‐term usability and clinical relevance of intraneural sensory feedback have not yet been clearly demonstrated.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>To this aim, we performed a six months clinical study with three trans‐radial amputees who received implants of transverse intrafascicular multichannel electrodes (TIMEs) in their median and ulnar nerves. After calibration, electrical stimulation was delivered through the TIMEs connected to artificial sensors in the digits of a prosthesis to generate sensory feedback, which was then used by the subjects while performing different grasping tasks.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>All the subjects, notwithstanding their important clinical differences, reported stimulation‐induced sensations from the phantom hand for the whole duration of the trial. They also successfully integrated the sensory feedback into their motor control strategies while performing experimental tests simulating tasks of real life (with and without the support of vision). Finally, they reported a decrement of their phantom limb pain and a general improvement in mood state.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The promising results achieved with all subjects show the feasibility of the use of intraneural stimulation in clinical settings.</p>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Genome-wide association studies have implicated many ion channels in schizophrenia pathophysiology. Although the functions of these channels are relatively well characterized by single-cell studies, the contributions of common variation in these channels to neurophysiological biomarkers and symptoms of schizophrenia remain elusive. Here, using computational modeling, we show that a common biomarker of schizophrenia, namely, an increase in delta-oscillation power, may be a direct consequence of altered expression or kinetics of voltage-gated ion channels or calcium transporters. Our model of a circuit of layer V pyramidal cells highlights multiple types of schizophrenia-related variants that contribute to altered dynamics in the delta-frequency band. Moreover, our model predicts that the same membrane mechanisms that increase the layer V pyramidal cell network gain and response to delta-frequency oscillations may also cause a deficit in a single-cell correlate of the prepulse inhibition, which is a behavioral biomarker highly associated with schizophrenia.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Emotions can be characterized by dimensions of arousal and valence (pleasantness). While the functional brain bases of emotional arousal and valence have been actively investigated, the neuromolecular underpinnings remain poorly understood. We tested whether the opioid and dopamine systems involved in reward and motivational processes would be associated with emotional arousal and valence. We used in vivo positron emission tomography to quantify μ-opioid receptor and type 2 dopamine receptor (MOR and D<sub>2</sub>R, respectively) availability in brains of 35 healthy adult females. During subsequent functional magnetic resonance imaging carried out to monitor hemodynamic activity, the subjects viewed movie scenes of varying emotional content. Arousal and valence were associated with hemodynamic activity in brain regions involved in emotional processing, including amygdala, thalamus, and superior temporal sulcus. Cerebral MOR availability correlated negatively with the hemodynamic responses to arousing scenes in amygdala, hippocampus, thalamus, and hypothalamus, whereas no positive correlations were observed in any brain region.

These results suggest that emotional arousal is regulated by the MOR system, and that cerebral MOR availability influences brain activity elicited by arousing stimuli.</span>

<p>Neural stem cells (NSCs) hold great promise for neural repair in cases of CNS injury and neurodegeneration; however, conventional cell-based transplant methods face the challenges of poor survival and inadequate neuronal differentiation. Here, we report an alternative, tissue-based transplantation strategy whereby cerebral organoids derived from human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) were grafted into lesioned mouse cortex. Cerebral organoid transplants exhibited enhanced survival and robust vascularization from host brain as compared to transplants of dissociated neural progenitor cells (NPCs). Engrafted cerebral organoids harbored a large NSC pool and displayed multilineage neurodifferentiation at two and four weeks after grafting. Cerebral organoids therefore represent a promising alternative source to NSCs or fetal tissues for transplantation, as they contain a large set of neuroprogenitors and differentiated neurons in a structured organization. Engrafted cerebral organoids may also offer a unique experimental paradigm for modeling human neurodevelopment and CNS diseases in the context of vascularized cortical tissue.</p>

Abstract<p>World class drum corps require cooperation among performance artists to render precisely synchronized and asynchronized events. For example, drum corps visual aesthetics often feature salient radial and rotational motion displays from color guard. Accordingly, extensive color guard training might predict superior visual timing sensitivity to asynchronies in radial and rotational motion displays. Less intuitively, one might instead predict superior visual timing sensitivity among world class drum corps musicians, who regularly sub-divide musical tempos into brief time units. This prediction arises from the possibility that auditory training transfers cross-modally. Here, we investigated whether precise visual temporal order judgments more strongly align with color guard’s visual training or musicians’ auditory training. To mimic color guard visual displays, stimuli comprised bilateral plaid patterns that radiated or rotated before changing direction asynchronously. Human participants indicated whether the direction changed first on the left or right –a temporal order judgment (TOJ). Twenty-five percussionists, 67 brass players, and 29 color guard from a world class drum corps collectively completed 67,760 visual TOJ trials. Percussionists exhibited significantly lower TOJ thresholds than did brass players, who exhibited significantly lower TOJ thresholds than did color guard. Group median thresholds spanned an order of magnitude, ranging between 29 milliseconds (percussionists judging rotational asynchronies) and 290 milliseconds (color guard judging radial asynchronies). The results suggest that visual timing can improve more by training cross-modally than intra-modally, even when intra-modal training and testing stimuli closely match. More broadly, pre-existing training histories can provide a unique window into the nervous system’s timing sensitivity.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Optimal cognitive and behavioral performance typically occurs when training conditions closely match testing conditions. This fundamental principle from learning and memory predicts greater visual test performance after visual training than after auditory training. Contrastingly, a fundamental sensory principle –superior temporal precision for auditory versus visual stimuli – predicts better visual test performance after auditory training than after visual training. We observed more precise visual timing among musical experts than among visual experts who had years of visual experience that closely matched the testing stimuli. The musicians’ superior performance suggests that shared neural events mediate the precision of auditory and visual timing. Moreover, these shared neural events provide greater temporal precision than does matching sensory modalities across training and testing contexts.</p>

<p>Auditory nerve single-unit recordings were obtained from two groups of young barn owls (age, between posthatching days 11 and 86) in terminal experiments under two different anesthetic regimes: ketamine (6–11 mg/kg) plus xylazine (~2 mg/kg); or isoflurane (1–1.5%) in oxygen, delivered via artificial respiration. In a second series of minimally invasive experiments, auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) were recorded in the same four adult barn owls (<i>Tyto alba</i>; age, between 5 and 32 months) under three different anesthetic protocols: ketamine (10 mg/kg) plus xylazine (3 mg/kg), isoflurane (1–1.5%), and sevoflurane (2–3%) in carbogen. Finally, the ABR measurements on adult owls were repeated in terminal experiments including more invasive procedures such as artificial respiration and higher isoflurane dosage. The main finding was a significant deterioration of auditory sensitivity in barn owls under gas anesthesia, at the level of the auditory nerve (i.e., a very peripheral level of the auditory system). The effect was drastic in the young animals that experienced threshold elevations in auditory nerve single-unit responses of ≥20 dB. ABR thresholds assessed repeatedly in experiments on adult owls were also significantly higher under isoflurane and sevoflurane, on average by 7 and 15 dB, compared with ketamine/xylazine. This difference already occurred with minimal dosages and was reversibly enlarged with increased isoflurane concentration. Finally, there was evidence for confounding detrimental effects associated with artificial respiration over many hours, which suggested oxygen toxicity.</p>

<p>Synaptic AMPAR expression controls the strength of excitatory synaptic transmission and plasticity. An excess of synaptic AMPARs leads to epilepsy in response to seizure-inducible stimulation. The appropriate regulation of AMPARs plays a crucial role in the maintenance of the excitatory/inhibitory synaptic balance; however, the detailed mechanisms underlying epilepsy remain unclear. Our previous studies have revealed that a key modification of AMPAR trafficking to and from postsynaptic membranes is the reversible, posttranslational <i>S</i>-palmitoylation at the C-termini of receptors. To clarify the role of palmitoylation-dependent regulation of AMPARs <i>in vivo</i>, we generated GluA1 palmitoylation-deficient (Cys811 to Ser substitution) knock-in mice. These mutant male mice showed elevated seizure susceptibility and seizure-induced neuronal activity without impairments in synaptic transmission, gross brain structure, or behavior at the basal level. Disruption of the palmitoylation site was accompanied by upregulated GluA1 phosphorylation at Ser831, but not at Ser845, in the hippocampus and increased GluA1 protein expression in the cortex. Furthermore, GluA1 palmitoylation suppressed excessive spine enlargement above a certain size after LTP. Our findings indicate that an abnormality in GluA1 palmitoylation can lead to hyperexcitability in the cerebrum, which negatively affects the maintenance of network stability, resulting in epileptic seizures.</p>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> AMPARs predominantly mediate excitatory synaptic transmission. AMPARs are regulated in a posttranslational, palmitoylation-dependent manner in excitatory synapses of the mammalian brain. Reversible palmitoylation dynamically controls synaptic expression and intracellular trafficking of the receptors. Here, we generated GluA1 palmitoylation-deficient knock-in mice to clarify the role of AMPAR palmitoylation <i>in vivo</i>. We showed that an abnormality in GluA1 palmitoylation led to hyperexcitability, resulting in epileptic seizure. This is the first identification of a specific palmitoylated protein critical for the seizure-suppressing process. Our data also provide insight into how predicted receptors such as AMPARs can effectively preserve network stability in the brain. Furthermore, these findings help to define novel key targets for developing anti-epileptic drugs.</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The present study was undertaken to determine the efficacy of coadministration of fingolimod with alteplase in acute ischemic stroke patients in a delayed time window.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>This was a prospective, randomized, open‐label, blinded endpoint clinical trial, enrolling patients with internal carotid artery or middle cerebral artery proximal occlusion within 4.5 to 6 hours from symptom onset. Patients were randomly assigned to receive alteplase alone or alteplase with fingolimod. All patients underwent pretreatment and 24‐hour noncontrast computed tomography (CT)/perfusion CT/CT angiography. The coprimary endpoints were the decrease of National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale scores over 24 hours and the favorable shift of modified Rankin Scale score (mRS) distribution at day 90. Exploratory outcomes included vessel recanalization, anterograde reperfusion, and retrograde reperfusion of collateral flow.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Each treatment group included 23 patients. Compared with alteplase alone, patients receiving fingolimod plus alteplase exhibited better early clinical improvement at 24 hours and a favorable shift of mRS distribution at day 90. In addition, patients who received fingolimod and alteplase exhibited a greater reduction in the perfusion lesion accompanied by suppressed infarct growth by 24 hours. Fingolimod in conjunction with alteplase significantly improved anterograde reperfusion of downstream territory and prevented the failure of retrograde reperfusion from collateral circulation.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Fingolimod may enhance the efficacy of alteplase administration in the 4.5‐ to 6‐hour time window in patients with a proximal cerebral arterial occlusion and salvageable penumbral tissue by promoting both anterograde reperfusion and retrograde collateral flow. These findings are instructive for the design of future trials of recanalization therapies in extended time windows. Ann Neurol 2018;84:725–736</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Several small case series identified <i>KCTD7</i> mutations in patients with a rare autosomal recessive disorder designated progressive myoclonic epilepsy (EPM3) and neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (CLN14). Despite the name KCTD (potassium channel tetramerization domain), KCTD protein family members lack predicted channel domains. We sought to translate insight gained from yeast studies to uncover disease mechanisms associated with deficiencies in KCTD7 of unknown function.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Novel <i>KCTD7</i> variants in new and published patients were assessed for disease causality using genetic analyses, cell‐based functional assays of patient fibroblasts and knockout yeast, and electron microscopy of patient samples.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Patients with <i>KCTD7</i> mutations can exhibit movement disorders or developmental regression before seizure onset, and are distinguished from similar disorders by an earlier age of onset. Although most published <i>KCTD7</i> patient variants were excluded from a genome sequence database of normal human variations, most newly identified patient variants are present in this database, potentially challenging disease causality. However, genetic analysis and impaired biochemical interactions with cullin 3 support a causal role for patient <i>KCTD7</i> variants, suggesting deleterious alleles of <i>KCTD7</i> and other rare disease variants may be underestimated. Both patient‐derived fibroblasts and yeast lacking Whi2 with sequence similarity to KCTD7 have impaired autophagy consistent with brain pathology.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Biallelic <i>KCTD7</i> mutations define a neurodegenerative disorder with lipofuscin and lipid droplet accumulation but without defining features of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis or lysosomal storage disorders. <i>KCTD7</i> deficiency appears to cause an underlying autophagy‐lysosome defect conserved in yeast, thereby assigning a biological role for KCTD7.

   <i>NBEA</i> is a candidate gene for autism, and de novo variants have been reported in neurodevelopmental disease (NDD) cohorts. However, <i>NBEA</i> has not been rigorously evaluated as a disease gene, and associated phenotypes have not been delineated. We identified 24 de novo <i>NBEA</i> variants in patients with NDD, establishing <i>NBEA</i> as an NDD gene.

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Recent availability of amyloid and tau positron emission tomography (PET) has provided us with a unique opportunity to measure the association of systemic vascular health with brain health after accounting for the impact of Alzheimer disease (AD) pathologies. We wanted to quantify early cerebrovascular health–related magnetic resonance imaging brain measures (structure, perfusion, microstructural integrity) and evaluate their utility as a biomarker for cerebrovascular health.</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used 2 independent samples (discovery, n = 390; validation, n = 1,035) of individuals, aged ≥ 60 years, along the cognitive continuum with imaging from the population‐based sample of Mayo Clinic Study of Aging. We ascertained vascular health by summing up recently existing cardiovascular and metabolic conditions (CMC) from health care records (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, cardiac arrhythmias, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, and stroke). Using multiple regression models, we quantified associations between CMC and brain health after accounting for age, sex, education/occupation, and AD burden (from amyloid and tau PET).</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Systemic vascular health was associated with medial temporal lobe thinning, widespread cerebral hypoperfusion, and loss of microstructural integrity in several white matter tracts including the corpus callosum and fornix. Further investigations suggested that microstructural integrity of the genu of the corpus callosum was suitable for assessing prodromal cerebrovascular health, had similar distributions in the discovery and independent validation datasets, and predicted cognitive performance above and beyond amyloid deposition.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Systemic vascular health has significant impact on brain structure and function. Quantifying prodromal cerebrovascular health–related brain measures that are independent of AD pathology–related changes has great utility for cognitive aging. Ann Neurol 2018;84:713–724</p>

                <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25345?af=R">Disease progression and outcome measures in spinobulbar muscular atrophy</a></h4>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is a slowly progressive disease with weakness of bulbar and extremity muscles. There is no curative treatment for the disease, but several clinical trials have been conducted over the past years. The results from these trials have uncovered a great need to develop quantitative, reliable outcome measures. In this study, we prospectively investigated disease progression over 18 months in 29 patients with genetically confirmed SBMA, using quantitative outcome measures, including Dixon magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We used MRI to assess changes in muscle fat content and stationary dynamometry to assess changes in muscle strength. Disease progression was also investigated with the SBMA functional rating scale, bulbar rating scale, 6‐minute walk test, and blood samples, among others.</p>


<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Mean muscle fat content, muscle strength in knee extensors, handgrip strength, walking distance, and creatinine levels changed significantly. Mean muscle fat content increased by 2 ± 1.25%, and knee extension strength decreased from 83 ± 60 to 76 ± 56Nm, handgrip strength from 31 ± 13 to 29 ± 13kg, walking distance from 362 ± 216 to 336 ± 219m, and creatinine level from 58 ± 21 to 54 ± 20 μmol/l. Functional rating scores did not change.</p>


<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>The present study demonstrates a slow and steady disease progression in SBMA. Dixon MRI detected increases in muscle fat content in all investigated muscles and is therefore a suitable candidate for an outcome measure in natural history or treatment studies in SBMA. The 6‐minute walk test and handgrip strength also seem to be reliable outcome measures for SBMA. Ann Neurol 2018;84:762–773</p>

How does our brain give rise to passive or active defensive responses when we are confronted with threats? In a recent study in Cell, Terburg, Scheggia and colleagues (Terburg et al., 2018) show that, in both humans and rats, a pathway originating from the amygdala can help suppress passive responses, thereby facilitating active responses to imminent threats.

The cerebellum, a brain structure historically considered to be important for motor coordination, is often overlooked in terms of its role in higher-order control processing. Using resting-state functional connectivity and precision mapping, Marek et al. (2018) illuminate the cerebellum as an important source of individual variation in brain function and cognition.

Abstract<p>Decision making often requires weighing costs and benefits of different options that vary in terms of reward magnitude and uncertainty. Previous studies using pharmacological inactivations have shown that the basolateral amygdala (BLA) to nucleus accumbens (NAc) pathway promotes choice towards larger/riskier rewards. Neural activity in BLA and NAc show distinct, phasic changes in firing prior to choice and following action outcomes, yet, how these temporally-discrete patterns of activity within BLA-NAc circuitry influence choice is unclear. We assessed how optogenetic silencing of BLA terminals in the NAc altered action selection during probabilistic decision making. Rats received intra-BLA infusions of viruses encoding the inhibitory opsin eArchT and were well-trained on a probabilistic discounting task, where they chose between smaller/certain rewards and larger rewards delivered in a probabilistic manner, with the odds of obtaining the larger reward changing over a session (50-12.5%). During testing, activity of BLA&amp;cenveo_unknown_entity_wingdings_F0E0;NAc inputs were suppressed with 4-7 s pulses of light delivered via optic fibers into the NAc during discrete task events: prior to choice or after choice outcomes. Inhibition prior to choice reduced selection of the preferred option, suggesting that during deliberation, BLA-NAc activity biases choice towards preferred rewards. Inhibition during reward omissions increased risky choice during the low-probability block, indicating that activity after non-rewarded actions serves to modify subsequent choice. In contrast, silencing during rewarded outcomes did not reliably affect choice. These data demonstrate how patterns of activity in BLA-NAc circuitry convey different types of information that guide action selection in situations involving reward uncertainty.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Amygdala projections to the nucleus accumbens form a neural circuit that has been implicated in guiding risk-related decision making, and dysfunction in this circuitry is thought to underlie aberrant decision making observed a variety of psychiatric illnesses. The present study used temporally-discrete optogenetic inhibition to identify how activity in amygdala inputs to the accumbens, during different phases of the decision process, promotes optimal decision making. These findings provide novel insight into the mechanisms through which these circuits contribute to normal and abnormal decisions involving reward uncertainty.</p>

ABSTRACT<p>Current theories suggest that the ability to control the body and to predict its associated sensory consequences is key for skilled motor behavior. It is also suggested that these abilities need both be updated when the mapping between motor commands and sensory consequences is altered. Here we challenge this view by investigating the transfer of adaptation to rotated visual feedback between one task in which human participants had to control a cursor with their hand in order to track a moving target, and another in which they had to predict with their eyes the visual consequences of their hand movement on the cursor. Hand and eye tracking performances were evaluated respectively through cursor-target and gaze-cursor distance. Results reveal a striking dissociation: although prior adaptation of hand tracking greatly facilitates eye tracking, adaptation of eye tracking does not transfer to hand tracking. We conclude that although the update of control is associated with the update of prediction, prediction can be updated independently of control. To account for this pattern of results we propose that task demands mediate the update of prediction and control. Although a joint update of prediction and control seemed mandatory for success in our hand tracking task, the update of control was only facultative for success in our eye tracking task. More generally those results promote the view that prediction and control are mediated by separate neural processes and suggest that people can learn to predict movement consequences without necessarily promoting their ability to control these movements.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Current theories suggest that accurately predicting the sensory consequences of one’s actions is central for perception, awareness of action, and motor learning. In the latter case, it is assumed that prediction errors are used to train the controller that transforms our desired sensory consequences into motor commands. Here we show that, following exposure to biased hand visual feedback, people can update their ability to predict visual consequences of hand movements without necessarily improving their ability to control these movements. This work challenges the view that the joint update of prediction and control is mandatory when facing a change in the mapping between motor commands and sensory consequences. Instead we propose that task demands mediate the update of prediction and control.</p>

Abstract<p>The nervous system seamlessly integrates perception and action. This ability is essential for stable representation of and appropriate responses to the external environment. How the sensorimotor integration underlying this ability occurs at the level of individual neurons is of keen interest. In <i>C. elegans,</i> RIA interneurons receive input from sensory pathways and have reciprocal connections with head motor neurons. RIA simultaneously encodes both head orientation and sensory stimuli, which may allow it to integrate these two signals to detect the spatial distribution of stimuli across head sweeps and generate directional head responses. Here, we show that blocking synaptic release from RIA disrupts head orientation behaviors in response to unilaterally presented stimuli. We found that sensory encoding in RIA is gated according to head orientation. This dependence on head orientation is independent of motor encoding in RIA, suggesting a second, posture-dependent pathway upstream of RIA. This gating mechanism may allow RIA to selectively attend to stimuli that are asymmetric across head sweeps. Attractive odor removal during head bends triggers rapid head withdrawal in the opposite direction. Unlike sensory encoding, this directional response is dependent on motor inputs to and synaptic output from RIA. Together, these results suggest that RIA is part of a sensorimotor pathway that is dynamically regulated according to head orientation at two levels: the first is a gate that filters sensory representations in RIA, and the second is a switch that routes RIA synaptic output to dorsal or ventral head motor neurons.</p><p><b>Significance statement</b> Simple head orientation behaviors in <i>C. elegans</i> provide an opportunity to dissect sensorimotor integration at the cellular and subcellular levels. We describe a single interneuron that coordinates posture, sensation, and movement to detect the spatial distribution of stimuli and direct motor output to guide navigation behavior. Our findings underscore the fundamental role of neural mechanisms for integrating sensory input into ongoing behavior.</p>

Abstract
<p>GABAergic cells constitute 20–40% of the cells that project from the inferior colliculus [(IC) a midbrain auditory hub] to the medial geniculate body [(MG) the main auditory nucleus of the thalamus]. Four subtypes of GABAergic IC cells have been identified based on their association with perineuronal nets (PNs) and dense rings of axosomatic terminals expressing vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGLUT2 rings). These subtypes differ in their soma size and distribution within the IC. Based on previous work emphasizing large GABAergic cells as the origin of GABAergic IC–MG projections, we hypothesized that GABAergic IC cells surrounded by PNs and VGLUT2 rings, which tend to have larger somas, were more likely to project to the MG than smaller cells lacking these extracellular markers. Here, we injected retrograde tract tracers into the MG of guinea pigs of either sex and analyzed retrogradely labeled GABAergic cells in the ipsilateral IC for soma size and association with PNs and/or VGLUT2 rings. We found a range of GABAergic soma sizes present within the IC–MG pathway, which were reflective of the full range of GABAergic soma sizes present within the IC. Further, we found that all four subtypes of GABAergic IC cells participate in the IC–MG pathway, and that GABAergic cells lacking PNs and VGLUT2 rings were more prevalent within the pathway than would be expected based on their overall prevalence in the IC. These results may provide an anatomical substrate for the multiple roles of inhibition in the IC–MG pathway, which have emerged in electrophysiological studies.</p>

Abstract<p>Microglia are dynamic immune cells of the central nervous system, and their morphology is commonly used as a readout of cellular function. However, current morphological analysis techniques rely on either tracing of cells or 2D projection analysis, which are time-consuming, subject to bias, and may ignore important three-dimensional (3D) information. Therefore, we have created 3DMorph, a Matlab-based script that analyzes microglial morphology from 3D data. The program initially requires input of threshold levels, cell size expectations, and preferred methods of skeletonization. This makes 3DMorph easily scalable and adaptable to different imaging parameters or cell types. After these settings are defined, the program is completely automatic and can batch process files without user input. Output data includes cell volume, territorial volume, branch length, number of endpoints and branch points, and average distance between cells. We show that 3DMorph is accurate when compared to manual tracing, with significantly decreased user input time. Importantly, 3DMorph is capable of processing <i>in vivo</i> microglial morphology, as well as other 3D branching cell types, from mouse cranial windows or acute hippocampal slices. Therefore, we present a novel, user-friendly, scalable, and semi-automatic method of analyzing cell morphology in 3 dimensions. This method should improve the accuracy of cell measurements, remove user bias between conditions, increase reproducibility between experimenters and labs, and reduce user input time. We provide this open source code on GitHub so that it is free and accessible to all investigators.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Microglial morphology is often considered to be an indicator of cellular activity, however current techniques to analyze morphology either lose valuable z-dimension information or are time intensive to perform. Therefore, we introduce 3DMorph, a MATLAB-based program that semi-automatically processes individual microglial morphology from overlapping 3D clusters, improving accuracy and processing time compared to current tools. 3DMorph is straightforward to use and adaptable to many imaging or experimental parameters. Once user settings are selected, 3DMorph can run in batch mode to automatically process multiple files. We validate 3DMorph against current techniques, and demonstrate the ability to detect differences in microglial morphologies from different <i>ex vivo</i> experimental conditions, as well as from <i>in vivo</i> data, and images of other branching cell types.</p>

                <h4><a href="http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0137-18.2018v1?rss=1">Development of GABAergic inputs is not altered in early maturation of adult born dentate granule neurons in Fragile X mice</a></h4>

Abstract<p>Fragile X syndrome is the most common form of inherited mental retardation and the most common known cause of autism. Loss of Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) in mice (<i>Fmr1</i> KO) leads to altered synaptic and circuit maturation in the hippocampus that are correlated with alterations in hippocampal-dependent behaviors. Previous studies have demonstrated that loss of FMRP increased the rate of proliferation of progenitor cells and altered their fate specification in adult <i>Fmr1</i> KO mice. While these studies clearly demonstrate a role for FMRP in adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus, it is not known whether the functional synaptic maturation and integration of adult born dentate granule cells (abDGCs) into hippocampal circuits is affected in <i>Fmr1</i> KO mice. Here we used retroviral labeling to birthdate abDGCs in <i>Fmr1</i> KO mice which allowed us to perform targeted patch clamp recording to measure the development of synaptic inputs to these neurons at precise time points after differentiation. The frequency and amplitude of spontaneous GABAergic events increased over the first three weeks after differentiation, however this normal development of GABAergic synapses was not altered in <i>Fmr1</i> KO mice. Furthermore, the relatively depolarized GABA reversal potential (<i>E<sub>GABA</sub></i>) in immature abDGCs was unaffected by loss of FMRP as was the development of dendritic arbor of the adult generated neurons. These studies systematically characterized the functional development of abDGCs during the first four weeks after differentiation and demonstrate that the maturation of GABAergic synaptic inputs to these neurons is not grossly affected by the loss of FMRP.</p><p><b>Significance Statement</b> Loss of FMRP causes Fragile X Syndrome, a devastating neurodevelopmental disorder that causes multiple alterations in the development of synapses and neurons. Previous studies have described a role for FMRP in neurogenesis and hippocampal-dependent conditioning tasks linked to neurogenesis. This study systematically assessed the functional development of GABAergic inputs to adult born dentate granule cells during the first four weeks after differentiation of adult neural stem cells in <i>Fmr1</i> KO mice.</p>

Adaptation to the ever-changing world is critical for survival, and our brains are particularly tuned to remember events that differ from previous experiences. Novel experiences induce dopamine release in the hippocampus, a process which promotes memory persistence. While axons from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) were generally thought to be the exclusive source of hippocampal dopamine, recent studies have demonstrated that noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus (LC) corelease noradrenaline and dopamine in the hippocampus and that their dopamine release boosts memory retention as well.

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Clarifying learning-induced synaptic plasticity in hippocampal circuits is critical for understanding hippocampal mechanisms of memory acquisition and storage. Many in vitro studies have demonstrated learning-associated plasticity at hippocampal synapses. However, as a neural basis of memory encoding, the nature of synaptic plasticity underlying hippocampal neuronal responses to memorized stimulation remains elusive. Using in vivo whole-cell recording in anaesthetized adult rats and mice, we investigated synaptic activity of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells (PCs) in response to a flash of visual stimulation as the conditioned stimulus (CS) in associative fear conditioning. We found that shortly (&lt;3 days) after conditioning, excitatory synaptic responses and spiking responses to the flash CS emerged in a large number (~70%) of CA1 PCs, a neuronal population previously unresponsive to the flash before conditioning. The learning-induced CA1 excitatory responsiveness was further indicated to result from postsynaptic unsilencing at flash-associated silent synapses, with NMDA receptor-gated responses we recently reported in naive animals. Our findings suggest that associative fear learning can induce excitatory responsiveness to the memorized CS in a large population of CA1 neurons, via a process of postsynaptic unsilencing at CA1 silent synapses, which may be critical for hippocampal acquisition and storage of associative memory.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The characterization of the functional significance of interindividual variation in brain morphometry is a core aim of cognitive neuroscience. Prior research has focused on interindividual variation at the level of regional brain measures thus overlooking the fact that each individual brain is a person-specific ensemble of interdependent regions. To expand this line of inquiry we introduce the person-based similarity index (PBSI) for brain morphometry. The conceptual unit of the PBSI is the individual person’s brain structural profile which considers all relevant morphometric measures as features of a single vector. In 2 independent cohorts (total of 1756 healthy participants), we demonstrate the foundational validity of this approach by affirming that the PBSI scores for subcortical volume and cortical thickness in healthy individuals differ between men and women, are heritable, and robust to variation in neuroimaging parameters, sample composition, and regional brain morphometry. Moreover, the PBSI scores correlate with age, body mass index, and fluid intelligence. Collectively, these results suggest that the person-based measures of brain morphometry are biologically and functionally meaningful and have the potential to advance the study of human variation in multivariate brain imaging phenotypes in healthy and clinical populations.</span>

<span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Adolescence is marked by increased vulnerability to mental disorders and maladaptive behaviors, including anorexia nervosa. Food-restriction (FR) stress evokes foraging, which translates to increased wheel running exercise (EX) for caged rodents, a maladaptive behavior, since it does not improve food access and exacerbates weight loss. While almost all adolescent rodents increase EX following FR, some then become resilient by suppressing EX by the second–fourth FR day, which minimizes weight loss. We asked whether GABAergic plasticity in the hippocampus may underlie this gain in resilience. In vitro slice physiology revealed doubling of pyramidal neurons’ GABA response in the dorsal hippocampus of food-restricted animals with wheel access (FR + EX for 4 days), but without increase of mIPSC amplitudes. mIPSC frequency increased by 46%, but electron microscopy revealed no increase in axosomatic GABAergic synapse number onto pyramidal cells and only a modest increase (26%) of GABAergic synapse lengths. These changes suggest increase of vesicular release probability and extrasynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors and unsilencing of GABAergic synapses. GABAergic synapse lengths correlated with individual’s suppression of wheel running and weight loss. These analyses indicate that EX can have dual roles—exacerbate weight loss but also promote resilience to some by dampening hippocampal excitability.</span>
