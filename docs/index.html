<p>An expression atlas and database of 38 neuropeptide genes and GABAergic/glutamatergic neuron marker genes in the adult zebrafish forebrain were constructed. The zebrafish hypothalamus was subdivided into finer subregions and its organization was reassessed based on the profiles of neuropeptide expression. The obtained expression data in the telencephalon and hypothalamus were compared with those from mice, revealing several similarities between these two vertebrate species.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Zebrafish is a useful model organism in neuroscience; however, its gene expression atlas in the adult brain is not well developed. In the present study, we examined the expression of 38 neuropeptides, comparing with GABAergic and glutamatergic neuron marker genes in the adult zebrafish brain by comprehensive in situ hybridization. The results are summarized as an expression atlas in 19 coronal planes of the forebrain. Furthermore, the scanned data of all brain sections were made publicly available in the Adult Zebrafish Brain Gene Expression Database (<a target="_blank"

   href="https://ssbd.riken.jp/azebex/">https://ssbd.riken.jp/azebex/</a>). Based on these data, we performed detailed comparative neuroanatomical analyses of the hypothalamus and found that several regions previously described as one nucleus in the reference zebrafish brain atlas contain two or more subregions with significantly different neuropeptide/neurotransmitter expression profiles. Subsequently, we compared the expression data in zebrafish telencephalon and hypothalamus obtained in this study with those in mice, by performing a cluster analysis. As a result, several nuclei in zebrafish and mice were clustered in close vicinity. The present expression atlas, database, and anatomical findings will contribute to future neuroscience research using zebrafish.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/85567">Ingestible pills reveal gastric correlates of emotions</a></h4>

              
                Although it is generally held that gastrointestinal (GI) signals are related to emotions, direct evidence for such a link is currently lacking. One of the reasons why the internal milieu of the GI system is poorly investigated is because visceral organs are difficult to access and monitor. To directly measure the influence of endoluminal markers of GI activity on the emotional experience, we asked a group of healthy male participants to ingest a pill that measured pH, pressure, and temperature of their GI tract while they watched video clips that consistently induced disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, or a control neutral state. In addition to the objective physiological markers of GI activity, subjective ratings of perceived emotions and visceral (i.e. gastric, respiratory and cardiac) sensations were recorded, as well as changes in heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (HRV) and spontaneous eyes blinks as non-gastric behavioral and autonomic markers of the emotional experience. We found that when participants observed fearful and disgusting video clips, they reported to perceive not only cardiac and respiratory sensations but also gastric sensations, such as nausea. Moreover, we found that there was a clear relation between the physiology of the stomach and the perceived emotions. Specifically, when disgusting video clips were displayed, the more acidic the pH, the more participants reported feelings of disgust and fear; the less acidic the pH, the more they reported happiness. Complementing the results found in the deep gastric realm, we found that disgusting stimuli induced a significant increase in HRV compared to the neutral scenarios, and together with fearful video clips a decrease in HR. Our findings suggest that gastric signals contribute to unique emotional states and that ingestible pills may open new avenues for exploring the deep-body physiology of emotions.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91452">Potassium-mediated bacterial chemotactic response</a></h4>

              
                Bacteria in biofilms secrete potassium ions to attract free swimming cells. However, the basis of chemotaxis to potassium remains poorly understood. Here, using a microfluidic device, we found that <i>Escherichia coli</i> can rapidly accumulate in regions of high potassium concentration on the order of millimoles. Using a bead assay, we measured the dynamic response of individual flagellar motors to stepwise changes in potassium concentration, finding that the response resulted from the chemotaxis signaling pathway. To characterize the chemotactic response to potassium, we measured the dose–response curve and adaptation kinetics via an Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay, finding that the chemotaxis pathway exhibited a sensitive response and fast adaptation to potassium. We further found that the two major chemoreceptors Tar and Tsr respond differently to potassium. Tar receptors exhibit a biphasic response, whereas Tsr receptors respond to potassium as an attractant. These different responses were consistent with the responses of the two receptors to intracellular pH changes. The sensitive response and fast adaptation allow bacteria to sense and localize small changes in potassium concentration. The differential responses of Tar and Tsr receptors to potassium suggest that cells at different growth stages respond differently to potassium and may have different requirements for potassium.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94561">Tracking the neurodevelopmental trajectory of beta band oscillations with optically pumped magnetometer-based magnetoencephalography</a></h4>

              
                Neural oscillations mediate the coordination of activity within and between brain networks, supporting cognition and behaviour. How these processes develop throughout childhood is not only an important neuroscientific question but could also shed light on the mechanisms underlying neurological and psychiatric disorders. However, measuring the neurodevelopmental trajectory of oscillations has been hampered by confounds from instrumentation. In this paper, we investigate the suitability of a disruptive new imaging platform – optically pumped magnetometer-based magnetoencephalography (OPM-MEG) – to study oscillations during brain development. We show how a unique 192-channel OPM-MEG device, which is adaptable to head size and robust to participant movement, can be used to collect high-fidelity electrophysiological data in individuals aged between 2 and 34 years. Data were collected during a somatosensory task, and we measured both stimulus-induced modulation of beta oscillations in sensory cortex, and whole-brain connectivity, showing that both modulate significantly with age. Moreover, we show that pan-spectral bursts of electrophysiological activity drive task-induced beta modulation, and that their probability of occurrence and spectral content change with age. Our results offer new insights into the developmental trajectory of beta oscillations and provide clear evidence that OPM-MEG is an ideal platform for studying electrophysiology in neurodevelopment.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92189">Syntaxin 17 recruitment to mature autophagosomes is temporally regulated by PI4P accumulation</a></h4>

              
                During macroautophagy, cytoplasmic constituents are engulfed by autophagosomes. Lysosomes fuse with closed autophagosomes but not with unclosed intermediate structures. This is achieved in part by the late recruitment of the autophagosomal SNARE syntaxin 17 (STX17) to mature autophagosomes. However, how STX17 recognizes autophagosome maturation is not known. Here, we show that this temporally regulated recruitment of STX17 depends on the positively charged C-terminal region of STX17. Consistent with this finding, mature autophagosomes are more negatively charged compared with unclosed intermediate structures. This electrostatic maturation of autophagosomes is likely driven by the accumulation of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) in the autophagosomal membrane. Accordingly, dephosphorylation of autophagosomal PI4P prevents the association of STX17 to autophagosomes. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations support PI4P-dependent membrane insertion of the transmembrane helices of STX17. Based on these findings, we propose a model in which STX17 recruitment to mature autophagosomes is temporally regulated by a PI4P-driven change in the surface charge of autophagosomes.

                Background Empyema (the presence of pus in the pleural space) is a severe complication of community-acquired pneumonia and significant cause of morbidity, but, fortunately, not mortality in children. Between 0.6 and 2% of pneumonias are complicated by empyema and the three main pathogens involved are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and group A Streptococcus 1,2,3,4. Optimal management in children, especially the choice of antibiotics, method of administration and duration of therapy, pleural dranage or surgery, are still a matter of debate and currently, lack of strong specific recommendations. This paper displays the study protocol for a scoping review that aims to summarize the available literature on the microbiological epidemiology, the medical and surgical treatment options, and the outcomes of pleural empyema in pediatric population. Methods Comprehensive research combining the terms pediatric (children aged 0 to 18 years) and pleural empyema will be performed on PubMed and SCOPUS to identify all eligible studies. At first, two reviewers will screen the abstract and then their full text to determine the articles that meet the inclusion criteria. This work will be carried out independently, everyone on a different Excel spreadsheet and each researcher will be blinded to the decision of the other researcher. When the process is completed, in case of discordance, any disagreement will be identified and resolved through discussion or with help of a third author. Dissemination The findings of this review will be published in a peer-reviewed journal.

                Background Numerous tools are available for evaluation of upper limb (UL) functions among stroke survivors. Despite the excellent psychometric properties, many require considerable amount of time, are resource-intensive, and often impractical for bedside evaluation. Objectives To develop and concurrently validate a simple, resource-efficient, and time-efficient bedside tool for evaluating UL function in stroke survivors. Methods Relevant literature review was carried out to conceptualize and define the theoretical framework of day-to-day UL movement tasks. Subsequently, an item pool of 18 UL movements was developed. A mini-Delphi method was employed to verify content validity. During the iterative rounds, 18-items were revised and refined to a 12-items scale. The final bedside upper limb evaluation tool (BUFET) scale underwent concurrent validation by correlating the scores with Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT) scores using Spearman’s correlation coefficient. Internal consistency was evaluated through Cronbach’s alpha. Results Concurrent validity and internal consistency of the scale were supported by a high correlation coefficient (r = 0.937; p<0.001) with WMFT and high Cronbach’s alpha (0.948). Conclusions Newly developed BUFET was found to be a valid and reliable bedside tool in the evaluation of upper limb functions and can be administered in a resource and time-efficient manner.

                <p>Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), the most common subtype of hemorrhagic stroke, leads to cognitive impairment and imposes significant psychological burdens on patients. Hippocampal neurogenesis has been shown to play an essential role in cognitive function. Our previous study has shown that tetrahydrofolate (THF) promotes the proliferation of neural stem cells (NSCs). However, the effect of THF on cognition after ICH and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we demonstrated that administration of THF could restore cognition after ICH. Using Nestin-GFP mice, we further revealed that THF enhanced the proliferation of hippocampal NSCs and neurogenesis after ICH. Mechanistically, we found that THF could prevent ICH-induced elevated level of PTEN and decreased expressions of phosphorylated AKT and mTOR. Furthermore, conditional deletion of PTEN in NSCs of the hippocampus attenuated the inhibitory effect of ICH on the proliferation of NSCs and abnormal neurogenesis. Taken together, these results provide molecular insights into ICH-induced cognitive impairment and suggest translational clinical therapeutic strategy for hemorrhagic stroke.</p>

                <p>The Cre-lox system is an indispensable tool in neuroscience research for targeting gene deletions to specific cellular populations. Here we assess the utility of several transgenic <I>Cre</I> lines, along with a viral approach, for targeting cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) in mice. Using a combination of a fluorescent reporter line (<I>Ai14</I>) to indicate <I>Cre</I>-mediated recombination and a floxed Dystroglycan line (<I>Dag1<sup>flox</sup></I>), we show that reporter expression does not always align precisely with loss of protein. The commonly used <I>Pcp2<sup>Cre</sup></I> line exhibits a gradual mosaic pattern of <I>Cre</I> recombination in PCs from Postnatal Day 7 (P7) to P14, while loss of Dag1 protein is not complete until P30. <I>Ptf1a<sup>Cre</sup></I> drives recombination in precursor cells that give rise to GABAergic neurons in the embryonic cerebellum, including PCs and molecular layer interneurons. However, due to its transient expression in precursors, <I>Ptf1a<sup>Cre</sup></I> results in stochastic loss of Dag1 protein in these neurons. <I>Nestin<sup>Cre</sup></I>, which is often described as a "pan-neuronal" <I>Cre</I> line for the central nervous system, does not drive <I>Cre</I>-mediated recombination in PCs. We identify a <I>Calb1<sup>Cre</sup></I> line that drives efficient and complete recombination in embryonic PCs, resulting in loss of Dag1 protein before the period of synaptogenesis. <I>AAV8</I>-mediated delivery of <I>Cre</I> at P0 results in gradual transduction of PCs during the second postnatal week, with loss of Dag1 protein not reaching appreciable levels until P35. These results characterize several tools for targeting conditional deletions in cerebellar PCs at different developmental stages and illustrate the importance of validating the loss of protein following recombination.</p>

                Background The quality of COVID-19 preprints should be considered with great care, as their contents can influence public policy. Surprisingly little has been done to calibrate the public’s evaluation of preprints and their contents. The PRECHECK project aimed to generate a tool to teach and guide scientifically literate non-experts to critically evaluate preprints, on COVID-19 and beyond. Methods To create a checklist, we applied a four-step procedure consisting of an initial internal review, an external review by a pool of experts (methodologists, meta-researchers/experts on preprints, journal editors, and science journalists), a final internal review, and a Preliminary implementation stage. For the external review step, experts rated the relevance of each element of the checklist on five-point Likert scales, and provided written feedback. After each internal review round, we applied the checklist on a small set of high-quality preprints from an online list of milestone research works on COVID-19 and low-quality preprints, which were eventually retracted, to verify whether the checklist can discriminate between the two categories. Results At the external review step, 26 of the 54 contacted experts responded. The final checklist contained four elements (Research question, study type, transparency and integrity, and limitations), with ‘superficial’ and ‘deep’ evaluation levels. When using both levels, the checklist was effective at discriminating a small set of high- and low-quality preprints. Its usability for assessment and discussion of preprints was confirmed in workshops with Bachelors students in Psychology and Medicine, and science journalists. Conclusions We created a simple, easy-to-use tool for helping scientifically literate non-experts navigate preprints with a critical mind and facilitate discussions within, for example, a beginner-level lecture on research methods. We believe that our checklist has potential to help guide decisions about the quality of preprints on COVID-19 in our target audience and that this extends beyond COVID-19.

                The subtypes of breast cancer exhibit diverse histology, molecular features, therapeutic response, aggressiveness, and patient outcomes. Multi-omics high-throughput technologies, which are widely used in cancer research, generated waste amounts of multimodal omic datasets calling for new approaches of integrated analyses to uncover patterns of transcriptomic, genomic, and epigenetic changes in breast cancer subtypes and connect them to disease clinical characteristics. Here, we applied multi-layer self-organizing map (ml-SOM) algorithms to PAM50-classified TCGA breast cancer samples to disentangle the diversity of the effects of gene expression, methylation, copy number, and somatic single nucleotide variation in the disease subtypes. Furthermore, we studied the association of perturbed gene modules with survival, prognosis, and other clinical characteristics. Our findings highlight the power of multi-omic analyses to offer a better understanding of the molecular diversity of breast cancer subtypes compared to single-omic analyses. Moreover, they highlight the complex subtype-characteristic associations between gene expression and epigenetic/genomic factors and their implications for survival and clinical outcomes.

                Periodontitis, a chronic inflammatory condition affecting the periodontal tissues and underlying bone, is now acknowledged as more than just a localized oral disease. With a global prevalence ranging from 20% to 50%, the implications of periodontitis extend beyond oral health, presenting significant concerns for public health. Research has demonstrated a strong association between periodontitis and cardiovascular disease, with shared risk factors encompassing age, smoking, socioeconomic status, and metabolic syndrome. Understanding the intricate relationship between periodontal disease and cardiovascular diseases, especially the development of arrhythmias like atrial fibrillation, is crucial. A comprehensive literature search using PubMed was conducted, employing keywords such as periodontitis, cardiovascular disease, cardiac arrhythmia, atrial fibrillation, and related terms. No exclusion criteria were used. This article reviews the current literature on the association between periodontitis and cardiovascular diseases, including atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation, the most common cardiac arrhythmia, is influenced by various risk factors including alcohol consumption, advanced age, underlying heart and lung diseases, with poor oral hygiene emerging as a notable contributing factor. The direct invasion of endothelial cells by periodontal pathogens, the indirect pathway where periodontal disease triggers a systemic inflammatory response, and a shared genetic basis are three theories that explain this link. Patients with periodontal disease face an elevated risk of major cardiovascular events, especially arrhythmias, and recognizing this association is essential for healthcare practitioners to provide comprehensive care to patients with cardiac conditions.

                Background Enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) is associated with acute and chronic diarrhea worldwide. EAEC is thought to form thick biofilms on the intestinal mucosa. Epidemiological data suggest that SepA, a serine protease autotransporter of Enterobacteriaceae (SPATE), is important for EAEC disease. The genes for SepA, and some proteins that are important for EAEC biofilm formation and aggregative adherence, are encoded by the pAA plasmid. Methods We deleted sepA 49-4043 from six EAEC clinical isolates and inserted a chloramphenicol resistance gene (cat) in place of the sepA coding sequence. In vitro biofilm formation was assessed after growth in 96-well plates. Complementation studies were conducted with genetic and protein-based techniques. We moved the pAA plasmid from EAEC strains into a commensal E. coli. Finally, we sequenced the pAA of several strains. Results All of the wild-type EAEC strains secreted similar amounts of SepA as assessed by Western blot analysis. Four of the six mutant EAEC strains exhibited increased biofilm staining when sepA was deleted. Additionally, we found that introduction of pAAΔsepA K261 into a nalidixic acid resistant commensal E. coli strain, (HSNalR) resulted in significantly increased biofilm staining relative to HSNalR (pAAK261). Therefore, pAAΔsepA K261 alone was sufficient to confer the elevated biofilm phenotype onto HSNalR. However, introduction of sepA via a plasmid or on the pAA did not restore biofilm staining to wild-type levels in the ΔsepA mutant strains that showed elevated biofilm staining. Furthermore, the addition of exogenous SepA to the biofilm in vitro did not reduce biofilm staining. Conclusions Taken together, our results suggest that deletion of sepA causes elevated biofilm formation in some EAEC strains, but that the increased biofilm staining is not directly due to the loss of SepA.

                Seed priming enhances germination and growth, which are important determinants of crop yield. This study was carried out to assess the effect of priming duration and metabolite concentration on the priming of five (5) different crops, using the metabolites of five (5) bacterial isolates. The crop seeds were treated in the cold-extracted metabolites of the five isolates at five (5) different priming durations (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 h) and then in five metabolite concentrations (200, 400, 600, 800, and 1000 mg/L) of the five extracted metabolites at the optimal priming duration determined in the first experiment. Characterization of the cold-extracted metabolites was also carried out using gas-chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Results revealed that priming cowpea and soybean for longer durations (< 3 h) could hinder their growth and development. Lower concentrations were observed to be optimal for cowpea and soybean, but for sesame and okra, there was no detectable pattern with metabolite concentration. The GC-MS revealed the presence of some molecules (e.g. hexadecanoic acid) that have shown plant growth promotion potential in other studies. This study showed that seeds with large endosperm, such as, cowpea and soybean, are more prone to the deleterious effects of treatment for longer durations. Further experiments should be carried out to isolate and purify the bioactive moieties for further studies and onward application.

                Background Perioperative thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) is commonly used in hepatectomy patients since it is opioid-sparing and reduces cardiorespiratory complications. However, TEA has a high failure rate and is associated with potentially devastating complications (particularly spinal haematoma) and the risk is increased with hepatectomy. Thus, some centres favour systemic opioid-based modalities which, in turn, are associated with inferior analgesia and well-known risks/side-effects. Hence, alternative analgesic methods are desirable. Paravertebral block (PVB) has been used in liver resection with advantages including haemodynamic stability, low failure rates, and low risk of spinal haematoma. Our purpose is to conduct a blinded, pilot RCT with hepatectomy patients randomised to receive TEA or PVB for perioperative analgesia. We hypothesise that opioid consumption, time to first analgesic request, and pain scores will be comparable between groups, but PVB patients will require fewer perioperative vasopressors/blood products, and have fewer adverse events and a shorter hospital stay. Methods With ethics approval, this non-inferiority, pilot RCT with a convenience sample of 50 hepatectomy patients will examine whether PVB imparts analgesia comparable to TEA but with fewer adverse effects. Primary outcomes are surrogates of analgesia for 72 h postoperatively (i.e., opioid consumption, time to first analgesic request and pain scores at rest and with coughing); Secondary outcomes are blood products/fluids administered; side effects/complications until 72 h postoperatively; length of hospital stay. The results will be used to plan a large multicentre trial comparing TEA vs. PVB in hepatectomy patients. This study has a high potential to positively impact the quality/safety of patient care.

Multi-factor screenings are commonly used in diverse applications in medicine and bioengineering, including optimizing combination drug treatments and microbiome engineering. Despite the advances in high-throughput technologies, large-scale experiments typically remain prohibitively expensive. Here we introduce a machine learning platform, structure-augmented regression (SAR), that exploits the intrinsic structure of each biological system to learn a high-accuracy model with minimal data requirement. Under different environmental perturbations, each biological system exhibits a unique, structured phenotypic response. This structure can be learned based on limited data and once learned, can constrain subsequent quantitative predictions. We demonstrate that SAR requires significantly fewer data comparing to other existing machine-learning methods to achieve a high prediction accuracy, first on simulated data, then on experimental data of various systems and input dimensions. We then show how a learned structure can guide effective design of new experiments. Our approach has implications for predictive control of biological systems and an integration of machine learning prediction and experimental design.

                <p>by Alexandra M. Proca, Fernando E. Rosas, Andrea I. Luppi, Daniel Bor, Matthew Crosby, Pedro A. M. Mediano</p>

Striking progress has been made in understanding cognition by analyzing how the brain is engaged in different modes of information processing. For instance, so-called <i>synergistic</i> information (information encoded by a set of neurons but not by any subset) plays a key role in areas of the human brain linked with complex cognition. However, two questions remain unanswered: (a) how and why a cognitive system can become highly synergistic; and (b) how informational states map onto artificial neural networks in various learning modes. Here we employ an information-decomposition framework to investigate neural networks performing cognitive tasks. Our results show that synergy increases as networks learn multiple diverse tasks, and that in tasks requiring integration of multiple sources, performance critically relies on synergistic neurons. Overall, our results suggest that synergy is used to combine information from multiple modalities—and more generally for flexible and efficient learning. These findings reveal new ways of investigating how and why learning systems employ specific information-processing strategies, and support the principle that the capacity for general-purpose learning critically relies on the system’s information dynamics.

Neuroscientists studying the neural correlates of mouse behavior often lack access to the brain-wide activity patterns elicited during a specific task of interest. Fortunately, large-scale imaging is becoming increasingly accessible thanks to modalities such as Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging and functional ultrasound (fUS). However, these and other techniques often involve challenging cranial window procedures and are difficult to combine with other neuroscience tools. We address this need with an open-source 3D-printable cranial implant—the COMBO (ChrOnic Multimodal imaging and Behavioral Observation) window. The COMBO window enables chronic imaging of large portions of the brain in head-fixed mice while preserving orofacial movements. We validate the COMBO window stability using both brain-wide fUS and multisite two-photon imaging. Moreover, we demonstrate how the COMBO window facilitates the combination of optogenetics, fUS, and electrophysiology in the same animals to study the effects of circuit perturbations at both the brain-wide and single-neuron level. Overall, the COMBO window provides a versatile solution for performing multimodal brain recordings in head-fixed mice.

Deuterostomes are a monophyletic group of animals that includes Hemichordata, Echinodermata (together called Ambulacraria), and Chordata. The diversity of deuterostome body plans has made it challenging to reconstruct their ancestral condition and to decipher the genetic changes that drove the diversification of deuterostome lineages. Here, we generate chromosome-level genome assemblies of 2 hemichordate species, <i>Ptychodera flava</i> and <i>Schizocardium californicum</i>, and use comparative genomic approaches to infer the chromosomal architecture of the deuterostome common ancestor and delineate lineage-specific chromosomal modifications. We show that hemichordate chromosomes (1<i>N</i> = 23) exhibit remarkable chromosome-scale macrosynteny when compared to other deuterostomes and can be derived from 24 deuterostome ancestral linkage groups (ALGs). These deuterostome ALGs in turn match previously inferred bilaterian ALGs, consistent with a relatively short transition from the last common bilaterian ancestor to the origin of deuterostomes. Based on this deuterostome ALG complement, we deduced chromosomal rearrangement events that occurred in different lineages. For example, a fusion-with-mixing event produced an Ambulacraria-specific ALG that subsequently split into 2 chromosomes in extant hemichordates, while this homologous ALG further fused with another chromosome in sea urchins. Orthologous genes distributed in these rearranged chromosomes are enriched for functions in various developmental processes. We found that the deeply conserved Hox clusters are located in highly rearranged chromosomes and that maintenance of the clusters are likely due to lower densities of transposable elements within the clusters. We also provide evidence that the deuterostome-specific pharyngeal gene cluster was established via the combination of 3 pre-assembled microsyntenic blocks. We suggest that since chromosomal rearrangement events and formation of new gene clusters may change the regulatory controls of developmental genes, these events may have contributed to the evolution of diverse body plans among deuterostomes.

                Background Neonatal healthcare-associated infection (HAI) globally is the leading preventable cause of neonatal mortality. Neonatal mortality in India is also very high. Considering that HAIs can be prevented globally, there are disparities in resources; the current study aimed at developing locally feasible and effective prevention bundles for neonatal HAIs. Methods A mixed-method study was conducted at one tertiary care teaching hospital's level IV Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. The study explores the causes of neonatal HAIs, current processes, benchmark practices, gaps in current practices with HAIs, root-cause analysis and system process mapping, and failure mode effect analysis. Observations, interviews, brainstorming activities, and a survey were conducted. Written and audio-video recorded prevention bundle was developed and implemented using a quasi-experimental study design. Results Process standardisation, healthcare worker training, hand hygiene practices, nursing care process and vascular access process were identified as key improvement areas to prevent neonatal HAIs. Out of eighteen identified processes, three processes were standardised. All the healthcare providers were trained at three-time intervals of three months each. After implementing the prevention bundle, there was a significant decline in the rate of HAIs, reducing it from 9.6 to 7.0 per 100 admissions >48 hours. The bacteraemia rate fell from 5.2 per 1000 patient days to 2.6 per 1000 patient days and was statistically significant on a two-tailed student t-test with 95% CI with p-value=0.00073. Conclusions Our developed prevention bundle for neonatal HAIs was significantly effective and reproducible for healthcare workers' training and development. Considering variations in global infection control practices and resources constraint, it is effective to develop a local prevention bundle for neonatal HAIs.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91288">Near-perfect precise on-target editing of human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells</a></h4>

              
                Precision gene editing in primary hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) would facilitate both curative treatments for monogenic disorders as well as disease modelling. Precise efficiencies even with the CRISPR/Cas system, however, remain limited. Through an optimization of guide RNA delivery, donor design, and additives, we have now obtained mean precise editing efficiencies &gt;90% on primary cord blood HSCPs with minimal toxicity and without observed off-target editing. The main protocol modifications needed to achieve such high efficiencies were the addition of the DNA-PK inhibitor AZD7648, and the inclusion of spacer-breaking silent mutations in the donor in addition to mutations disrupting the PAM sequence. Critically, editing was even across the progenitor hierarchy, did not substantially distort the hierarchy or affect lineage outputs in colony-forming cell assays or the frequency of high self-renewal potential long-term culture initiating cells. As modelling of many diseases requires heterozygosity, we also demonstrated that the overall editing and zygosity can be tuned by adding in defined mixtures of mutant and wild-type donors. With these optimizations, editing at near-perfect efficiency can now be accomplished directly in human HSPCs. This will open new avenues in both therapeutic strategies and disease modelling.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91924">Agent-based model demonstrates the impact of nonlinear, complex interactions between cytokinces on muscle regeneration</a></h4>

              
                Muscle regeneration is a complex process due to dynamic and multiscale biochemical and cellular interactions, making it difficult to identify microenvironmental conditions that are beneficial to muscle recovery from injury using experimental approaches alone. To understand the degree to which individual cellular behaviors impact endogenous mechanisms of muscle recovery, we developed an agent-based model (ABM) using the Cellular-Potts framework to simulate the dynamic microenvironment of a cross-section of murine skeletal muscle tissue. We referenced more than 100 published studies to define over 100 parameters and rules that dictate the behavior of muscle fibers, satellite stem cells (SSCs), fibroblasts, neutrophils, macrophages, microvessels, and lymphatic vessels, as well as their interactions with each other and the microenvironment. We utilized parameter density estimation to calibrate the model to temporal biological datasets describing cross-sectional area (CSA) recovery, SSC, and fibroblast cell counts at multiple timepoints following injury. The calibrated model was validated by comparison of other model outputs (macrophage, neutrophil, and capillaries counts) to experimental observations. Predictions for eight model perturbations that varied cell or cytokine input conditions were compared to published experimental studies to validate model predictive capabilities. We used Latin hypercube sampling and partial rank correlation coefficient to identify in silico perturbations of cytokine diffusion coefficients and decay rates to enhance CSA recovery. This analysis suggests that combined alterations of specific cytokine decay and diffusion parameters result in greater fibroblast and SSC proliferation compared to individual perturbations with a 13% increase in CSA recovery compared to unaltered regeneration at 28 days. These results enable guided development of therapeutic strategies that similarly alter muscle physiology (i.e. converting extracellular matrix [ECM]-bound cytokines into freely diffusible forms as studied in cancer therapeutics or delivery of exogenous cytokines) during regeneration to enhance muscle recovery after injury.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90972">Glutamatergic supramammillary nucleus neurons respond to threatening stressors and promote active coping</a></h4>

              
                Threat-response neural circuits are conserved across species and play roles in normal behavior and psychiatric diseases. Maladaptive changes in these neural circuits contribute to stress, mood, and anxiety disorders. Active coping in response to stressors is a psychosocial factor associated with resilience against stress-induced mood and anxiety disorders. The neural circuitry underlying active coping is poorly understood, but the functioning of these circuits could be key for overcoming anxiety and related disorders. The supramammillary nucleus (SuM) has been suggested to be engaged by threat. SuM has many projections and a poorly understood diversity of neural populations. In studies using mice, we identified a unique population of glutamatergic SuM neurons (SuM<sup>VGLUT2+</sup>::POA) based on projection to the preoptic area of the hypothalamus (POA) and found SuM<sup>VGLUT2+</sup>::POA neurons have extensive arborizations. SuM<sup>VGLUT2+</sup>::POA neurons project to brain areas that mediate features of the stress and threat responses including the paraventricular nucleus thalamus (PVT), periaqueductal gray (PAG), and habenula (Hb). Thus, SuM<sup>VGLUT2+</sup>::POA neurons are positioned as a hub, connecting to areas implicated in regulating stress responses. Here we report SuM<sup>VGLUT2+</sup>::POA neurons are recruited by diverse threatening stressors, and recruitment correlated with active coping behaviors. We found that selective photoactivation of the SuM<sup>VGLUT2+</sup>::POA population drove aversion but not anxiety like behaviors. Activation of SuM<sup>VGLUT2+</sup>::POA neurons in the absence of acute stressors evoked active coping like behaviors and drove instrumental behavior. Also, activation of SuM<sup>VGLUT2+</sup>::POA neurons was sufficient to convert passive coping strategies to active behaviors during acute stress. In contrast, we found activation of GABAergic (VGAT+) SuM neurons (SuM<sup>VGAT+</sup>) neurons did not alter drive aversion or active coping, but termination of photostimulation was followed by increased mobility in the forced swim test. These findings establish a new node in stress response circuitry that has projections to many brain areas and evokes flexible active coping behaviors.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89017">DUX4 is a common driver of immune evasion and immunotherapy failure in metastatic cancers</a></h4>

              
                Cancer immune evasion contributes to checkpoint immunotherapy failure in many patients with metastatic cancers. The embryonic transcription factor DUX4 was recently characterized as a suppressor of interferon-γ signaling and antigen presentation that is aberrantly expressed in a small subset of primary tumors. Here, we report that <i>DUX4</i> expression is a common feature of metastatic tumors, with ~10–50% of advanced bladder, breast, kidney, prostate, and skin cancers expressing <i>DUX4. DUX4</i> expression is significantly associated with immune cell exclusion and decreased objective response to PD-L1 blockade in a large cohort of urothelial carcinoma patients. <i>DUX4</i> expression is a significant predictor of survival even after accounting for tumor mutational burden and other molecular and clinical features in this cohort, with <i>DUX4</i> expression associated with a median reduction in survival of over 1 year. Our data motivate future attempts to develop DUX4 as a biomarker and therapeutic target for checkpoint immunotherapy resistance.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93686">Structures of wild-type and a constitutively closed mutant of connexin26 shed light on channel regulation by CO2</a></h4>

              
                Connexins allow intercellular communication by forming gap junction channels (GJCs) between juxtaposed cells. Connexin26 (Cx26) can be regulated directly by CO<sub>2</sub>. This is proposed to be mediated through carbamylation of K125. We show that mutating K125 to glutamate, mimicking the negative charge of carbamylation, causes Cx26 GJCs to be constitutively closed. Through cryo-EM we observe that the K125E mutation pushes a conformational equilibrium towards the channel having a constricted pore entrance, similar to effects seen on raising the partial pressure of CO<sub>2</sub>. In previous structures of connexins, the cytoplasmic loop, important in regulation and where K125 is located, is disordered. Through further cryo-EM studies we trap distinct states of Cx26 and observe density for the cytoplasmic loop. The interplay between the position of this loop, the conformations of the transmembrane helices and the position of the N-terminal helix, which controls the aperture to the pore, provides a mechanism for regulation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/90497">Physiological roles of endocytosis and presynaptic scaffold in vesicle replenishment at fast and slow central synapses</a></h4>

              
                After exocytosis, release sites are cleared of vesicular residues to replenish with transmitter-filled vesicles. Endocytic and scaffold proteins are thought to underlie this site-clearance mechanism. However, the physiological significance of this mechanism at diverse mammalian central synapses remains unknown. Here, we tested this in a physiologically optimized condition using action potential evoked EPSCs at fast calyx synapse and relatively slow hippocampal CA1 synapse, in post-hearing mice brain slices at 37°C and in 1.3 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]. Pharmacological block of endocytosis enhanced synaptic depression at the calyx synapse, whereas it attenuated synaptic facilitation at the hippocampal synapse. Block of scaffold protein activity likewise enhanced synaptic depression at the calyx but had no effect at the hippocampal synapse. At the fast calyx synapse, block of endocytosis or scaffold protein activity significantly enhanced synaptic depression as early as 10 ms after the stimulation onset. Unlike previous reports, neither endocytic blockers nor scaffold protein inhibitors prolonged the recovery from short-term depression. We conclude that the release-site clearance by endocytosis can be a universal phenomenon supporting vesicle replenishment at both fast and slow synapses, whereas the presynaptic scaffold mechanism likely plays a specialized role in vesicle replenishment predominantly at fast synapses.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/87434">Styxl2 regulates de novo sarcomere assembly by binding to non-muscle myosin IIs and promoting their degradation</a></h4>

              
                Styxl2, a poorly characterized pseudophosphatase, was identified as a transcriptional target of the Jak1-Stat1 pathway during myoblast differentiation in culture. Styxl2 is specifically expressed in vertebrate striated muscles. By gene knockdown in zebrafish or genetic knockout in mice, we found that Styxl2 plays an essential role in maintaining sarcomere integrity in developing muscles. To further reveal the functions of Styxl2 in adult muscles, we generated two inducible knockout mouse models: one with <i>Styxl2</i> being deleted in mature myofibers to assess its role in sarcomere maintenance, and the other in adult muscle satellite cells (MuSCs) to assess its role in de novo sarcomere assembly. We find that Styxl2 is not required for sarcomere maintenance but functions in de novo sarcomere assembly during injury-induced muscle regeneration. Mechanistically, Styxl2 interacts with non-muscle myosin IIs, enhances their ubiquitination, and targets them for autophagy-dependent degradation. Without Styxl2, the degradation of non-muscle myosin IIs is delayed, which leads to defective sarcomere assembly and force generation. Thus, Styxl2 promotes de novo sarcomere assembly by interacting with non-muscle myosin IIs and facilitating their autophagic degradation.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/92909">The archerfish uses motor adaptation in shooting to correct for changing physical conditions</a></h4>

              
                The archerfish is unique in its ability to hunt by shooting a jet of water from its mouth that hits insects situated above the water’s surface. To aim accurately, the fish needs to overcome physical factors including changes in light refraction at the air-water interface. Nevertheless, archerfish can still hit the target with a high success rate under changing conditions. One possible explanation for this extraordinary ability is that it is learned by trial and error through a motor adaptation process. We tested this possibility by characterizing the ability of the archerfish to adapt to perturbations in the environment to make appropriate adjustments to its shots. We introduced a perturbing airflow above the water tank of the archerfish trained to shoot at a target. For each trial shot, we measured the error, i.e., the distance between the center of the target and the center of the water jet produced by the fish. Immediately after the airflow perturbation, there was an increase in shot error. Then, over the course of several trials, the error was reduced and eventually plateaued. After the removal of the perturbation, there was an aftereffect, where the error was in the opposite direction but washed out after several trials. These results indicate that archerfish can adapt to the airflow perturbation. Testing the fish with two opposite airflow directions indicated that adaptation took place within an egocentric frame of reference. These results thus suggest that the archerfish is capable of motor adaptation, as indicated by data showing that the fish produced motor commands that anticipated the perturbation.

">Time-division multiplexing (TDM) sequence removes bias in T2 estimation and relaxation-diffusion measurements</a></h4>

              
                Purpose: To compare the performance of multi-echo (ME) and time-division multiplexing (TDM) sequences for accelerated relaxation-diffusion MRI (rdMRI) acquisition and to examine their reliability in estimating accurate rdMRI microstructure measures. Method: The ME, TDM, and the reference single-echo (SE) sequences with six echo times (TE) were implemented using Pulseq with single-band (SB-) and multi-band 2 (MB2-) acceleration factors. On a diffusion phantom, the image intensities of the three sequences were compared, and the differences were quantified using the normalized root mean squared error (NRMSE). For the in-vivo brain scan, besides the image intensity comparison and T2-estimates, different methods were used to assess sequence-related effects on microstructure estimation, including the relaxation diffusion imaging moment (REDIM) and the maximum-entropy relaxation diffusion distribution (MaxEnt-RDD). Results: TDM performance was similar to the gold standard SE acquisition, whereas ME showed greater biases (3-4X larger NRMSEs for phantom, 2X for in-vivo). T2 values obtained from TDM closely matched SE, whereas ME sequences underestimated the T2 relaxation time. TDM provided similar diffusion and relaxation parameters as SE using REDIM, whereas SB-ME exhibited a 60% larger bias in the <R2> map and on average 3.5X larger bias in the covariance between relaxation-diffusion coefficients. Conclusion: Our analysis demonstrates that TDM provides a more accurate estimation of relaxation-diffusion measurements while accelerating the acquisitions by a factor of 2 to 3.

">APOE4 increases energy metabolism in APOE-isogenic iPSC-derived neurons</a></h4>

              
                The apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) allele represents the major genetic risk factor for Alzheimers disease (AD). In contrast, APOE2 is known to lower the AD risk while APOE3 is defined as risk neutral. APOE plays a prominent role in the bioenergetic homeostasis of the brain, and early-stage metabolic changes have been detected in brains of AD patients. Although APOE is primarily expressed by astrocytes in the brain, neurons also have been shown as source for APOE. However, little is known about the differential role of the three APOE isoforms for neuronal energy homeostasis. In this study, we generated pure human neurons (iN cells) from APOE-isogenic induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), expressing either APOE2, APOE3, APOE4 or carrying an APOE-knockout (KO) to investigate APOE isoform-specific effects on neuronal energy metabolism. We showed that endogenously produced APOE4 enhanced mitochondrial ATP production in APOE-isogenic iN cells but not in the corresponding iPS cell line. This effect neither correlated with the expression levels of mitochondrial fission or fusion proteins, nor with the intracellular or secreted levels of APOE, which were similar for APOE2, APOE3 and APOE4 iN cells. ATP production and basal respiration in APOE-KO iN cells strongly differed from APOE4 and more closely resembled APOE2 and APOE3 iN cells indicating a gain-of-function mechanism of APOE4 rather than a loss-of-function. Taken together, our findings in APOE isogenic iN cells reveal an APOE genotype-dependent and neuron-specific regulation of oxidative energy metabolism.

">Machine learning elucidates electrophysiological properties predictive of multi- and single-firing human and mouse dorsal root ganglia neurons</a></h4>

              
                Human and mouse dorsal root ganglia (hDRG and mDRG) neurons are important tools in understanding the molecular and electrophysiological mechanisms that underlie nociception and drive pain behaviors. One of the simplest differences in firing phenotypes is that neurons are single-firing (exhibit only one action potential) or multi-firing (exhibit 2 or more action potentials). To determine if single- and multi-firing hDRG exhibit differences in intrinsic properties, firing phenotypes, and AP waveform properties, and if these properties could be used to predict multi-firing, we measured 22 electrophysiological properties by whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology of 94 hDRG neurons from 6 male and 4 female donors. We then analyzed the data using several machine learning models to determine if these properties could be used to predict multi-firing. We used 1000 iterations of Monte Carlo Cross Validation to split the data into different train and test sets and tested the Logistic Regression, k-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, Supported Vector Classification, and XGBoost machine learning models. All models tested had a greater than 80% accuracy on average, with Supported Vector Classification and XGBoost performing the best. We found that several properties correlated with multi-firing hDRG neurons and together could be used to predict multi-firing neurons in hDRG including a long decay time, a low rheobase, and long first spike latency. We also found that the hDRG models were able to predict multi-firing with 90% accuracy in mDRG. Targeting the neuronal properties that lead to multi-firing could elucidate better targets for treatment of chronic pain.

">Group identification drives brain integration for collective performance</a></h4>

              
                Group identification may influence collective behaviors and result in variations in collective performance. However, the evidence for this hypothesis and the neural mechanisms involved remain elusive. To this end, we conducted a study using both single-brain activation and multi-brain synchronization analyses to investigate how group identification influences collective problem-solving in a murder mystery case. Our results showed that groups with high levels of identification performed better individually compared to those with low identification, as supported by single-brain activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Furthermore, high-identification groups also showed enhanced collective performance, supported by within-group neural synchronization (GNS) in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). The DLPFC-OFC connectivity played a crucial role in linking individual and collective performance. Overall, our study provides a two-in-one neural model to explain how group identification affects collective decision-making processes, offering valuable insights into the dynamics of group interactions.

                RNA binding proteins have emerged as central players in the mechanisms of many neurodegenerative diseases. In particular, a proteinopathy of fused in sarcoma (FUS) is present in some instances of familial Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and about 10% of sporadic FTLD. Here we establish that focal injection of sonicated human FUS fibrils into brains of mice in which ALS-linked mutant or wild-type human FUS replaces endogenous mouse FUS is sufficient to induce focal cytoplasmic mislocalization and aggregation of mutant and wild-type FUS which with time spreads to distal regions of the brain. Human FUS fibril-induced FUS aggregation in the mouse brain of humanized FUS mice is accelerated by an ALS-causing FUS mutant relative to wild-type human FUS. Injection of sonicated human FUS fibrils does not induce FUS aggregation and subsequent spreading after injection into naive mouse brains containing only mouse FUS, indicating a species barrier to human FUS aggregation and its prion-like spread. Fibril-induced human FUS aggregates recapitulate pathological features of FTLD including increased detergent insolubility of FUS and TAF15 and amyloid-like, cytoplasmic deposits of FUS that accumulate ubiquitin and p62, but not TDP-43. Finally, injection of sonicated FUS fibrils is shown to exacerbate age-dependent cognitive and behavioral deficits from mutant human FUS expression. Thus, focal seeded aggregation of FUS and further propagation through prion-like spread elicits FUS-proteinopathy and FTLD-like disease progression.

">Defective interferon signaling in the circulating monocytes of type 2 diabetic mice</a></h4>

              
                Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is associated with poor outcome after stroke. Peripheral monocytes play a critical role in the secondary injury and recovery of damaged brain tissue after stroke, but the underlying mechanisms are largely unclear. To investigate transcriptome changes and molecular networks across monocyte subsets in response to T2DM and stroke, we performed single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNAseq) from peripheral blood mononuclear cells and bulk RNA-sequencing from blood monocytes from four groups of adult mice, consisting of T2DM model db/db and normoglycemic control db/+ mice with or without ischemic stroke. Via scRNAseq we found that T2DM expands the monocyte population at the expense of lymphocytes, which was validated by flow cytometry. Among the monocytes, T2DM also disproportionally increased the inflammatory subsets with Ly6C+ and negative MHC class II expression (MO.6C+II-). Conversely, monocytes from control mice without stroke are enriched with steady-state classical monocyte subset of MO.6C+II+ but with the least percentage of MO.6C+II- subtype. Apart from enhancing inflammation and coagulation, enrichment analysis from both scRNAseq and bulk RNAseq revealed that T2DM specifically suppressed type-1 and type-2 interferon signaling pathways crucial for antigen presentation and the induction of ischemia tolerance. Preconditioning by lipopolysaccharide conferred neuroprotection against ischemic brain injury in db/+ but not in db/db mice and coincided with a lesser induction of brain Interferon-regulatory-factor-3 in the brains of the latter mice. Our results suggest that the increased diversity and altered transcriptome in the monocytes of T2DM mice underlie the worse stroke outcome by exacerbating secondary injury and potentiating stroke-induced immunosuppression.

">Excitability and synaptic transmission after vitrification of mouse corticohippocampal slices.</a></h4>

              
                Cryopreservation of adult neural tissue is of considerable practical and theoretical interest. Utilizing 61% w/v ethylene glycol, we vitrified and rewarmed acute mouse corticohippocampal slices to evaluate field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSP) in the stratum radiatum of the CA1 region of the hippocampus. Our results demonstrate successfully recovered synaptic transmission, and high-frequency stimulation (HFS)-induced potentiation. However, we failed to induce a stable potentiation following HFS stimulation. Structural analysis post-vitrification revealed cellular alterations such as swelling and vacuolization, which likely contributed to the unstable potentiation. Despite high variability in results, this study highlights the potential of vitrification to partially preserve brain function.

">Less is more: selection from a small set of options improves BCI velocity control</a></h4>

              
                We designed the discrete direction selection (DDS) decoder for intracortical brain computer interface (iBCI) cursor control and showed that it outperformed currently used decoders in a human-operated real-time iBCI simulator and in monkey iBCI use. Unlike virtually all existing decoders that map between neural activity and continuous velocity commands, DDS uses neural activity to select among a small menu of preset cursor velocities. We compared closed-loop cursor control across four visits by each of 48 naive, able-bodied human subjects using either DDS or one of three common continuous velocity decoders: direct regression with assist (an affine map from neural activity to cursor velocity), ReFIT, and the velocity Kalman Filter. DDS outperformed all three by a substantial margin. Subsequently, a monkey using an iBCI also had substantially better performance with DDS than with the Wiener filter decoder (direct regression decoder that includes time history). Discretizing the decoded velocity with DDS effectively traded high resolution velocity commands for less tortuous and lower noise trajectories, highlighting the potential benefits of simplifying online iBCI control.

">Mosaic midbrain organoids: a new tool to study Progressive Supranuclear Palsy and advancing clinical neurology research</a></h4>

              
                Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a severe neurodegenerative disease pathologically characterized by intracellular tangles of hyperphosphorylated tau protein, widely distributed across the neocortex, basal ganglia, and midbrain. Developing effective drugs for PSP presents challenges due to its complex underpinning mechanism and the absence of robust human models that accurately recapitulate biochemical and pathological features of the disease phenotype. Brain organoids have recently emerged as a three-dimensional tissue culture platform to study brain development and pathology. Here, we present a novel induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived mosaic midbrain organoid (mMOs) system from four patients with progressive supranuclear palsy-Richardson syndrome (PSP-RS), aimed at reproducing key molecular disease features while reducing variability across organoids derived from different iPSC donors. The PSP-RS 3D model exhibited accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein, predominance of 4R-tau, increased GFAP-positive cells, and PSP-associated histological alterations compared to organoids derived from healthy donors. Pathologically, diseased mMOs showed typical neurofibrillary tangles and tufted-shaped astrocytes, and poorly branched processes of Tyrosine Hydroxylase-immunoreactive cells with terminal branches appearing thin. Our results suggest that mMOs represent a valuable experimental model for PSP research and hold great promise for future identification of new therapeutic targets for progressive supranuclear palsy.

">Consciousness in Non-REM parasomnia episodes</a></h4>

              
                Sleepwalking and related parasomnias are thought to result from incomplete awakenings out of Non rapid eye movement (Non-REM) sleep. Non-REM parasomnia behaviors have been described as unconscious and automatic, or related to vivid, dream-like conscious experiences. Similarly, some observations have suggested that patients are unresponsive during episodes, while others that they can interact with their surroundings. To better grasp and characterize the full spectrum of consciousness and environmental disconnection associated with behavioral episodes, 35 adult patients with Non-REM sleep parasomnias were interviewed in-depth about their experiences. The level of consciousness during parasomnia episodes was reported to be variable both within and between individuals, ranging from minimal or absent consciousness and largely automatic behaviors (frequently/always present in 36% of patients) to preserved conscious experiences characterized by delusional thinking of varying degrees of specificity (65%), often about impending danger, variably formed, uni- or multisensory hallucinations (53%), impaired insight (77%), negative emotions (75%) and variable, but often pronounced amnesia (30%). Patients described their experiences as a dream scene during which they felt awake (awake dreaming). Surroundings were either realistically perceived, misinterpreted (in the form of perceptual illusions or misidentifications of people) or entirely hallucinated as a function of the prevailing delusion. These observations suggest that the level of consciousness and sensory disconnection in Non-REM parasomnias is variable and graded. In their full-fledged expression, Non-REM parasomnia experiences feature several core features of dreams. They therefore represent a valuable model for the study of consciousness, sleep-related sensory disconnection and dreaming.

">Reliability of structural brain change in cognitively healthy adult samples.</a></h4>

              
                In neuroimaging research, tracking individuals over time is key to understanding the interplay between brain changes and genetic, environmental, or cognitive factors across the lifespan. Yet, the extent to which we can estimate the individual trajectories of brain change over time with precision remains uncertain. In this study, we estimated the reliability of structural brain change in cognitively healthy adults from multiple samples and assessed the influence of follow-up time and number of observations. Estimates of cross-sectional measurement error and brain change variance were obtained using the longitudinal FreeSurfer processing stream. Our findings showed, on average, modest longitudinal reliability with two years of follow-up. Increasing the follow-up time was associated with a substantial increase in longitudinal reliability while the impact of increasing the number of observations was comparatively minor. On average, 2-year follow-up studies require {approx}2.7 and {approx}4.0 times more individuals than designs with follow-ups of 4 and 6 years to achieve comparable statistical power. Subcortical volume exhibited higher longitudinal reliability compared to cortical area, thickness, and volume. The reliability estimates were comparable to those estimated from empirical data. The reliability estimates were affected by both the cohort's age where younger adults had lower reliability of change, and the preprocessing pipeline where the FreeSurfer's longitudinal stream was notably superior than the cross-sectional. Suboptimal reliability inflated sample size requirements and compromised the ability to distinguish individual trajectories of brain aging. This study underscores the importance of long-term follow-ups and the need to consider reliability in longitudinal neuroimaging research.

">Medial amygdalar tau is associated with anxiety symptoms in preclinical Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                BACKGROUND: While the amygdala receives early tau deposition in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and is involved in social and emotional processing, the relationship between amygdalar tau and early neuropsychiatric symptoms in AD is unknown. We sought to determine whether focal tau binding in the amygdala and abnormal amygdalar connectivity were detectable in a preclinical AD cohort and identify relationships between these and self-reported mood symptoms. METHODS: We examined n=598 individuals (n=347 amyloid-positive (58% female), n=251 amyloid-negative (62% female); subset into tau PET and fMRI cohorts) from the A4 Study. In our tau PET cohort, we used amygdalar segmentations to examine representative nuclei from three functional divisions of the amygdala. We analyzed between-group differences in division-specific tau binding in the amygdala in preclinical AD. We conducted seed-based functional connectivity analyses from each division in the fMRI cohort. Finally, we conducted exploratory post-hoc correlation analyses between neuroimaging biomarkers of interest and anxiety and depression scores. RESULTS: Amyloid-positive individuals demonstrated increased tau binding in medial and lateral amygdala (F(4,442)=14.61, p=0.00045; F(4,442)=5.83, p=0.024, respectively). Across amygdalar divisions, amyloid-positive individuals had relatively increased regional connectivity from amygdala to other temporal regions, insula, and orbitofrontal cortex. There was an interaction by amyloid group between tau binding in the medial and lateral amygdala and anxiety. Medial amygdala to retrosplenial connectivity negatively correlated with anxiety symptoms (rs=-0.103, p=0.015). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that preclinical tau deposition in the amygdala may result in meaningful changes in functional connectivity which may predispose patients to mood symptoms.

">Chemical imaging signatures delineate heterogeneous amyloid plaque populations across the Alzheimers disease spectrum</a></h4>

              
                Amyloid plaque deposition is recognized as the primary pathological hallmark of Alzheimers disease(AD) that precedes other pathological events and cognitive symptoms. Plaque pathology represents itself with an immense polymorphic variety comprising plaques with different stages of amyloid fibrillization ranging from diffuse to fibrillar, mature plaques. The association of polymorphic Abeta plaque pathology with AD pathogenesis, clinical symptoms and disease progression remains unclear. Advanced chemical imaging tools, such as functional amyloid microscopy combined with MALDI mass spectrometry imaging (MSI), are now enhanced by deep learning algorithms. This integration allows for precise delineation of polymorphic plaque structures and detailed identification of their associated Abeta compositions. We here set out to make use of these tools to interrogate heterogenic plaque types and their associated biochemical architecture. Our findings reveal distinct Abeta signatures that differentiate diffuse plaques from fibrilized ones, with the latter showing substantially higher levels of Abeta x-40. Notably, within the fibrilized category, we identified a distinct subtype known as coarse-grain plaques. Both in sAD and fAD brain tissue, coarse grain plaques contained more Abeta x-40 and less Abeta x-42 compared with cored plaques. The coarse grain plaques in both sAD and fAD also showed higher levels of neuritic content including paired helical filaments (PHF-1)/phosphorylated phospho Tau-immunopositive neurites. Finally, the Abeta; peptide content in coarse grain plaques resembled that of vascular Abeta deposits (CAA) though with relatively higher levels of Abeta 1-42 and pyroglutamated Abeta x-40 and Abeta x-42 species in coarse grain plaques. This is the first of its kind study on spatial in situ biochemical characterization of different plaque morphotypes demonstrating the potential of the correlative imaging techniques used that further increase the understanding of heterogeneous AD pathology. Linking the biochemical characteristics of amyloid plaque polymorphisms with various AD etiologies and toxicity mechanisms is crucial. Understanding the connection between plaque structure and disease pathogenesis can enhance our insights. This knowledge is particularly valuable for developing and advancing novel, amyloid-targeting therapeutics.

">Unraveling Alzheimer's Disease: Investigating Dynamic Functional Connectivity in the Default Mode Network through DCC-GARCH Modeling</a></h4>

              
                Alzheimer's disease (AD) has a prolonged latent phase. Sensitive biomarkers of amyloid beta (A{beta}), in the absence of clinical symptoms, offer opportunities for early detection and identification of patients at risk. Current A{beta} biomarkers, such as CSF and PET biomarkers, are effective but face practical limitations due to high cost and limited availability. Recent blood plasma biomarkers, though accessible, still incur high costs and lack physiological significance in the Alzheimer's process. This study explores the potential of brain functional connectivity (FC) alterations associated with AD pathology as a non-invasive avenue for A{beta} detection. While current stationary FC measurements lack sensitivity at the single-subject level, our investigation focuses on dynamic FC using resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) and introduces the Generalized Auto-Regressive Conditional Heteroscedastic Dynamic Conditional Correlation (DCC-GARCH) model. Our findings demonstrate the superior sensitivity of DCC-GARCH to CSF A{beta} status, and offer key insights into dynamic functional connectivity analysis in AD.

">Comparative neuroimaging of the carnivoran brain: Neocortical sulcal anatomy</a></h4>

              
                Carnivorans are an important study object for comparative neuroscience, as they exhibit a wide range of behaviours, ecological adaptations, and social structures. Previous studies have mainly examined relative brain size, but a comprehensive understanding of brain diversity requires the investigation of other aspects of their neuroanatomy. Here, we obtained primarily post-mortem brain scans from eighteen species of the order Carnivora, reconstructed their cortical surfaces, and examined neocortical sulcal anatomy to establish a framework for systematic inter-species comparisons. We observed distinct regional variations in sulcal anatomy, potentially related to the species' behaviour and ecology. Arctoidea species with pronounced forepaw dexterity exhibited complex sulcal configurations in the presumed somatosensory cortex but low sulcal complexity in the presumed visual and auditory occipitotemporal cortex. Canidae had the largest number of unique major sulci with a unique sulcus in the occipital cortex and highly social canids featuring an additional frontal cortex sulcus. We also observed differentially complex occipito-temporal sulcal patterns in Felidae and Canidae, indicative of changes in auditory and visual areas that may be related to foraging strategies and social behaviour. In conclusion, this study presents an inventory of the sulcal anatomy of a number of rarely studied carnivoran brains and establishes a framework and novel avenues for further investigations employing a variety of neuroimaging modalities to reveal more about carnivoran brain diversity.

">Amygdala circuit mechanisms underlying alcohol seeking</a></h4>

              
                Alcohol seeking during abstinence is mediated in part by strong associations between the pharmacological effects of alcohol and the environment within which alcohol is administered. The amygdala, particularly the basolateral amygdala (BLA), is a key neural substrate of environmental cue and reward associations since it is involved in associative learning and memory recall. However, we still lack a clear understanding of how the activity of molecularly distinct BLA neurons is affected by alcohol and encodes information that drives environmental cue-dependent, alcohol-related behaviors. We previously demonstrated that a subset of BLA neurons which express the CaMKII and Thy1 markers project preferentially to the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), rather than the central amygdala; and these neurons mediate fear inhibition rather than fear acquisition or expression, suggesting a specific role in positive valence processing. We now demonstrate that Pavlovian conditioning with alcohol administration increases the activity of these Thy1-expressing (Thy1+) excitatory neurons in mouse BLA, which is necessary for the conditioned appetitive response. In vivo calcium imaging indicates that the temporal activity profile of these neurons is also correlated with alcohol seeking behavior in response to environmental cues. Optogenetic inhibition of BLA Thy1+ neuronal activity disrupts both the formation and recall of alcohol conditioned place preference. Furthermore, selective axonal inhibition of BLA-Thy1+ neurons reveals that the activity of their NAcc and prefrontal cortex (PFC) projections are differentially necessary for alcohol cue association vs. recall, respectively. Together, these findings provide insights into a molecularly distinct subset of BLA neurons that regulates environmental cue-reward associations and drives alcohol seeking behaviors in a projection-specific manner.

">Exploring memory-related network via dorsal hippocampus suppression</a></h4>

              
                Memory is a complex brain process that requires coordinated activities in a large-scale brain network. However, the relationship between coordinated brain network activities and memory-related behavior is not well understood. In this study, we investigated this issue by suppressing the activity in the dorsal hippocampus (dHP) using chemogenetics and measuring the corresponding changes in brain-wide resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) and memory behavior in awake rats. We identified an extended brain network contributing to the performance in a spatial-memory related task. Our results were cross-validated using two different chemogenetic actuators, clozapine (CLZ) and clozapine-N-oxide (CNO). This study provides a brain network interpretation of memory performance, indicating that memory is associated with coordinated brain-wide neural activities.

">Cognitive behavioral phenotyping of DSCAM heterozygosity as a model for autism spectrum disorder</a></h4>

              
                It is estimated that 1 in 36 children are affected by autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in the United States, which is nearly a twofold increase from a decade ago. Recent genetic studies have identified de novo loss-of-function (dnLoF) mutations in the Down Syndrome Cell Adhesion Molecule (DSCAM) as a strong risk factor for ASD. Previous research has shown that DSCAM ablation confers social interaction deficits and perseverative behaviors in mouse models. However, it remains unknown to what extent DSCAM underexpression captures the full range of behaviors, specifically cognitive phenotypes, presented in ASD. Here, we conducted a comprehensive cognitive behavioral phenotyping which revealed that loss of one copy of DSCAM, as in the DSCAM2J+/- mice, displayed hyperactivity, increased anxiety, and motor coordination impairments. Additionally, hippocampal-dependent learning and memory was affected, including working memory, long-term memory, and contextual fear learning. Interestingly, implicit learning processes remained intact. Therefore, DSCAM LoF produces autistic-like behaviors that are similar to human cases of ASD. These findings further support a role for DSCAM dnLoF mutations in ASD and suggest DSCAM2J+/- as a suitable model for ASD research.

">Nonlinear spatial integration allows the retina to detect the sign of defocus in natural scenes</a></h4>

              
                Eye growth is regulated by the visual input. Many studies suggest that the retina can detect if a visual image is focused in front or behind the back of the eye, and modulate eye growth to bring it back to focus. How can the retina distinguish between these two types of defocus? Here we simulated how eye optics transform natural images and recorded how the isolated retina responds to different types of simulated defocus. We found that some ganglion cell types could distinguish between an image focussed in front or behind the retina, by estimating spatial contrast. Aberrations in the eye optics made spatial contrast, but not luminance, a reliable cue to distinguish these two types of defocus. Our results suggest a mechanism for how the retina can estimate the sign of defocus and provide an explanation for several results aiming at mitigating strong myopia by slowing down eye growth.

">Ecological fNIRS in mobile children: Using short separation channels to correct for systemic contamination during naturalistic neuroimaging.</a></h4>

              
                Significance The advances and the miniaturization in functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) instrumentation offers the potential to move the classical laboratory-based cognitive neuroscience investigations into more naturalistic settings. Wearable and mobile fNIRS devices also provide a novel child-friendly means to image functional brain activity in freely moving toddlers and preschoolers. Measuring brain activity in more ecologically valid settings with fNIRS presents additional challenges, such as the increased impact of physiological interferences. One of the most popular methods to minimize such interferences is to regress out short separation channels from the long separation channels (i.e., superficial signal regression or SSR). Whilst this has been extensively investigated in adults, little is known about the impact of systemic changes on the fNIRS signals recorded in children in either classical or novel naturalistic experiments. Aim We aim to investigate if extracerebral physiological changes occur in toddlers and preschoolers, and whether SSR can help minimize these interferences. Approach We collected fNIRS data from 3-to-7 years olds during a conventional computerized static task and in a dynamic naturalistic task in an immersive virtual reality (VR) continuous automatic virtual environment (CAVE). Results Our results show that superficial signal contamination data is present in both young children as in adults. Importantly, we find that SSR helps in improving the localization of functional brain activity, both in the computerized task and, to a larger extent, in the dynamic VR task. Conclusions Following from these results, we formulate suggestions to advance the field of developmental neuroimaging with fNIRS, particularly in ecological settings.

">Different Trajectories of Functional Connectivity Captured with Gamma-Event Coupling and Broadband Measures of EEG in the Rat Fluid Percussion Injury Model.</a></h4>

              
                Functional connectivity (FC) after TBI is affected by an altered excitatory-inhibitory balance due to neuronal dysfunction, and the mechanistic changes observed could be reflected differently by contrasting methods. Local gamma event coupling FC (GEC-FC) is believed to represent multiunit fluctuations due to inhibitory dysfunction, and we hypothesized that FC derived from widespread, broadband amplitude signal (BBA-FC) would be different, reflecting broader mechanisms of functional disconnection. We tested this during sleep and active periods defined by high delta and theta EEG activity, respectively, at 1,7 and 28d after rat fluid-percussion-injury (FPI) or sham injury (n=6/group) using 10 indwelling, bilateral cortical and hippocampal electrodes. We also measured seizure and high-frequency oscillatory activity (HFOs) as markers of electrophysiological burden. BBA-FC analysis showed early hyperconnectivity constrained to ipsilateral sensory-cortex-to-CA1-hippocampus that transformed to mainly ipsilateral FC deficits by 28d compared to shams. These changes were conserved over active epochs, except at 28d when there were no differences to shams. In comparison, GEC-FC analysis showed large regions of hyperconnectivity early after injury within similar ipsilateral and intrahemispheric networks. GEC-FC weakened with time, but hyperconnectivity persisted at 28d compared to sham. Edge- and global connectivity measures revealed injury-related differences across time in GEC-FC as compared to BBA-FC, demonstrating greater sensitivity to FC changes post-injury. There was no significant association between sleep fragmentation, HFOs, or seizures with FC changes. The within-animal, spatial-temporal differences in BBA-FC and GEC-FC after injury may represent different mechanisms driving FC changes as a result of primary disconnection and interneuron loss.

">Identification of cortical targets for modulating function supported by the human hippocampal network</a></h4>

              
                Background: Individualized transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) targeting using functional connectivity analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been demonstrated to be advantageous in inducing neuroplasticity. However, how this approach can benefit modulating the episodic memory function supported by the hippocampal network remains elusive. Objective: We use the resting-state fMRI data from a large cohort to reveal tentative TMS targets at cortical regions within the hippocampal network. Methods: Functional MRI from 1,133 individuals in the Human Connectome Project was used to analyze the hippocampal network using seed-based functional connectivity. Results: Using a weighted sum of time series at the cortex, we identified the average centroids of individualized targets at the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and posterior parietal cortices (PPC) at (-10, 49, 7) and (-40, -67, 30) in the left hemisphere, respectively. The mPFC and PPC coordinate at the right hemispheres are (11, 51, 6) and (48, -59, 24) in the right hemisphere, respectively. These coordinates can be reliably identified (>90% of individuals). Conclusion: Our results suggest candidate TMS target coordinates to modulate the hippocampal function.

">Effects of Tasks on Functional Brain Connectivity Derived from Inter-Individual Correlations: Insights from Regional Homogeneity of Functional MRI Data</a></h4>

              
                Research on brain functional connectivity often relies on intra-individual moment-to-moment correlations of functional brain activity, typically using techniques like functional MRI (fMRI). Inter-individual correlations are also employed on data from fMRI and positron emission tomography (PET). Many past studies have not specified tasks for participants, keeping them in an implicit "resting" condition. This lack of task specificity raises questions about how different tasks impact inter-individual correlation estimates. In our analysis of fMRI data from 100 unrelated participants, scanned during seven task conditions and in a resting state, we calculated Regional Homogeneity (ReHo) for each task as a regional measure of brain functions. We found that changes in ReHo due to different tasks were relatively small compared with the variations across brain regions. Cross-region variations of ReHo were highly correlated between different tasks. Similarly, whole-brain inter-individual correlation patterns were remarkably consistent across the tasks, showing correlations greater than 0.78. Changes in inter-individual correlations between tasks were primarily driven by connectivity in the visual, somatomotor, default mode network, and the interactions between them. The subtle yet statistically significant differences in functional connectivity may be linked to specific brain regions associated with the studied tasks. Future studies should consider task design when exploring inter-individual connectivity in specific brain systems.

">Chemogenetic activation of astrocytes modulates sleep/wakefulness states in a brain region-dependent manner</a></h4>

              
                Study objectives: Astrocytes change their intracellular calcium (Ca2+) concentration during sleep/wakefulness states in mice. Furthermore, the Ca2+ dynamics in astrocytes vary depending on the brain region. However, whether alterations in intracellular Ca2+ concentration in astrocytes can affect sleep/wakefulness states and cortical oscillations in a brain region-dependent manner remain unclear. Methods: The Ca2+ concentration in astrocytes was artificially increased using chemogenetics in mice. Astrocytes in the hippocampus and pons, which are 2 brain regions previously classified into different clusters based on their Ca2+ dynamics during sleep/wakefulness, were focused on to compare whether there are differences in the effects of astrocytes from different brain regions. Results: The activation of astrocytes in the hippocampus significantly decreased the total time of wakefulness and increased the total time of sleep. This had minimal effects on cortical oscillations in all sleep/wakefulness states. On the other hand, the activation of astrocytes in the pons substantially suppressed rapid eye movement (REM) sleep in association with a decreased number of REM episodes, indicating strong inhibition of REM onset. Regarding cortical oscillations, the delta wave component during non-REM sleep was significantly enhanced. Conclusions: These results suggest that astrocytes modulate sleep/wakefulness states and cortical oscillations. Furthermore, the role of astrocytes in sleep/wakefulness states appears to vary among brain regions.

">Synthesising robot behaviour through reinforcement learning for homeostasis</a></h4>

              
                Homeostasis is a fundamental property for the survival of animals. Computational reinforcement learning provides a theoretically sound framework for learning autonomous agents, but the integrated motivational signal (aka reward) for survival behaviours has been underexplored. Here, we present a neuroscience-inspired algorithm for synthesising robot survival behaviour without the need for complicated reward design and external feedback from the outside of the robot's body. Our agent, Embodied Neural Homeostat, was trained solely with feedback generated by agent's internal physical state, and optimised its behaviour to stabilise its internal physical states: homeostasis. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our concept, we trained the agent in the simulated mechano-thermal environment and tested in the real robot. We observed the synthesis of walking, navigating to the food, resting to cool down the motors and shivering to warm up the motors through the joint optimisation for thermal and energy homeostasis. Embodied neural homeostat successfully achieved homeostasis-based integrated behaviour synthesis, which has not previously existed at the motor control level. This shows that homeostasis is a possible motivating principle for integrated behaviour generation in robots and can also explain the behavioural principles of living organisms.

">Spatial and directional tuning of serial dependence for tracking eye movements</a></h4>

              
                An attractive influence of past sensory experience on current behaviour has been observed in many domains, such as for perceptual decisions and motor responses. However, it is unclear what sort of information is integrated across trials, and the limits of this integration, especially for oculomotor behavior. Here we provide a detailed and systematic investigation of the spatial and directional tuning of serial dependence for oculomotor tracking. In a series of experiments, we measured oculomotor responses to sequences of movements: the first movement (the prior) could move at different velocities (5 or 15 deg/s), and could additionally vary in its spatial location or direction relative to the following movement. The second movement (the probe) always moved at the same velocity (10 deg/s) and was constant across all experiments. We observed that eye velocity for the probe movement was faster when following the fast prior compared to following the slow prior, replicating attractive serial dependence. Importantly, this effect stayed consistent for distances of up to 30 deg between probe and prior, strongly suggesting a retinotopic coordinate frame. When we manipulated the direction of the prior, we observed that the strength of the serial dependence on eye velocity as well as eye direction was modulated by the relative angle between prior and probe. We observed stronger serial dependence for prior directions more similar to the probe direction. The strength of the effect on eye velocity and eye direction was correlated, suggesting a shared mechanism controlling these effects. Across all experiments, we observed that even when the prior moved in the opposite direction to the probe, there was a residual attractive effect. This suggests that serial dependence for oculomotor tracking consists of two components, one retinotopic, direction-tuned component and one more general component that is not direction-specific.

                Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is rare, fast progressing, and fatal synucleinopathy with alpha-synuclein (-syn) inclusions located within oligodendroglia called glial cytoplasmic inclusions (GCI). Along with GCI pathology there is severe demyelination, neurodegeneration, and neuroinflammation. In post-mortem tissue, there is significant infiltration of CD8+ T cells into the brain parenchyma, however their role in disease progression is unknown. To determine the role of CD8+ T cells, a modified AAV, Olig001-SYN, was used to selectively overexpress -syn in oligodendrocytes modeling MSA in mice. Four weeks post transduction, we observed significant CD8+ T cell infiltration into the striatum of Olig001-SYN transduced mice recapitulating the CD8+ T cell infiltration observed in post-mortem tissue. To understand the role of CD8+ T cells, a CD8 knockout mice were transduced with Olig001-SYN. Six months post transduction into a mouse lacking CD8+ T cells, demyelination and neurodegeneration were unchanged. Four weeks post transduction, neuroinflammation and demyelination were enhanced in CD8 knockout mice compared to wild type controls. Applying unbiased spectral flow cytometry, CD103+, CD69+, CD44+, CXCR6+, CD8+ T cells were identified when -syn was present in oligodendrocytes, suggesting the presence of tissue resident memory CD8+ T (Trm) cells during MSA disease progression. This study indicates that CD8+ T cells are not critical in driving MSA pathology but are needed to modulate the neuroinflammation and demyelination response.

">A myelinic channel system for organelle transport to the glial-axonal junction</a></h4>

              
                Myelin sheaths comprise compacted layers of oligodendroglial membrane wrapped spirally around axons. Each sheath, if imagined unwrapped, has a cytoplasm-filled space at its perimeter, linking it to the oligodendrocyte soma via a short process. By electron microscopy (EM), this space, which we term the myelinic channel system contains microtubules and membranous organelles, but whether these are remnants of development or serve a function is unknown. Performing live imaging of myelinating oligodendrocytes expressing fluorescent reporters, we found that the myelinic channel system serves microtubule-dependent organelle transport. Further, the intra-myelinic movement of peroxisomes was modulated by neuronal electrical activity in these mixed neural cell cultures. Loss of oligodendroglial Kif21b or CNP in vivo led to apparent stasis of myelin organelles and secondary axon pathology. This suggests that oligodendrocytes require motor transport in the myelinic channel system to maintain axonal integrity.

">AgRP neurons mediate activity-dependent development of oxytocin connectivity and autonomic regulation</a></h4>

              
                During postnatal life, the adipocyte-derived hormone leptin is required for normal targeting of neural inputs to the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH) and impacts the activity of neurons containing agouti-related peptide (AgRP) in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus. Activity-dependent developmental mechanisms are known to play a defining role during postnatal organization of neural circuits, but whether leptin-mediated postnatal neuronal activity specifies neural projections to the PVH or impacts downstream connectivity is largely unexplored. Here, we blocked neuronal activity of AgRP neurons during a discrete postnatal period and evaluated development of AgRP inputs to defined regions in the PVH, as well as descending projections from PVH oxytocin neurons to the dorsal vagal complex (DVC) and assessed their dependence on leptin or postnatal AgRP neuronal activity. In leptin-deficient mice, AgRP inputs to PVH neurons were significantly reduced, as well as oxytocin-specific neuronal targeting by AgRP. Moreover, downstream oxytocin projections from the PVH to the DVC were also impaired, despite the lack of leptin receptors on PVH oxytocin neurons. Blocking AgRP activity specifically during early postnatal life reduced the density of AgRP inputs to the PVH, as well as the density of projections from PVH oxytocin neurons to the DVC, and these innervation deficits were associated with dysregulated autonomic function. These findings suggest that postnatal targeting of descending PVH oxytocin projections to the DVC requires leptin-mediated AgRP neuronal activity, and represents a novel activity-dependent mechanism for hypothalamic specification of metabolic circuitry, with consequences for autonomic regulation.

	<p>Aging contributes significantly to cognitive decline. Aerobic exercise (AE) has been shown to induce substantial neuroplasticity changes, enhancing cognitive and brain health. Likewise, recent research underscores the cognitive benefits of foreign language learning (FLL), indicating improvements in brain structure and function across age groups. However, the lack of a comprehensive paradigm integrating language learning with exercise limits research on combined effects in older adults. In order to address this gap, we devised a novel approach using a virtual world tourism scenario for auditory-based language learning combined with aerobic cycling. Our study examines the impact of simultaneous AE and FLL integration on cognitive and language learning outcomes compared to FLL alone. A total of 20 older adults were randomly assigned to AE + FLL and FLL-only groups. The results revealed significantly improved Spanish language learning outcomes in both combined and language learning-only groups. Additionally, significant cognitive function improvement was observed in the FLL group following short-term language learning.</p>

	<p>As cancer progresses, patients may experience physical decline, which can impair their ability to carry out essential daily tasks. The aim of this study was to analyze the levels of physical activity in patients with advanced cancer undergoing systemic treatment and its relationship with sociodemographic, clinical, and psychological factors. A prospective, cross-sectional, multicenter study was carried out in 15 oncology departments in Spain. Patients with locally advanced, unresectable, or metastatic cancer who were candidates for systemic treatment were included. Participants completed demographic information and psychological scales. In total, 508 patients were included in the study, the majority of whom were male, over the age of 65, and diagnosed with bronchopulmonary tumors (36%) and metastatic disease. Based on their physical activity levels, participants were categorized as sedentary (20%, n = 190), engaging in light physical activity (43%, n = 412), or demonstrating moderate physical activity (37%, n = 351). Patients who were over 65 years old; had a worse baseline status (ECOG &amp;amp;ge; 1); lacked a partner; had a lower educational level; or were retired or unemployed were found to have lower levels of physical activity. Those with sedentary physical activity reported higher levels of psychological distress, anxiety, depression, somatization, and physical symptoms, as well as worse functional status, global health status, and well-being. Understanding the complex interplay between physical activity and sociodemographic, clinical, and psychological factors can help neuroscientists develop tailored exercise interventions that address the unique needs of advanced cancer patients.</p>

	<p>Background: Vestibular schwannoma (VS), also known as acoustic neuroma, is a benign, well-encapsulated, and slow-growing tumor that originates from Schwann cells, which form the myelin sheath around the vestibulocochlear nerve (VIII cranial nerve). The surgical treatment of this condition presents a challenging task for surgeons, as the tumor&amp;amp;rsquo;s location and size make it difficult to remove without causing damage to the surrounding structures. In recent years, fluorescein sodium (FS) has been proposed as a tool to enhance surgical outcomes in VS surgery. This essay will provide an analytical comparison of the use of FS in VS surgery, evaluating its benefits and limitations and comparing surgical outcomes with and without FS-assisted surgery. Methods: In a retrospective study conducted at San Filippo Neri Hospital, we examined VS cases that were operated on between January 2017 and December 2023. The patients were divided into two groups: group A, which consisted of patients who underwent surgery without the use of FS until January 2020 (102 cases), and group B, which included patients who underwent surgery with FS after January 2020 (55 cases). All operations were performed using the retrosigmoid approach, and tumor size was classified according to the Koos classification system. The extent of surgical removal was evaluated using both the intraoperative surgeon&amp;amp;rsquo;s opinion and postoperative MRI imaging. Preoperatively and postoperatively, facial nerve function and hearing were assessed. In group B, FS was used to assist the surgical procedures, which were performed using a surgical microscope equipped with an integrated fluorescein filter. Postoperative clinical and MRI controls were performed at six months and annually, with no patients lost to follow-up. Results: This study investigated the impact of intraoperative fluorescein exposure on tumor resection and clinical outcomes in patients with VS. The study found a statistically significant difference in the tumor resection rates between patients who received fluorescein intraoperatively (p = 0.037). Further analyses using the Koos classification system revealed a significant effect of fluorescein exposure, particularly in the Koos 3 subgroup (p = 0.001). Notably, no significant differences were observed in hearing loss or facial nerve function between the two groups. A Spearman correlation analysis revealed a positive correlation between tumor size and Koos, age, and size, but no significant correlation was found between facial nerve function tests. Conclusions: FS-assisted surgery for VS may potentially enhance tumor resection, allowing for more comprehensive tumor removal.</p>

	<p>Background: Despite substantial progress in investigating its psychophysical complexity, tinnitus remains a scientific and clinical enigma. The present study, through an ecological and multidisciplinary approach, aims to identify associations between electroencephalographic (EEG) and psycho-audiological variables. Methods: EEG beta activity, often related to stress and anxiety, was acquired from 12 tinnitus patients (TIN group) and 7 controls (CONT group) during an audio cognitive task and at rest. We also investigated psychological (SCL-90-R; STAI-Y; BFI-10) and audiological (THI; TQ12-I; Hyperacusis) variables using non-parametric statistics to assess differences and relationships between and within groups. Results: In the TIN group, frontal beta activity positively correlated with hyperacusis, parietal activity, and trait anxiety; the latter is also associated with depression in CONT. Significant differences in paranoid ideation and openness were found between groups. Conclusions: The connection between anxiety trait, beta activity in the fronto-parietal cortices and hyperacusis provides insights into brain functioning in tinnitus patients, offering quantitative descriptions for clinicians and new multidisciplinary treatment hypotheses.</p>

	<p>This study was designed to examine the relationships among the impulsivity construct as a personality trait, the dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S), and testosterone in a sample of 120 healthy middle-aged males (Mage = 44.39; SD = 12.88). The sum of the three BIS-11 scales, the SR, and the five UPPS-P scales correlated with DHEA-S 0.23 (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.006) and testosterone 0.19 (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.04), controlling for age. Partial correlations showed that DHEA-S was significantly related to motor impulsivity (0.24; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.008), Sensitivity to Reward (0.29; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.002), Lack of Premeditation (0.26; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05), and, to a lesser extent, Sensation Seeking (0.19; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.04) and Positive Urgency (0.19; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.04). Testosterone correlated with attention impulsivity (0.18; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.04), Sensation Seeking (0.18; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.04), and Positive Urgency (0.22; p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01). Sensitivity to Reward, Negative Urgency, and Positive Urgency were significant predictors of DHEA-S (R2 = 0.28), and Positive Urgency for testosterone (R2 = 0.09). Non-parametric LOESS graphical analyses for local regression allowed us to visualize the non-linear relationships between the impulsivity scales with the two androgens, including non-significant trends. We discuss the implications of these results for impulsive biological personality traits, the limitations of our analyses, and the possible development of future research.</p>

	<p>Positive symptoms of schizophrenia have been proposed to be an intrusion of dreaming in wakefulness; conversely, psychotic patients&amp;amp;rsquo; abnormal cognitive and behavioral features could overflow into sleep, so that their dreams would differ from those of healthy people. Here we assess this hypothesis by comparing dream features of 46 patients affected by schizophrenic spectrum disorders to those of 28 healthy controls. In patients, we also investigated correlations of dream variables with symptom severity and verbal fluency. Overall, patients reported fewer and shorter dreams, with a general impoverishment of content (including characters, settings, interactions) and higher spatiotemporal bizarreness. The number of emotions, mainly negative ones, was lower in patients&amp;amp;rsquo; reports and correlated inversely with symptom severity. Verbal fluency correlated positively with dream report length and negatively with perceptive bizarreness. In conclusion, our data show a significant impoverishment of dream reports in psychotic patients versus controls. Future research should investigate to what extent this profile of results depends on impaired verbal fluency or on impaired mechanisms of dream generation in this population. Moreover, in line with theories on the role of dreaming in emotion regulation, our data suggest that this function could be impaired in psychoses and related to symptom severity.</p>

	<p>Earlier research has suggested gender differences in event-related potentials/oscillations (ERPs/EROs). Yet, the alteration in event-related oscillations (EROs) in the delta and theta frequency bands have not been explored between genders across the three age groups of adulthood, i.e., 18&amp;amp;ndash;50, 51&amp;amp;ndash;65, and &amp;amp;gt;65 years. Data from 155 healthy elderly participants who underwent a neurological examination, comprehensive neuropsychological assessment (including attention, memory, executive function, language, and visuospatial skills), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) from past studies were used. The delta and theta ERO powers across the age groups and between genders were compared and correlational analyses among the ERO power, age, and neuropsychological tests were performed. The results indicated that females displayed higher theta ERO responses than males in the frontal, central, and parietal regions but not in the occipital location between 18 and 50 years of adulthood. The declining theta power of EROs in women reached that of men after the age of 50 while the theta ERO power was more stable across the age groups in men. Our results imply that the cohorts must be recruited at specified age ranges across genders, and clinical trials using neurophysiological biomarkers as an intervention endpoint should take gender into account in the future.</p>

">Generalized cue reactivity in dopamine neurons after opioids</a></h4>

              
                Cue reactivity is the maladaptive neurobiological and behavioral response upon exposure to drug cues and is a major driver of relapse. The leading hypothesis is that dopamine release by addictive drugs represents a persistently positive reward prediction error that causes runaway enhancement of dopamine responses to drug cues, leading to their pathological overvaluation compared to non-drug reward alternatives. However, this hypothesis has not been directly tested. Here we developed Pavlovian and operant procedures to measure firing responses, within the same dopamine neurons, to drug versus natural reward cues, which we found to be similarly enhanced compared to cues predicting natural rewards in drug-naive controls. This enhancement was associated with increased behavioral reactivity to the drug cue, suggesting that dopamine release is still critical to cue reactivity, albeit not as previously hypothesized. These results challenge the prevailing hypothesis of cue reactivity, warranting new models of dopaminergic function in drug addiction, and provide critical insights into the neurobiology of cue reactivity with potential implications for relapse prevention.

	<p>The prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is increasing, with a tendency for co-occurrence. Some studies indicate a connection between atypical sensory processing and executive function. This study aims to explore the distinctive etiology of executive function deficits in children with ASD+ADHD by investigating the relationship between sensory processing and executive function, comparing children with ASD, ASD+ADHD, ADHD, and typically developing children (TD). Method: Sensory Profile 2 (SP-2) and Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function 2 (BRIEF-2) were measured in 120 school-aged children. The results of the above scales were compared across these four groups, and correlation and regression analyses between BRIEF2 and SP2 were conducted. Results: Our research revealed varying levels of atypical sensory processing and executive function anomalies across the three neurodevelopmental disorder groups compared to the TD group. The ASD+ADHD group showed particularly significant differences. The heightened emotional problems observed in ASD+ADHD children may be associated with more prominent atypical sensory processing. Variance analysis of inhibitory function revealed differences between ASD+ADHD and ADHD children, suggesting distinct etiological mechanisms for attention issues between ASD+ADHD and ADHD. Conclusions: ASD+ADHD represents a phenotype distinct from both ASD and ADHD. Special consideration should be given to interventions for children with ASD+ADHD. The results of this study may offer a new perspective on understanding the occurrence of ASD+ADHD and potential individualized intervention methods.</p>

                <p>Outcomes following vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) improve over years after implantation in children with drug-resistant epilepsy. The added value of deep brain stimulation (DBS) instead of continued VNS optimization is unknown. In a prospective, non-blinded, randomized patient preference trial of 18 children (aged 8–17 years) who did not respond to VNS after at least 1 year, add-on DBS resulted in greater seizure reduction compared with an additional year of VNS optimization (51.9% vs. 12.3%, <i>p</i> = 0.047). Add-on DBS also resulted in less bothersome seizures (<i>p</i> = 0.03), but no change in quality of life. DBS may be considered earlier for childhood epilepsy after non-response to VNS.

	<p>This study introduces Multi-Threshold Recurrence Rate Plots (MTRRP), a novel methodology for analyzing dynamic patterns in complex systems, such as those influenced by neurodegenerative diseases in brain activity. MTRRP characterizes how recurrence rates evolve with increasing recurrence thresholds. A key innovation of our approach, Recurrence Complexity, captures structural complexity by integrating local randomness and global structural features through the product of Recurrence Rate Gradient and Recurrence Hurst, both derived from MTRRP. We applied this technique to resting-state EEG data from patients diagnosed with Alzheimer&amp;amp;rsquo;s Disease (AD), Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD), and age-matched healthy controls. The results revealed significantly higher recurrence complexity in the occipital areas of AD and FTD patients, particularly pronounced in the Alpha and Beta frequency bands. Furthermore, EEG features derived from MTRRP were evaluated using a Support Vector Machine with leave-one-out cross-validation, achieving a classification accuracy of 87.7%. These findings not only underscore the utility of MTRRP in detecting distinct neurophysiological patterns associated with neurodegenerative diseases but also highlight its broader applicability in time series analysis, providing a substantial tool for advancing medical diagnostics and research.</p>

                In this white paper, we describe the founding of a new ELIXIR Community - the Systems Biology Community - and its proposed future contributions to both ELIXIR and the broader community of systems biologists in Europe and worldwide. The Community believes that the infrastructure aspects of systems biology - databases, (modelling) tools and standards development, as well as training and access to cloud infrastructure - are not only appropriate components of the ELIXIR infrastructure, but will prove key components of ELIXIR’s future support of advanced biological applications and personalised medicine. By way of a series of meetings, the Community identified seven key areas for its future activities, reflecting both future needs and previous and current activities within ELIXIR Platforms and Communities. These are: overcoming barriers to the wider uptake of systems biology; linking new and existing data to systems biology models; interoperability of systems biology resources; further development and embedding of systems medicine; provisioning of modelling as a service; building and coordinating capacity building and training resources; and supporting industrial embedding of systems biology. A set of objectives for the Community has been identified under four main headline areas: Standardisation and Interoperability, Technology, Capacity Building and Training, and Industrial Embedding. These are grouped into short-term (3-year), mid-term (6-year) and long-term (10-year) objectives.

                Background Persistent neck pain is a prevalent musculoskeletal condition that affects the quality of life and functional abilities of individuals. Blood Flow Restriction Training (BFRT) is a novel therapeutic approach that involves restricting blood flow to exercising muscles to enhance strength and function. However, limited research has been conducted on the effects of BFRT on pressure pain threshold and hand function in adults with persistent neck pain. This randomized controlled trial aims to investigate the potential benefits of BFRT as a treatment intervention for this population. Methods This study will be a prospective 1:1 allocation, parallel group active controlled trail conducted at Physiotherapy Department, Galgotias University. The trial was prospectively registered with the Clinical Trial Registry India CTRI/2023/06/053439. Informed consent will be obtained from all the participants who are eligible to be included in the study. A total of 110 patients with persistent neck pain will be randomly allocated into two groups. The BFRT group will receive supervised training sessions three times a week for eight weeks, performing low-load resistance exercises with blood flow restriction applied using personalized cuff pressure. The control group will receive standard care for neck pain, which may include general advice, manual therapy, and/or home exercises without BFRT. The primary outcome measures will be the pressure pain threshold, assessed using a pressure Algometer, and hand function, evaluated using standardized tests such as Hand Grip Strength and Purdue Peg board Test. Results The data obtained will be analyzed using appropriate statistical methods, and the significance level will be set at p<0.05. Conclusion This trial will contribute valuable contribution highlighting the potential benefits of BFR training in improving pressure pain threshold and hand function in adults with persistent neck pain.

                Background In recent years, various advancements in anticancer therapy have led to the development of multiple regimens and protocols. This study endeavors to provide an extensive evaluation of anticancer therapy prescription patterns in correlation with patient outcomes. Methods From June 2014 to April 2022, we included adult cancer patients who received anticancer therapy in our cancer center. Collected data encompassed demographic characteristics of patients and cancer, chemotherapy protocols or agents, antiemetics, drug side effects, and the patient’s last status. The prescribed drugs were assessed using the Essential Medicines List, while the prescription’s rationality was determined using the World Health Organization indicators. Results The mean age was 55.16 ± 17.04 years, with 56.4% of the patients being males. Gastrointestinal (29.7%) and breast (25.8%) cancers were the most common malignancies. The main protocols included a combination of Adriamycin and cyclophosphamide (20.1%) and folinic acid, fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin-based (FOLFOX) regimen (13.5%). The most frequently used drugs were doxorubicin (14.0%), cyclophosphamide (13.3%), and docetaxel (9.9%). The majority of patients also did not report any acute adverse events related to chemotherapy (81.1%). Antiemetics, mainly metoclopramide-based, were used in 76.07% of cases. Remarkably, 86.7% of anticancer agents were from the EML, and 90.1% were prescribed generically. Conclusion In this study, gastrointestinal cancers were the most prevalent cancers observed, with more preponderance among males. Most anticancer agents were taken from the essential drug list, with the majority being prescribed under generic names, indicating rational use.

                Background Pulmonary involvement is a major cause of internal organ complication and the leading cause of death in patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc). This study aimed to demonstrate the characteristics of pulmonary function (PF) in Thai patients with SSc and the association between PF and body mass index (BMI) and anti-topoisomerase (anti-Scl70). Methods All patients diagnosed with SSc in our tertiary care teaching hospital database between 2016 and 2021 were reviewed and analyzed. Results Of 211 SSc patients, 128 patients who underwent the PF test were enrolled; 102 (79.7%) were female. The mean age was 54 years. The median BMI for all patients was 21.7 kg/m2. Regarding anti-Scl70, 10.9% of patients were positive, 7.8% were negative, and the status was unreported for 81.3%. The mean (SD) forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio was 0.8 (0.1). The mean (SD) % predicted values of FEV1, FVC, and diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO) were 76.3 (16.3), 69.1 (15.8), and 75.5 (22.8), respectively. A restrictive spirometry pattern (RSP) was found in 78.8% of the patients. DLCO had a moderate positive linear correlation with FVC (r=0.50, p <0.001) and a moderate negative linear correlation with BMI (r=-0.36, p <0.001). However, there was no correlation between FVC and BMI. There was no statistical difference in demographic data or the presence of anti-Scl70 among patients with or without RSP. Conclusions RSP is common among Thai patients with SSc. However, the power of using demographic data and the presence of anti-Scl70 to determine the probability of pulmonary involvement remains limited.

                Introduction The commonest type of cancer in the head and neck region is oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) due to its high rates of occurrence and mortality. The early diagnosis of oral cancer gives better prognosis. Brandwein-Gensler criteria predict the early stage of OSCC cases with a high risk of locoregional recurrence. Objectives To correlate Brandwein-Gensler criteria and depth of invasion of OSCC with three-year survival. Methodology In the study, This study will include 80 random histopathologically-diagnosed cases of OSCC. hematoxylin-eosin (HE)-stained section slides will be used to evaluate, Brandwein and Gensler criteria by three histopathologists in a blinded manner. The depth of invasion assessment will be done from the basement-membrane (BM), in regions where the BM has been lost, as well as from an illustrative line connecting the BM from the neighbouring epithelium to the point of deepest tumour invasion in the connective-tissue stroma with the help of a research microscope (Leica-DMLB2) in resected tissue specimens of OSCC cases. Expected results The present study will find the correlation between Brandwein-Gensler criteria and depth of invasion in OSCC in order to evaluate the locoregional recurrence in OSCC cases. In high-risk OSCC cases, there may be an increased depth of invasion in resected tissues. Conclusions We hypothesized that the correlation between Brandwein-Gensler criteria and depth of invasion can be used as an independent predictor for locoregional recurrence in OSCC.

                Background Interpersonal meaning is the interaction between the speaker and the listener and the writer and the reader. This study aims to determine the structure of mood and how the structure of mood is found. The purposes of this study are (1) to be more sensitive to the mood structure shown in Maybelline New York cosmetic advertisement. (2) to investigate the reason of why interrogative sentences are more difficult to find than declarative sentences. Through this research, we can see the types of mood structures, and how these mood structures are used. Methods The type of research approach used is descriptive qualitative. Research in this case describes systematically, factually and accurately facts and causal relationships of the phenomena studied. The sources of data in this study are eight cosmetic Maybelline New York products, namely the Maybelline gel pencil, L’oreal colour riche nail, Maybelline mascara and eyeliner, Maybelline creamy lipmatte and Maybelline eyeshadow, Maybelline eyeliner, Maybelline lipstick, and Maybelline clear smooth all in one. Results In analyzing the data, the researcher of the 2014 Halliday theory revised by Mathiesse found that there are three types of manifested mood, four types of realized speech function, and mood-based realization of speech function. The moods manifested were declarative (48.64%), interrogative (5.40%) and imperative (45.94%). Speech functions that are realized are statements (48.64%), questions (5.40%), offers (18.91%) and command (24.32%). Conclusions It can be concluded that declarative sentences are mostly found in Maybelline New York products. Researchers suggest that readers be more careful in using mood structures in cosmetic advertisements so that there are no misunderstandings.

                Background This paper identifies the determinant factors of Portuguese investment in Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic. We assume that investment abroad is motivated by business opportunities, and the quality-price ratio of the workforce. Methods To this end, we used a qualitative methodology composed of 6 case studies, based on interviews and surveys with the managers of the Portuguese firms investing in those three economies. Results Despite the business opportunities, Portuguese investment directed towards these economies is negligible, due, in part, to the geographic and cultural distance. However, the economic and political stability, combined with market size and growth potential are undeniable attraction factors for Portuguese investors. Small and medium enterprises (SMEs), due to their flexible conditions that allow changes in the activity, and the strong trend towards outsourcing, to the detriment of the manufacturing industry, are the primary focus of international investment. This trend, although common to several sectors, has shown greater dynamism in the banking and financial sector. Conclusions The results suggest market-oriented investments aiming at growth and expansion. The vast Polish market is the one that most attracted Portuguese investors. The hybrid feature of some strategies can align with the cautious attitude towards the investment translated into cooperation agreements with financial institutions for funding, the market learning process, and the training of the personnel. The anticipation of the installation over potential competitors, the experience in production and international markets, the price-quality ratio, the capacity of product adaptation and the design were considered important sources of competitive advantage that motivated the investment. The greatest difficulties during this process were language and the complexity of legislation.

                Background Amidst the global escalation of COVID-19, nurses have confronted the dual challenge of exposure to infection and the duty to provide patient care, leading to some moral dilemmas. This study aims to explore the psychological burden and dilemmas faced by nurses working in COVID-19 wards, elucidating their professional distress and rewards, and examining their interrelation. Methods This qualitative descriptive study employed semi-structured interviews to gather data on the experiences of nurses who worked in COVID-19 wards. The study spanned from January 2022 to March 2023. Qualitative content analysis was applied to analyze interview transcripts. Results The study involved 12 participants (8 women and 4 men). Their experience ranged from 4-21 years. The group included 6 staff nurses, 3 head or deputy head nurses, and 3 head nurses. No significant changes were observed in weekly working hours pre- and post-COVID-19. Analysis of the interviews revealed that nurses working in COVID-19 wards experienced conflicts related to the risk of infection at work, role execution, organizational challenges, and interpersonal relationships. Concurrently, they also reported finding rewards in their work and in building connections with others. Conclusions This study revealed that nurses experienced distress related to COVID-19-related job challenges, leading to a sense of mistrust towards their organizations. However, working in COVID-19 wards also brought a renewed sense of job fulfillment, particularly through interactions with individuals they had not previously encountered. These experiences are illustrative of the dilemmas faced by healthcare professionals in balancing the distress and rewards inherent in their roles.

                Background Differentiating between ameloblastoma (AB) and ameloblastic carcinoma (AC) is difficult, especially when AB has atypical cytological characteristics or an uncommon clinical history. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to elucidate the differential expression of immunohistochemical markers between AB and AC. Methods We conducted a thorough search of PUBMED and SCOPUS according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines to identify cross-sectional studies that compared the expression of immunohistochemical markers in AB and AC. We used a random-effects model to analyze the risk ratios and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The quality of the included studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. The Egger’s test was used to assess publication bias. Results In total, 301 articles were identified. After excluding irrelevant titles and abstracts, 86 articles were selected for full-text review. We categorized the 41 markers into proliferative and non-proliferative markers. Among non-proliferative markers, nuclear markers were differentially expressed in AB and AC. SOX2 was the only marker that significantly differentiated AB and AC, with an RR of -0.19 (CI 0.10-0.36, I2=0). Conclusion The current evidence suggests the significance of SOX2 in differentiating between AB and AC, warranting prospective confirmation in well-defined extensive studies. We highlight the paucity of high-quality replicated studies of other markers in this field. Collaborative efforts with standardized techniques are necessary to generate clinically useful immunohistochemical markers.

                Background Determining the appropriate computational requirements and software performance is essential for efficient genomic surveillance. The lack of standardized benchmarking complicates software selection, especially with limited resources. Methods We developed a containerized benchmarking pipeline to evaluate seven long-read assemblers—Canu, GoldRush, MetaFlye, Strainline, HaploDMF, iGDA, and RVHaplo—for viral haplotype reconstruction, using both simulated and experimental Oxford Nanopore sequencing data of HIV-1 and other viruses. Benchmarking was conducted on three computational systems to assess each assembler’s performance, utilizing QUAST and BLASTN for quality assessment. Results Our findings show that assembler choice significantly impacts assembly time, with CPU and memory usage having minimal effect. Assembler selection also influences the size of the contigs, with a minimum read length of 2,000 nucleotides required for quality assembly. A 4,000-nucleotide read length improves quality further. Canu was efficient among de novo assemblers but not suitable for multi-strain mixtures, while GoldRush produced only consensus assemblies. Strainline and MetaFlye were suitable for metagenomic sequencing data, with Strainline requiring high memory and MetaFlye operable on low-specification machines. Among reference-based assemblers, iGDA had high error rates, RVHaplo showed the best runtime and accuracy but became ineffective with similar sequences, and HaploDMF, utilizing machine learning, had fewer errors with a slightly longer runtime. Conclusions The HIV-64148 pipeline, containerized using Docker, facilitates easy deployment and offers flexibility to select from a range of assemblers to match computational systems or study requirements. This tool aids in genome assembly and provides valuable information on HIV-1 sequences, enhancing viral evolution monitoring and understanding.

                <p>by Lulu Gong, Fabio Pasqualetti, Thomas Papouin, ShiNung Ching</p>

Astrocytes are a ubiquitous and enigmatic type of non-neuronal cell and are found in the brain of all vertebrates. While traditionally viewed as being supportive of neurons, it is increasingly recognized that astrocytes play a more direct and active role in brain function and neural computation. On account of their sensitivity to a host of physiological covariates and ability to modulate neuronal activity and connectivity on slower time scales, astrocytes may be particularly well poised to modulate the dynamics of neural circuits in functionally salient ways. In the current paper, we seek to capture these features via actionable abstractions within computational models of neuron-astrocyte interaction. Specifically, we engage how nested feedback loops of neuron-astrocyte interaction, acting over separated time-scales, may endow astrocytes with the capability to enable learning in context-dependent settings, where fluctuations in task parameters may occur much more slowly than within-task requirements. We pose a general model of neuron-synapse-astrocyte interaction and use formal analysis to characterize how astrocytic modulation may constitute a form of meta-plasticity, altering the ways in which synapses and neurons adapt as a function of time. We then embed this model in a bandit-based reinforcement learning task environment, and show how the presence of time-scale separated astrocytic modulation enables learning over multiple fluctuating contexts. Indeed, these networks learn far more reliably compared to dynamically homogeneous networks and conventional non-network-based bandit algorithms. Our results fuel the notion that neuron-astrocyte interactions in the brain benefit learning over different time-scales and the conveyance of task-relevant contextual information onto circuit dynamics.

                <p>by Garrick W. Bruening, Robert J. Courter, Shruthi Sukumar, Megan K. O’Brien, Alaa A. Ahmed</p>

On any given day, we make countless reaching movements to objects around us. While such ubiquity may suggest uniformity, each movement’s speed is unique—why is this? Reach speed is known to be influenced by accuracy; we slow down to sustain high accuracy. However, in other forms of movement like walking or running, metabolic cost is often the primary determinant of movement speed. Here we bridge this gap and ask: how do metabolic cost and accuracy interact to determine speed of reaching movements? First, we systematically measure the effect of increasing mass on the metabolic cost of reaching across a range of movement speeds. Next, in a sequence of three experiments, we examine how added mass affects preferred reaching speed across changing accuracy requirements. We find that, while added mass consistently increases metabolic cost thereby leading to slower metabolically optimal movement speeds, self-selected reach speeds are slower than those predicted by an optimization of metabolic cost alone. We then demonstrate how a single model that considers both accuracy and metabolic costs can explain preferred movement speeds. Together, our findings provide a unifying framework to illuminate the combined effects of metabolic cost and accuracy on movement speed and highlight the integral role metabolic cost plays in determining reach speed.

We evaluate approaches to vaccine distribution using an agent-based model of human activity and COVID-19 transmission calibrated to detailed trends in cases, hospitalizations, deaths, seroprevalence, and vaccine breakthrough infections in Florida, USA. We compare the incremental effectiveness for four different distribution strategies at four different levels of vaccine supply, starting in late 2020 through early 2022. Our analysis indicates that the best strategy to reduce severe outcomes would be to actively target high disease-risk individuals. This was true in every scenario, although the advantage was greatest for the intermediate vaccine availability assumptions and relatively modest compared to a simple mass vaccination approach under high vaccine availability. Ring vaccination, while generally the most effective strategy for reducing infections, ultimately proved least effective at preventing deaths. We also consider using age group as a practical surrogate measure for actual disease-risk targeting; this approach also outperforms both simple mass distribution and ring vaccination. We find that quantitative effectiveness of a strategy depends on whether effectiveness is assessed after the alpha, delta, or omicron wave. However, these differences in absolute benefit for the strategies do not change the ranking of their performance at preventing severe outcomes across vaccine availability assumptions.

                <p>by Philippe Nguyen, Jinani Sooriyaarachchi, Qianyu Huang, Curtis L. Baker Jr.</p>

Neurons in the primary visual cortex respond selectively to simple features of visual stimuli, such as orientation and spatial frequency. Simple cells, which have phase-sensitive responses, can be modeled by a single receptive field filter in a linear-nonlinear model. However, it is challenging to analyze phase-invariant complex cells, which require more elaborate models having a combination of nonlinear subunits. Estimating parameters of these models is made additionally more difficult by cortical neurons’ trial-to-trial response variability. We develop a simple convolutional neural network method to estimate receptive field models for both simple and complex visual cortex cells from their responses to natural images. The model consists of a spatiotemporal filter, a parameterized rectifier unit (PReLU), and a two-dimensional Gaussian "map" of the receptive field envelope. A single model parameter determines the simple vs. complex nature of the receptive field, capturing complex cell responses as a summation of homogeneous subunits, and collapsing to a linear-nonlinear model for simple type cells. The convolutional method predicts simple and complex cell responses to natural image stimuli as well as grating tuning curves. The fitted models yield a continuum of values for the PReLU parameter across the sampled neurons, showing that the simple/complex nature of cells can vary in a continuous manner. We demonstrate that complex-like cells respond less reliably than simple-like cells. However, compensation for this unreliability with noise ceiling analysis reveals predictive performance for complex cells proportionately closer to that for simple cells. Most spatial receptive field structures are well fit by Gabor functions, whose parameters confirm well-known properties of cat A17/18 receptive fields.

                <p>by Tomas Ferreira Amaro Freire, Zhijian Hu, Kevin B. Wood, Erida Gjini</p>

Multi-drug combinations to treat bacterial populations are at the forefront of approaches for infection control and prevention of antibiotic resistance. Although the evolution of antibiotic resistance has been theoretically studied with mathematical population dynamics models, extensions to spatial dynamics remain rare in the literature, including in particular spatial evolution of multi-drug resistance. In this study, we propose a reaction-diffusion system that describes the multi-drug evolution of bacteria based on a drug-concentration rescaling approach. We show how the resistance to drugs in space, and the consequent adaptation of growth rate, is governed by a Price equation with diffusion, integrating features of drug interactions and collateral resistances or sensitivities to the drugs. We study spatial versions of the model where the distribution of drugs is homogeneous across space, and where the drugs vary environmentally in a piecewise-constant, linear and nonlinear manner. Although in many evolution models, per capita growth rate is a natural surrogate for fitness, in spatially-extended, potentially heterogeneous habitats, fitness is an emergent property that potentially reflects additional complexities, from boundary conditions to the specific spatial variation of growth rates. Applying concepts from perturbation theory and reaction-diffusion equations, we propose an analytical metric for characterization of <i>average mutant fitness</i> in the spatial system based on the principal eigenvalue of our linear problem, λ<sub>1</sub>. This enables an accurate translation from drug spatial gradients and mutant antibiotic susceptibility traits to the relative advantage of each mutant across the environment. Our approach allows one to predict the precise outcomes of selection among mutants over space, ultimately from comparing their λ<sub>1</sub> values, which encode a critical interplay between growth functions, movement traits, habitat size and boundary conditions. Such mathematical understanding opens new avenues for multi-drug therapeutic optimization.

                <p>by Yifei Ren, Pouya Bashivan</p>

Unit activity in particular deep neural networks (DNNs) are remarkably similar to the neuronal population responses to static images along the primate ventral visual cortex. Linear combinations of DNN unit activities are widely used to build predictive models of neuronal activity in the visual cortex. Nevertheless, prediction performance in these models is often investigated on stimulus sets consisting of everyday objects under naturalistic settings. Recent work has revealed a generalization gap in how predicting neuronal responses to synthetically generated out-of-distribution (OOD) stimuli. Here, we investigated how the recent progress in improving DNNs’ object recognition generalization, as well as various DNN design choices such as architecture, learning algorithm, and datasets have impacted the generalization gap in neural predictivity. We came to a surprising conclusion that the performance on none of the common computer vision OOD object recognition benchmarks is predictive of OOD neural predictivity performance. Furthermore, we found that adversarially robust models often yield substantially higher generalization in neural predictivity, although the degree of robustness itself was not predictive of neural predictivity score. These results suggest that improving object recognition behavior on current benchmarks alone may not lead to more general models of neurons in the primate ventral visual cortex.

Negation is key for cognition but has no physical basis, raising questions about its neural origins. A new study in PLOS Biology on the negation of scalar adjectives shows that negation acts in part by altering the response to the adjective it negates.

All languages make use of negation, but the neural bases of our cognitive ability to process negation remain unknown. This Primer explores a new PLOS Biology study which shows that humans first interpret negated adjectives as affirmative and later modify their interpretation towards, but never exactly as, the opposite meaning.

                <p>by Ricarda Sabitzki, Anna-Lena Roßmann, Marius Schmitt, Sven Flemming, Andrés Guillén-Samander, Hannah Michaela Behrens, Ernst Jonscher, Katharina Höhn, Ulrike Fröhlke, Tobias Spielmann</p>

Vesicular trafficking, including secretion and endocytosis, plays fundamental roles in the unique biology of <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> blood-stage parasites. Endocytosis of host cell cytosol (HCC) provides nutrients and room for parasite growth and is critical for the action of antimalarial drugs and parasite drug resistance. Previous work showed that PfVPS45 functions in endosomal transport of HCC to the parasite’s food vacuole, raising the possibility that malaria parasites possess a canonical endolysosomal system. However, the seeming absence of VPS45-typical functional interactors such as rabenosyn 5 (Rbsn5) and the repurposing of Rab5 isoforms and other endolysosomal proteins for secretion in apicomplexans question this idea. Here, we identified a parasite Rbsn5-like protein and show that it functions with VPS45 in the endosomal transport of HCC. We also show that PfRab5b but not PfRab5a is involved in the same process. Inactivation of PfRbsn5L resulted in PI3P and PfRab5b decorated HCC-filled vesicles, typical for endosomal compartments. Overall, this indicates that despite the low sequence conservation of PfRbsn5L and the unusual N-terminal modification of PfRab5b, principles of endosomal transport in malaria parasite are similar to that of model organisms. Using a conditional double protein inactivation system, we further provide evidence that the PfKelch13 compartment, an unusual apicomplexa-specific endocytosis structure at the parasite plasma membrane, is connected upstream of the Rbsn5L/VPS45/Rab5b-dependent endosomal route. Altogether, this work indicates that HCC uptake consists of a highly parasite-specific part that feeds endocytosed material into an endosomal system containing more canonical elements, leading to the delivery of HCC to the food vacuole.

                Background It is important and challenging to distinguish between acute myocardial infarction and Wellens syndrome due to its time to intervention. Difficulties in differentiating between subtypes could mean the patients are overtreated or receive undertreatment. Case report A 57-year-old man was referred to our emergency ward with acute onset of chest pain. Electrocardiograms changes were suggestive of type A Wellens syndrome. Nitroglycerin was administrated, the patient's chest pain disappeared, and we planned an early invasive strategy. He had a previous documented electrocardiogram before he went for catheterization and based on the second electrocardiogram changes were suggestive of an ST-elevation. As the result of the invasive strategy, it was found that there was single-vessel disease, critical occlusion in the middle of the left anterior descending artery coronary artery with collateral from the right coronary artery. After two days of observation in the Intensive Cardiovascular Care Unit, the patient improved and was transferred to Low Care Unit. Conclusions The case highlights Wellens syndrome in acute critical occlusion with collateral artery.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>This study was undertaken to explore manipulation of the Myc protein interactome, members of an oncogene group, in enhancing the intrinsic growth of injured peripheral adult postmitotic neurons and the nerves they supply. New approaches to enhance adult neuron growth properties are a key strategy in improving nerve regeneration.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Expression and impact of Myc interactome members c-Myc, N-Myc, Mad1, and Max were evaluated within naive and “preconditioned” adult sensory neurons and Schwann cells (SCs), using siRNA and transfection of CRISPR/Cas9 or luciferase reporter in vitro. Morphological, behavioral, and electrophysiological indices of nerve regeneration were analyzed in vivo.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>c-Myc, N-Myc, Max, and Mad were expressed in adult sensory neurons and in partnering SCs. In vitro knockdown (KD) of either Mad1 or Max, competitive inhibitors of Myc, unleashed heightened neurite outgrowth in both naive uninjured or preconditioned adult neurons. In contrast, KD or inhibition of both isoforms of Myc was required to suppress growth. In SCs, Mad1 KD not only enhanced migratory behavior but also conditioned increased outgrowth in separately cultured adult sensory neurons. In vivo, local Mad1 KD improved electrophysiological, behavioral, and structural indices of nerve regeneration out to 60 days of follow-up.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Members of the Myc interactome, specifically Mad1, are novel targets for improving nerve regeneration. Unleashing of Myc growth signaling through Mad1 KD enhances the regrowth of both peripheral neurons and SCs to facilitate better regrowth of nerves. ANN NEUROL 2024</p>

                Disentangling how cognitive functions emerge from the interplay of brain dynamics and network architecture is among the major challenges that neuroscientists face. Pharmacological and pathological perturbations of consciousness provide a lens to investigate these complex challenges. Here, we review how recent advances about consciousness and the brain’s functional organisation have been driven by a common denominator: decomposing brain function into fundamental constituents of time, space, and information. Whereas unconsciousness increases structure–function coupling across scales, psychedelics may decouple brain function from structure. Convergent effects also emerge: anaesthetics, psychedelics, and disorders of consciousness can exhibit similar reconfigurations of the brain’s unimodal–transmodal functional axis. Decomposition approaches reveal the potential to translate discoveries across species, with computational modelling providing a path towards mechanistic integration.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/94191">Visual working memories are abstractions of percepts</a></h4>

              
                During perception, decoding the orientation of gratings depends on complex interactions between the orientation of the grating, aperture edges, and topographic structure of the visual map. Here, we aimed to test how aperture biases described during perception affect working memory (WM) decoding. For memoranda, we used gratings multiplied by radial and angular modulators to generate orthogonal aperture biases for identical orientations. Therefore, if WM representations are simply maintained sensory representations, they would have similar aperture biases. If they are abstractions of sensory features, they would be unbiased and the modulator would have no effect on orientation decoding. Neural patterns of delay period activity while maintaining the orientation of gratings with one modulator (e.g. radial) were interchangeable with patterns while maintaining gratings with the other modulator (e.g. angular) in visual and parietal cortex, suggesting that WM representations are insensitive to aperture biases during perception. Then, we visualized memory abstractions of stimuli using models of visual field map properties. Regardless of aperture biases, WM representations of both modulated gratings were recoded into a single oriented line. These results provide strong evidence that visual WM representations are abstractions of percepts, immune to perceptual aperture biases, and compel revisions of WM theory.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89516">Genetically defined nucleus incertus neurons differ in connectivity and function</a></h4>

              
                The nucleus incertus (NI), a conserved hindbrain structure implicated in the stress response, arousal, and memory, is a major site for production of the neuropeptide relaxin-3. On the basis of <i>goosecoid homeobox 2</i> (<i>gsc2</i>) expression, we identified a neuronal cluster that lies adjacent to <i>relaxin 3a</i> (<i>rln3a</i>) neurons in the zebrafish analogue of the NI. To delineate the characteristics of the <i>gsc2</i> and <i>rln3a</i> NI neurons, we used CRISPR/Cas9 targeted integration to drive gene expression specifically in each neuronal group, and found that they differ in their efferent and afferent connectivity, spontaneous activity, and functional properties. <i>gsc2</i> and <i>rln3a</i> NI neurons have widely divergent projection patterns and innervate distinct subregions of the midbrain interpeduncular nucleus (IPN). Whereas <i>gsc2</i> neurons are activated more robustly by electric shock, <i>rln3a</i> neurons exhibit spontaneous fluctuations in calcium signaling and regulate locomotor activity. Our findings define heterogeneous neurons in the NI and provide new tools to probe its diverse functions.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93178">Bacterial vampirism mediated through taxis to serum</a></h4>

              
                Bacteria of the family Enterobacteriaceae are associated with gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and bacteremia and are a leading cause of death, from sepsis, for individuals with inflammatory bowel diseases. The bacterial behaviors and mechanisms underlying why these bacteria are prone to bloodstream entry remain poorly understood. Herein, we report that clinical isolates of non-typhoidal <i>Salmonella enterica</i> serovars, <i>Escherichia coli</i>, and <i>Citrobacter koseri</i> are rapidly attracted toward sources of human serum. To simulate GI bleeding, we utilized an injection-based microfluidics device and found that femtoliter volumes of human serum are sufficient to induce bacterial attraction to the serum source. This response is orchestrated through chemotaxis and the chemoattractant L-serine, an amino acid abundant in serum that is recognized through direct binding by the chemoreceptor Tsr. We report the first crystal structures of <i>Salmonella</i> Typhimurium Tsr in complex with L-serine and identify a conserved amino acid recognition motif for L-serine shared among Tsr orthologues. We find Tsr to be widely conserved among Enterobacteriaceae and numerous World Health Organization priority pathogens associated with bloodstream infections. Lastly, we find that Enterobacteriaceae use human serum as a source of nutrients for growth and that chemotaxis and the chemoreceptor Tsr provide a competitive advantage for migration into enterohemorrhagic lesions. We define this bacterial behavior of taxis toward serum, colonization of hemorrhagic lesions, and the consumption of serum nutrients as ‘bacterial vampirism’, which may relate to the proclivity of Enterobacteriaceae for bloodstream infections.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/93087">Aberrant methylation and expression of TNXB promote chondrocyte apoptosis and extracullar matrix degradation in hemophilic arthropathy via AKT signaling</a></h4>

              
                Recurrent joint bleeding in hemophilia patients frequently causes hemophilic arthropathy (HA). Drastic degradation of cartilage is a major characteristic of HA, but its pathological mechanisms has not yet been clarified. In HA cartilages, we found server matrix degradation and increased expression of DNA methyltransferase proteins. We thus performed genome-wide DNA methylation analysis on human HA (N=5) and osteoarthritis (OA) (N=5) articular cartilages, and identified 1228 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with HA. Functional enrichment analyses revealed the association between DMR genes (DMGs) and extracellular matrix (ECM) organization. Among these DMGs, Tenascin XB (TNXB) expression was down-regulated in human and mouse HA cartilages. The loss of <i>Tnxb</i> in <i>F8<sup>-/-</sup></i> mouse cartilage provided a disease-promoting role in HA by augmenting cartilage degeneration and subchondral bone loss. <i>Tnxb</i> knockdown also promoted chondrocyte apoptosis and inhibited phosphorylation of AKT. Importantly, AKT agonist showed chondroprotective effects following <i>Tnxb</i> knockdown. Together, our findings indicate that exposure of cartilage to blood leads to alterations in DNA methylation, which is functionally related to ECM homeostasis, and further demonstrate a critical role of TNXB in HA cartilage degeneration by activating AKT signaling. These mechanistic insights allow development of potentially new strategies for HA cartilage protection.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/91798">SMAD4 promotes somatic-germline contact during murine oocyte growth</a></h4>

              
                Development of the mammalian oocyte requires physical contact with the surrounding granulosa cells of the follicle, which provide it with essential nutrients and regulatory signals. This contact is achieved through specialized filopodia, termed transzonal projections (TZPs), that extend from the granulosa cells to the oocyte surface. Transforming growth factor (TGFβ) family ligands produced by the oocyte increase the number of TZPs, but how they do so is unknown. Using an inducible Cre recombinase strategy together with expression of green fluorescent protein to verify Cre activity in individual cells, we examined the effect of depleting the canonical TGFβ mediator, SMAD4, in mouse granulosa cells. We observed a 20–50% decrease in the total number of TZPs in SMAD4-depleted granulosa cell-oocyte complexes, and a 50% decrease in the number of newly generated TZPs when the granulosa cells were reaggregated with wild-type oocytes. Three-dimensional image analysis revealed that TZPs of SMAD4-depleted cells were longer than controls and more frequently oriented towards the oocyte. Strikingly, the transmembrane proteins, N-cadherin and Notch2, were reduced by 50% in SMAD4-depleted cells. SMAD4 may thus modulate a network of cell adhesion proteins that stabilize the attachment of TZPs to the oocyte, thereby amplifying signalling between the two cell types.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/96065">Neutralizing gut-derived lipopolysaccharide as a novel therapeutic strategy for severe leptospirosis</a></h4>

              
                Leptospirosis is an emerging infectious disease caused by pathogenic <i>Leptospira</i> spp. Humans and some mammals can develop severe forms of leptospirosis accompanied by a dysregulated inflammatory response, which often results in death. The gut microbiota has been increasingly recognized as a vital element in systemic health. However, the precise role of the gut microbiota in severe leptospirosis is still unknown. Here, we aimed to explore the function and potential mechanisms of the gut microbiota in a hamster model of severe leptospirosis. Our study showed that leptospires were able to multiply in the intestine, cause pathological injury, and induce intestinal and systemic inflammatory responses. 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis revealed that <i>Leptospira</i> infection changed the composition of the gut microbiota of hamsters with an expansion of Proteobacteria. In addition, gut barrier permeability was increased after infection, as reflected by a decrease in the expression of tight junctions. Translocated Proteobacteria were found in the intestinal epithelium of moribund hamsters, as determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization, with elevated lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels in the serum. Moreover, gut microbiota depletion reduced the survival time, increased the leptospiral load, and promoted the expression of proinflammatory cytokines after <i>Leptospira</i> infection. Intriguingly, fecal filtration and serum from moribund hamsters both increased the transcription of <i>TNF-α</i>, <i>IL-1β</i>, <i>IL-10</i>, and <i>TLR4</i> in macrophages compared with those from uninfected hamsters. These stimulating activities were inhibited by LPS neutralization using polymyxin B. Based on our findings, we identified an LPS neutralization therapy that significantly improved the survival rates in severe leptospirosis when used in combination with antibiotic therapy or polyclonal antibody therapy. In conclusion, our study not only uncovers the role of the gut microbiota in severe leptospirosis but also provides a therapeutic strategy for severe leptospirosis.

	<p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is characterized by the progressive loss of motor neurons from the brain and spinal cord. The excessive neuroinflammation is thought to be a common determinant of ALS. Suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS3) is pathologically upregulated after injury/diseases to negatively regulate a broad range of cytokines/chemokines that mediate inflammation; however, the role that SOCS3 plays in ALS pathogenesis has not been explored. Here, we found that SOCS3 protein levels were significantly increased in the brainstem of the superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1)-G93A ALS mice, which is negatively related to a progressive decline in motor function from the pre-symptomatic to the early symptomatic stage. Moreover, SOCS3 levels in both cervical and lumbar spinal cords of ALS mice were also significantly upregulated at the pre-symptomatic stage and became exacerbated at the early symptomatic stage. Concomitantly, astrocytes and microglia/macrophages were progressively increased and reactivated over time. In contrast, neurons were simultaneously lost in the brainstem and spinal cord examined over the course of disease progression. Collectively, SOCS3 was first found to be upregulated during ALS progression to directly relate to both increased astrogliosis and increased neuronal loss, indicating that SOCS3 could be explored to be as a potential therapeutic target of ALS.</p>

	<p>This study aimed to explore the impact of the first two waves of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental and physical states of sports students from Romania and also to compare the differences according to gender and the type of sport. Initially, in order to collect demographic data and health reports, a cross-sectional survey was developed to evaluate the emotional needs of sports students during the pandemic. After the second wave, the coping strategies used by the participants to fight negative emotions were assessed using the CERQ questionnaire. The results indicate that depression symptoms are the most reported psychological issues among the participants and that there are differences according to gender concerning the cognitive schemas they use in order to reduce the symptoms. Also, it was found that there are differences, corresponding to the type of sport, in choosing adaptive coping mechanisms. Ultimately, it was confirmed that higher levels of hopelessness among sports students are associated with increased vulnerability to substance use, with the correlation between those two indicators being strong. Delving deeper into this relationship can help identify critical points for intervention to prevent substance abuse. At the same time, the dichotomic analysis of the results found as moderators&amp;amp;mdash;the gender and the type of sport in decreasing the severity of depression could be an important aspect of the next counseling interventions.</p>

                Background A proper and adequate school environment is important for an effective learning process and maintaining the health of the students as they spend most of their time in schools. The physical school environment includes the physical structures; presence of chemicals and biological agents; and the surrounding environment, including air, water, and materials. This study aimed to evaluate the indoor air quality (IAQ) in governmental girls’ schools in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). Methods Seventeen girls’ schools were randomly selected in the Eastern Province of KSA. The indoor levels of PM10 and PM2.5, volatile organic compounds, CO, NO2, and CO2 were measured at different sites inside each school during four months of the year 2020. Results Levels of the six air pollutants were higher inside schools adjacent to roads with moderate traffic activity than schools with low and very low traffic activity. However, the mean level of CO2 inside the selected schools was higher than its outdoor level, suggesting the predominance of an indoor source of CO2. The levels of all measured air pollutants inside governmentally constructed school buildings were higher than those inside the rental type. Conclusion The average levels of air pollutants inside the selected schools were much lower than their air quality guidelines (AQGs), while some CO2 and NO2 levels exceeded their AQGs at some schools.

                Background Co-infection of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has an impact on high HBV replication and progression to liver cancer. These may lead to cross-resistance of drugs due to therapeutic pressure or liver toxicity. These require continuous monitoring of HBV variants for better diagnosis and treatment strategies. Methods Convenience sampling was used to collect fifty archival sera from Inkosi Albert Luthuli Central Hospital. The Sera were subjected to HBsAg screening using ELISA, DNA extraction, PCR amplification, Sanger sequencing, phylogenetic and mutation analysis. A correlation test was performed to measure the association between polymerase and surface mutations. Results Of the 50 samples, 86% (N= 43/50) were HBsAg positive; 82% (N=41/50) PCR positive and 92% (N=38/41) sequenced. The HBV sequences showed similarity to genotype A (73% [N=19/26]) and (24% [N=7/26]) as genotypes B, C, D, E, F, and G. Prevalence of the mutations in the Surface region was (47% [N=18/38]); including diagnostic failure (K122R and T143S) and vaccines escape mutations (P127T, G145R, S207N, Y200T, E164D, Y206H and L209V). The mutations in the RT was at (36% [N=14/38]) with drug resistance mutations (DRM) at (50% [7/14]). Mutations showed resistance to lamivudine (LMV) at (35% [5/14]), telbivudine (LdT) at (29% [4/14]), (14% [2/14]) for entecavir (ETV) and (21% [3/14]) for adefovir (ADV). One sample had a combination of L180M, M204V, S202K, and M250I mutations. There was no statistical significance between S and RT mutations at P>0.005 and the statistical correlation between RT and SHB mutations was weak at 0.877. Conclusions Our findings highlight the prevalence of HBV genotype A in HIV-infected patients in South Africa. We provide evidence of mutations linked to immune evasion and drug resistance. Mutations have no statistical significance but can have clinical Implication on the diagnosis and treatment of HBV in HBV/HIV co-infected individuals.

                Introduction The process of breast cancer treatment, especially radiation therapy, frequently alters patients’ lives significantly. It is essential to comprehend how radiation affects breast cancer survivors’ quality of life to improve their overall treatment and well-being. The quality of life among breast cancer patients treated at Acharya Vinoba Bhave Rural Hospital (AVBRH), affiliated with the University Of Datta Meghe Institute Of Higher Education and Research (DMIHER), Sawangi, following radiation therapy is examined in this study during the years 2023–2024. Methods This observational cross-sectional study will be conducted in the Department of Radiotherapy of AVBRH associated with DMIHER, the hospital is situated in the state of Maharashtra, in India, from 2023 to 2024. We will select Breast cancer patients registered in AVBRH at the Radiotherapy department from Jan 2023 to October 2023 and receive treatment in the form of radiotherapy; chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The study will be observational and cross-sectional. This research will take approximately six months. Questionnaires will be distributed on the spot to patients and phone interviews for distant patients will be conducted using an interview checklist. Discussion The study is expected to contribute significantly to the existing body of knowledge by delving into specific challenges and experiences of breast cancer survivors post-radiotherapy, particularly within the context of a rural healthcare setting. By concentrating on this group, the study will contribute to the body of existing knowledge by offering a deeper view of the variables influencing the quality of life in breast cancer survivors. The knowledge gathered from this research will be extremely helpful in understanding the complex effects of radiation therapy on the physical, psychological, and social aspects of survivors’ quality of life.

Neural responses in visual cortex adapt to prolonged and repeated stimuli. While adaptation occurs across the visual cortex, it is unclear how adaptation patterns and computational mechanisms differ across the visual hierarchy. Here we characterize two signatures of short-term neural adaptation in time-varying intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) data collected while participants viewed naturalistic image categories varying in duration and repetition interval. Ventral- and lateral-occipitotemporal cortex exhibit slower and prolonged adaptation to single stimuli and slower recovery from adaptation to repeated stimuli compared to V1-V3. For category-selective electrodes, recovery from adaptation is slower for preferred than non-preferred stimuli. To model neural adaptation we augment our delayed divisive normalization (DN) model by scaling the input strength as a function of stimulus category, enabling the model to accurately predict neural responses across multiple image categories. The model fits suggest that differences in adaptation patterns arise from slower normalization dynamics in higher visual areas interacting with differences in input strength resulting from category selectivity. Our results reveal systematic differences in temporal adaptation of neural population responses between lower and higher visual brain areas and show that a single computational model of history-dependent normalization dynamics, fit with area-specific parameters, accounts for these differences.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012071">The evolution of environmentally mediated social interactions and posthumous spite under isolation by distance</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Charles Mullon, Jorge Peña, Laurent Lehmann</p>

Many social interactions happen indirectly via modifications of the environment, e.g. through the secretion of functional compounds or the depletion of renewable resources. Here, we derive the selection gradient on a quantitative trait affecting dynamical environmental variables that feed back on reproduction and survival in a finite patch-structured population subject to isolation by distance. Our analysis shows that the selection gradient depends on how a focal individual influences the fitness of all future individuals in the population through modifications of the environmental variables they experience, weighted by the neutral relatedness between recipients and the focal. The evolutionarily relevant trait-driven environmental modifications are formalized as the extended phenotypic effects of an individual, quantifying how a trait change in an individual in the present affects the environmental variables in all patches at all future times. When the trait affects reproduction and survival through a payoff function, the selection gradient can be expressed in terms of extended phenotypic effects weighted by scaled relatedness. We show how to compute extended phenotypic effects, relatedness, and scaled relatedness using Fourier analysis, which allow us to investigate a broad class of environmentally mediated social interactions in a tractable way. We use our approach to study the evolution of a trait controlling the costly production of some lasting commons (e.g. a common-pool resource or a toxic compound) that can diffuse in space and persist in time. We show that indiscriminate posthumous spite readily evolves in this scenario. More generally, whether selection favours environmentally mediated altruism or spite is determined by the spatial correlation between an individual’s lineage and the commons originating from its patch. The sign of this correlation depends on interactions between dispersal patterns and the commons’ renewal dynamics. More broadly, we suggest that selection can favour a wide range of social behaviours when these have carry-over effects in space and time.

                <p>by Yahaya A Yabo, Dieter Henrik Heiland</p>

Glioblastoma, the most aggressive and prevalent form of primary brain tumor, is characterized by rapid growth, diffuse infiltration, and resistance to therapies. Intrinsic heterogeneity and cellular plasticity contribute to its rapid progression under therapy; therefore, there is a need to fully understand these tumors at a single-cell level. Over the past decade, single-cell transcriptomics has enabled the molecular characterization of individual cells within glioblastomas, providing previously unattainable insights into the genetic and molecular features that drive tumorigenesis, disease progression, and therapy resistance. However, despite advances in single-cell technologies, challenges such as high costs, complex data analysis and interpretation, and difficulties in translating findings into clinical practice persist. As single-cell technologies are developed further, more insights into the cellular and molecular heterogeneity of glioblastomas are expected, which will help guide the development of personalized and effective therapies, thereby improving prognosis and quality of life for patients.

                <p>by Yatian Chen, Jiayue Gu, Biao Yang, Lili Yang, Jie Pang, Qinghua Luo, Yirong Li, Danyang Li, Zixin Deng, Changjiang Dong, Haohao Dong, Zhengyu Zhang</p>

The peptidoglycan (PG) layer is a critical component of the bacterial cell wall and serves as an important target for antibiotics in both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. The hydrolysis of septal PG (sPG) is a crucial step of bacterial cell division, facilitated by FtsEX through an amidase activation system. In this study, we present the cryo-EM structures of <i>Escherichia coli</i> FtsEX and FtsEX-EnvC in the ATP-bound state at resolutions of 3.05 Å and 3.11 Å, respectively. Our PG degradation assays in <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> reveal that the ATP-bound conformation of FtsEX activates sPG hydrolysis of EnvC-AmiB, whereas EnvC-AmiB alone exhibits autoinhibition. Structural analyses indicate that ATP binding induces conformational changes in FtsEX-EnvC, leading to significant differences from the apo state. Furthermore, PG degradation assays of AmiB mutants confirm that the regulation of AmiB by FtsEX-EnvC is achieved through the interaction between EnvC-AmiB. These findings not only provide structural insight into the mechanism of sPG hydrolysis and bacterial cell division, but also have implications for the development of novel therapeutics targeting drug-resistant bacteria.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002622">Negation mitigates rather than inverts the neural representations of adjectives</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Arianna Zuanazzi, Pablo Ripollés, Wy Ming Lin, Laura Gwilliams, Jean-Rémi King, David Poeppel</p>

Combinatoric linguistic operations underpin human language processes, but how meaning is composed and refined in the mind of the reader is not well understood. We address this puzzle by exploiting the ubiquitous function of negation. We track the online effects of negation (“not”) and intensifiers (“really”) on the representation of scalar adjectives (e.g., “good”) in parametrically designed behavioral and neurophysiological (MEG) experiments. The behavioral data show that participants first interpret negated adjectives as affirmative and later modify their interpretation towards, but never exactly as, the opposite meaning. Decoding analyses of neural activity further reveal significant above chance decoding accuracy for negated adjectives within 600 ms from adjective onset, suggesting that negation does not invert the representation of adjectives (i.e., “not bad” represented as “good”); furthermore, decoding accuracy for negated adjectives is found to be significantly lower than that for affirmative adjectives. Overall, these results suggest that negation mitigates rather than inverts the neural representations of adjectives. This putative suppression mechanism of negation is supported by increased synchronization of beta-band neural activity in sensorimotor areas. The analysis of negation provides a steppingstone to understand how the human brain represents changes of meaning over time.

The CRISPR-associated endonuclease Cas12a has become a powerful genome-editing tool in biomedical research due to its ease of use and low off-targeting. However, the size of Cas12a severely limits clinical applications such as adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based gene therapy. Here, we characterized a novel compact Cas12a ortholog, termed EbCas12a, from the metagenome-assembled genome of a currently unclassified <i>Erysipelotrichia</i>. It has the PAM sequence of 5′-TTTV-3′ (V = A, G, C) and the smallest size of approximately 3.47 kb among the Cas12a orthologs reported so far. In addition, enhanced EbCas12a (enEbCas12a) was also designed to have comparable editing efficiency with higher specificity to AsCas12a and LbCas12a in mammalian cells at multiple target sites. Based on the compact enEbCas12a, an all-in-one AAV delivery system with crRNA for Cas12a was developed for both in vitro and in vivo applications. Overall, the novel smallest high-fidelity enEbCas12a, this first case of the all-in-one AAV delivery for Cas12a could greatly boost future gene therapy and scientific research.

                <p>by Marlen C. Rice, Andrew J. Janik, Nels C. Elde, James A. Gagnon, Keir M. Balla</p>

Zebrafish are popular research organisms selected for laboratory use due in part to widespread availability from the pet trade. Many contemporary colonies of laboratory zebrafish are maintained in aquaculture facilities that monitor and aim to curb infections that can negatively affect colony health and confound experiments. The impact of laboratory control on the microbial constituents associated with zebrafish in research environments compared to the pet trade are unclear. Diseases of unknown causes are common in both environments. We conducted a metatranscriptomic survey to broadly compare the zebrafish-associated microbes in pet trade and laboratory environments. We detected many microbes in animals from the pet trade that were not found in laboratory animals. Cohousing experiments revealed several transmissible microbes including a newly described non-enveloped, double-stranded RNA virus in the Birnaviridae family we name Rocky Mountain birnavirus (RMBV). Infections were detected in asymptomatic animals from the pet trade, but when transmitted to laboratory animals RMBV was associated with pronounced antiviral responses and hemorrhagic disease. These experiments highlight the pet trade as a distinct source of diverse microbes that associate with zebrafish and establish a paradigm for the discovery of newly described pathogenic viruses and other infectious microbes that can be developed for study in the laboratory.

                Background Copper (Cu), nickel (Ni), chromium (Cr) ion release, and surface topography change from the orthodontic wire are the initial processes of corrosion that may affect the mechanical properties of the archwire. In this study, we aim to evaluate the effect of CHX, NaF, and chitosan on the corrosion of CuNiTi wire nickel and copper ions released, surface roughness change, and archwire deflection. Methods Ninety samples of CuNiTi Tanzo™ archwires were divided into five groups according to their immersion solution: Artificial Saliva, CHX, NaF, CHX-NaF, and chitosan group. Each group was further divided into three subgroups (n=6) corresponding immersion time, i.e., two, four, and six weeks. The corrosion of the samples was analyzed with an atomic absorption spectrophotometer (AAS), scanning electron microscope (SEM), and universal testing machine (UTM). Results The amount of nickel ion releases was increasing, but the copper ion releases were reduced by the time of observations. The highest nickel ion was released in the CHX-NaF group and the lowest in the chitosan group for six-week immersion. It also corresponded to the surface topography by SEM analysis which showed the most extended cracks and deep pits in the CHX-NaF group and a smoother surface in the chitosan group. Copper ion release showed the highest ion release in the NaF group and the lowest release in the chitosan group. The unloading force of CuNiTi archwire deflection remains the same at week two and week four for all mouthwashes. Conclusion The use of mouthwashes that contained CHX, NaF, and chitosan could further alter the passive layer and cause higher nickel and copper ion release and increased CuNiTi archwire surface structure porosity. But there is no distinction between mouthwashes to release the unloading force within two until four weeks.

                Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are well-recognised antidiabetic medications among clinicians due to its highly protective effects on cardiovascular and renal systems on diabetic patients. However, one of its uncommonly reported side effects is the development of euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (EuDKA) which is characterized by mild hyperglycemia, ketosis and acidosis. Chest pain as a clinical presentation of EuDKA has been rarely reported in the literature. We present a case of a 46-year-old female with a past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), hypertension, and hypertriglyceridemia presented to the hospital with central chest pain that radiates to the back and is associated with mild shortness of breath and one bout of vomiting. She had been taking dapagliflozin, an SGLT2 inhibitor, for four years. She was found to have a blood glucose level of 7 mmol\L, high anion gap metabolic acidosis and ketonuria. Toxicology screening was unremarkable. She was diagnosed as a case of SGLT2-induced EuDKA and was treated with fluid, insulin and potassium chloride (KCL). Her hospital course went smoothly. Dapagloflzi was discontinued, and she was discharged home on oral metformin and subcutaneous insulin. This study highlights the rare occurance of chest pain as a presentation of EuDKA, an uncommon side effect of the widely used SGLT2 inhibitors. Chest pain in patients using SGLT2 Inhibitors should raise the clinician’s suspicion for possible EuDKA.

                Chronic respiratory diseases often necessitate lung transplantation due to irreversible damage. Organ engineering offers hope through stem cell-based organ generation. However, the crucial sterilization step in scaffold preparation poses challenges. This study conducted a systematic review of studies that analysed the extracellular matrix (ECM) conditions of decellularised lungs subjected to different sterilisation processes. A search was performed for articles published in the PubMed, Web of Sciences, Scopus, and SciELO databases according to the PRISMA guidelines. Overall, five articles that presented positive results regarding the effectiveness of the sterilisation process were selected, some of which identified functional damage in the ECM. Was possible concluded that regardless of the type of agent used, physical or chemical, all of them demonstrated that sterilisation somehow harms the ECM.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-553/v1?src=rss">The first complete mitochondrional genome of Anopheles gibbinsi using a skimming sequencing approach. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Mosquitoes belonging to the genus Anopheles are the only vectors of human malaria. Anopheles gibbinsi has been linked to malaria transmission in Kenya, with recent collections in Zambia reporting the mosquito species exhibiting zoophilic and exophilic behavioral patterns with occasional contact with humans. Given the paucity of genetic data, and challenges to identification and molecular taxonomy of the mosquitoes belonging to the Anopheles genus; we report the first complete mitochondrial genome of An. gibbinsi using a genome skimming approach. An Illumina Novaseq 6000 platform was used for sequencing, the length of the mitochondrial genome was 15401 bp, with 78.5% AT content comprised of 37 genes. Phylogenetic analysis by maximum likelihood using concatenation of the 13 protein coding genes demonstrated that An. marshallii was the closest relative based on existing sequence data. This study demonstrates that the skimming approach is an inexpensive and efficient approach for mosquito species identification and concurrent taxonomic rectification, which may be a useful alternative for generating reference sequence data for evolutionary studies among the Culicidae.

     alt="Thalamic activity-dependent specification of sensory input neurons in the developing chick entopallium"/>
<p>In the developing chick pallium, input neurons located in the entopallium (top, green region) are born from lateral and ventral pallial (LP and VP) precursors (bottom left, blue). LP- and VP-derived neurons then receive thalamic axons around E10 and are specified into input neurons by receiving neuronal activity from thalamic axon within the entopallium E11 onward (bottom right, green cells)

<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>During development, cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic factors play important roles in neuronal differentiation; however, the underlying mechanisms in nonmammalian species remain largely unknown. We here investigated the mechanisms responsible for the differentiation of sensory input neurons in the chick entopallium, which receives its primary visual input via the tectofugal pathway from the nucleus rotundus. The results obtained revealed that input neurons in the entopallium expressed Potassium Voltage-Gated Channel Subfamily H Member 5 (KCNH5/EAG2) mRNA from embryonic day (E) 11. On the other hand, the onset of protein expression was E20, which was 1 day before hatching. We confirm that entopallium input neurons in chicks were generated during early neurogenesis in the lateral and ventral ventricular zones. Notably, neurons derived from the lateral (LP) and ventral pallium (VP) exhibited a spatially distinct distribution along the rostro–caudal axis. We further demonstrated that the expression of EAG2 was directly regulated by input activity from thalamic axons. Collectively, the present results reveal that thalamic input activity is essential for specifying input neurons among LP- and VP-derived early-generated neurons in the developing chick entopallium.</p>

                The Neuroscientist, Ahead of Print. <br/>Pioneering investigations in the mid-19th century revealed that the perception of tactile cues presented to the surface of the skin improves with training, which is referred to as tactile learning. Surprisingly, tactile learning also occurs for body parts and skin locations that are not physically involved in the training. For example, after training of a finger, tactile learning transfers to adjacent untrained fingers. This suggests that the transfer of tactile learning follows a somatotopic pattern and involves brain regions such as the primary somatosensory cortex (S1), in which the trained and untrained body parts and skin locations are represented close to each other. However, other results showed that transfer occurs between body parts that are not represented close to each other in S1—for example, between the hand and the foot. These and similar findings have led to the suggestion of additional cortical mechanisms to explain the transfer of tactile learning. Here, different mechanisms are reviewed, and the extent to which they can explain the transfer of tactile learning is discussed. What all of these mechanisms have in common is that they assume a representational or functional relationship between the trained and untrained body parts and skin locations. However, none of these mechanisms alone can explain the complex pattern of transfer results, and it is likely that different mechanisms interact to enable transfer, perhaps in concert with higher somatosensory and decision-making areas.

Miq as a potential antiviral agent for Newcastle disease [version 6; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Recent evidence suggests that some flavonoid compounds obtained from crude methanol extract of mistletoe leaves (Dendrophthoe pentandra L. Miq), also known as Benalu Duku (BD), have antimicrobial effects. Thus, the plant has the potential to eliminate viruses that may cause outbreaks in chicken farms. This study aimed to prove the in vitro ability of flavonoid compounds, namely quercetin-like compounds (QLCs), to eliminate field viruses, specifically the Newcastle disease virus (NDV). Methods This research was performed in two stages. An in vitro test was used with a post-test of the control groups designed at a significance of 0.05. BD leaves (5 kg) were extracted using a maceration method with methanol and then separated into hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, and methanol fractions. The final extracted products were separated using semi-preparative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to obtain QLCs. The QLCs were identified and compared with quercetin using HPLC, proton and carbon nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry, Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometry and ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The activity of QLCs was tested in vitro against the NDV at a virulence titter of 10−5 Tissue Culture Infectious Dose 50% (TCID50) in chicken kidney cell culture. Results Solutions of 0.05% (w/v) QLCs were discovered to have antiviral activity against NDVs, with an average cytopathogenic effect antigenicity at a 10−5 dilution (p<0.05). Conclusions QLCs from flavonoids from the leaves of BD have in vitro antiviral bioactivity against NDV at a virulence titter of 10-5 Tissue Culture Infectious Dose 50% (TCID50) in chicken kidney cell culture. QLCs may have the potential to be developed as medicinal compounds for the treatment of other human or animal viral infections.

                Background Surgical site infection (SSI), albeit infrequent, drastically impacts the quality of care. This article endeavors to investigate the predictive factors of SSIs following surgical interventions that involve the gastrointestinal (GI) tract within a single institution in a resource-limited setting. Methods Over seven years from June 2015 to June 2022, patients who underwent GI surgery and developed SSI were retrospectively matched with an unaffected case-control cohort of patients. Standardized techniques for wound culture, laboratory evaluation of bacterial isolates, and antibiotic susceptibility tests were employed. Logistic regression analysis was utilized to investigate the predictive factors associated with 30-day postoperative SSI occurrence. Results A total of 525 patients who underwent GI surgical procedures were included, among whom, 86 (16.4%) developed SSI and the majority of SSIs were superficial (74.4%). Escherichia coli was the most commonly isolated bacterium (54.4%), and a high percentage of multidrug-resistant organisms were observed (63.8%). In multivariate Cox regression analysis, illiteracy (Odds ratio [OR]:40.31; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 9.54-170.26), smoking (OR: 21.15; 95% CI: 4.63-96.67), diabetes (OR: 5.07; 95% CI: 2.27-11.35), leukocytosis (OR: 2.62; 95% CI: 1.24-5.53), hypoalbuminemia (OR: 3.70; 95% CI: 1.35-10.16), contaminated and dirty wounds (OR: 6.51; 95% CI:1.62-26.09), longer operation duration (OR: 1.02; 95% CI: 1.01-1.03), emergency operations (OR: 12.58; 95% CI: 2.91-54.30), and extending antibiotic prophylaxis duration (OR: 3.01; 95% CI: 1.28-7.10) were the independent risk factors for SSI (all p < 0.05). Conclusions This study highlights significant predictors of SSI, including illiteracy, smoking, diabetes, leukocytosis, hypoalbuminemia, contaminated and dirty wounds, longer operative time, emergency operations, and extending antibiotic prophylaxis duration. Identifying these risk factors can help surgeons adopt appropriate measures to reduce postoperative SSI and improve the quality of surgical care, especially in a resource-limited setting with no obvious and strict policy for reducing SSI.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The plains vizcacha, <i>Lagostomus maximus</i>, is a precocial hystricomorph rodent with a gyrencephalic brain. This work aimed to perform a time-lapse analysis of the embryonic brain cortical development in the plains vizcacha to establish a species-specific temporal window for corticogenesis and the gyrencephaly onset. Additionally, a comparative examination with evolutionarily related rodents was conducted. Embryos from 40 embryonic days (ED) until the end of pregnancy (∼$\sim $154 ED) were evaluated. The neuroanatomical examination determined transverse sulci at 80 ED and rostral lateral and caudal intraparietal sulci around 95 ED. Histological examination of corticogenesis showed emergence of the subplate at 43 ED and expansion of the subventricular zone (SVZ) and its division into inner and outer SVZs around 54 ED. The neocortical layers formation followed an inside-to-outside spatiotemporal gradient beginning with the emergence of layers VI and V at 68 ED and establishing the final six neocortical layers around 100 ED. A progressive increment of gyrencephalization index (GI) from 1.005 ± 0.003 around 70 ED, which reflects a smooth cortex, up to 1.07 ± 0.009 at the end of gestation, reflecting a gyrencephalic neuroanatomy, was determined. Contrarily, the minimum cortical thickness (MCT) progressively decreased from 61 ED up to the end of gestation. These results show that the decrease in the cortical thickness, which enables the onset of neocortical invaginations, occurs together with the expansion and subdivision of the SVZ. The temporal comparison of corticogenesis in plains vizcacha with that in relative species reflects a prenatal long process compared with other rodents that may give an evolutionary advantage to <i>L. maximus</i> as a precocial species.</p>
