              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06499">Network-Specific Models for Multimodal Brain Response Prediction</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.06499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a network-specific approach for predicting brain responses to complex multimodal movies, leveraging the Yeo 7-network parcellation of the Schaefer atlas. Rather than treating the brain as a homogeneous system, we grouped the seven functional networks into four clusters and trained separate multi-subject, multi-layer perceptron (MLP) models for each. This architecture supports cluster-specific optimization and adaptive memory modeling, allowing each model to adjust temporal dynamics and modality weighting based on the functional role of its target network. Our results demonstrate that this clustered strategy significantly enhances prediction accuracy across the 1,000 cortical regions of the Schaefer atlas. The final model achieved an eighth-place ranking in the Algonauts Project 2025 Challenge, with out-of-distribution (OOD) correlation scores nearly double those of the baseline model used in the selection phase. Code is available at https://github.com/Corsi01/algo2025.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06503">Understanding Human Limits in Pattern Recognition: A Computational Model of Sequential Reasoning in Rock, Paper, Scissors</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.06503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How do we predict others from patterns in their behavior and what are the computational constraints that limit this ability? We investigate these questions by modeling human behavior over repeated games of rock, paper, scissors from Brockbank & Vul (2024). Against algorithmic opponents that varied in strategic sophistication, people readily exploit simple transition patterns (e.g., consistently playing rock after paper) but struggle to detect more complex sequential dependencies. To understand the cognitive mechanisms underlying these abilities and their limitations, we deploy Hypothetical Minds (HM), a large language model-based agent that generates and tests hypotheses about opponent strategies, as a cognitive model of this behavior (Cross et al., 2024). We show that when applied to the same experimental conditions, HM closely mirrors human performance patterns, succeeding and failing in similar ways. To better understand the source of HM's failures and whether people might face similar cognitive bottlenecks in this context, we performed a series of ablations and augmentations targeting different components of the system. When provided with natural language descriptions of the opponents' strategies, HM successfully exploited 6/7 bot opponents with win rates >80% suggesting that accurate hypothesis generation is the primary cognitive bottleneck in this task. Further, by systematically manipulating the model's hypotheses through pedagogically-inspired interventions, we find that the model substantially updates its causal understanding of opponent behavior, revealing how model-based analyses can produce testable hypotheses about human cognition.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06514">Synthetic Data Generation for Classifying Electrophysiological and Morpho-Electrophysiological Neurons from Mouse Visual Cortex</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.06514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accurate classification of neuronal cell types is central to decoding brain function, yet remains hindered by data scarcity and cellular heterogeneity. Here, we benchmarked classical and deep generative synthetic data augmentation strategies -- including SMOTE, GANs, VAEs, Normalizing Flows, and DDPMs -- for supervised classification of both electrophysiological (e-type) and morpho-electrophysiological (mee-type) neuron types from the mouse visual cortex. Using a curated dataset annotated with 48 electrophysiological and 24 morphological features, we established baseline classifiers and introduced synthetic data generated by each method. Our results demonstrate that SMOTE-based augmentation yields the highest classification accuracies (absolute gains of 0.16 for e-types, 0.12 for mee-types), outperforming deep generative models. GANs approached similar performance when hyperparameters and sample sizes were optimized, but were more sensitive to model specification. In addition, we benchmarked synthetic neuron fidelity by comparing mean absolute errors between synthetic and real class profiles against the natural phenotypic variability observed between real neuronal classes.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07115">Sensory robustness through top-down feedback and neural stochasticity in recurrent vision models</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.07115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological systems leverage top-down feedback for visual processing, yet most artificial vision models succeed in image classification using purely feedforward or recurrent architectures, calling into question the functional significance of descending cortical pathways. Here, we trained convolutional recurrent neural networks (ConvRNN) on image classification in the presence or absence of top-down feedback projections to elucidate the specific computational contributions of those feedback pathways. We found that ConvRNNs with top-down feedback exhibited remarkable speed-accuracy trade-off and robustness to noise perturbations and adversarial attacks, but only when they were trained with stochastic neural variability, simulated by randomly silencing single units via dropout. By performing detailed analyses to identify the reasons for such benefits, we observed that feedback information substantially shaped the representational geometry of the post-integration layer, combining the bottom-up and top-down streams, and this effect was amplified by dropout. Moreover, feedback signals coupled with dropout optimally constrained network activity onto a low-dimensional manifold and encoded object information more efficiently in out-of-distribution regimes, with top-down information stabilizing the representational dynamics at the population level. Together, these findings uncover a dual mechanism for resilient sensory coding. On the one hand, neural stochasticity prevents unit-level co-adaptation albeit at the cost of more chaotic dynamics. On the other hand, top-down feedback harnesses high-level information to stabilize network activity on compact low-dimensional manifolds.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07471">Modeling bias in decision-making attractor networks</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.07471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attractor neural network models of cortical decision-making circuits represent them as dynamical systems in the state space of neural firing rates with the attractors of the network encoding possible decisions. While the attractors of these models are well studied, far less attention is paid to the basins of attraction even though their sizes can be said to encode the biases towards the corresponding decisions. The parameters of an attractor network control both the attractors and the basins of attraction. However, findings in behavioral economics suggest that the framing of a decision-making task can affect preferences even when the same choices are being offered. This suggests that the circuit encodes both choices and biases separately, that preferences can be changed without disrupting the encoding of the choices themselves. In the context of attractor networks, this would mean that the parameters can be adjusted to reshape the basins of attraction without changing the attractors themselves. How can this be realized and how do the parameters shape decision-making biases?
  In this PhD thesis we study this question mathematically in the context of threshold linear networks, a common firing rate model used in computational neuroscience. (Note: This is an abbreviated abstract. Please see the document for the full abstract.)

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07253">PySeizure: A single machine learning classifier framework to detect seizures in diverse datasets</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2508.07253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliable seizure detection is critical for diagnosing and managing epilepsy, yet clinical workflows remain dependent on time-consuming manual EEG interpretation. While machine learning has shown promise, existing approaches often rely on dataset-specific optimisations, limiting their real-world applicability and reproducibility. Here, we introduce an innovative, open-source machine-learning framework that enables robust and generalisable seizure detection across varied clinical datasets. We evaluate our approach on two publicly available EEG datasets that differ in patient populations and electrode configurations. To enhance robustness, the framework incorporates an automated pre-processing pipeline to standardise data and a majority voting mechanism, in which multiple models independently assess each second of EEG before reaching a final decision. We train, tune, and evaluate models within each dataset, assessing their cross-dataset transferability. Our models achieve high within-dataset performance (AUC 0.904+/-0.059 for CHB-MIT and 0.864+/-0.060 for TUSZ) and demonstrate strong generalisation across datasets despite differences in EEG setups and populations (AUC 0.615+/-0.039 for models trained on CHB-MIT and tested on TUSZ and 0.762+/-0.175 in the reverse case) without any post-processing. Furthermore, a mild post-processing improved the within-dataset results to 0.913+/-0.064 and 0.867+/-0.058 and cross-dataset results to 0.619+/-0.036 and 0.768+/-0.172. These results underscore the potential of, and essential considerations for, deploying our framework in diverse clinical settings. By making our methodology fully reproducible, we provide a foundation for advancing clinically viable, dataset-agnostic seizure detection systems. This approach has the potential for widespread adoption, complementing rather than replacing expert interpretation, and accelerating clinical integration.

                arXiv:2508.07283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the intersection of electroencephalography (EEG) microstates and Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance the assessment of cognitive load states. By utilizing EEG microstate features, the research aims to fine-tune LLMs for improved predictions of distinct cognitive states, specifically 'Rest' and 'Load'. The experimental design is delineated in four comprehensive stages: dataset collection and preprocessing, microstate segmentation and EEG backfitting, feature extraction paired with prompt engineering, and meticulous LLM model selection and refinement. Employing a supervised learning paradigm, the LLM is trained to identify cognitive load states based on EEG microstate features integrated into prompts, producing accurate discrimination of cognitive load. A curated dataset, linking EEG features to specified cognitive load conditions, underpins the experimental framework. The results indicate a significant improvement in model performance following the proposed fine-tuning, showcasing the potential of EEG-informed LLMs in cognitive neuroscience and cognitive AI applications. This approach not only contributes to the understanding of brain dynamics but also paves the way for advancements in machine learning techniques applicable to cognitive load and cognitive AI research.

Abstract: Attention is fundamental to cognition, yet it remains a challenge to understand attention in tasks approaching real-world complexity. Here, we approached this problem by modeling gaze patterns of monkeys playing Pac-Man. We first show a transformer network trained to reproduce their gameplay developed internal attention patterns closely matching the monkeys' eye movements. By dissecting the network's attention, we revealed a hierarchical structure comprising two components: a value-based layer encoding fixed object salience, coupled with a dynamic interaction layer tracking relational information between game elements. We further developed a condensed model in which reward-driven attention serves as a gain modulator and is integrated with spatial attention maps, predicting attention as well as the transformer. Together, our study pioneers the use of AI architectures as analytical tools and bridges mechanistic interpretability with cognitive neuroscience to yield novel, testable insights into how the brain coordinates reward, spatial cognition, and attention in complex environments.

                arXiv:2406.14801v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural manifolds are an attractive theoretical framework for characterizing the complex behaviors of neural populations. However, many of the tools for identifying these low-dimensional subspaces are correlational and provide limited insight into the underlying dynamics. The ability to precisely control the latent activity of a circuit would allow researchers to investigate the structure and function of neural manifolds. We simulate controlling the latent dynamics of a neural population using closed-loop, dynamically generated sensory inputs. Using a spiking neural network (SNN) as a model of a neural circuit, we find low-dimensional representations of both the network activity (the neural manifold) and a set of salient visual stimuli. The fields of classical and optimal control offer a range of methods to choose from for controlling dynamics on the neural manifold, which differ in performance, computational cost, and ease of implementation. Here, we focus on two commonly used control methods: proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control and model predictive control (MPC). PID is a computationally lightweight controller that is simple to implement. In contrast, MPC is a model-based, anticipatory controller with a much higher computational cost and engineering overhead. We evaluate both methods on trajectory-following tasks in latent space, under partial observability and in the presence of unknown noise. While both controllers in some cases were able to successfully control the latent dynamics on the neural manifold, MPC consistently produced more accurate control and required less hyperparameter tuning. These results demonstrate how MPC can be applied on the neural manifold using data-driven dynamics models, and provide a framework to experimentally test for causal relationships between manifold dynamics and external stimuli.

Abstract: How can we make sense of large-scale recordings of neural activity across learning? Theories of neural network learning with their origins in statistical physics offer a potential answer: for a given task, there are often a small set of summary statistics that are sufficient to predict performance as the network learns. Here, we review recent advances in how summary statistics can be used to build theoretical understanding of neural network learning. We then argue for how this perspective can inform the analysis of neural data, enabling better understanding of learning in biological and artificial neural networks.

                arXiv:2506.05794v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a continuous, information-theoretic extension of the Free Energy Principle through the concept of Markov blanket density, i.e., a scalar field that quantifies the degree of conditional independence between internal and external states at each point in space (ranging from 0 for full coupling to 1 for full separation). It demonstrates that active inference dynamics, including the minimization of variational and expected free energy, naturally emerge from spatial gradients in this density, making Markov blanket density a necessary foundation for the Free Energy Principle. These ideas are developed through a mathematically framework that links density gradients to precise and testable dynamics, offering a foundation for novel predictions and simulation paradigms.

Abstract: The human brain represents the only known example of general intelligence that naturally aligns with human values. On a mere 20-watt power budget, the brain achieves robust learning and adaptive decision-making in ways that continue to elude advanced AI systems. Inspired by the brain, we present a computational architecture based on canonical microcircuits (CMCs) - stereotyped patterns of neurons found ubiquitously throughout the cortex. We implement these circuits as neural ODEs comprising spiny stellate, inhibitory, and pyramidal neurons, forming an 8-dimensional dynamical system with biologically plausible recurrent connections. Our experiments show that even a single CMC node achieves 97.8 percent accuracy on MNIST, while hierarchical configurations - with learnable inter-regional connectivity and recurrent connections - yield improved performance on more complex image benchmarks. Notably, our approach achieves competitive results using substantially fewer parameters than conventional deep learning models. Phase space analysis revealed distinct dynamical trajectories for different input classes, highlighting interpretable, emergent behaviors observed in biological systems. These findings suggest that neuromorphic computing approaches can improve both efficiency and interpretability in artificial neural networks, offering new directions for parameter-efficient architectures grounded in the computational principles of the human brain.

                arXiv:2508.06817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of dynamic functional connectomes has provided valuable insights into how patterns of brain activity change over time. Neural networks process information through artificial neurons, conceptually inspired by patterns of activation in the brain. However, their hierarchical structure and high-dimensional parameter space pose challenges for understanding and controlling training dynamics. In this study, we introduce a novel approach to characterize training dynamics in neural networks by representing evolving neural activations as functional connectomes and extracting dynamic signatures of activity throughout training. Our results show that these signatures effectively capture key transitions in the functional organization of the network. Building on this analysis, we propose the use of a time series of functional connectomes as an intrinsic indicator of learning progress, enabling a principled early stopping criterion. Our framework performs robustly across benchmarks and provides new insights into neural network training dynamics.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20484">"What" x "When" working memory representations using Laplace Neural Manifolds</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2409.20484v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Working memory - the ability to remember recent events as they recede continuously into the past - requires the ability to represent any stimulus at any time delay. This property requires neurons coding working memory to show mixed selectivity, with conjunctive receptive fields (RFs) for stimuli and time, forming a representation of 'what' x 'when'. We study the properties of such a working memory in simple experiments where a single stimulus must be remembered for a short time. The requirement of conjunctive receptive fields allows the covariance matrix of the network to decouple neatly, allowing an understanding of the low-dimensional dynamics of the population. Different choices of temporal basis functions lead to qualitatively different dynamics. We study a specific choice - a Laplace space with exponential basis functions for time coupled to an "Inverse Laplace" space with circumscribed basis functions in time. We refer to this choice with basis functions that evenly tile log time as a Laplace Neural Manifold. Despite the fact that they are related to one another by a linear projection, the Laplace population shows a stable stimulus-specific subspace whereas the Inverse Laplace population shows rotational dynamics. The growth of the rank of the covariance matrix with time depends on the density of the temporal basis set; logarithmic tiling shows good agreement with data. We sketch a continuous attractor CANN that constructs a Laplace Neural Manifold. The attractor in the Laplace space appears as an edge; the attractor for the inverse space appears as a bump. This work provides a map for going from more abstract cognitive models of WM to circuit-level implementation using continuous attractor neural networks, and places constraints on the types of neural dynamics that support working memory.

                arXiv:2504.06354v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Both biological cortico-thalamic networks and artificial transformer networks use canonical computations to perform a wide range of cognitive tasks. In this work, we propose that the structure of cortico-thalamic circuits is well suited to realize a computation analogous to multihead self-attention, the main algorithmic innovation of transformer networks. We assign distinct computational roles to superficial and deep pyramidal cells of the cortex: while superficial pyramidal cells maintain a key-value memory, deep pyramidal cells encode the current query, gain-modulated by the key-value memory in the superficial layer. We show that the structure of this computation matches the fine-grained structure of core and matrix projections from the thalamus to the cortex. We then suggest the parallel between one head of attention and a cortical area, and propose that a thalamo-cortico-thalamic pathway implements a computation akin to a multihead, unnormalized, linear self-attention block. Cross-attention corresponds to the key-value memory of one cortical area being used for retrieval by the query in another cortical area. Finally, as a first step towards a mechanistic theory of synaptic learning of cortical transformers, we derive the formal gradients of a typical loss function with respect to the parameters of such computation.

                arXiv:2508.06730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dependence of the Valid Prediction Time (VPT) of Reservoir Computers (RCs) on hyperparameters including the regularization coefficient, reservoir size, and spectral radius. Under carefully chosen conditions, the RC can achieve approximately 70% of a benchmark performance, based on the output of a single prediction step used as initial conditions for the Lorenz equations. We report high VPT values (>30 Lyapunov times), as we are predicting a noiseless system where overfitting can be beneficial. While these conditions may not hold for noisy systems, they could still be useful for real-world applications with limited noise. Furthermore, utilizing knowledge of the Lyapunov exponent, we find that the VPT can be predicted by the error in the first few prediction steps, offering a computationally efficient evaluation method. We emphasize the importance of the numerical solver used to generate the Lorenz dataset and define a Valid Ground Truth Time (VGTT), during which the outputs of several common solvers agree. A VPT exceeding the VGTT is not meaningful, as a different solver could produce a different result. Lastly, we identify two spectral radius regimes that achieve large VPT: a small radius near zero, resulting in simple but stable operation, and a larger radius operating at the "edge of chaos."

                arXiv:2508.06793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in modeling graph-structured data, while Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer high energy efficiency through sparse, event-driven computation. However, existing spiking GNNs predominantly operate in Euclidean space and rely on fixed geometric assumptions, limiting their capacity to model complex graph structures such as hierarchies and cycles. To overcome these limitations, we propose \method{}, a novel Geometry-Aware Spiking Graph Neural Network that unifies spike-based neural dynamics with adaptive representation learning on Riemannian manifolds. \method{} features three key components: a Riemannian Embedding Layer that projects node features into a pool of constant-curvature manifolds, capturing non-Euclidean structures; a Manifold Spiking Layer that models membrane potential evolution and spiking behavior in curved spaces via geometry-consistent neighbor aggregation and curvature-based attention; and a Manifold Learning Objective that enables instance-wise geometry adaptation through jointly optimized classification and link prediction losses defined over geodesic distances. All modules are trained using Riemannian SGD, eliminating the need for backpropagation through time. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that GSG achieves superior accuracy, robustness, and energy efficiency compared to both Euclidean SNNs and manifold-based GNNs, establishing a new paradigm for curvature-aware, energy-efficient graph learning.

                arXiv:2508.06841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate parameter identification in photovoltaic (PV) models is crucial for performance evaluation but remains challenging due to their nonlinear, multimodal, and high-dimensional nature. Although the Dung Beetle Optimization (DBO) algorithm has shown potential in addressing such problems, it often suffers from premature convergence. To overcome these issues, this paper proposes a Memory Enhanced Fractional-Order Dung Beetle Optimization (MFO-DBO) algorithm that integrates three coordinated strategies. Firstly, fractional-order (FO) calculus introduces memory into the search process, enhancing convergence stability and solution quality. Secondly, a fractional-order logistic chaotic map improves population diversity during initialization. Thirdly, a chaotic perturbation mechanism helps elite solutions escape local optima. Numerical results on the CEC2017 benchmark suite and the PV parameter identification problem demonstrate that MFO-DBO consistently outperforms advanced DBO variants, CEC competition winners, FO-based optimizers, enhanced classical algorithms, and recent metaheuristics in terms of accuracy, robustness, convergence speed, while also maintaining an excellent balance between exploration and exploitation compared to the standard DBO algorithm.

                arXiv:2508.07077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) are essential for solving complex optimization problems, such as the diet problem, where balancing conflicting objectives, like cost and nutritional content, is crucial. However, most MOEAs focus on optimizing solutions in the objective space, often neglecting the diversity of solutions in the decision space, which is critical for providing decision-makers with a wide range of choices. This paper introduces an approach that directly integrates a Hamming distance-based measure of uniformity into the selection mechanism of a MOEA to enhance decision space diversity. Experiments on a multi-objective formulation of the diet problem demonstrate that our approach significantly improves decision space diversity compared to NSGA-II, while maintaining comparable objective space performance. The proposed method offers a generalizable strategy for integrating decision space awareness into MOEAs.

Abstract: We present Evo-Sparrow, a deep learning-based agent for AI decision-making in Sparrow Mahjong, trained by optimizing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks using Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES). Our model evaluates board states and optimizes decision policies in a non-deterministic, partially observable game environment. Empirical analysis conducted over a significant number of simulations demonstrates that our model outperforms both random and rule-based agents, and achieves performance comparable to a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) baseline, indicating strong strategic play and robust policy quality. By combining deep learning with evolutionary optimization, our approach provides a computationally effective alternative to traditional reinforcement learning and gradient-based optimization methods. This research contributes to the broader field of AI game playing, demonstrating the viability of hybrid learning strategies for complex stochastic games. These findings also offer potential applications in adaptive decision-making and strategic AI development beyond Sparrow Mahjong.

                arXiv:2508.07691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving complex real problems often demands advanced algorithms, and then continuous improvements in the internal operations of a search technique are needed. Hybrid algorithms, parallel techniques, theoretical advances, and much more are needed to transform a general search algorithm into an efficient, useful one in practice. In this paper, we study how surrogates are helping metaheuristics from an important and understudied point of view: their energy profile. Even if surrogates are a great idea for substituting a time-demanding complex fitness function, the energy profile, general efficiency, and accuracy of the resulting surrogate-assisted metaheuristic still need considerable research. In this work, we make a first step in analyzing particle swarm optimization in different versions (including pre-trained and retrained neural networks as surrogates) for its energy profile (for both processor and memory), plus a further study on the surrogate accuracy to properly drive the search towards an acceptable solution. Our conclusions shed new light on this topic and could be understood as the first step towards a methodology for assessing surrogate-assisted algorithms not only accounting for time or numerical efficiency but also for energy and surrogate accuracy for a better, more holistic characterization of optimization and learning techniques.

                arXiv:2508.08091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developmental Graph Cellular Automata (DGCA) are a novel model for morphogenesis, capable of growing directed graphs from single-node seeds. In this paper, we show that DGCAs can be trained to grow reservoirs. Reservoirs are grown with two types of targets: task-driven (using the NARMA family of tasks) and task-independent (using reservoir metrics).
  Results show that DGCAs are able to grow into a variety of specialized, life-like structures capable of effectively solving benchmark tasks, statistically outperforming `typical' reservoirs on the same task. Overall, these lay the foundation for the development of DGCA systems that produce plastic reservoirs and for modeling functional, adaptive morphogenesis.

Abstract: Neurosymbolic AI combines neural network adaptability with symbolic reasoning, promising an approach to address the complex regulatory, operational, and safety challenges in Advanced Air Mobility (AAM). This survey reviews its applications across key AAM domains such as demand forecasting, aircraft design, and real-time air traffic management. Our analysis reveals a fragmented research landscape where methodologies, including Neurosymbolic Reinforcement Learning, have shown potential for dynamic optimization but still face hurdles in scalability, robustness, and compliance with aviation standards. We classify current advancements, present relevant case studies, and outline future research directions aimed at integrating these approaches into reliable, transparent AAM systems. By linking advanced AI techniques with AAM's operational demands, this work provides a concise roadmap for researchers and practitioners developing next-generation air mobility solutions.

                arXiv:2508.08080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symbolic Regression (SR) is a well-established framework for generating interpretable or white-box predictive models. Although SR has been successfully applied to create interpretable estimates of the average of the outcome, it is currently not well understood how it can be used to estimate the relationship between variables at other points in the distribution of the target variable. Such estimates of e.g. the median or an extreme value provide a fuller picture of how predictive variables affect the outcome and are necessary in high-stakes, safety-critical application domains. This study introduces Symbolic Quantile Regression (SQR), an approach to predict conditional quantiles with SR. In an extensive evaluation, we find that SQR outperforms transparent models and performs comparably to a strong black-box baseline without compromising transparency. We also show how SQR can be used to explain differences in the target distribution by comparing models that predict extreme and central outcomes in an airline fuel usage case study. We conclude that SQR is suitable for predicting conditional quantiles and understanding interesting feature influences at varying quantiles.

Abstract: We introduce liquid-resistance liquid-capacitance neural networks (LRCs), a neural-ODE model which considerably improve the generalization, accuracy, and biological plausibility of electrical equivalent circuits (EECs), liquid time-constant networks (LTCs), and saturated liquid time-constant networks (STCs), respectively. We also introduce LRC units (LRCUs), as a very efficient and accurate gated RNN-model, which results from solving LRCs with an explicit Euler scheme using just one unfolding. We empirically show and formally prove that the liquid capacitance of LRCs considerably dampens the oscillations of LTCs and STCs, while at the same time dramatically increasing accuracy even for cheap solvers. We experimentally demonstrate that LRCs are a highly competitive alternative to popular neural ODEs and gated RNNs in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and interpretability, on classic time-series benchmarks and a complex autonomous-driving lane-keeping task.

                arXiv:2505.01323v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Together with the NSGA-II and SMS-EMOA, the strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm 2 (SPEA2) is one of the most prominent dominance-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs). Different from the NSGA-II, it does not employ the crowding distance (essentially the distance to neighboring solutions) to compare pairwise non-dominating solutions but a complex system of $\sigma$-distances that builds on the distances to all other solutions. In this work, we give a first mathematical proof showing that this more complex system of distances can be superior. More specifically, we prove that a simple steady-state SPEA2 can compute optimal approximations of the Pareto front of the OneMinMax benchmark in polynomial time. The best proven guarantee for a comparable variant of the NSGA-II only assures approximation ratios of roughly a factor of two, and both mathematical analyses and experiments indicate that optimal approximations are not found efficiently.

                arXiv:2505.06850v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph-structured combinatorial problems in complex networks are prevalent in many domains, and are computationally demanding due to their complexity and non-linear nature. Traditional evolutionary algorithms (EAs), while robust, often face obstacles due to content-shallow encoding limitations and lack of structural awareness, necessitating hand-crafted modifications for effective application. In this work, we introduce an original framework, visual evolutionary ptimization (VEO), leveraging multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as the backbone evolutionary optimizer in this context. Specifically, we propose a context-aware encoding way, representing the solution of the network as an image. In this manner, we can utilize MLLMs' image processing capabilities to intuitively comprehend network configurations, thus enabling machines to solve these problems in a human-like way. We have developed MLLM-based operators tailored for various evolutionary optimization stages, including initialization, crossover, and mutation. Furthermore, we propose that graph sparsification can effectively enhance the applicability and scalability of VEO on large-scale networks, owing to the scale-free nature of real-world networks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using a well-known task in complex networks, influence maximization, and validate it on eight different real-world networks of various structures. The results have confirmed VEO's reliability and enhanced effectiveness compared to traditional evolutionary optimization.

                arXiv:2508.00387v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transformer-based Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) suffer from a great performance gap compared to floating-point \mbox{Artificial} Neural Networks (ANNs) due to the binary nature of spike trains. Recent efforts have introduced deep-level feedback loops to transmit high-level semantic information to narrow this gap. However, these designs often span \mbox{multiple} deep layers, resulting in costly feature transformations, higher parameter overhead, increased energy consumption, and longer inference latency. To address this issue, we propose Shallow-level Temporal Feedback (STF), a lightweight plug-and-play module for the encoding layer, which consists of Temporal-Spatial Position Embedding (TSPE) and Temporal Feedback (TF). Extensive experiments show that STF consistently improves performance across various Transformer-based SNN backbones on static datasets, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-1K, under different spike timestep settings. Further analysis reveals that STF enhances the diversity of spike patterns, which is key to performance gain. Moreover, evaluations on adversarial robustness and temporal sensitivity confirm that STF outperforms direct coding and its variants, highlighting its potential as a new spike encoding scheme for static scenarios. Our code will be released upon acceptance.

">The Relationship between Social Reward Behavior and Mesolimbic Dopamine Release</a></h4>

              
                Deficits in social behavior, such as reduced motivation and social avoidance, are key symptoms in several psychiatric disorders. Distinct modes of reward, such as drug and social, may rely on different dopamine release patterns in the mesolimbic pathway. We investigated the relationship between social reward behaviors and dopamine release elicited by phasic and tonic stimulation patterns in C57BL/6J mice. Social conditioned place preference was used to assess motivation for social interaction, and in vivo fixed potential amperometry was used to measure nucleus accumbens dopamine release before and after cocaine (10 mg/kg, ip). Additional measures included the frequency and duration of social interactions during conditioning sessions, with the first and last session representing novel and familiar social interactions respectively. No relationship was found between baseline (pre-cocaine) dopamine and social place preference in either sex. However, in males, social place preference negatively correlated with cocaine-induced phasic dopamine release, indicating that increased social motivation was associated with a reduced phasic dopaminergic response to cocaine. In contrast, greater novel interaction was associated with increased baseline dopamine elicited by tonic stimulations. These relationships were not observed in females. Overall, these findings suggest distinct, sex-dependent roles for phasic and tonic dopamine release in mediating social reward.

">The Microglial TREM2 Receptor Programs Hippocampal Development in a Mouse Model of Childhood Deprivation</a></h4>

              
                Childhood neglect and deprivation are the most common forms of adversity, yet their biological impact on cognitive development--and how enrichment mitigates these effects--remains unclear. Using limited bedding (LB) as a mouse model of deprivation, we previously showed that abnormal microglial-mediated synaptic pruning during the second and third postnatal weeks leads to impaired synaptic connectivity and hippocampal dysfunction, particularly in males. Here, we demonstrate that LB reduces expression of Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) in different mouse strains and that TREM2 deficiency contributes to, but does not fully explain, impaired microglial pruning. Overexpressing TREM2 restored microglial phagocytic function and rescued deficits in hippocampal connectivity and fear learning. Brief postnatal enrichment (P14-P17) also normalized synaptic pruning in a TREM2-dependent manner. Together, our findings identify TREM2 as a key molecular mediator of experience-dependent plasticity, revealing its central role in linking early-life deprivation and enrichment to cognitive outcomes later in life.

">Dynamic, behavior-dependent interactions between dorsal striatal dopamine and glutamate release predict cognitive flexibility and punishment resistant cocaine use</a></h4>

              
                Cognitive inflexibility covaries with substance use disorder (SUD) risk. To determine if there is a neural relationship between these phenomena, glutamate and dopamine release in the dorsomedial (DMS) and dorsolateral (DLS) striatum were measured as rats performed a discrimination and strategy switching test. Elevations in glutamate release, with reductions in dopamine, at trial initiation (DLS) and prior to choice (DMS and DLS) predicted fast strategy switching and punishment sensitive cocaine seeking. Elevations in DLS and DMS dopamine release at these respective timestamps predicted slow switching and punishment resistance. Orbitofrontal cortex and intralaminar thalamus were significant contributors to DLS and DMS glutamate release, but their relative contributions differed between rats that were fast or slow strategy switchers, and in how they affected behavior. As such, these data describe a neural signature of flexibility and associated circuitry that could be used to predict and treat SUDs in humans.

">The Semantic Underpinnings of Speech Disorganization in Schizophrenia</a></h4>

              
                Effective communication relies on shared semantic representations and their context-sensitive retrieval. Accordingly, difficulties in communicating coherently, as seen in some patients with schizophrenia, may reflect impairments at the level of semantic structure or the retrieval process operating on this structure. Disentangling these components is challenging. Here, we address this problem using a word association task and magnetoencephalography (MEG), allowing us to examine behavioral markers of semantic structure and retrieval as well as semantic representation in the brain. For the latter, we detail an approach that contrasts the brain's encoding of concepts as predicted by generic versus personalized semantic models. In so doing, we provide converging evidence for semantic structure idiosyncrasy in patients with schizophrenia who also exhibit speech disorganization. The findings advance our understanding of the semantic underpinnings of speech disorganization in schizophrenia, while also revealing the potential of using personalized semantic models to explain neural representation and behavior.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>For children with congenital heart disease (CHD), differences in brain structure are already present at birth. Cortical surface area and gyrification increase dramatically over the third trimester, and cortical expansion has been hypothesized to drive brain folding. This study sought to quantify differences in cortical expansion in fetuses with CHD and typically developing controls. Fetal magnetic resonance imaging was conducted at early (26-31 weeks) and late (34-39 weeks) gestational time points, and cortical surfaces were reconstructed using a high resolution, motion-corrected pipeline. For fetuses with reconstructions at both time points (36 CHD, 24 control), anatomically-constrained multimodal surface matching (aMSM) was used to generate individualized maps of cortical surface expansion. Global analysis revealed significant reductions in total cortical expansion and gyrification index among CHD fetuses. Furthermore, expansion maps revealed high expansion in the lateral temporal lobes of control fetuses that was reduced in fetuses with CHD, consistent with previous reports of atypical folding in this region. This study is the first to reveal spatiotemporal patterns of cortical expansion in typical and atypical fetal development. This detailed understanding of cortical growth trajectory may improve understanding of functional deficits associated with specific cortical areas and inform clinical interventions for patients with CHD.</span>

                <p>by Nandan Haloi, Rebecca J. Howard, Erik Lindahl</p>

Resolving protein-ligand interactions in atomic detail is key to understanding how small molecules regulate macromolecular function. Although recent breakthroughs in cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) have enabled high-quality reconstruction of numerous complex biomolecules, the resolution of bound ligands is often relatively poor. Furthermore, methods for building and refining molecular models into cryo-EM maps have largely focused on proteins and may not be optimized for the diverse properties of small-molecule ligands. Here, we present an approach that integrates artificial intelligence (AI) with cryo-EM density-guided simulations to fit ligands into experimental maps. Using three inputs: 1) a protein amino acid sequence, 2) a ligand specification, and 3) an experimental cryo-EM map, we validated our approach on a set of biomedically relevant protein-ligand complexes including kinases, GPCRs, and solute transporters, none of which were present in the AI training data. In cases for which AI was not sufficient to predict experimental poses outright, integration of flexible fitting into molecular dynamics simulations improved ligand model-to-map cross-correlation relative to the deposited structure from 40-71% to 82-95%. This work offers a straightforward pipeline for integrating AI and density-guided simulations to model building in cryo-EM maps of ligand-protein complexes.

                <p>by Jakob C. B. Schwenk, Andrea Alamia</p>

Recent studies have shown that cortical low-frequency oscillations are often organized as traveling waves. The properties of these waves have been linked to both sensory processing and cognitive functions. In EEG recordings, alpha-band (~10Hz) traveling waves propagate predominantly along the occipital-frontal axis, with forward waves being most prominent during visual processing, while backward waves dominate at rest and during sensory suppression. While a previous study has proposed a functional model to explain their generation and propagation, a biologically plausible implementation is lacking. Here, we present a multi-scale network model with mean-field dynamics that, building on known cortical connectivity, reproduces the dynamics of alpha-band traveling waves observed in EEG recordings. We show that forward and backward waves can arise from two distinct cortical sub-networks that are connected in infragranular layers at each area. At rest, the network generates spontaneous backward waves and switches to a forward state upon sensory stimulation, reproducing the dynamics observed in EEG recordings. We then show that a cortico-thalamic pathway through the pulvinar can bias the dynamics to the forward state and that pulvinar engagement leads to spontaneous forward waves at rest. This is in line with previous studies suggesting a key role for the pulvinar in directing cortical information flow. In summary, our model provides a biologically plausible architecture for modeling the dynamics of macroscale traveling waves. It bridges the gap between scales by connecting laminar activity to scalp-level spatial patterns, providing a biologically grounded and comprehensive view of the spatial propagation of alpha-band traveling waves.

Vaccination is vital for preventing disease spread, as demonstrated by its role played in recent outbreaks such as measles, COVID-19, and the 2014 West Africa Ebola crisis. Classical ring vaccination–targeting individuals near infected cases to form protective clusters–has become of interest due to its effectiveness, yet it is strongly influenced by the quality of contact tracing and availability of medical resources. Here, we model the efficiency of a family of ring vaccination-inspired strategies that address these limiting factors and disentangle them from the structure of the contact patterns. In particular, we evaluate scenarios that consider a vaccination radius <i>r</i>, used to vaccinate nodes in the network up to <i>r</i> contacts away (<i>block vaccination</i>) or exactly <i>r</i> contacts away (<i>ring vaccination</i>) from nodes of interest. Each one of these is tested under two further scenarios: the <i>preventive</i> one, where individuals are vaccinated before the epidemic takes place, and the <i>containment</i> one, where vaccination occurs during an outbreak to limit disease spread. They are tested in synthetic networks, where we find that in the preventive scenario, ring outperforms block vaccination, reducing the size of the epidemic and, in some cases, even preventing it from happening. On the other hand, in the containment scenario, we find that both strategies perform slightly similarly in reducing the impact of the diseases but block vaccination using fewer resources. As a case study, the proposed strategies are used to create epidemiological risk maps by employing the spatial position of olive trees in the Salento region in Italy, which recently suffered the impact of the bacterium <i>Xylella fastidiosa</i>.

In the quest for improved therapeutics targeting immune checkpoints (ICs), we turn to spontaneously developing dog (canine) cancers, some of which genetically and clinically mirror the human counterparts. Despite its potential, canine cancer immunology remains largely unexplored. Here, we examine the RNA-seq-based expression of 44 ICs across 14 canine cancer types and an extensive human dataset. We unveil diverse canine IC expression patterns and unique human IC signatures that reflect the histological type and primary site of cancer. We uncover a striking similarity between canine brain cancers, osteosarcoma, and their human counterparts, identifying them as prospective immunotherapy models. Four ICs - CD160, A2AR, NKG2A, and OX40 - are key to the differences observed between species. We also find that individual human IC signatures vary in how well they align with their respective cancer types, a pattern that may influence future approaches to personalized therapy. This exploration highlights aspects of canine and human cancer immunology that warrant further study, setting the stage for discoveries at their crossroads.

Hypovolemic shock and hemorrhage continue to shape healthcare delivery and incur a heavy burden on public health and wellbeing. Many healthcare organizations have specific transfusion protocols that are referenced when a patient meets certain physiological criteria. These protocols are shaped around best practices and nuanced understanding of the physiology of the patient. Despite their importance, these protocols are extremely difficult to change or challenge and, to date, there does not exist a sufficient mathematical model that may be employed towards investigating simulated patient hemorrhage. We show that once constructed, we can consider the health of the patient in phase-space rather than traditional time-series representations, quantifying the recovery of the patient due to the geometry of the trajectories. We construct a whole-body physiology model of hemorrhagic shock and trauma that encompasses multiple organ systems, non-linear feedback mechanisms and patient variability. We validate this model by constructing a major hemorrhage scenario, that includes transit time and associated mass transfusion resuscitation of the patient. We then use this model to create phase-plane diagrams of patient trajectories as a function of lactate blood pH and volumes, among other relevant physiological metrics. Exploring these patient trajectories amongst a varied patient population yields a series of high curvature points associated with the transition from deterioration to recovery of the patient. We then construct a convex hull, covering the high curvature regions of a diverse simulated patient population. These hulls, constructed by simulated numerous patients, exposed to three distinct hemorrhagic severities, are then used to validate the model by comparing experimental serum lactate levels as a function of blood volume to these regions in phase-space. In conclusion, we show that the model is highly accurate and accounts for distinct lactate trajectories amongst the simulated patient cohorts. Finally, we fit a logistic curve to the resulting data for a quick patient severity tool and denote the standard error of parameterization based on the delta method.

Multisensory integration has primarily been studied in static environments, where optimal integration relies on the precision of the respective sensory modalities. However, in numerous situations, sensory information is dynamic and changes over time, due to changes in our bodily state and the surrounding environment. Given that different sensory modalities have different delays, this suggests that optimal integration may not solely depend on sensory precision but may also be affected by the delays associated with each sensory system. To investigate this hypothesis, participants (n = 22, 16 female) engaged in a continuous steering task. Participants sat on a motion platform facing a screen that displayed a cartoonish traffic scene, featuring a car traveling along a road. In the visuoinertial condition, where vestibular and somatosensory feedback were available, they were tasked with counteracting an external multi-frequency perturbation signal, which laterally perturbed the platform and the car, such that the car was kept within the center of the road. In the visual condition, the visual car was perturbed, while the motion platform remained stationary. We show that participants compensate better for the perturbation in the visuoinertial than the visual condition, particularly in the high frequency range of the perturbation. Using computational modelling, we demonstrate that this enhanced performance is partially due to the shorter delay of the vestibular modality. In this condition, participants rely more on the vestibular information, which is less delayed than the more precise but longer delayed, visual information.

Multiple myeloma (MM) is a plasma cell cancer that occurs in the bone marrow. A leading treatment for MM is the monoclonal antibody Daratumumab, targeting the CD38 receptor, which is highly overexpressed in myeloma cells. In this work we model drug resistance via loss of CD38 expression, which is a proposed mechanism of resistance to Daratumumab treatment. We develop an ODE model that includes drug resistance via two mechanisms: a direct effect in which CD38 expression is lost without cell death in response to Daratumumab, and an indirect effect in which CD38 expression switches on and off in the cancer cells; myeloma cells that do not express CD38 have lower fitness but are shielded from the drug action. The model also incorporates competition with healthy cells, death of healthy cells due to off-target drug effects, and a Michaelis-Menten type immune response. Using optimal control theory, we study the effect of the drug resistance mechanisms and the off-target drug effect on the optimal treatment regime. We identify a general increase in the duration and costs of optimal treatment, as a result of these added mechanisms. Several distinct optimal treatment regimes are identified within the parameter space.

                <p>by Pedro F. Vale, Chadi M. Saad-Roy, Mike Boots</p>

Variation in infection history is an important but often underappreciated driver of individual variability in responses to infections. Such individual heterogeneity in immune responses, stemming from variable previous exposure to pathogens, subsequently influences epidemiological outcomes. By comparing research on innate immune priming in invertebrates, which lack adaptive immune memory but demonstrate enhanced responses to re-infections, to patterns seen in vertebrates, this Essay reveals broad implications for disease dynamics. Insights from mathematical modelling and experimental data highlight the critical need to integrate evolutionary disease ecology into public health initiatives to better predict and manage infectious diseases.

<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Microcirculatory disturbances may play an important role in futile recanalization. This study investigated the early factors affecting the prognosis of cerebral infarction in rats and whether low-molecular-weight heparin improves microcirculation disorders. We used a male rat middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model with 90 min transient MCAO (tMCAO) or permanent MCAO (pMCAO) ischemia, and analyzed after 24 h. Cortical blood flow was monitored using laser speckle blood flow imaging. Furthermore, 1.5 mg/kg Enoxaparin (Enox) was administered 30 min before ischemia or 1 h post-reperfusion. The tMCAO group received saline. Our results showed that the proportion of moderate and severe (M&amp;S) injuries was 54.2% in tMCAO rats, 100% in pMCAO rats, and reduced to 25% in the enoxaparin pre-ischemic (Enox-pre) group. The reperfusion rats had persistent hypoperfusion and the lowest blood flow after 1 h post-reperfusion. The 1 and 24 h post-reperfusion cortical blood flow was negatively correlated with infarct volume and neurological scores. The Enox-pre group had higher blood flow than the tMCAO group at 1 h post-reperfusion (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Enox-pre reduced fibrin deposition after 1 h post-reperfusion (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01), improved microvascular patency after 1 and 24 h (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01), and decreased Evans blue leakage after 24 h (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). We concluded that 50% of the futile recanalization rate also exists in rats with recanalization 1.5 h post-infarction. The degree of reperfusion blood flow recovery significantly affects cerebral infarction outcomes. Enox-pre reduces the proportion of poor outcomes by reducing early microthrombus formation, enhancing microcirculation, increasing reperfusion blood flow, and mitigating blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption.</p>

                Rizzo et al. describe an imageable breast cancer mouse model to study nanomedicine targeting to primary tumors vs. metastases. Clinical-stage polymeric micelles preferentially accumulate in metastases over healthy tissues, albeit less efficiently than in primary tumors, due to collagen crosslinking. Docetaxel-loaded micelles show superior efficacy and reduced toxicity compared to Taxotere.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/89225">Hexokinase regulates Mondo-mediated longevity via the PPP and organellar dynamics</a></h4>

              
                The transcriptional complex Mondo/Max-like, MML-1/MXL-2, acts as a convergent transcriptional regulatory output of multiple longevity pathways in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. These transcription factors coordinate nutrient sensing with carbohydrate and lipid metabolism across the evolutionary spectrum. While most studies have focused on the downstream outputs, little is known about the upstream inputs that regulate these transcription factors in a live organism. Here, we found that knockdown of various glucose metabolic enzymes decreases MML-1 localization in the nucleus and identified two hexokinase isozymes, <i>hxk-1</i> and <i>hxk-2,</i> as the most vigorous regulators of MML-1 function. Upon hexokinase knockdown, MML-1 redistributes to mitochondria and lipid droplets (LDs), and concomitantly, transcriptional targets are downregulated and germline longevity is abolished. Further, we found that <i>hxk-1</i> regulates MML-1 through mitochondrial β-oxidation, while <i>hxk-2</i> regulates MML-1 by modulating the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and its coordinated association with LDs. Similarly, inhibition of the PPP rescues mammalian MondoA nuclear translocation and transcriptional function upon starvation. These studies reveal how metabolic signals and organellar communication regulate a key convergent metabolic transcription factor to promote longevity.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102352">A biofilm-tropic Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteriophage uses the exopolysaccharide Psl as receptor</a></h4>

              
                Bacteria in nature can exist in multicellular communities called biofilms. Biofilms also form in the course of many infections. <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> infections frequently involve biofilms, which contribute materially to the difficulty to treat these infections with antibiotic therapy. Many biofilm-related characteristics are controlled by the second messenger, cyclic-di-GMP, which is upregulated on surface contact. Among these factors is the exopolysaccharide Psl, which is a critically important component of the biofilm matrix. Here, we describe the discovery of a <i>P. aeruginosa</i> bacteriophage, which we have called Clew-1, that directly binds to and uses Psl as a receptor. While this phage does not efficiently infect planktonically growing bacteria, it can disrupt <i>P. aeruginosa</i> biofilms and replicate in biofilm bacteria. We further demonstrate that the Clew-1 can reduce the bacterial burden in a mouse model of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> keratitis, which is characterized by the formation of a biofilm on the cornea. Due to its reliance on Psl for infection, Clew-1 does not actually form plaques on wild-type bacteria under standard in vitro conditions. This argues that our standard isolation procedures likely exclude bacteriophage that are adapted to using biofilm markers for infection. Importantly, the manner in which we isolated Clew-1 can be easily extended to other strains of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> and indeed other bacterial species, which will fuel the discovery of other biofilm-tropic bacteriophage and expand their therapeutic use.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/99936">Redistribution of fragmented mitochondria ensures symmetric organelle partitioning and faithful chromosome segregation in mitotic mouse zygotes</a></h4>

              
                In cleavage-stage embryos, preexisting organelles partition evenly into daughter blastomeres without signiﬁcant cell growth after symmetric cell division. The presence of mitochondrial DNA within mitochondria and its restricted replication during preimplantation development makes their inheritance particularly important. While chromosomes are precisely segregated by the mitotic spindle, the mechanisms controlling mitochondrial partitioning remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigate the mechanism by which Dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) controls the mitochondrial redistribution and partitioning during embryonic cleavage. Depletion of Drp1 in mouse zygotes causes marked mitochondrial aggregation, and the majority of embryos arrest at the 2 cell stage. Clumped mitochondria are located in the center of mitotic Drp1-depleted zygotes with less uniform distribution, thereby preventing their symmetric partitioning. Asymmetric mitochondrial inheritance is accompanied by functionally inequivalent blastomeres with biased ATP and endoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels. We also find that marked mitochondrial centration in Drp1-depleted zygotes prevents the assembly of parental chromosomes, resulting in chromosome segregation defects and binucleation. Thus, mitochondrial fragmentation mediated by Drp1 ensures proper organelle positioning and partitioning into functional daughters during the first embryonic cleavage.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106261">Navigating contradictions in enteric chemotactic stimuli</a></h4>

              
                Previously, we showed Enterobacteriaceae use chemotaxis and the chemoreceptor Tsr for attraction to blood serum (Glenn et al., 2024). Here, we investigated the complementary role of Tsr in mediating chemorepulsion, a behaviour by which motile bacteria avoid deleterious compounds to locate permissive niches. In the gut, indole is a bacteriostatic compound produced by microbiota and thought to act as a chemorepellent for invading pathogens, thereby protecting the host against infection. The principal reservoir of intestinal indole is fecal matter, a complex biological material that contains both attractant and repellent stimuli. Whether indole in its natural context is sufficient for pathogen chemorepulsion or host protection has remained unknown. Using an intestinal explant system, we show that pure indole suppresses an infection advantage mediated through chemotaxis for the enteric pathogen Salmonella Typhimurium, but this effect is abolished in the presence of other fecal chemoeffectors, including the chemoattractant L-Serine (L-Ser), dependent on the chemoreceptor Tsr. Live imaging reveals that although S. Typhimurium is repelled by pure indole, the pathogen is actually strongly attracted to human fecal matter despite its high indole content, and this response is mediated by Tsr, which simultaneously senses both stimuli. Fecal attraction is conserved across diverse Enterobacteriaceae species that harbor Tsr orthologues, including <i>Escherichia coli</i>, Citrobacter koseri, Enterobacter cloacae, and clinical isolates of non-typhoidal Salmonella. In a defined system of fecal chemoeffectors, L-Ser and other fecal chemoattractants override indole chemorepulsion, but the magnitude of bacterial chemoattraction is controlled by indole levels. Together, these findings suggest chemorepulsion elicited by indole is not protective against enteric infection and actually benefits pathogens by helping them locate niches with lower competitor density. Our study highlights the limitations of applying single-effector studies in predicting bacterial behavior in natural environments, where chemotaxis is shaped by the integration of multiple, often opposing, chemical signals.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106288">Recurrent mutations drive the rapid evolution of pesticide resistance in the two-spotted spider mite Tetranychus urticae</a></h4>

              
                The genetic basis of pesticide resistance has been widely studied, but the exact nature of this evolutionary process in the field is often unclear, particularly when a limited number of populations is considered and when there is a lag between the evolutionary event and its investigation. We showed that an unprecedented number of recurrently evolved mutations in an arthropod pest, the two-spotted spider mite <i>Tetranychus urticae</i>, drive the rapid evolution of resistance to a recently commercialized acaricide, cyetpyrafen. We first observed high levels of resistance that appeared and became widespread within three years. Genome scans revealed genetic heterogeneity of resistance among populations and identified 15 target mutations, including six mutations on five amino acid residues of subunit <i>sdhB</i>, and nine mutations on three amino acid residues of subunit <i>sdhD</i> of the pesticide target succinate dehydrogenase, with as many as five substitutions on one residue. No mutations were present in 2,317 screened historical specimens, suggesting that mutations arose rapidly through de novo substitutions or from very rare segregating mutations. Identical mutations recurrently appeared in different genetic backgrounds, increasing the likelihood of resistance evolution. The high number of mutational options available for the evolution of target site resistance in this pest challenges resistance management practices.

">Distinct goal location beta frequency dynamics in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex across learning</a></h4>

              
                Neural activity at goal locations contributes to learning by providing feedback on the success of preceding actions. This period engages neocortical and hippocampal networks, which serve distinct functions in processing reward and forming associations with experience that lead to reward. A neocortical network signature for reward feedback processing is beta oscillations (15-30Hz). Beta oscillations are thought to coordinate distributed neural processes across brain regions. However, it is unknown whether beta oscillations coordinate hippocampal-neocortical networks during the goal period, or how their dynamics relate to learning. Here, we show that beta oscillations occur in both hippocampal CA1 and the prefrontal cortex (PFC) when rats reach goal locations in spatial navigation tasks. Despite the presence of beta oscillations in both regions after goal entry, beta activity in each region differed in spectral and temporal properties. These differences suggest that the hippocampus and PFC are not strongly coupled at the beta frequency. We found the strengths of PFC and CA1 beta oscillations across learning were inversely related: PFC beta activity increasing in strength and CA1 beta activity decreasing in strength. Beta burst properties in PFC also had an inverse relationship to those of hippocampal sharp wave-ripples (SWRs), a prominent hippocampal process required for learning. We found a subset of PFC neurons modulated by both beta and hippocampal SWRs, which had distinct task-related firing patterns. Our results suggest that during outcome processing at goal locations, the neocortex and hippocampus are independently modulated by beta oscillations before becoming coordinated for memory-related processes during SWRs.

">Spreading alpha-Synuclein Oligomers Trigger Astrocyte Reactivity and Astrocyte-glutamatergic Neuron system dysfunction in an Age-Dependent Manner</a></h4>

              
                Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the progressive accumulation and spatio-temporal spread of -synuclein (-syn) oligomers and a progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons. To investigate the transcriptional and cellular consequences of -syn oligomer spreading, we employed spatial transcriptomics and single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) in a transgenic PD mouse model. We identified -syn spreading to the substantia nigra and defined a transcriptional "Spreading Signature" associated with -syn pathology. We found an age specific increase in reactive astrocytes, close interactions between reactive astrocytes and -syn, and transcriptional dysregulation of the astrocyte-glutamatergic neuron network. We further identified two subtypes of glutamatergic neurons that are vulnerable to astrocytic changes. Comparative analysis with human PD snRNA-seq data revealed conserved astrocytic dysfunctions, underscoring the translational relevance of our findings. Based on our results, we propose a revised model of -syn spreading and highlight 36 genes as potential therapeutic targets for mitigating astrocyte-neuron dysfunction in PD.

">Optimal colors can predict luminosity thresholds in natural scenes</a></h4>

              
                Luminosity thresholds define the luminance boundary at which a surface color shifts in appearance from being perceived as an illuminated surface to appearing self-luminous. Previous research suggests that the human visual system infers these thresholds based on internal references of physically realizable surface colors under a given illumination, referred to as the physical gamut. A surface is perceived as self-luminous when its luminance exceeds the upper limit of this empirically internalized gamut. However, the precise structure and boundaries of these gamuts remain uncertain. Optimal colors, which represent theoretical surface reflectances under specific illuminants, have been shown to provide an effective model for visualizing and computing the physical gamuts. In prior studies, optimal colors have successfully predicted luminosity thresholds; however, these findings were limited to highly simplified, abstract stimuli. Whether this framework generalizes to more naturalistic viewing conditions has remained an open question. In the present study, we demonstrate that the theory of an internal reference in the form of an empirically constructed physical gamut, visualized through optimal colors, remains valid under more natural conditions. Our results confirm that optimal colors can still accurately predict luminosity thresholds in such settings. Moreover, our findings suggest that the luminosity thresholds encompass both self-luminosity and naturalness concepts. Subsequently, this may imply that the notion of physical gamut could envelope both concepts as well and could be defined as "all physically possible colors in a scene for an object that does not emit light." These insights can have profound potential implications for both applied fields (i.e., XR or projection mapping) and fundamental science (e.g., understanding human visual processing mechanisms).

">Adaptive behavior is guided by integrated representations of controlled and non-controlled information</a></h4>

              
                Understanding how task knowledge is encoded neurally is crucial for uncovering the mechanisms underlying adaptive behavior. Here, we test the theory that all task information is integrated into a conjunctive task representation by investigating whether this representation simultaneously includes two types of associations that can guide behavior: stimulus-response (non-controlled) associations and stimulus-control (controlled) associations that inform how task focus should be adjusted to achieve goal-directed behavior. We extended the classic item-specific proportion congruency paradigm to dissociate the electroencephalographic (EEG) representations of controlled and non-controlled associations. Behavioral data replicated previous findings of association-driven adaptive behaviors. Decoding analyses of EEG data further showed that associations of controlled and non-controlled information were represented concurrently and differentially. Brain-behavioral analyses also showed that the strength of both associations was associated with faster responses. These findings support the idea that controlled and non-controlled associations are governed by an integrated task representation to guide adaptive behaviors simultaneously.

">Revisiting Amplitude of Low-Frequency Fluctuations (ALFF) in Resting-state fMRI: Clarifications and Improvements</a></h4>

              
                The amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) and its related measure, fractional ALFF (fALFF), are widely used resting-state fMRI techniques for quantifying spontaneous neural activity within specific frequency bands. However, inconsistencies in the definition and implementation of ALFF have led to confusion in the field. In this study, we provide a mathematical clarification of ALFF and fALFF by introducing two variants: the arithmetic mean-defined ALFF/fALFF (amALFF/amfALFF) and the quadratic mean-defined ALFF/fALFF (qmALFF/qmfALFF). We examine the relationships between mean BOLD intensity (MBI), amALFF, and qmALFF across both subjects and voxels using two independent datasets mapped onto different brain templates. Additionally, we investigate the impact of z-scoring the original BOLD signal on ALFF and fALFF metrics. Our key findings include: (1) MBI is positively correlated with both amALFF and qmALFF, highlighting the need for normalization to subject-level means; (2) normalized qmALFF and qmfALFF are highly correlated with normalized amALFF and amfALFF, respectively, at both the subject and voxel levels; (3) z-scoring the BOLD signal does not affect amfALFF or qmfALFF, but it substantially alters amALFF and qmALFF. Based on these findings, we present a comprehensive flowchart of the (f)ALFF algorithm implemented in the temporal domain. The full procedure is implemented in R, and the corresponding script is available at: https://github.com/lejianhuang/ALFF.

">Pause characteristics of sentence production in Parkinson's disease: insights from sentence complexity and length</a></h4>

              
                Purpose Parkinson's disease (PD) affects forward flow of speech including fluency disruptions in 90% of individuals. One of the main parameters affecting flow and fluency of speech is pause behaviour. However, the precise language characteristics of pauses, including sentence complexity and length, and how they contribute to the fluency disruptions of PD are not fully understood. This study examined how sentence complexity and length affect pause behaviour in PD. Method Seventy-one participants, comprising individuals with PD (n = 32) and neurotypical controls (n = 39), read a speech passage aloud. The number and duration of pauses, categorised by location (between, within sentences), sentence complexity (simple, complex), and sentence length (short, long) were analysed. Cognitive ability, assessed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and motor speech deficits (i.e., dysarthria) severity, assessed using a speech perceptual ranking, were evaluated and correlated with pause characteristics. Results Individuals with PD produced significantly more pauses across all categories compared to controls. However, only between-sentence and long-sentence pauses were significantly longer in duration. Pause frequency and duration in both groups were higher in more complex and longer sentences. Significant negative correlations were found between MoCA scores and number of pauses. Significant positive correlations were observed between dysarthria severity and duration of pauses. Conclusion These findings suggest that increased cognitive-linguistic demands--indexed by sentence complexity and length--may underlie pausing behaviour and contribute to fluency disruptions in individuals with PD. The results extend previous research by highlighting the potential cognitive-linguistic basis of motor speech dysfunction in PD.

">Reverse Predictivity: Going Beyond One-Way Mapping to Compare Artificial Neural Network Models and Brains</a></h4>

              
                A major goal in systems neuroscience is to build computational models that capture the primate brain's internal representations. Standard evaluations of artificial neural networks (ANNs) emphasize forward predictivity -- how well model features predict neural responses -- without testing whether model representations are themselves recoverable from neural activity. Here we develop the reverse predictivity metric, which quantifies how well macaque inferior temporal (IT) cortex responses predict ANN unit activations. This two-way framework reveals a striking asymmetry: models with high forward predictivity (~50% variance explained) often contain units unpredictable from neural activity, reflecting biologically inaccessible dimensions. In contrast, monkey-to-monkey mappings are symmetric, confirming that the asymmetry reflects genuine representational mismatch. Reverse predictivity isolates common ANN units -- shared with IT, behaviorally relevant, and generalizing across species -- and unique units lacking such alignment. Influenced by feature dimensionality, training objectives, and adversarial robustness, reverse predictivity offers a principled benchmark for guiding next-generation ANNs toward both high task performance and genuine biological plausibility.

">Neural Circuit Remodeling Underlying Enhanced Feeding During Pregnancy in Mice</a></h4>

              
                Pregnancy represents a unique physiological state marked by substantial adaptations influencing both behavior and metabolism. Alterations have been observed across multiple levels, from changes in cellular morphology, synaptic density, and neuroglial interactions to a brain-wide reduction in gray matter volume. While these adaptations are thought to support offspring survival and promote maternal physiological and psychological well-being, their functional significance remains largely unresolved. In particular, linking localized synaptic plasticity to a broader brain-wide circuit dynamics has posed a major challenge. Using virus-mediated screening in mice, we investigated the pregnancy-induced remodeling of the presynaptic landscape of paraventricular hypothalamic (PVH) oxytocin neurons, a central hub of maternal physiology. Here we show a selective and reversible elimination of excitatory synaptic inputs from the medial preoptic nucleus to PVH oxytocin neurons, displaying region-, cell-type-, and pathway-specificity. This reduction in excitatory drive attenuated the anorexigenic activity of oxytocin neurons during feeding, thereby promoting the increased food intake characteristic of pregnancy. These data demonstrate that the selective suppression of anorexigenic PVH oxytocin neuron activity plays a critical role in appetite regulation during pregnancy. More broadly, our data identify a pregnancy-associated remodeling of hypothalamic neural circuits with direct physiological relevance.

">Sound-evoked auditory neurophysiological signals are a window into prodromal functional differences in a preclinical model of Alzheimer's Disease</a></h4>

              
                Hearing has been identified as the largest modifiable mid-life risk factor for Alzheimer's Disease (AD), despite that its link to dementia remains unclear. Here we identify a biomarker of AD risk in an auditory neural signal using the non-invasive, rapidly acquired, and clinically translatable auditory brainstem response (ABR) in normal hearing knock-in rats (Swedish familial AD risk variant to Amyloid precursor protein, AppS; male and female). While ABR morphology has been proposed as a biomarker for AD, we report a novel biomarker derived from multidimensional parametric feature extraction on the distribution statistics of repeated single traces of the ABR that increases its potential for clinical utility with sensitivity and specificity. We report accurate prediction of AD genetic risk in both young and aged animals: AppS rats separate clearly from humanized controls in both sex- and age-dependent manners. Notably, auditory learning in young adulthood normalized the ABR signature in AppS rats with maintained effects into older age, altogether supporting a central neural generator of auditory dysfunction related to AD risk. These preclinical findings show how ABRs could provide a very early biomarker for detection of AD risk and lay the groundwork to test the synergy of auditory and cognitive functions in human dementia.

">A Cell-Autonomous Role for the Vitamin B6 Metabolism Gene PNPO in Drosophila GABAergic Neurons</a></h4>

              
                In animals, the enzyme pyridox(am)ine 5'-phosphate oxidase (PNPO) is critical for synthesizing the active form of vitamin B6 (VB6), pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP), from inactive vitamers. PLP is a required cofactor for many enzymatic reactions, including the synthesis of GABA and the monoamines. PNPO disruption in humans is associated with an array of epilepsy syndromes, while Drosophila harboring mutations in the sole PNPO ortholog, sugarlethal (sgll), display spontaneous seizures and short lifespans. These phenotypes are suppressed by PLP supplementation and are exacerbated by restriction of dietary B6 vitamers. In the context of PNPO deficiency, it remains to be resolved what the specific contributions by cellular subpopulations in the nervous system are to neurological phenotypes. We addressed this question in sgll mutants by expressing human PNPO (hPNPO) cDNA in cholinergic, glutamatergic, and GABAergic neurons as well as glia and measuring changes in survival and seizure phenotypes. We found hPNPO expression in GABAergic neurons largely restored lifespan and attenuated seizure activity, while glial expression also improved sgll phenotypes albeit to a lesser degree. In contrast, hPNPO expression in either cholinergic or glutamatergic neurons, accounting for most neurons in the fly brain, did not appreciably alter sgll phenotypes. We contrasted these observations with changes in sgll mutants induced by feeding GABA receptor modulators. The GABAB agonist SKF-97541 reduced mortality, while GABA or GABAA receptor modulators did not improve survival. Together, our data establish a cell-autonomous role for PNPO in GABAergic neurons to support brain function, especially under VB6-restricted conditions.

">Inflammation increases the penetrance of behavioral impairment in Shank3 haploinsufficiency mice -- can it explain the behavioral regression in Autism?</a></h4>

              
                Behavioral regression occurs in ~40% of SHANK3-associated autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We previously reported that significant behavioral regression in a small cohort with SHANK3 haploinsufficiency patients, triggered by subclinical infections, responded to immunomodulator treatments. We hypothesize that behavioral regression results from the interplay between SHANK3 deficiency and neuroinflammation. Using Shank3 exon 4-22 deletion heterozygous mutant (Sh3+/-) mouse, which shows no significant behavior impairments, we established a preclinical model -- Shank3 haploinsufficiency mouse undergoing systemic inflammation challenge via intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharides (LPS). We found that, two weeks after LPS challenge, wild-type mice (WT) recovered but Sh3+/- mice exhibited motor impairment, anxiety-like behaviors, and excessive grooming, similar to Shank3 exon 4-22 deletion homozygous mutants. Anti-inflammatory treatment partially reversed LPS-induced behavioral changes. Transcriptomic analysis revealed upregulation of neuroinflammation-related genes and downregulation of synaptic function-related genes in Sh3+/- mice in response to LPS. Especially, pro-inflammatory genes and microglia markers were overly activated that may result from the increased Toll-Like Receptor 4 (TLR4) expression in microglia in Sh3+/- mice. Our findings indicate that neuroinflammation increases the penetrance of behavioral impairment in Shank3 haploinsufficiency mice and support a potential mechanism for the behavioral regression in human SHANK3 disorders for future investigations.

">Very low amplitude muscle activity increases probability of motor evoked potentials in healthy individuals and in ALS</a></h4>

              
                Background In many clinical and research settings, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) intensities are standardised based on resting motor threshold (RMT). It is well-established that contraction of the target muscle increases motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitude and correspondingly decreases RMT. As such, when estimating RMT it is crucial to ensure the target muscle is relaxed. Typically trials in which baseline electromyographic (EMG) amplitude exceeds a specified threshold are rejected. The influence of motor activity below typical rejection thresholds on MEP amplitudes has yet to be established. Methods We retrospectively analysed TMS-EMG data collected during RMT measurement in 45 healthy controls (1761 datapoints) and 35 people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, 1238 datapoints). Trials where root mean squared (RMS) baseline EMG amplitude exceeded 10V were rejected. Generalised linear mixed-effects models were used to assess effects of muscle activity below this rejection threshold on probability of evoking an MEP with peak-to-peak amplitude [&ge;]50V. Results Greater sub-rejection-threshold activity significantly increases MEP probability in controls (p<0.0004) and people with ALS (p=0.0010). Models predicted a 31-38% increase in MEP probability when baseline RMS-EMG amplitude increased from 1V to 9V. Sub-rejection-threshold baseline activity was significantly greater in ALS than controls (p=0.0055). Conclusions We have shown for the first time that higher EMG amplitudes below a typical rejection threshold markedly increase probability of evoking an MEP with peak-to-peak amplitude [&ge;]50V. Researchers should take measures to account for effects of sub-rejection-threshold activity on RMT, particularly in populations where baseline activity may be elevated, such as in ALS.

">Increased neuronal activity restores circadian functionin Drosophila models of C9orf72-ALS/FTD</a></h4>

              
                Circadian rhythm disruptions are common across neurodegenerative diseases, but their link to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) remains unclear. The C9orf72 hexanucleotide repeat expansion is the most prevalent genetic cause of ALS/FTD. Here, we used Drosophila models expressing toxic arginine-rich dipeptides (PR or GR) or GGGGCC hexanucleotide repeats to investigate circadian deficits in C9orf72-ALS/FTD. We found that circadian rhythmicity and period length were disrupted in a repeat number-, dosage-, and age-dependent manner. Additionally, we observed lower levels of the neuropeptide PDF, a key regulator of free-running circadian rhythms, as well as decreased projection complexity and reduced neuronal activity in PDF-expressing neurons. Importantly, increases in neuronal activity significantly restored circadian function under select conditions. These results implicate reduced neuronal activity in C9orf72-ALS/FTD circadian deficits, underscoring the importance of precisely tuned, circuit- and stage-specific interventions.

">Surgical Removal of Visceral Adipose Tissue has Therapeutic Benefit in Male APPNL-F Mice</a></h4>

              
                Purpose: Visceral white adipose tissue (vWAT) accumulation causes systemic inflammation, insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, and senescent cell accumulation that are risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Visceral fat removal (VFR) improves metabolism and reduces proinflammatory cytokines. We hypothesized that VFR removal in AD mice would improve metabolism and cognition. Methods: Male and female APPNL-F mice underwent sham or vWAT surgical resection (epididymal and perirenal) at 4 (pre-symptomatic) and 16 (symptomatic) months of age to understand interventional and therapeutic effects, respectively. At 18 months of age, glucose metabolism and novel object recognition (NOR) memory were assayed followed by assessment of body composition and tissue-specific markers of metabolism, cell senescence, inflammation, or amyloid accumulation. Results: Male and female APPNL-F mice showed distinct VFR responses. In pre-symptomatic males, increased vWAT lipolysis and hepatic lipogenesis led to ectopic liver lipid accumulation, with reduced adiponectin and leptin, elevated visfatin, and impaired glucose metabolism. Symptomatic males showed reduced vWAT lipogenesis, enhanced hepatic lipolysis, glycolysis, and glycogenesis, lowering liver lipids and improving insulin sensitivity. Only symptomatic males improved NOR, linked to elevated hippocampal learning and memory markers. Female vWAT reaccumulation was due to increased lipogenesis and lower lipolysis. Pre-symptomatic females had lower hepatic lipogenesis, while glycolysis and glycogenesis declined with disease progression. Hippocampal senescence and inflammation were elevated early in the disease that persisted symptomatically. Conclusions: Sex-specific differences in glucose and lipid metabolism and lipid accumulation underlie the divergent responses to VFR in APPNL-F mice, with symptomatic males showing the only beneficial outcomes in metabolism and cognition.

">Modulation of repopulating microglia in multiple sclerosis models with implications for neuroprotection</a></h4>

              
                Microglia play a critical role in central nervous system (CNS) pathologies including multiple sclerosis (MS), and their modulation offers therapeutic potential especially during progressive disease courses. Using cell culture and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) models, we investigated microglial dynamics during depletion and repopulation (MGrepo) and their modulation using siponimod (sipo), an established CNS penetrating MS medication. Repopulating microglia exhibited a transient reactive state (CD86, MHC-II, Il1b, Tnf). Sipo modulated microglia populations, increasing CD163+, CD206+, and CX3CR1+ while reducing CD86+MHC-II+ cells accompanied by a reduction of neuronal damage. Proteomic spinal cord analysis revealed protein expression alterations by MGrepo and sipo linked to inflammation, myelination, and neuronal structural organization, supported by RNA sequencing of the spinal cord. The neuroinflammation attenuating role of sipo could be linked to cell maintenance and myelin formation associated processes. These findings highlight the capacity of pharmacological interventions to modulate microglia, offering new insights into therapeutic strategies targeting microglial activity in neuroinflammatory diseases.

">Tau drives cell specific functional isolation of the hippocampal formation</a></h4>

              
                A major challenge in understanding Alzheimer's disease is linking changes that occur across different biological scales. For example, how do changes in individual neurons build into widespread network disruptions? To address this, we used flexible mesh electronics to record neuronal activity for six months in ThyTau22 mice, a model of tauopathy that accumulates mutant human tau with age. Electrophysiology was recorded simultaneously from the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex of awake, behaving mice. At all ages we observed neuron-level, tau-driven silencing including ages without detectable tangles or cell-death. We found an unexpected phenomenon: neurons silenced by tau spontaneously recover individual firing patterns, yet these neurons fail to regain normal network interactions. Thus, as the animals age, disrupted network-level activity emerges. Specifically, we observe a global decrease in excitatory interactions and a breakdown in gamma-band coherence, which is particularly disrupted between the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus. These observations reveal a temporal relationship between neuronal silencing and impaired network connectivity, which also contributes to a progressive disruption in the excitatory/inhibitory balance. This ultimately disconnects viable entorhinal-hippocampal connections, physiologically isolating the hippocampus. Importantly, this network dysfunction is not driven by neuron loss, but by the failure of neurons to re-establish proper network interactions after silencing. This reveals a previously unrecognized mechanism by which mutant tau can destabilize neural systems. Further, these experiments indicate that a therapeutic window may exist where neuronal function and network activity might still be restored prior to irreversible degeneration.

">Circuit inhibition promotes the dynamic reorganization of prefrontal task encoding to support cognitive flexibility</a></h4>

              
                The mammalian prefrontal cortex encodes variables related to goal-directed behavior, and enables flexibility during environmental changes, making it critical to understand how the dynamic updating vs. stable maintenance of different encodings contribute to behavioral adaptation. We addressed this by comparing prefrontal encoding during successful adaptation vs. maladaptive perseveration. Specifically, we studied mutant (Dlx5/6+/-) mice, which have dysfunctional parvalbumin-expressing inhibitory interneurons and perseverate in a rule shifting task. We measured mPFC activity patterns using microendoscopic calcium imaging, then used linear classifiers and neural networks to compare representational geometries in wild-type mice and Dlx5/6+/- mutants before, during, and after benzodiazepine treatment, which persistently rescues their rule shift learning. The encoding of correct vs. incorrect trial outcomes rapidly shifts as mice successfully learn new cue-reward associations, but becomes more stable when mutant mice perseverate. We also find activity patterns that normally distinguish learning of the initial association vs. rule shift, but become diminished during perseveration. Finally, during perseveration, outdated representations are inappropriately reinstated, not just passively maintained. These results reveal prefrontal contributions to flexible behavior driven by the dynamic reorganization of abstract rule representations, rather than stable reinforcement signals.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Electroencephalography (EEG) microstate sequences, representing whole-brain spatial potential distribution patterns of the EEG, help capture spatiotemporally continuous and fluctuating neural dynamics with high temporal resolution through appropriate discretization. Recent studies suggest that EEG microstate transitions are gradual and continuous phenomena, contrary to the classical view of binary transitions. To update conventional microstate analysis to reflect continuous EEG dynamics and examine differences in age-related electrophysiological state transitions, we considered the relative positions of EEG microstates on the neural manifold and their topographical polarity. Transition probability results revealed fewer transitions on the microstate D-C-E axis in older adults but increased transitions among microstates A, D, B, and E that were mainly observed within polarity and A-B between polarity. Furthermore, the 100 microstate transitions, which are variations of the shortest transitions between 10 microstates, could be reduced to 8 principal components based on each transition co-occurrence, including hubs C and E, planar transitions through msA/B and D, and unidirectional transition components. Several transition components were potentially significant predictors of age group, independent of age-related alpha activity reductions. These patterns remained stable across longer continuous transitions over time and were nearly replicated in independent data, indicating their robustness in characterizing age-related electrophysiological spatiotemporal dynamics.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Working memory is an important cognitive process that develops throughout early life. During adolescence, there is marked improvement in this process that is associated with structural and functional brain changes. These changes have been linked to age; however, endogenous testosterone is thought to regulate structural and functional changes in the brain during puberty, with differential influences across adolescence into early adulthood. Thus, testosterone may have a direct impact on brain activity that is modulated by age. The current study aimed to examine this using a working memory functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) task in adolescents and young adults. Saliva samples collected prior to scanning were assayed for endogenous testosterone levels. One hundred and forty-five typically developing participants (74 female), aged 12–25 yr, completed a working memory fMRI task. Results showed that, for the most difficult versus the 0back conditions, younger female participants (≤19) only had more deactivation in the anterior cingulate cortex with higher level of testosterone. In contrast, male participants showed increased activation in the precentral gyrus with higher testosterone, regardless of age. These findings indicate sex differences in how endogenous testosterone relates to the activity of different brain regions recruited during working memory. Furthermore, these associations vary across typical adolescent development.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Although episodic memory is typically impaired in older adults (OAs) compared to young adults (YAs), this deficit is attenuated when OAs can leverage their rich semantic knowledge, such as their knowledge of schemas.

Neuroimaging studies have associated schema use with the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), angular gyrus (AG), and hippocampus (HPC), but most of this research has been limited to YAs. This fMRI study investigated the neural mechanisms underlying how schemas boost episodic memory in OAs. Participants encoded scene-object pairs with varying congruency, and memory for the objects was tested the following day. Congruency with schemas enhanced object memory for YAs and, more substantially, for OAs. fMRI analyses examined cortico-hippocampal interactions at encoding. We found that a vmPFC-HPC interaction was related to enhanced subsequent memory for congruent objects in both age groups, whereas an AG-HPC interaction contributed to subsequent memory for congruent objects only in OAs. Individual difference analyses of the AG-HPC interaction suggested that OAs made use of semantic knowledge to facilitate encoding. Collectively, our findings illustrate age-related differences in how schemas influence episodic memory encoding via distinct cortico-hippocampal interactions.</span>

Iron homeostasis in this region is essential for neurotransmitter synthesis, especially for dopamine, and thus, iron dysregulation may contribute to the symptomatology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, iron deposition and functional circuits of the SN in the autistic brain remain underexplored. This study investigated iron deposition and functional connectivity (FC) of the SN in 53 adult males with ASD and 99 typically developing controls using quantitative susceptibility mapping and resting-state fMRI. Compared to controls, the ASD group exhibited higher magnetic susceptibility in the right SN, suggesting elevated iron deposition. Within the ASD group, higher iron deposition was associated with more severe socio-communicative deficits and reduced sensory-seeking behavior. Seed-based FC analyses further revealed that the ASD group exhibited stronger FC between the right SN and bilateral visual cortices and reduced FC with the right superior frontal gyrus. These results highlight the critical role of the SN in the autistic brain and indicate that altered iron homeostasis in the SN may contribute to disruptions in the dopaminergic system that underlie the core symptoms of ASD.</span>

">Attention-related sampling of targets rhythmically alternates with increased susceptibility to co-occurring distractors</a></h4>

              
                The Rhythmic Theory of Attention proposes that visual spatial attention is characterized by alternating states that promote either sampling at the present focus of attention or a higher likelihood of shifting attentional resources to another location. While theta-rhythmically (4-8 Hz) occurring windows of opportunity for shifting attentional resources might provide cognitive flexibility, these windows might also make us more susceptible to distractors. Here, we used EEG in humans to test how frequency-specific neural activity phasically influences behavioral performance and visual processing when high-contrast distractors co-occur with low-contrast targets. For trials with and without distractors, perceptual sensitivity at the cued target location depended on pre-stimulus theta phase (~7 Hz) recorded at central electrodes. For trials with distractors, there was a greater increase in false alarm rates at the same theta phase associated with lower hit rates (i.e., during the proposed 'shifting state'), confirming theta-rhythmically occurring windows of increased susceptibility to distractors. In addition to these phase-behavior effects at central electrodes, we observed phase-behavior effects at frontocentral and occipital electrodes that (i) only occurred on trials with distractors, (ii) peaked in the alpha-frequency range (~9-10 Hz) and (iii) were strongest at occipital electrodes that were contralateral to distractors. Alpha phase at these electrodes was also associated with fluctuations in the amplitude of distractor-evoked visual responses, consistent with an alpha-mediated gating of distractors. The present findings thus provide evidence for distinct theta- and alpha-mediated mechanisms of spatial attention that phasically modulate the influence of distractors on task performance.

">A switch in kappa opioid receptor signaling from inhibitory to excitatory induced by stress in a subset of cortically-projecting dopamine neurons</a></h4>

              
                The kappa opioid receptor (KOR) has shown potential as a therapeutic target for several neuropsychiatric disorders including major depressive disorder, pain, and substance use disorder. In vivo signaling of G protein coupled receptors like the KOR is generally thought to change in magnitude but not sign in such behavior states. Here we investigated KOR modulation of ventral tegmental area (VTA) neurons following an acute, behaviorally aversive manipulation. We found this switches KOR signaling from inhibitory to excitatory in a subset of VTA dopamine neurons. Brief corticotrophin releasing factor (CRF) exposure ex vivo rapidly induces a similar switch in KOR signaling, specifically in dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) projecting neurons, but not nucleus accumbens or basolateral amygdala projecting neurons. These KOR mediated excitations depend on G protein activation, but where somatodendritic VTA KORs activate a K+ conductance to hyperpolarize dopamine neurons in control conditions, depolarizations require HCN channel function. One behavioral impact of this change is a loss of the aversiveness of intra-VTA KOR activation, providing direct evidence that rapid changes in GPCR signaling pathways can be triggered by activity at other GPCRs and significantly alter behavioral responses driven by neuromodulators.

">Mesocorticolimbic reinforcement learning of reward representation and value provides an integrated mechanistic account for schizophrenia</a></h4>

              
                Mesocorticolimbic dopamine projections are crucial for value learning, motivational control, and cognitive functions, but their precise neurocomputational roles remain elusive. Based on recent experimental and theoretical findings, we constructed a neural circuit model where dopamine neuronal populations receive differential inputs from individual rewards and encode heterogeneous reward prediction errors, which train cortical and striatal neurons to learn reward-associated state representation and value. Learning is achieved via simultaneous 'alignments' of the cortical and striatal downstream connections to the mesocorticolimbic dopamine projections, and inhibition-dominance in the cortical recurrent network is a key for successful learning. Excessive excitation, whether pre-existing or induced by manipulations, leads to aberrant activity, which disrupts the alignments and even causes anti-alignment. This impairs both reward-specific motivational control and credit assignment, potentially explaining the negative and positive symptoms of schizophrenia, respectively. Our model thus provides a mechanistic account for schizophrenia, integrating the different causes and symptoms, with testable predictions.

">Expectations and Motor Signals Shape Auditory Evoked Responses in an Independent Manner</a></h4>

              
                Voluntary actions are usually accompanied by sensory consequences that evoke neural responses in relevant sensory regions. These evoked responses are different when compared to those evoked by otherwise identical physical stimulation not associated with preceding actions (sensory attenuation). A common model suggests that sensory attenuations are caused by efference signals associated with the binding of actions with sensory outcomes. Nevertheless, the information encoded in such signals is debated, with some theories suggesting they convey predictive information while others suggest they convey global motor information regardless of specific outcome expectations. To address this debate, we recorded EEG data while participants (n=30) learned to associate motor or visual cues with corresponding tones. Following 8 repetitions of cue-tone learning, participants successfully learnt the association (>84% correct). At the neural level, the amplitude of auditory evoked responses (N100) decreased across repetitions, as the binding between cues and tones strengthened. In addition, N100 amplitude was attenuated when preceded by motor vs. visual cues. Most importantly, we did not find an interaction effect between repetition and cue type, suggesting a similar sensory attenuation effect across repetitions. Specifically, we show significant sensory attenuation even at the first repetition, when no expectation could be formed. Thus, our results suggest that the sensory attenuation effect does not change while forming experience with action-outcome contingency. These results have implications for contemporary models of sensorimotor control and predictive mechanisms.

                AGO-APP through the expression of the T6B peptide permits the isolation of Ago-bound miRNAs. Here we present the generation and characterization of two transgenic mouse lines allowing to perform AGO-APP in vivo. First, we generated mice for CRE-dependent expression of T6B in the cytoplasm. Using this line we performed Ago-APP in olfactory bulb (OB) inhibitory interneurons and cerebral cortex excitatory neurons. Bioinformatic analysis validated the high reproducibility of the approach. It also demonstrated that, despite global miRNome conservation between the two cell types, a set of miRNAs including the miR-200 family and the miR-183/96/182 cluster, is massively enriched in OB interneurons which is consistent with previous observations. In the second mouse line T6B is fused to the postsynaptic protein PSD95. Isolation of T6B-PSD95 fractions from OB and cortical neurons identified specific sets of post-synapse enriched miRNAs. Gene ontology analyses confirmed that these miRNAs preferentially target mRNAs related to synaptic functions.

">Dissociable Spatial and Feature Tuning of Gamma and Alpha Rhythms in Human Visual Cortex</a></h4>

              
                Visual stimulation in humans reliably induces narrowband gamma (40 - 80 Hz) increases and alpha (8 - 12 Hz) suppression in EEG, but the relationship between these rhythms is not fixed. Using high-density EEG, we mapped gamma and alpha responses across a broad set of retinotopic, orientation, and motion conditions. Gamma was strongly retinotopically tuned, with linear summation of subfield responses accurately predicting full-field responses. In contrast, alpha showed little spatial tuning, substantial responses even in the absence of visual input (anticipatory suppression), and subadditive summation consistent with divisive normalization. Across most retinotopic configurations, higher gamma coincided with stronger alpha suppression, yet systematic dissociations emerged, with full-field and foveal-centered gratings evoking stronger than expected gamma relative to alpha suppression. Orientation tuning was robust for gamma but weak for alpha, with oblique gratings producing high gamma yet weak alpha suppression, reversing the usual inverse relationship. These patterns indicate that EEG gamma power primarily reflects large-scale synchronous activity that matches the global LFP observed in macaque V1, whose spatial and feature tuning properties are independent of both single-neuron selectivity and feedback-driven alpha dynamics. The results establish a mechanistic dissociation between gamma and alpha rhythms, highlighting distinct circuit origins and tuning principles for these canonical visual responses.

">Attenuated CaV1.2-BK channel protein interaction in bipolar disorder</a></h4>

              
                Bipolar disorder (BP) is a severe mental illness featured with potential cycling of depressive and manic episodes. The recurrent cycling is known to be associated with poor prognosis. Thus, it is important to decipher the pathophysiological mechanism that may possibly underlie the cycling. In our study, by using BP patient-derived neurons, we discovered the delay of time-to-peak in depolarization-associated intracellular calcium dynamics. This cellular deficit is selectively associated with the number of manic episodes in BP patients, suggesting that this deficit may participate in the mechanism of clinical cycling. We also observed an attenuated protein interaction between the calcium and voltage-activated potassium (BK) channel and the CaV1.2 L-type VGCC in BP patients. Pharmacological and molecular interventions that target CaV1.2-BK protein interaction, directly to BK channel for the amelioration of this attenuated protein interaction rescues the disease-associated intracellular calcium deficit. To test the involvement of BK channel in cycling-associated behaviors, we generated a novel animal model.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Socioeconomic status (SES) and lifestyle activities (LA) are strongly related, and both are associated with dementia risk. We investigated the influence of SES and LA on brain atrophy and cognitive decline considering amyloid-beta (Aβ) positron emission tomography and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) load.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We investigated 221 older adults (mean age, 67.1 ± 8.2 years) who underwent cognitive testing annually over a median follow-up period of 3.4 years. Longitudinal T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging was available for 181 participants. Measures of SES and LA were collected using questionnaires and combined to SES and LA scores using a latent variable approach. We used linear mixed-effects models to investigate if SES and LA are independently or interactively with Aβ and WMH load associated with decline in domains language, processing speed/attention, executive function, and episodic memory. Mediation models assessed whether these associations were explained by gray matter atrophy.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>SES and LA were associated with better cognitive performance at baseline, but were not associated with cognitive decline over time. In interaction with brain pathologies, higher LA reduced the detrimental effects of Aβ and WMH load on language decline, whereas higher SES reduced the detrimental effects of Aβ pathology on episodic memory decline. Individuals with low SES showed faster Aβ-related gray matter atrophy, which mediated the association between Aβ and episodic memory decline but not language decline.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These results suggest that multiple resilience mechanisms underlie the protective effects of SES and LA on cognitive decline. Interventions targeting SES-related risk factors may be most effective when implemented early, before neurodegenerative changes begin. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Tofersen is the first effective and approved therapy for superoxide dismutase 1 (<i>SOD1</i>)-associated amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS [SOD1-ALS]). Following treatment with tofersen, neurofilament levels in patients' cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum seem to respond earlier than clinical parameters. This evidence prompted us to hypothesize that this novel treatment could provide an opportunity to identify additional biomarkers responsive to therapy in SOD1-ALS.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>We investigated a panel of 120 neural, glial, and inflammatory markers in CSF and serum samples longitudinally collected from a total of 28 SOD1-ALS patients at baseline, and after 3, 6 and 12 months of treatment with tofersen, followed by validation with conventional methodology.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We identified a set of proteins, including neurofilament light chain, neurofilament heavy chain, amyloid-beta 1–40 and amyloid-beta 1–42, neuropeptide Y (NPY), and ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCHL1), whose CSF levels both differed between SOD1-ALS and the control group, and were responsive to tofersen at 3 and 6 months after treatment initiation. Another group of markers, including the neuropentraxin (NPTX) family members NPTX1, NPTX2 and NPTXR, did not separate untreated SOD1-ALS from controls, but was responsive to tofersen. At 12 months on tofersen the levels of neurofilament light chain, neurofilament heavy chain, NPTX1, NPTX2, and NPTXR remained reduced compared with baseline, and correlated with the clinical response to tofersen. Consistent with increasing CSF pleocytosis and intrathecal immunoglobulin production, inflammatory markers were significantly increased after 12 months of treatment.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Our results highlight a complex, time-dependent differential response of CSF biomarkers to tofersen treatment, and may pave the way for developing a panel of responsive proteins to make biomarker endpoints more robust in clinical trials for SOD1-ALS and beyond.

                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The understanding of neurofilament light chain (NfL) presence and release in oligodendrocytes is limited. This study aims to determine the NfL expression in oligodendrocytes, investigate whether excess ɑ-synuclein (α-syn) impacts NfL expression, release, and functions in oligodendrocytes, as well as detect plasma NfL-positive oligodendrocyte-derived extracellular vesicles (ODEVs) changes in patients with multiple system atrophy (MSA), Parkinson's disease (PD), and healthy controls (HCs).</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>NfL expression in oligodendrocytes was assessed using RNAscope and immunofluorescence staining in human and mouse brain slices, as well as flow cytometry in mouse brain single-cells. The MO3.13 oligodendrocyte cell line was used to mimic MSA pathology with α-syn overexpression or preformed fibril treatment. NfL levels were detected in cell line, brain tissues and condition media, and the differences between MSA pathology and controls were compared. Plasma NfL-positive ODEVs were quantified using nano-scale flow cytometry in a cohort of 101 MSA patients, 96 PD patients, and 97 HCs.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Both <i>NEFL</i> mRNA and NfL protein showed co-localization with typical oligodendrocyte marker anti-2,3-cyclic nucleotide-3-phosphodiesterase (CNPase). A total of 58.5% of CNPase-positive oligodendrocytes co-expressed NfL. Increased α-syn load elevates NfL expression in both oligodendrocyte cell line and MSA patient brain slices. NfL overexpression inhibited oligodendrocyte maturation, but did not affect α-syn-induced cell viability deficits. α-Syn promoted oligodendrocytic NfL release via extracellular vesicles. Plasma NfL-positive ODEVs were elevated in MSA patients compared to PD and HCs.</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>These findings suggest additional cellular roles for NfL in oligodendrocytes beyond its established function in neurons and have potential implications for the neurodegenerative pathophysiology of MSA. ANN NEUROL 2025</p>

">Local homeostasis preserves global neural dynamics compensating for structural loss during human lifespan aging</a></h4>

              
                Aging brain undergoes a structural decline over lifespan accompanied by changes in neurotransmitter levels, leading to altered functional markers. Past studies have reported human resting state brain display a remarkable preservation of coordination among neural assemblies stemming from an underlying neurocomputational principles along aging trajectories, however, the true nature of which remains unknown. Here, we identify the computational mechanisms with which neurotransmitters, such as altered GABA and glutamate concentrations, can preserve functional integration across lifespan aging, despite structural decline. We employ multiscale, biophysically grounded modeling, constrained by the empirically derived anatomical connectome of the human brain, where the neurotransmitter concentrations can be free parameters that are algorithmically adjusted to maintain regional homeostasis and optimal working point. The two estimated neurotransmitters can maintain critical firing rates in the brain region and mimic age-associated functional connectivity patterns, consistent with empirical observations. We identified invariant GABA and reduced glutamate as the principle computational mechanism that can explain the topological variation of functional connectivity along lifespan, validated using graph-theoretic metrics. The results are subsequently replicated on three distinct datasets. Thus, the study offers an operational framework that integrates brain network dynamics at macroscopic and molecular scales, to gain insight into age-associated neural disorders.

">ATXN2 polyglutamine expansion impairs QKI-dependent alternative splicing and oligodendrocyte maintenance</a></h4>

              
                Background: Polyglutamine (polyQ) tract expansion mutations in Ataxin-2 gene (ATXN2) are associated with neurodegenerative diseases spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), while the therapeutic reduction of ATXN2 confers strong health-/lifespan extension in models of both disorders. Although the involvement of ATXN2 in peripheral lipid metabolism has been elaborated in Atxn2 knock-out mice, its impact on nervous system lipid maintenance and a potential influence on oligodendrocytes remains unexplored. Methods: We examine the nervous tissue of an authentic ATXN2 polyQ expansion mouse model in terms of (i) gross morphology of the brain and differential glial affection via immunohistochemical analyses, (ii) spinocerebellar proteome profile via label-free mass spectroscopy and (iii) alternative splicing patterns of oligodendroglial transcripts via quantitative RT-PCR. Finally, electrophysiological recording of sensory response in cerebellar Purkinje cells was performed as a phenotypic measure of demyelination. Results: We demonstrate a massive impairment in myelin maintenance due to ATXN2 polyQ expansion, affecting key oligodendroglial proteins accompanied by their splicing anomalies much earlier than disease manifestation. Oligodendroglial ATXN2 aggregates were documented for the first time in cerebellum, which sequestrated the RNA splicing factor Quaking (QKI). As an outcome of demyelination, our SCA2 model showed a significant delay in response to sensory stimuli. Conclusions: Overall, we provide pioneer evidence of oligodendroglial proteotoxicity leading to myelin maintenance defects in an authentic mouse model of SCA2. Our findings suggest that not only neuronal metabolism, but also that of oligodendroglia depends on ATXN2 and is affected during the disease course. This novel aspect of ATXN2 pathomechanism sheds light on potential new outcomes of its therapeutic manipulation, and makes it relevant also for demyelination syndromes next to SCA2 and other polyQ disorders.

High-resolution posture tracking of <i>C. elegans</i> has applications in genetics, neuroscience, and drug screening. While classic methods can reliably track isolated worms on uniform backgrounds, they fail when worms overlap, coil, or move in complex environments. Model-based tracking and deep learning approaches have addressed these issues to an extent, but there is still significant room for improvement in tracking crawling worms. Here we train a version of the DeepTangle algorithm developed for swimming worms using a combination of data derived from Tierpsy tracker and hand-annotated data for more difficult cases. DeepTangleCrawl (DTC) outperforms existing methods, reducing failure rates and producing more continuous, gap-free worm trajectories that are less likely to be interrupted by collisions between worms or self-intersecting postures (coils). We show that DTC enables the analysis of previously inaccessible behaviours and increases the signal-to-noise ratio in phenotypic screens, even for data that was specifically collected to be compatible with legacy trackers including low worm density and thin bacterial lawns. DTC broadens the applicability of high-throughput worm imaging to more complex behaviours that involve worm-worm interactions and more naturalistic environments including thicker bacterial lawns.

                <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Expression of immediate early genes (IEGs) is critical for memory formation and has been widely used to identify the neural substrate of memory traces, termed memory engram cells. Functions of IEGs have been known to be different depending on their types. However, there is limited knowledge about the extent to which different types of IEGs are selectively or concurrently involved in the formation of memory engram. To address this question, we investigated the combinative expression of c-Fos, Arc, and Npas4 proteins using immunohistochemistry following aversive and rewarding experiences across subregions in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), basolateral amygdala (BLA), hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG), and retrosplenial cortex (RSC). Using an automated cell detection algorithm, we found that expression patterns of c-Fos, Npas4, and Arc varied across different brain areas, with a higher increase of IEG expressing cells in the PFC and posterior BLA than in the DG. The combinative expression patterns, along with their experience-induced changes, also differed across brain areas; the co-expression of IEGs increased in the PFC and BLA following experience, whereas the increase was less pronounced in the DG and RSC. Furthermore, we demonstrate that different area-to-area functional connectivity networks were extracted by different IEGs. These findings provide insights into how different IEGs and their combinations identify engram cells, which will contribute to a deeper understanding of the functional significance of IEG-tagged memory engram cells.</p>

                Vision is crucial for effective navigation. Li et al. reveal that the dorsolateral nucleus, a higher-order thalamic area linking visual and navigational networks, encodes direction of optic flow and turning in free explorations, which contributes to spatial cognition and spatial memory.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/107534">Long-term live imaging, cell identification and cell tracking in regenerating crustacean legs</a></h4>

              
                High-resolution live imaging of regeneration presents unique challenges due to the nature of the specimens (large mobile animals), the duration of the process (spanning days or weeks), and the fact that cellular resolution must be achieved without damage caused by lengthy exposures to light. Building on previous work that allowed us to image different parts of the process of leg regeneration in the crustacean <i>Parhyale hawaiensis</i>, we present here a method for live imaging that captures the entire process of leg regeneration, spanning up to 10 days, at cellular resolution. Our method includes (1) mounting and long-term live imaging of regenerating legs under conditions that yield high spatial and temporal resolution but minimise photodamage, (2) fixing and in situ staining of the regenerated legs that were imaged, to identify cell fates, and (3) computer-assisted cell tracking to determine the cell lineages and progenitors of identified cells. The method is optimised to limit light exposure while maximising tracking efficiency. Combined with appropriate cell-type-specific markers, this method may allow the description of cell lineages for every regenerated cell type in the limb.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/103737">Human multiethnic radiogenomics reveals low-abundancy microRNA signature in plasma-derived extracellular vesicles for early diagnosis and molecular subtyping of pancreatic cancer</a></h4>

              
                Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a highly aggressive malignancy in humans, where early diagnosis significantly improves patient outcomes. However, effective methods for accurate and early detection remain limited. In this multiethnic study involving human subjects, we developed a liquid biopsy signature based on extracellular vesicle (EV)-derived microRNAs (miRNAs) linked to radiomics features extracted from patients’ tumor imaging. We integrated eight datasets containing clinical records, imaging data of benign and malignant pancreatic lesions, and small RNA sequencing data from plasma-derived EVs of PC patients. Radiomics features were extracted and analyzed using the limma package, with feature selection conducted via the Boruta algorithm and model construction through Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator regression. Radiomics-related low-abundance EV miRNAs were identified via weighted gene co-expression network analysis and validated for diagnostic accuracy using 10 machine-learning algorithms. Three key EV miRNAs were found to robustly distinguish malignant from benign lesions. Subsequent molecular clustering of these miRNAs and their predicted targets identified two PC subtypes, with distinct survival profiles and therapeutic responses. Specifically, one cluster was associated with prolonged overall survival and higher predicted sensitivity to immunotherapy, while the other indicated high-risk tumors potentially amenable to targeted drug interventions. This radiogenomic EV miRNA signature in human plasma represents a promising non-invasive biomarker for early diagnosis and molecular subtyping of PC, with potential implications for precision treatment strategies.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>The cortex plays a crucial role in various perceptual and cognitive functions, driven by its basic unit, the canonical cortical microcircuit. Yet, we remain short of a framework that definitively explains the structure-function relationships of this fundamental neuroanatomical motif. To better understand how physical substrates of cortical circuitry facilitate their neuronal dynamics, we employ a computational approach using recurrent neural networks and representational analyses. We examine the differences manifested by the inclusion and exclusion of biologically motivated interareal laminar connections on the computational roles of different neuronal populations in the microcircuit of hierarchically related areas throughout learning. Our findings show that the presence of feedback connections correlates with the functional modularization of cortical populations in different layers and provides the microcircuit with a natural inductive bias to differentiate expected and unexpected inputs at initialization, which we justify mathematically. Furthermore, when testing the effects of training the microcircuit and its variants with a predictive-coding-inspired strategy, we find that doing so helps better encode noisy stimuli in areas of the cortex that receive feedback, all of which combine to suggest evidence for a predictive-coding mechanism serving as an intrinsic operative logic in the cortex.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Sensory processing arises from the communication between neural populations across multiple brain areas. While the widespread presence of neural response variability shared throughout a neural population limits the amount of stimulus-related information those populations can accurately represent, how this variability affects the interareal communication of sensory information is unknown. We propose a mathematical framework to understand the impact of neural population response variability on sensory information transmission. We combine linear Fisher information, a metric connecting stimulus representation and variability, with the framework of communication subspaces, which suggests that functional mappings between cortical populations are low-dimensional relative to the space of population activity patterns. From this, we partition Fisher information depending on the alignment between the population covariance and the mean tuning direction projected onto the communication subspace or its orthogonal complement. We provide mathematical and numerical analyses of our proposed decomposition of Fisher information and examine theoretical scenarios that demonstrate how to leverage communication subspaces for flexible routing and gating of stimulus information. This work will provide researchers investigating interareal communication with a theoretical lens through which to understand sensory information transmission and guide experimental design.</span>

In this regard, a recent research thread in theoretical neuroscience has focused on how recurrent neural network models and their internal dynamics enact multitask learning. To manage different tasks requires a mechanism to convey information about task identity or context into the model, which from a biological perspective may involve mechanisms of neuromodulation. In this study, we use recurrent network models to probe the distinctions between two forms of contextual modulation of neural dynamics, at the level of neuronal excitability and at the level of synaptic strength. We characterize these mechanisms in terms of their functional outcomes, focusing on their robustness to context ambiguity and, relatedly, their efficiency with respect to packing multiple tasks into finite-size networks. We also demonstrate the distinction between these mechanisms at the level of the neuronal dynamics they induce. Together, these characterizations indicate complementarity and synergy in how these mechanisms act, potentially over many timescales, toward enhancing the robustness of multitask learning.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are reported to be overparametrized. The search for optimal (minimal) and sufficient architecture is an NP-hard problem: if the network has N neurons, then there are 2N possibilities to connect them—and therefore 2N possible architectures and 2N Boolean hyperparameters to encode them. Selecting the best possible hyperparameter out of them becomes an Np-hard problem since 2N grows in N faster then any polynomial Np. Here, we introduce a layer-by-layer data-driven pruning method based on the mathematical idea aiming at a computationally scalable entropic relaxation of the pruning problem. The sparse subnetwork is found from the pretrained (full) CNN using the network entropy minimization as a sparsity constraint. This allows deploying a numerically scalable algorithm with a sublinear scaling cost. The method is validated on several benchmarks (architectures): on MNIST (LeNet), resulting in sparsity of 55% <span style="font-style:italic;">to</span> 84% and loss in accuracy of just 0.1% to 0.5%, and on CIFAR-10 (VGG-16, ResNet18), resulting in sparsity of 73% to 89% and loss in accuracy of 0.1% to 0.5%.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Degeneracy—the ability of different structures to perform the same function—is a fundamental feature of biological systems, contributing to their robustness and evolvability. However, the ubiquity of degeneracy in systems generated through adaptive processes complicates our understanding of the behavioral and computational strategies they employ. In this study, we investigated degeneracy in simple computational agents, known as Markov brains, trained using an artificial evolution algorithm to solve a spatial navigation task with or without associative memory. We analyzed degeneracy at three levels: behavioral, structural, and computational, with a focus on the last. Using information-theoretical concepts, Tononi et al. (1999) proposed a functional measure of degeneracy within biological networks. Here, we extended this approach to compare degeneracy across multiple networks. Using information-theoretical tools and causal analysis, we explored the computational strategies of the evolved agents and quantified their computational degeneracy. Our findings reveal a hierarchy of degenerate solutions, from varied behaviors to diverse structures and computations. Even agents with identical evolved behaviors demonstrated different underlying structures and computations. These results underscore the pervasive nature of degeneracy in neural networks, blurring the lines between the algorithmic and implementation levels in adaptive systems, and highlight the importance of advanced analytical tools to understand their complex behaviors.</span>

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Gaussian processes are now commonly used in dimensionality reduction approaches tailored to neuroscience, especially to describe changes in high-dimensional neural activity over time. As recording capabilities expand to include neuronal populations across multiple brain areas, cortical layers, and cell types, interest in extending gaussian process factor models to characterize multipopulation interactions has grown. However, the cubic runtime scaling of current methods with the length of experimental trials and the number of recorded populations (groups) precludes their application to large-scale multipopulation recordings. Here, we improve this scaling from cubic to linear in both trial length and group number. We present two approximate approaches to fitting multigroup gaussian process factor models based on inducing variables and the frequency domain. Empirically, both methods achieved orders of magnitude speed-up with minimal impact on statistical performance, in simulation and on neural recordings of hundreds of neurons across three brain areas. The frequency domain approach, in particular, consistently provided the greatest runtime benefits with the fewest trade-offs in statistical performance. We further characterize the estimation biases introduced by the frequency domain approach and demonstrate effective strategies to mitigate them. This work enables a powerful class of analysis techniques to keep pace with the growing scale of multipopulation recordings, opening new avenues for exploring brain function.</span>

                <p>Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a bacterial endotoxin that induces innate immune responses. The present study aimed to elucidate alterations in cerebral cortical surface morphology induced by neonatal exposure to LPS using gyrencephalic ferrets. Male ferret pups received a subcutaneous injection of LPS (500&nbsp;&micro;g/g of body weight) on Postnatal Day (P)6 and P7. Furthermore, EdU and BrdU were administered on P5 and P7, respectively, to label postproliferative and proliferating cells that were exposed to LPS in the late stage of cortical neurogenesis. On P20 when the primary sulci and gyri had formed, MRI-based morphometry revealed an anterior shift in sulcal infolding in the medial and dorsolateral cortices of LPS-exposed ferrets. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that LPS increased the density of BrdU-labeled cells and reduced their apoptosis, as indicated by cleaved caspase-3 (cCasp3) immunostaining, in the outer stratum of the lateral sulcus located on the parietal association cortex. Furthermore, cCasp3 immunostaining of EdU-labeled cells was enhanced in the presylvian and lateral sulci located in the prefrontal and parietal association cortices, respectively, but was reduced in the coronal sulcus and gyrus located on the primary motor cortex in LPS-exposed ferrets. This study is the first to elucidate the effect of bacterial components on cerebral cortical sulcogyrogenesis, which is involved in the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders. Such altered sulcal topology may be attributed to a region-related effect on cortical neuron apoptosis in the medial and dorsolateral cortices caused by neonatal LPS exposure.</p>

Epigenetic mechanisms play a crucial role in driving transcript expression and shaping the phenotypic plasticity of glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs), contributing to tumor heterogeneity and therapeutic resistance. These mechanisms dynamically regulate the expression of key oncogenic and stemness-associated genes, enabling GSCs to adapt to environmental cues and evade targeted therapies. Importantly, epigenetic reprogramming allows GSCs to transition between cellular states, including therapy-resistant mesenchymal-like phenotypes, underscoring the need for epigenetic-targeting strategies to disrupt these adaptive processes. Understanding these epigenetic drivers of gene expression provides a foundation for novel therapeutic interventions aimed at eradicating GSCs and improving glioblastoma outcomes. Using machine learning (ML), we employ cross-patient prediction of transcript expression in GSCs by combining epigenetic features from various sources, including ATAC-seq, CTCF ChIP-seq, RNAPII ChIP-seq, H3K27Ac ChIP-seq, and RNA-seq. We investigate different ML and deep learning (DL) models for this task and ultimately build our final pipeline using XGBoost. The model trained on one patient generalizes to other 11 patients with high performance. Notably, H3K27Ac alone from a single patient is sufficient to predict gene expression in all 11 patients. Furthermore, the distribution of H3K27Ac peaks across the genomes of all patients is remarkably similar. These findings suggest that GSCs share a common distributional pattern of enhancer activity characterized by H3K27Ac, which can be utilized to predict gene expression in GSCs across patients. In summary, while GSCs are known for their transcriptomic and phenotypic heterogeneity, we propose that they share a common epigenetic pattern of enhancer activation that defines their underlying transcriptomic expression pattern. This pattern can predict gene expression across patient samples, providing valuable insights into the biology of GSCs.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003312">An arginine switch drives the stepwise activation of β-arrestin by CXCR7</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Jeong Seok Ji, Yaejin Yun, Tomasz Maciej Stepniewski, Hye-Jin Yoon, Kyungjin Min, Ji Young Park, Chiwoon Chung, Miguel Dieguez Eceolaza, Ka Young Chung, Jana Selent, Hyung Ho Lee</p>

β-arrestins (βarrs) play a crucial role in regulating G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling and trafficking. Canonically, interactions of βarr with the phosphorylated intracellular GPCR-tail induce a multi-step conformational transition that results in the activation of βarr. Depending on the specific interaction pattern with the receptor, βarrs adopt multiple conformational states, each tightly linked to a specific functional outcome of βarr recruitment. Despite its physiological relevance, the structural determinants of βarr activation remain poorly understood. Using a combination of molecular dynamics simulations, biochemical and cell-based experiments, we reveal how specific interactions with a chemokine receptor 7 (CXCR7) promote the unbinding of the βarr2 C-tail—a crucial step in arrestin activation. Importantly, we observe that the expulsion of the C-tail is promoted by the displacement of a conserved arginine residue (Arg394) within the βarr polar core, which we dub “the arginine switch.” Our study uncovers a role for the arginine switch that, upon engagement, destabilizes the polar core as a crucial step in the CXCR7-induced βarr activation.

              <h4><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003281">Orbitofrontal cortex computes gaze-dependent comparisons between attributes rather than integrated values</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Aster Q. Perkins, Erin L. Rich</p>

Economic decisions often require weighing multiple dimensions, or attributes. The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is thought to be important for computing the integrated value of an option from its attributes and comparing values to make a choice. Although OFC neurons are known to encode integrated values, evidence for value comparison has been limited. Here, we used a multi-attribute choice task for monkeys (<i>Macaca mulatta</i>) to investigate how OFC neurons integrate and compare multi-attribute options. By representing attributes with separate cues and using eye tracking to measure attention, we demonstrate that OFC neurons encode the value of attended attributes independent of other attributes in the same option. Encoding was negatively weighted by the value of the matching attribute in the other option, consistent with a comparison between like attributes. These results indicate that OFC computes comparisons between attributes rather than integrated values, and does so dynamically, shifting with the focus of attention.
