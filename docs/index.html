              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The role of single nucleotide polymorphisms of IL-1A -889C>T (rs1800587), TNF-A -238G>A (rs361525), and VDR TaqI (rs731236) on susceptibility to herniated nucleus pulposus [version 2; peer review: 1 approved, 1 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The pathogenesis of herniated nucleus pulposus (HNP) is complex and may involve the wide variety of gene polymorphism. However, the reports from the existing studies are inconclusive. The objective of this study was to determine the role of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in interleukin 1 alpha (IL-1A), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-A), and vitamin D receptor (VDR) genes on the susceptibility to herniated nucleus pulposus (HNP). Methods: Four databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, and Web of Science) were searched as of April 1 st, 2021. Authors, publication year, targeted genes, genotype and allele frequency in each case and control groups were collected. Newcastle-Ottawa scale was used to evaluate the publication quality. The pooled estimates of association of IL-1A -889C>T (rs1800587), TNF-A -238G>A (rs361525), and VDR TaqI (rs731236) and susceptibility to HNP were assessed using Z test. Results: We screened 3,067 unique studies for eligibility and three, two and nine case-control studies on IL-1A -889C>T, TNF-A -238G>A, and VDR TaqI were included, respectively, in our meta-analysis. The studies consisting 369 HNP cases and 433 controls for IL-1A -889C>T, 252 cases and 259 controls for TNF-A -238G>A and 1130 cases and 2096 controls for VDR TaqI. Our pooled estimates indicated that there was no significant association of those SNPs with the susceptibility to HNP in any genotype, dominant model, recessive model, or allele comparations. Conclusion: Although individual studies suggested the important role of gene expression dysregulation associated with SNPs in IL-1A, TNF-A, and VDR, our data indicated that IL-1A -889C>T, TNF-A -238G>A, and VDR TaqI had weak association with HNP susceptibility in both genotypes and allele distributions. However, since heterogeneity was identified among studies included in this meta-analysis, further meta-analysis with a larger population and subgroup analysis on specific population are warranted to support this finding.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Marine plant mediated green synthesis of silver nanoparticles using mangrove Rhizophora stylosa: Effect of variable process and their antibacterial activity [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Most natural plants used in the synthesis of silver nanoparticles are limited to marine plants. To carry out applications, colloidal silver nanoparticles (AgNps) should have appropriate properties such as homogeneous shapes, small and narrow particle size distribution, and long time stability. This study aims to determine the effects of a variable process of AgNps mediated mangrove Rhizophora stylosa (RS) leaf extract, and antibacterial activity.  Methods: Synthesis of AgNps was carried out by stirring silver nitrate solution with aqueous extract. The characterization of AgNps was carried out using UV-Vis spectrophotometry, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) zetasizer and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). Evaluation of antibacterial activity was carried out on Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. Reaction conditions such as the concentration of metal ions (0.001 M, 0.005 M, and 0.01 M), extracts (1%, 3%, and 5% v/v), and the reaction time on the size and stability of nanoparticles were also explored. Results: The UV-Vis spectroscopy showed an absorption of colloidal AgNps in a wavelength range of 403–443 nm.  TEM analysis showed that as-synthesized AgNps were spherical in shape with a size range of 5–87 nm. The use of 0.001 M and 0.005 M of Ag+ resulted in a smaller diameter than the synthesized AgNps, using 0.01 M Ag+, in the same extract concentration. The range of zeta potential was -24.9 mV to -27.7 mV. The as-synthesized AgNps were stable for more than one month. The XRD analysis showed four peaks, which were attributed to the face centered cubic crystal structure of metallic silver. The results of the silver nanoparticles synthesis showed good activity on Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, with an inhibition zone between 4.1–7.2 mm. Conclusions: The AgNps synthesized with RS leaf extract, which is a reducing agent, showed good potential as an antibacterial component.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">The need to reassess single-cell RNA sequencing datasets: more is not always better [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: The advent of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) and additional single-cell omics technologies have provided scientists with unprecedented tools to explore biology at cellular resolution. However, reaching an appropriate number of good quality reads per cell and reasonable numbers of cells within each of the populations of interest are key to infer conclusions from otherwise limited analyses. For these reasons, scRNAseq studies are constantly increasing the number of cells analysed and the granularity of the resultant transcriptomics analyses. Methods: We aimed to identify previously described fibroblast subpopulations in healthy adult human skin by using the largest dataset published to date (528,253 sequenced cells) and an unsupervised population-matching algorithm. Results: Our reanalysis of this landmark resource demonstrates that a substantial proportion of cell transcriptomic signatures may be biased by cellular stress and response to hypoxic conditions. Conclusions: We postulate that the ”more is better” approach, currently prevalent in the scientific community, might undermine the extent of the analysis, possibly due to long computational processing times inherent to large datasets.

                Background: This study investigated how the inclusion of Boesenbergia pandurata extract (BPE) in goldfish feed affects fish growth, immunity, and resistance to infection by Aeromonas hydrophila and Pseudomonas fluorescens.   Methods: Four fish feeds, were prepared by adding BPE at the concentrations of 0 (control), 2, 4, and 6 g kg-1, respectively, and 120 goldfish (Cyprinus carpio; initial weight 5 g) were separated into 12 boxes and fed with specific pellets and examined thrice. The experiment lasted 12 weeks, beginning with the different feeds, fish growth was measured at Weeks 4 and 8 after the feeding period. Moreover, a challenge test with pathogen bacteria to assay disease resistance was administered at Week 8 after the feeding period, and the survival rate and relative percentage of survival were quantified at Week 12.   Results: At Week 8, the goldfish that were fed BPE-containing feeds were significantly heavier than the fish that received the control feed (pellet without BPE), and the highest weight gain, reaching 72.44 g, was obtained with Pellet 3; accordingly, the specific growth rate after BPE treatment (5.7%) was higher than that after control treatment. Conversely, the feed conversion ratio in the control group, 2.03, was higher than the ratios in the BPE groups, which were decreased to 0.55–0.90. Lastly, BPE treatment consistently enhanced the immunity parameters of goldfish (relative to control treatment) at weeks 4 and 8, and following BPE treatment, the rate of resistance against bacterial infection, 68.3%–77.0%, was higher than that after control treatment.   Conclusions: BPE addition in goldfish feed clearly produces a positive effect by enhancing fish growth, immunity, and resistance to infection by pathogenic bacteria, and 4 g kg-1 is the optimal BPE concentration in feed prepared for goldfish.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis: to investigate the association of adherence to plant-based diets with cardiovascular disease risk [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Plant-based diets (PBDs) are characterised as healthy dietary patterns that emphasise the intake of plant foods and limit the intake of animal foods. The Mediterranean and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diets are common examples of healthy dietary patterns that are mainly plant based. There are different dietary pattern analysis approaches and scoring systems available to construct indices that measure adherence to a dietary pattern. Nutritional epidemiology studies necessitate the use of appropriate dietary indices when investigating diet-disease associations. Methods: This systematic review protocol was developed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis protocols (PRISMA-P) guidelines. PubMed–Medline, Scopus and relevant biomedical databases within EBSCOhost will be searched up to August 2021 using relevant key words. Two reviewers will independently screen the identified records and review the eligible full texts for inclusion. Discrepancies will be resolved by consensus or through discussion with a third reviewer. Appropriate meta-analysis will be performed where possible and consistency of the findings checked through subgroup analysis. Heterogeneity across studies will be assessed and quantified, and publication bias investigated. Relevant sensitivity analyses will be performed to substantiate the robustness of the study findings. Conclusion: Currently, there is some inconsistency in defining and measuring adherence to a PBD across study populations. In addition to this, a lack of global data on the association between adherence to a PBD and CVD risk. This systematic review could aid in promoting the worldwide uptake of these findings for policy and practice purposes. This research will use previously published studies; and therefore, will not require ethical approval.

<p>Binge ethanol activates astrocytes resulting in an increase in glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunoreactivity (red) in the basolateral amygdala. When astrocytic receptor signaling was activated using GFAP-Gq-GPCR designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs, it decreased ethanol consumption and ameliorated alcohol-induced depression of glutamate in the amygdala.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Binge drinking is a common occurrence in the United States, but a high concentration of alcohol in the blood has been shown to have reinforcing and reciprocal effects on the neuroimmune system in both dependent and non-dependent scenarios. The first part of this study examined alcohol's effects on the astrocytic response in the central amygdala and basolateral amygdala (BLA) in a non-dependent model. C57BL/6J mice were given access to either ethanol, water, or sucrose during a “drinking in the dark” paradigm, and astrocyte number and astrogliosis were measured using immunohistochemistry. Results indicate that non-dependent consumption increased glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) density but not the number of GFAP+ cells, suggesting that non-dependent ethanol is sufficient to elicit astrocyte activation. The second part of this study examined how astrocytes impacted behaviors and the neurochemistry related to alcohol using the chemogenetic tool, DREADDs (designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs). Transgenic GFAP-hM3Dq mice were administered clozapine N-oxide both peripherally, affecting the entire central nervous system (CNS), or directly into the BLA. In both instances, GFAP-Gq-signaling activation significantly reduced ethanol consumption and correlating blood ethanol concentrations. However, GFAP-Gq-DREADD activation throughout the CNS had more broad effects resulting in decreased locomotor activity and sucrose consumption. More targeted GFAP-Gq-signaling activation in the BLA only impacted ethanol consumption. Finally, a glutamate assay revealed that after GFAP-Gq-signaling activation glutamate concentrations in the amygdala were partially normalized to control levels. Altogether, these studies support the theory that astrocytes represent a viable target for alcohol use disorder therapies.</p>

<p>Male and female rats were exposed to adolescent intermittent ethanol (AIE; PND 30–45) and aged into adulthood (PND 70).

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Adolescent alcohol drinking is widely recognized as a significant public health problem, and evidence is accumulating that sufficient levels of consumption during this critical period of brain development have an enduring impact on neural and behavioral function. Recent studies have indicated that adolescent intermittent ethanol (AIE) exposure alters astrocyte function, astrocyte–neuronal interactions, and related synaptic regulation and activity. However, few of those studies have included female animals, and a broader assessment of AIE effects on the proteins mediating astrocyte-mediated glutamate dynamics and synaptic function is needed. We measured synaptic membrane expression of several such proteins in the dorsal and ventral regions of the hippocampal formation (DH, VH) from male and female rats exposed to AIE or adolescent intermittent water. In the DH, AIE caused elevated expression of glutamate transporter 1 (GLT-1) in both males and females, elevated postsynaptic density 95 expression in females only, and diminished NMDA receptor subunit 2A expression in males only. AIE and sex interactively altered ephrin receptor A4 (EphA4) expression in the DH. In the VH, AIE elevated expression of the cystine/glutamate antiporter and the glutamate aspartate transporter 1 (GLAST) in males only. Compared to males, female animals expressed lower levels of GLT-1 in the DH and greater levels of ephrin receptor B6 (EphB6) in the VH, in the absence of AIE effects. These results support the growing literature indicating that adolescent alcohol exposure produces long-lasting effects on astrocyte function and astrocyte-neuronal interactions. The sex and subregion specificity of these effects have mechanistic implications for our understanding of AIE effects generally.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are alarmingly common, result in significant personal and societal loss, and there is no effective treatment for these disorders. Cerebellar neuropathology is common in FASD and causes aberrant cognitive and motor function. Ethanol-induced neuroinflammation is believed to contribute to neuropathological sequelae of FASD, and was previously demonstrated in the cerebellum in animal models of FASD. We now demonstrate neuroinflammation persists in the cerebellum several days following cessation of ethanol treatment in an early postnatal mouse model, with meaningful implications for timing of therapeutic intervention in FASD. We also demonstrate by Sholl analysis that ethanol decreases ramification of microglia cell processes in cells located near the Purkinje cell layer but not those near the external granule cell layer. Ethanol did not alter the expression of anti-inflammatory molecules or molecules that constitute NLRP1 and NLRP3 inflammasomes. Interestingly, ethanol decreased the expression of IL-23a (P19) and IL-12Rβ1 suggesting that ethanol may suppress IL-12 and IL-23 signaling. Fractalkine-fractalkine receptor (CX3CL1-CX3CR1) signaling is believed to suppress microglial activation and our demonstration that ethanol decreases CX3CL1 expression suggests that ethanol modulation of CX3CL1-CX3CR1 signaling may contribute to cerebellar neuroinflammation and neuropathology. We demonstrate ethanol alters the expression of specific molecules in the cerebellum understudied in FASD, but crucial for immune responses. Ethanol increases the expression of NOX-2 and NGP and decreases the expression of RAG1, NOS1, CD59a, S1PR5, PTPN22, GPR37, and Serpinb1b. These molecules represent a new horizon as potential targets for development of FASD therapy.</p>

     alt="Extracellular microvesicles promote microglia-mediated pro-inflammatory responses to ethanol"/>
<p>Ethanol causes the secretion of pro-inflammatory microvesicles (MVs) from brain tissue. Ethanol-induced MVs reproduce the pro-inflammatory gene induction and microglial activation seen with ethanol alone, and inhibition of their secretion blocks ethanol-induced neuroinflammation. Microglia are required for the generation of pro-inflammatory MVs, with MV secretion involving activation of microglial PI3K.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Alcohol use disorder (AUD) pathology features pro-inflammatory gene induction and microglial activation. The underlying cellular processes that promote this activation remain unclear. Previously considered cellular debris, extracellular vesicles (EVs) have emerged as mediators of inflammatory signaling in several disease states. We investigated the role of microvesicles (MVs, 50 nm–100 µm diameter EVs) in pro-inflammatory and microglial functional gene expression using primary organotypic brain slice culture (OBSC). Ethanol caused a unique immune gene signature that featured: temporal induction of pro-inflammatory TNF-α and IL-1β, reduction of homeostatic microglia state gene Tmem119, progressive increases in purinergic receptor P2RY12 and the microglial inhibitory fractalkine receptor CX3CR1, an increase in the microglial presynaptic gene C1q, and a reduction in the phagocytic gene TREM2. MV signaling was implicated in this response as reduction of MV secretion by imipramine blocked pro-inflammatory TNF-α and IL-1β induction by ethanol, and ethanol-conditioned MVs (EtOH-MVs) reproduced the ethanol-associated immune gene signature in naïve OBSC slices. Depletion of microglia prior to ethanol treatment prevented pro-inflammatory activity of EtOH-MVs, as did incubation of EtOH-MVs with the HMGB1 inhibitor glycyrrhizin. Ethanol caused HMGB1 secretion from cultured BV2 microglia in MVs through activation of PI3 kinase. In summary, these studies find MVs modulate pro-inflammatory gene induction and microglial activation changes associated with ethanol. Thus, MVs may represent a novel therapeutic target to reduce neuroinflammation in the setting of alcohol abuse or other diseases that feature a neuroimmune component.

     alt="Microglia and astrocytes show limited, acute alterations in morphology and protein expression following a single developmental alcohol exposure"/>
<p>After a single, binge-level exposure to ethanol in development, we found subtle effects on glia in the mouse somatosensory cortex and hippocampus. Ethanol treatment reduced colocalization between two astrocytic markers, GFAP and Aldh1L1; induced region-specific changes in microglia volume, process morphology, and density; and had no effect on glial interactions.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are the most common cause of nonheritable, preventable mental disability and are characterized by cognitive, behavioral, and physical impairments. FASD occurs in almost 5% of births in the United States, but despite this prevalence there is no known cure, largely because the biological mechanisms that translate alcohol exposure to neuropathology are not well understood. While the effects of early ethanol exposure on neuronal survival and circuitry have received more attention, glia, the cells most closely tied to initiating and propagating inflammatory events, could be an important target for alcohol in the developing brain. Inflammation is known to alter developmental trajectories, but it has recently been shown that even small changes in both astrocytes and microglia in the absence of full-blown inflammatory signaling can alter brain function long-term. Here, we studied the acute response of astrocytes and microglia to a single exposure to ethanol in development across sexes in a mouse model of human third trimester exposure, in order to understand how these cells may transition from their normal developmental path to a different program that leads to FASD neuropathology. We found that although a single ethanol exposure delivered subcutaneously on postnatal day 4 did not cause large changes in microglial morphology or the expression of AldH1L1 and GFAP in the cortex and hippocampus, subtle effects were observed. These findings suggest that even a single, early ethanol exposure can induce mild acute alterations in glia that could contribute to developmental deficits.</p>

<p>Microglia structural reorganization, and altered neuroimmune signaling, are implicated in pathological adaptations that promote excessive drinking. Here we used Iba1 immunohistochemistry, high-resolution confocal microscopy, and digital reconstruction analyses of Iba1-positive microglia in the prelimbic (PL) cortex and nucleus accumbens (NAc) of rats during withdrawal from chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) exposure, rats injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and an ethanol-naïve (air)-exposed group. We found that CIE and LPS led to dichotomous alterations in microglia structural complexity in the PL cortex that were largely absent in the NAc. These findings add to a growing body of literature pointing towards altered microglia structural complexity, and presumably function, in ethanol-induced adaptations in the brain.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Accumulating evidence has linked pathological changes associated with chronic alcohol exposure to neuroimmune signaling mediated by microglia. Prior characterization of the microglial structure–function relationship demonstrates that alterations in activity states occur concomitantly with reorganization of cellular architecture. Accordingly, gaining a better understanding of microglial morphological changes associated with ethanol exposure will provide valuable insight into how neuroimmune signaling may contribute to ethanol-induced reshaping of neuronal function. Here we have used Iba1-staining combined with high-resolution confocal imaging and 3D reconstruction to examine microglial structure in the prelimbic (PL) cortex and nucleus accumbens (NAc) in male Long-Evans rats. Rats were either sacrificed at peak withdrawal following 15 days of exposure to chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) or 24 hr after two consecutive injections of the immune activator lipopolysaccharide (LPS), each separated by 24 hr. LPS exposure resulted in dramatic structural reorganization of microglia in the PL cortex, including increased soma volume, overall cellular volume, and branching complexity. In comparison, CIE exposure was associated with a subtle increase in somatic volume and differential effects on microglia processes, which were largely absent in the NAc. These data reveal that microglial activation following a neuroimmune challenge with LPS or exposure to chronic alcohol exhibits distinct morphometric profiles and brain region-dependent specificity.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Ethanol exposure to the fetus during pregnancy can result in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). These disorders vary in severity, can affect multiple organ systems, and can lead to lifelong disabilities. Damage to the central nervous system (CNS) is common in FASD, and can result in altered behavior and cognition. The incidence of FASD is alarmingly high, resulting in significant personal and societal costs. There are no cures for FASD. Alcohol can directly alter the function of neurons in the developing CNS. In addition, ethanol can alter the function of CNS glial cells including microglia and astrocytes which normally maintain homeostasis in the CNS. These glial cells can function as resident immune cells in the CNS to protect against pathogens and other insults. However, activation of glia can also damage CNS cells and lead to aberrant CNS function. Ethanol exposure to the developing brain can result in the activation of glia and neuroinflammation, which may contribute to the pathology associated with FASD. This suggests that anti-inflammatory agents may be effective in the treatment of FASD.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Glypicans define unique roles for the Hedgehog co-receptors Boi and Ihog in cytoneme-mediated gradient formation</a></h4>

              
                The conserved family of Hedgehog (Hh) signaling proteins plays a key role in cell-cell communication during development, tissue repair and cancer progression, inducing distinct concentration-dependent responses in target cells located at short and long distances. One simple mechanism for long distance dispersal of the lipid modified Hh is the direct contact between cell membranes through filopodia-like structures known as cytonemes. Here we have analyzed in <i>Drosophila</i> the interaction between the glypicans Dally and Dally-like protein, necessary for Hh signaling, and the adhesion molecules and Hh coreceptors Ihog and Boi. We describe that glypicans are required to maintain the levels of Ihog, but not of Boi. We also show that the overexpression of Ihog, but not of Boi, regulates cytoneme dynamics through their interaction with glypicans, the Ihog fibronectin III domains being essential for this interaction. Our data suggest that the regulation of glypicans over Hh signaling is specifically given by their interaction with Ihog in cytonemes. Contrary to previous data, we also show that there is no redundancy of Ihog and Boi functions in Hh gradient formation, being Ihog, but not of Boi, essential for the long-range gradient.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Discovery and characterization of Hv1-type proton channels in reef-building corals</a></h4>

              
                Voltage-dependent proton-permeable channels are membrane proteins mediating a number of important physiological functions. Here we report the presence of a gene encoding H<sub>v</sub>1 voltage-dependent, proton-permeable channels in two species of reef-building corals. We performed a characterization of their biophysical properties and found that these channels are fast-activating and modulated by the pH gradient in a distinct manner. The biophysical properties of these novel channels make them interesting model systems. We have also developed an allosteric gating model that provides mechanistic insight into the modulation of voltage-dependence by protons. This work also represents the first functional characterization of any ion channel in scleractinian corals. We discuss the implications of the presence of these channels in the membranes of coral cells in the calcification and pH-regulation processes and possible consequences of ocean acidification related to the function of these channels.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Naa12 compensates for Naa10 in mice in the amino-terminal acetylation pathway</a></h4>

              
                Amino-terminal acetylation is catalyzed by a set of N-terminal acetyltransferases (NATs). The NatA complex (including X-linked Naa10 and Naa15) is the major acetyltransferase, with 40-50% of all mammalian proteins being potential substrates. However, the overall role of amino-terminal acetylation on a whole-organism level is poorly understood, particularly in mammals. Male mice lacking <i>Naa10</i> show no globally apparent <i>in vivo</i> amino-terminal acetylation impairment and do not exhibit complete embryonic lethality. Rather <i>Naa10</i> nulls display increased neonatal lethality, and the majority of surviving undersized mutants exhibit a combination of hydrocephaly, cardiac defects, homeotic anterior transformation, piebaldism and urogenital anomalies. <i>Naa12</i> is a previously unannotated <i>Naa10</i>-like paralogue with NAT activity that genetically compensates for <i>Naa10</i>. Mice deficient for<i> Naa12</i> have no apparent phenotype, whereas mice deficient for <i>Naa10</i> and <i>Naa12 </i>display embryonic lethality. The discovery of <i>Naa12</i> adds to the currently known machinery involved in amino-terminal acetylation in mice.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The need for practical insecticide-resistance guidelines to effectively inform mosquito-borne disease control programs</a></h4>

              
                Monitoring local mosquito populations for insecticide resistance is critical for effective vector-borne disease control. However, widely used phenotypic assays, which are designed to monitor the emergence and spread of insecticide resistance (technical resistance), do not translate well to the efficacy of vector control products to suppress mosquito numbers in the field (practical resistance). This is because standard testing conditions such as environmental conditions, exposure dose, and type of substrate differ dramatically from those experienced by mosquitoes under field conditions. In addition, field mosquitoes have considerably different physiological characteristics such as age and blood-feeding status. Beyond this, indirect impacts of insecticide resistance and/or exposure on mosquito longevity, pathogen development, host-seeking behavior, and blood-feeding success impact disease transmission. Given the limited number of active ingredients currently available and the observed discordance between resistance and disease transmission, we conclude that additional testing guidelines are needed to determine practical resistance—the efficacy of vector control tools under relevant local conditions— in order to obtain programmatic impact.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Expanding the MECP2 network using comparative genomics reveals potential therapeutic targets for Rett syndrome</a></h4>

              
                Inactivating mutations in the Methyl-CpG Binding Protein 2 (MECP2) gene are the main cause of Rett syndrome (RTT). Despite extensive research into MECP2 function, no treatments for RTT are currently available. Here, we used an evolutionary genomics approach to construct an unbiased MECP2 gene network, using 1028 eukaryotic genomes to prioritize proteins with strong co-evolutionary signatures with MECP2. Focusing on proteins targeted by FDA-approved drugs led to three promising targets, two of which were previously linked to MECP2 function (IRAK, KEAP1) and one that was not (EPOR). The drugs targeting these three proteins (Pacritinib, DMF, and EPO) were able to rescue different phenotypes of MECP2 inactivation in cultured human neural cell types, and appeared to converge on Nuclear Factor Kappa B (NF-κB) signaling in inflammation. This study highlights the potential of comparative genomics to accelerate drug discovery, and yields potential new avenues for the treatment of RTT.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Non-linear dimensionality reduction on extracellular waveforms reveals cell type diversity in premotor cortex</a></h4>

              
                Cortical circuits are thought to contain a large number of cell types that coordinate to produce behavior. Current in vivo methods rely on clustering of specified features of extracellular waveforms to identify putative cell types, but these capture only a small amount of variation. Here, we develop a new method (WaveMAP) that combines non-linear dimensionality reduction with graph clustering to identify putative cell types. We apply WaveMAP to extracellular waveforms recorded from dorsal premotor cortex of macaque monkeys performing a decision-making task. Using WaveMAP, we robustly establish eight waveform clusters and show that these clusters recapitulate previously identified narrow- and broad-spiking types while revealing previously unknown diversity within these subtypes. The eight clusters exhibited distinct laminar distributions, characteristic firing rate patterns, and decision-related dynamics. Such insights were weaker when using featurebased approaches. WaveMAP therefore provides a more nuanced understanding of the dynamics of cell types in cortical circuits.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Unexpected plasticity in the life cycle of Trypanosoma brucei</a></h4>

              
                African trypanosomes cause sleeping sickness in humans and nagana in cattle. These unicellular parasites are transmitted by the bloodsucking tsetse fly. In the mammalian host's circulation, proliferating slender stage cells differentiate into cell cycle-arrested stumpy stage cells when they reach high population densities. This stage transition is thought to fulfil two main functions: first, it auto-regulates the parasite load in the host; second, the stumpy stage is regarded as the only stage capable of successful vector transmission. Here, we show that proliferating slender stage trypanosomes express the mRNA and protein of a known stumpy stage marker, complete the complex life cycle in the fly as successfully as the stumpy stage, and require only a single parasite for productive infection. These findings suggest a reassessment of the traditional view of the trypanosome life cycle. They may also provide a solution to a long-lasting paradox, namely the successful transmission of parasites in chronic infections, despite low parasitemia.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Mixed matrix factorization: a novel algorithm for the extraction of kinematic-muscular synergies</a></h4>

              
                Synergistic models have been employed to investigate motor coordination separately in the muscular and kinematic domains. However, the relationship between muscle synergies, constrained to be non-negative, and kinematic synergies, whose elements can be positive and negative, has received limited attention. Existing algorithms for extracting synergies from combined kinematic and muscular data either do not enforce non-negativity constraints or separate non-negative variables into positive and negative components. We propose a mixed matrix factorization (MMF) algorithm based on a gradient descent update rule which overcomes these limitations. It directly assesses the relationship between kinematic and muscle activity variables, by enforcing the non-negativity constrain on a subset of variables. We validated the algorithm on simulated kinematic-muscular data generated from known spatial synergies and temporal coefficients, by assessing the similarity between extracted and ground truth synergies and temporal coefficients when the data are corrupted by different noise levels. We also compared the performance of MMF to that of non-negative matrix factorization applied to separate positive and negative components (NMFpn). Finally, we factorized kinematic and EMG data collected during upper-limb movements to demonstrate the potential of the algorithm. MMF achieved almost perfect reconstruction on noiseless simulated data. It performed better than NMFpn in recovering the correct spatial synergies and temporal coefficients with noisy simulated data. It allowed to correctly select the original number of ground truth synergies. We showed meaningful applicability to real data. MMF can also be applied to any multivariate data that contains both non-negative and unconstrained variables.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Precision dynamical mapping using topological data analysis reveals a unique hub-like transition state at rest</a></h4>

              
                Even in the absence of external stimuli, neural activity is both highly dynamic and organized across multiple spatiotemporal scales. The continuous evolution of brain activity patterns during rest is believed to help maintain a rich repertoire of possible functional configurations that relate to typical and atypical cognitive phenomena. Whether these transitions or "explorations" follow some underlying arrangement or instead lack a predictable ordered plan remains to be determined. Here, using a precision dynamics approach, we aimed at revealing the rules that govern transitions in brain activity at rest at the single participant level. We hypothesized that by revealing and characterizing the overall landscape of whole brain configurations (or states) we could interpret the rules (if any) that govern transitions in brain activity at rest. To generate the landscape of whole-brain configurations we used Topological Data Analysis based Mapper approach. Across all participants, we consistently observed a rich topographic landscape in which the transition of activity from one state to the next involved a central hub-like "transition state." The hub topography was characterized as a shared attractor-like basin where all canonical resting-state networks were represented equally. The surrounding periphery of the landscape had distinct network configurations. The intermediate transition state and traversal through it via a topographic gradient seemed to provide the underlying structure for the continuous evolution of brain activity patterns at rest. In addition, differences in the landscape architecture were more consistent within than between subjects, providing evidence of idiosyncratic dynamics and potential utility in precision medicine.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Extracellular and intracellular components of theimpedance of neural tissue</a></h4>

              
                Electric phenomena in brain tissue can be measured using extracellular potentials, such as the local field potential, or the electro-encephalogram. The interpretation of these signals depend on the electric structure and properties of extracellular media, but the measurements of these electric properties are subject to controversy. Some measurements point to a model where the extracellular medium is purely resistive, and thus parameters such as electric conductivity and permittivity should be independent of frequency. Other measurements point to a pronounced frequency dependence of these parameters, with scaling laws that are consistent with capacitive or diffusive effects. However, these experiments correspond to different preparations, and it is unclear how to correctly compare them. Here, we provide for the first time, impedance measurements in various preparations, for acute brain slices and primary cell cultures, and we compare to measurements using the same setup in artificial cerebrospinal fluid with no biological material. The measurements show that when the current flows across a cell membrane, the frequency dependence of the macroscopic impedance between intracellular and extracellular electrodes is significant, and cannot be captured by a model with resistive media. Fitting a mean-field model to the data shows that this frequency dependence could be explained by the ionic diffusion mainly associated to Debye layers surrounding the membranes. We conclude that neuronal membranes and their ionic environment induce strong deviations to resistivity, that should be taken into account to correctly interpret extracellular potentials generated by neurons.

	<p>Background: We aimed to assess the effects of modulated neuroprotection with intermittent administration in patients with unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS) after severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). Methods: Retrospective analysis of 60 patients divided into two groups, with and without neuroprotective treatment with Actovegin, Cerebrolysin, pyritinol, L-phosphothreonine, L-glutamine, hydroxocobalamin, alpha-lipoic acid, carotene, DL-α-tocopherol, ascorbic acid, thiamine, pyridoxine, cyanocobalamin, Q 10 coenzyme, and L-carnitine alongside standard treatment. Main outcome measures: Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) after TBI, Extended Glasgow Coma Scale (GOS E), Disability Rankin Scale (DRS), Functional Independence Measurement (FIM), and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA), all assessed at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after TBI. Results: Patients receiving neuroprotective treatment recovered more rapidly from UWS than controls (p = 0.007) passing through a state of minimal consciousness and gradually progressing until the final evaluation (p = 0.000), towards a high cognitive level MOCA = 22 ± 6 points, upper moderate disability GOS-E = 6 ± 1, DRS = 6 ± 4, and an assisted gait, FIM =101 ± 25. The improvement in cognitive and physical functioning was strongly correlated with lower UWS duration (−0.8532) and higher GCS score (0.9803). Conclusion: Modulated long-term neuroprotection may be the therapeutic key for patients to overcome UWS after severe TBI.</p>

	<p>Decision making is a complex cognitive phenomenon commonly used in everyday life. Studies have shown differences in behavioral strategies in risky decision-making tasks over the course of aging. The development of functional neuroimaging has gradually allowed the exploration of the neurofunctional bases of these behaviors. The purpose of our study was to carry out a meta-analysis on the neural networks underlying risky decision making in healthy older adults. Following the PRISMA guidelines, we systematically searched for fMRI studies of decision making in older adults using risky decision-making tasks. To perform the quantitative meta-analysis, we used the revised version of the activation likelihood estimation (ALE) algorithm. A total of 620 references were selected for initial screening. Among these, five studies with a total of 98 cognitively normal older participants (mean age: 69.5 years) were included. The meta-analysis yielded two clusters. Main activations were found in the right insula, bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and left orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Despite the limited number of studies included, our meta-analysis highlights the crucial involvement of circuits associated with both emotion regulation and the decision to act. However, in contrast to the literature on young adults, our results indicate a different pattern of hemispheric lateralization in older participants. These activations can be used as a minimum pattern of activation in the risky decision-making tasks of healthy older subjects.</p>

	<p>Background and objectives: Parkinson’s disease (PD) and schizophrenia often share symptomatology. Psychotic symptoms are prevalent in patients with PD, and similar motor symptoms with extrapyramidal signs are frequently observed in antipsychotic-naïve patients with schizophrenia as well as premorbid families. However, few studies have examined the relationship between PD and schizophrenia. We performed this study to evaluate whether genetic variants which increase PD risk influence the risk of developing schizophrenia, and vice versa. Materials and Methods: Two-sample Mendelian randomization (TSMR) with summary statistics from large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) was applied. Summary statistics were extracted for these instruments from GWAS of PD and schizophrenia; Results: We found an increase in the risk of schizophrenia per one-standard deviation (SD) increase in the genetically-predicted PD risk (inverse-variance weighted method, odds ratio = 1.10; 95% confidence interval, 1.05−1.15; p = 3.49 × 10−5). The association was consistent in sensitivity analyses, including multiple TSMR methods, analysis after removing outlier variants with potential pleiotropic effects, and analysis after applying multiple GWAS subthresholds. No relationships were evident between PD and smoking or other psychiatric disorders, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder, bipolar affective disorder, major depressive disorder, Alzheimer’s disease, or alcohol dependence. However, we did not find a reverse relationship; genetic variants increasing schizophrenia risk did not alter the risk of PD; Conclusions: Overall, our findings suggest that increased genetic risk of PD can be associated with increased risk of schizophrenia. This association supports the intrinsic nature of the psychotic symptom in PD rather than medication or environmental effects. Future studies for possible comorbidities and shared genetic structure between the two diseases are warranted.</p>

	<p>The beneficial effects of regular physical activity (PA) on cognitive functions have received much attention. Recent research suggests that regular PA may also enhance creative thinking, an indispensable cognitive factor for invention and innovation. However, at what intensity regular PA brings the most benefits to creative thinking remains uninvestigated. Furthermore, whether the levels of regular PA affect the acute PA effects on creative thinking is also unclear. In the present study, using a previous dataset that investigated the effects of an acute bout of aerobic exercise on creative thinking in healthy Japanese young adults (22.98 ± 1.95 years old) in the year 2020, we tested the association between different intensities of regular PA (i.e., vigorous, moderate, and walking) and creative thinking with the cross-sectional baseline data using multiple linear regression. We also investigated whether regular PA levels were associated with the acute aerobic exercise intervention effects on creative thinking. The results showed that cross-sectionally, the regular PAs were differentially associated with divergent but not convergent thinking. Specifically, whereas the amount of vigorous-intensity PA was positively associated with fluency and flexibility, the amount of walking was positively associated with novelty on the alternate uses test (AUT) measuring divergent thinking. Importantly, the explained variances of fluency, flexibility, and novelty were 20.3% (p = 0.040), 18.8% (p = 0.055), and 20.1% (p = 0.043), respectively. None of the regular PAs predicted convergent thinking (i.e., an insight problem-solving task), nor were they associated with the acute aerobic exercise intervention effects on divergent and convergent thinking. These findings suggest that engaging in regular vigorous-intensity PA and walking may be useful strategies to enhance different aspects of divergent thinking in daily life.</p>

	<p>Prader–Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare disease determined by the loss of the paternal copy of the 15q11-q13 region, and it is characterized by hypotonia, hyperphagia, obesity, short stature, hypogonadism, craniofacial dysmorphisms, and cognitive and behavioral disturbances. The aims of this retrospective study were to analyze interictal EEG findings in a group of PWS patients and to correlate them with genetic, clinical, and neuroimaging data. The demographic, clinical, genetic, EEG, and neuroimaging data of seventy-four patients were collected. Associations among the presence of paroxysmal EEG abnormalities, genotype, and clinical and neuroimaging features were investigated. Four patients (5.4%) presented drug-sensitive epilepsy. Interictal paroxysmal EEG abnormalities—focal or multifocal—were present in 25.7% of the cases, and the normalization of the EEG occurred in about 25% of the cases. In 63.2% of the cases, the paroxysmal abnormalities were bilaterally localized over the middle–posterior regions. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed on 39 patients (abnormal in 59%). No relevant associations were found between paroxysmal EEG abnormalities and all of the other variables considered. Interictal paroxysmal EEG abnormalities—in particular, with a bilateral middle–posterior localization—could represent an important neurological feature of PWS that is not associated with genotype, cognitive or behavioral endophenotypes, MRI anomalies, or prognosis.</p>

<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Increasing evidence suggests that Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression is driven by a vicious cycle of soluble β-amyloid (Aβ)-induced neuronal hyperactivity. Thus, breaking this vicious cycle by suppressing neuronal hyperactivity may represent a logical approach to stopping AD progression. In support of this, we have recently shown that genetically and pharmacologically limiting ryanodine receptor 2 (RyR2) open time prevented neuronal hyperactivity, memory impairment, dendritic spine loss, and neuronal cell death in a rapid, early onset AD mouse model (5xFAD). Here, we assessed the impact of limiting RyR2 open time on AD-related deficits in a relatively late occurring, slow developing AD mouse model (3xTG-AD) that bears more resemblance (compared to 5xFAD) to that of human AD. Using behavioral tests, long-term potentiation recordings, and Golgi and Nissl staining, we found that the RyR2-E4872Q mutation, which markedly shortens the open duration of the RyR2 channel, prevented learning and memory impairment, defective long-term potentiation, dendritic spine loss, and neuronal cell death in the 3xTG-AD mice. Furthermore, pharmacologically shortening the RyR2 open time with R-carvedilol rescued these AD-related deficits in 3xTG mice. Therefore, limiting RyR2 open time may offer a promising, neuronal hyperactivity-targeted anti-AD strategy.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Structural basis for enhanced infectivity and immune evasion of SARS-CoV-2 variants</a></h4>

              
                <p>Several fast-spreading variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have become the dominant circulating strains in the COVID-19 pandemic. We report here cryo&ndash;electron microscopy structures of the full-length spike (S) trimers of the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants, as well as their biochemical and antigenic properties. Amino acid substitutions in the B.1.1.7 protein increase both the accessibility of its receptor binding domain and the binding affinity for receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The enhanced receptor engagement may account for the increased transmissibility. The B.1.351 variant has evolved to reshape antigenic surfaces of the major neutralizing sites on the S protein, making it resistant to some potent neutralizing antibodies. These findings provide structural details on how SARS-CoV-2 has evolved to enhance viral fitness and immune evasion.</p>

                <p>A novel variant of concern (VOC) named CAL.20C (B.1.427/B.1.429), which was originally detected in California, carries spike glycoprotein mutations S13I in the signal peptide, W152C in the N-terminal domain (NTD), and L452R in the receptor-binding domain (RBD). Plasma from individuals vaccinated with a Wuhan-1 isolate&ndash;based messenger RNA vaccine or from convalescent individuals exhibited neutralizing titers that were reduced 2- to 3.5-fold against the B.1.427/B.1.429 variant relative to wild-type pseudoviruses. The L452R mutation reduced neutralizing activity in 14 of 34 RBD-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). The S13I and W152C mutations resulted in total loss of neutralization for 10 of 10 NTD-specific mAbs because the NTD antigenic supersite was remodeled by a shift of the signal peptide cleavage site and the formation of a new disulfide bond, as revealed by mass spectrometry and structural studies.</p>

                <p>We report de novo genome assemblies, transcriptomes, annotations, and methylomes for the 26 inbreds that serve as the founders for the maize nested association mapping population. The number of pan-genes in these diverse genomes exceeds 103,000, with approximately a third found across all genotypes. The results demonstrate that the ancient tetraploid character of maize continues to degrade by fractionation to the present day. Excellent contiguity over repeat arrays and complete annotation of centromeres revealed additional variation in major cytological landmarks. We show that combining structural variation with single-nucleotide polymorphisms can improve the power of quantitative mapping studies. We also document variation at the level of DNA methylation and demonstrate that unmethylated regions are enriched for cis-regulatory elements that contribute to phenotypic variation.</p>

                <p>The functional role of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in inherited metabolic disorders, including phenylketonuria (PKU), is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the mouse lncRNA <I>Pair</I> and human <I>HULC</I> associate with phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH). <I>Pair</I>-knockout mice exhibited excessive blood phenylalanine (Phe), musty odor, hypopigmentation, growth retardation, and progressive neurological symptoms including seizures, which faithfully models human PKU. <I>HULC</I> depletion led to reduced PAH enzymatic activities in human induced pluripotent stem cell&ndash;differentiated hepatocytes. Mechanistically, <I>HULC</I> modulated the enzymatic activities of PAH by facilitating PAH-substrate and PAH-cofactor interactions. To develop a therapeutic strategy for restoring liver lncRNAs, we designed GalNAc-tagged lncRNA mimics that exhibit liver enrichment. Treatment with GalNAc-<I>HULC</I> mimics reduced excessive Phe in <I>Pair</I><sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> and <I>Pah</I><sup>R408W/R408W</sup> mice and improved the Phe tolerance of these mice.</p>

                <p>Fully controllable ultracold atomic systems are creating opportunities for quantum sensing, yet demonstrating a quantum advantage in useful applications by harnessing entanglement remains a challenging task. Here, we realize a many-body quantum-enhanced sensor to detect displacements and electric fields using a crystal of ~150 trapped ions. The center-of-mass vibrational mode of the crystal serves as a high-<I>Q</I> mechanical oscillator, and the collective electronic spin serves as the measurement device. By entangling the oscillator and collective spin and controlling the coherent dynamics via a many-body echo, a displacement is mapped into a spin rotation while avoiding quantum back-action and thermal noise. We achieve a sensitivity to displacements of 8.8 &plusmn; 0.4 decibels below the standard quantum limit and a sensitivity for measuring electric fields of 240 &plusmn; 10 nanovolts per meter in 1 second. Feasible improvements should enable the use of trapped ions in searches for dark matter.</p>

                <p>A prototypical hydroperoxyalkyl radical (&bull;QOOH) intermediate, transiently formed in the oxidation of volatile organic compounds, was directly observed through its infrared fingerprint and energy-dependent unimolecular decay to hydroxyl radical and cyclic ether products. Direct time-domain measurements of &bull;QOOH unimolecular dissociation rates over a wide range of energies were found to be in accord with those predicted theoretically using state-of-the-art electronic structure characterizations of the transition state barrier region. Unimolecular decay was enhanced by substantial heavy-atom tunneling involving O-O elongation and C-C-O angle contraction along the reaction pathway. Master equation modeling yielded a fully a priori prediction of the pressure-dependent thermal unimolecular dissociation rates for the &bull;QOOH intermediate&mdash;again increased by heavy-atom tunneling&mdash;which are required for global models of atmospheric and combustion chemistry.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/rss/current.xml">Suppressing atomic diffusion with the Schwarz crystal structure in supersaturated Al-Mg alloys</a></h4>

              
                <p>High atomic diffusivity in metals enables substantial tuneability of their structure and properties by tailoring the diffusional processes, but this causes their customized properties to be unstable at elevated temperatures. Eliminating diffusive interfaces by fabricating single crystals or heavily alloying helps to address this issue but does not inhibit atomic diffusion at high homologous temperatures. We discovered that the Schwarz crystal structure was effective at suppressing atomic diffusion in a supersaturated aluminum&ndash;magnesium alloy with extremely fine grains. By forming these stable structures, diffusion-controlled intermetallic precipitation from the nanosized grains and their coarsening were inhibited up to the equilibrium melting temperature, around which the apparent across-boundary diffusivity was reduced by about seven orders of magnitude. Developing advanced engineering alloys using the Schwarz crystal structure may lead to useful properties for high-temperature applications.</p>

                <p>Recent advances in nanofluidics have enabled the confinement of water down to a single molecular layer. Such monolayer electrolytes show promise in achieving bioinspired functionalities through molecular control of ion transport. However, the understanding of ion dynamics in these systems is still scarce. Here, we develop an analytical theory, backed up by molecular dynamics simulations, that predicts strongly nonlinear effects in ion transport across quasi&ndash;two-dimensional slits. We show that under an electric field, ions assemble into elongated clusters, whose slow dynamics result in hysteretic conduction. This phenomenon, known as the memristor effect, can be harnessed to build an elementary neuron. As a proof of concept, we carry out molecular simulations of two nanofluidic slits that reproduce the Hodgkin-Huxley model and observe spontaneous emission of voltage spikes characteristic of neuromorphic activity.</p>

We show that large-scale woven metafabrics can provide high emissivity (94.5%) in the atmospheric window and high reflectivity (92.4%) in the solar spectrum because of the hierarchical-morphology design of the randomly dispersed scatterers throughout the metafabric. Through scalable industrial textile manufacturing routes, our metafabrics exhibit desirable mechanical strength, waterproofness, and breathability for commercial clothing while maintaining efficient radiative cooling ability. Practical application tests demonstrated that a human body covered by our metafabric could be cooled ~4.8&deg;C lower than one covered by commercial cotton fabric. The cost-effectiveness and high performance of our metafabrics present substantial advantages for intelligent garments, smart textiles, and passive radiative cooling applications.</p>

Their success at making split-second, potentially life-threatening decisions of biomechanical capability depends on their skillful use of acrobatic maneuvers and learning from past efforts. Here, we found that free-ranging fox squirrels (<I>Sciurus niger</I>) leaping across unfamiliar, simulated branches decided where to launch by balancing a trade-off between gap distance and branch-bending compliance. Squirrels quickly learned to modify impulse generation upon repeated leaps from unfamiliar, compliant beams. A repertoire of agile landing maneuvers enabled targeted leaping without falling. Unanticipated adaptive landing and leaping "parkour" behavior revealed an innovative solution for particularly challenging leaps. Squirrels deciding and learning how to launch and land demonstrates the synergistic roles of biomechanics and cognition in robust gap-crossing strategies.</p>

                <p>Gag, the primary structural protein of HIV-1, is recruited to the plasma membrane for virus assembly by its matrix (MA) domain. Gag is subsequently cleaved into its component domains, causing structural maturation to repurpose the virion for cell entry. We determined the structure and arrangement of MA within immature and mature HIV-1 through cryo&ndash;electron tomography. We found that MA rearranges between two different hexameric lattices upon maturation. In mature HIV-1, a lipid extends out of the membrane to bind with a pocket in MA. Our data suggest that proteolytic maturation of HIV-1 not only assembles the viral capsid surrounding the genome but also repurposes the membrane-bound MA lattice for an entry or postentry function and results in the partial removal of up to 2500 lipids from the viral membrane.</p>

                <p>Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants with multiple spike mutations enable increased transmission and antibody resistance. We combined cryo&ndash;electron microscopy (cryo-EM), binding, and computational analyses to study variant spikes, including one that was involved in transmission between minks and humans, and others that originated and spread in human populations. All variants showed increased angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor binding and increased propensity for receptor binding domain (RBD)&ndash;up states. While adaptation to mink resulted in spike destabilization, the B.1.1.7 (UK) spike balanced stabilizing and destabilizing mutations. A local destabilizing effect of the RBD E484K mutation was implicated in resistance of the B.1.1.28/P.1 (Brazil) and B.1.351 (South Africa) variants to neutralizing antibodies. Our studies revealed allosteric effects of mutations and mechanistic differences that drive either interspecies transmission or escape from antibody neutralization.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Maternal Oxycodone Treatment Results in Neurobehavioral Disruptions in Mice Offspring</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Opioid drugs are increasingly being prescribed to pregnant women. Such compounds can also bind and activate opioid receptors in the fetal brain, which could lead to long-term brain and behavioral disruptions. We hypothesized that maternal treatment with oxycodone (OXY), the primary opioid at the center of the current crisis, leads to later neurobehavioral disorders and gene expression changes in the hypothalamus and hippocampus of resulting offspring. Female mice were treated daily with 5 mg OXY/kg or saline solution (control; CTL) for two weeks before breeding and then throughout gestation. Male and female offspring from both groups were tested with a battery of behavioral and metabolic tests to measure cognition, exploratory-like, anxiety-like, voluntary physical activity, and socio-communication behaviors. qPCR analyses were performed for candidate gene expression patterns in the hypothalamus and hippocampus of OXY and CTL derived offspring. Developmental exposure to OXY caused socio-communication changes that persisted from weaning through adulthood. Such offspring also showed cognitive impairments, reduced voluntary physical activity, and weighed more than CTL counterparts. In the hippocampus, prenatal exposure to OXY caused sex-dependent differences in expression of genes encoding opioid receptors and those involved in serotonin signaling. OXY exposure induced changes in neuropeptide hormone expression and the epigenetic modulator, <I>Dnmt3a</I>, in the hypothalamus, which could result in epigenetic changes in this brain region. The findings suggest cause for concern that consumption of OXY by pregnant mothers may result in permanent neurobehavioral changes in their offspring. Further work is needed to determine the potential underpinning epigenetic mechanisms.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Action Costs Rapidly and Automatically Interfere with Reward-Based Decision-Making in a Reaching Task</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>It is widely assumed that we select actions we value the most. While the influence of rewards on decision-making has been extensively studied, evidence regarding the influence of motor costs is scarce. Specifically, how and when motor costs are integrated in the decision process is unclear. Twenty-two right-handed human participants performed a reward-based target selection task by reaching with their right arm toward one of two visual targets. Targets were positioned in different directions according to biomechanical preference, such that one target was systematically associated with a lower motor cost than the other. Only one of the two targets was rewarded, either in a congruent or incongruent manner with respect to the associated motor cost. A timed-response paradigm was used to manipulate participants&rsquo; reaction times (RT). Results showed that when the rewarded target carried the highest motor cost, movements produced at short RT (&lt;350 ms) were deviated toward the other (i.e., non-rewarded, low-cost (LC) target). In this context participants needed an additional 150-ms delay to reach the same percentage of rewarded trials as when the LC target was rewarded. Crucially, motor costs affected the total earnings of participants. These results demonstrate a robust interference of motor costs in a simple reward-based decision-making task. They point to the rapid and automatic integration of motor costs at an early stage of processing, potentially through the direct modulation of competing action representations in parieto-frontal regions. The progressive overcoming of this bias with increasing RT is likely achieved through top-down signaling pertaining to expected rewards.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Cross-sectional versus longitudinal comparisons of age-related change have often revealed differing results. In the current study, we used within-subject task-based fMRI to investigate changes in voxel-based activations and behavioral performance across the life span in the Reference Ability Neural Network cohort, at both baseline and 5 year follow-up. We analyzed fMRI data from between 127 and 159 participants (20&ndash;80 years) on a battery of tests relating to each of four cognitive reference abilities. We applied a Gaussian age kernel to capture continuous change across the life span using a 5 year sliding window centered on each age in our participant sample, with a subsequent division into young, middle, and old age brackets. This method was applied separately to both cross-sectional approximations of change and real longitudinal changes adopting a comparative approach. We then focused on longitudinal measurements of neural change to identify regions expressing peak changes and fluctuations of sign change across our sample. Our results revealed several regions expressing divergence between cross-sectional and longitudinal measurements in each domain and age bracket; behavioral comparisons between measurements showed differences in change curves for all four domains, with processing speed displaying the steepest declines. In the longitudinal change measurement, we found lack of support for age-related frontal increases across analysis types, instead finding more posterior regions displaying peak increases in activation, particularly in the old age bracket. Our findings encourage greater focus on longitudinal measurements of age-related changes, which display appreciable differences from cross-sectional approximations.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">General Anesthesia Disrupts Complex Cortical Dynamics in Response to Intracranial Electrical Stimulation in Rats</a></h4>

              
                <p>The capacity of human brain to sustain complex cortical dynamics appears to be strongly associated with conscious experience and consistently drops when consciousness fades. For example, several recent studies in humans found a remarkable reduction of the spatiotemporal complexity of cortical responses to local stimulation during dreamless sleep, general anesthesia, and coma. However, this perturbational complexity has never been directly estimated in non-human animals <I>in vivo</I> previously, and the mechanisms that prevent neocortical neurons to engage in complex interactions are still unclear. Here, we quantify the complexity of electroencephalographic (EEG) responses to intracranial electrical stimulation in rats, comparing wakefulness to propofol, sevoflurane, and ketamine anesthesia. The evoked activity changed from highly complex in wakefulness to far simpler with propofol and sevoflurane. The reduced complexity was associated with a suppression of high frequencies that preceded a reduced phase-locking, and disruption of functional connectivity and pattern diversity. We then showed how these parameters dissociate with ketamine and depend on intensity and site of stimulation. Our results support the idea that brief periods of activity-dependent neuronal silence can interrupt complex interactions in neocortical circuits, and open the way for further mechanistic investigations of the neuronal basis for consciousness and loss of consciousness across species.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>The NMDA receptors are a type of glutamate receptors, which is involved in neuronal function, plasticity and development in the mammalian brain. However, how the NMDA receptors contribute to adult neurogenesis and development of the dentate gyrus is unclear. In this study, we investigate this question by examining a region-specific knock-out mouse line that lacks the NR1 gene, which encodes the essential subunit of the NMDA receptors, in granule cells of the dentate gyrus (DG-NR1KO mice). We found that the survival of newly-generated granule cells, cell proliferation and the size of the granule cell layer are significantly reduced in the dorsal dentate gyrus of adult DG-NR1KO mice. Our results also show a significant reduction in the number of immature neurons and in the volume of the granule cell layer, starting from three weeks of postnatal age. DG-NR1KO mice also showed impairment in the expression of an immediate early gene, Arc, and behavior during the novelty-suppressed feeding and open field test. These results suggest that the NMDA receptors in granule cells have a role in adult neurogenesis in the adult brain and contributes to the normal development of the dentate gyrus.</p>

                <p>by Natália Teruel, Olivier Mailhot, Rafael J. Najmanovich</p>

The SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein needs to be in an open-state conformation to interact with ACE2 to initiate viral entry. We utilise coarse-grained normal mode analysis to model the dynamics of Spike and calculate transition probabilities between states for 17081 variants including experimentally observed variants. Our results correctly model an increase in open-state occupancy for the more infectious D614G via an increase in flexibility of the closed-state and decrease of flexibility of the open-state. We predict the same effect for several mutations on glycine residues (404, 416, 504, 252) as well as residues K417, D467 and N501, including the N501Y mutation recently observed within the B.1.1.7, 501.V2 and P1 strains. This is, to our knowledge, the first use of normal mode analysis to model conformational state transitions and the effect of mutations on such transitions. The specific mutations of Spike identified here may guide future studies to increase our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection mechanisms and guide public health in their surveillance efforts.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Relating simulation studies by provenance—Developing a family of Wnt signaling models</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Kai Budde, Jacob Smith, Pia Wilsdorf, Fiete Haack, Adelinde M. Uhrmacher</p>

For many biological systems, a variety of simulation models exist. A new simulation model is rarely developed from scratch, but rather revises and extends an existing one. A key challenge, however, is to decide which model might be an appropriate starting point for a particular problem and why. To answer this question, we need to identify entities and activities that contributed to the development of a simulation model. Therefore, we exploit the provenance data model, PROV-DM, of the World Wide Web Consortium and, building on previous work, continue developing a PROV ontology for simulation studies. Based on a case study of 19 Wnt/β-catenin signaling models, we identify crucial entities and activities as well as useful metadata to both capture the provenance information from individual simulation studies and relate these forming a family of models. The approach is implemented in WebProv, a web application for inserting and querying provenance information. Our specialization of PROV-DM contains the entities Research Question, Assumption, Requirement, Qualitative Model, Simulation Model, Simulation Experiment, Simulation Data, and Wet-lab Data as well as activities referring to building, calibrating, validating, and analyzing a simulation model. We show that most Wnt simulation models are connected to other Wnt models by using (parts of) these models. However, the overlap, especially regarding the Wet-lab Data used for calibration or validation of the models is small. Making these aspects of developing a model explicit and queryable is an important step for assessing and reusing simulation models more effectively. Exposing this information helps to integrate a new simulation model within a family of existing ones and may lead to the development of more robust and valid simulation models. We hope that our approach becomes part of a standardization effort and that modelers adopt the benefits of provenance when considering or creating simulation models.

                <p>by Leo Zhu, William Pei, Ines Thiele, Radhakrishnan Mahadevan</p>

Ethanol is one of the most widely used recreational substances in the world and due to its ubiquitous use, ethanol abuse has been the cause of over 3.3 million deaths each year. In addition to its effects, ethanol’s primary metabolite, acetaldehyde, is a carcinogen that can cause symptoms of facial flushing, headaches, and nausea. How strongly ethanol or acetaldehyde affects an individual depends highly on the genetic polymorphisms of certain genes. In particular, the genetic polymorphisms of mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase, ALDH2, play a large role in the metabolism of acetaldehyde. Thus, it is important to characterize how genetic variations can lead to different exposures and responses to ethanol and acetaldehyde. While the pharmacokinetics of ethanol metabolism through alcohol dehydrogenase have been thoroughly explored in previous studies, in this paper, we combined a base physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model with a whole-body genome-scale model (WBM) to gain further insight into the effect of other less explored processes and genetic variations on ethanol metabolism. This combined model was fit to clinical data and used to show the effect of alcohol concentrations, organ damage, ALDH2 enzyme polymorphisms, and ALDH2-inhibiting drug disulfiram on ethanol and acetaldehyde exposure. Through estimating the reaction rates of auxiliary processes with dynamic Flux Balance Analysis, The PBPK-WBM was able to navigate around a lack of kinetic constants traditionally associated with PK modelling and demonstrate the compensatory effects of the body in response to decreased liver enzyme expression. Additionally, the model demonstrated that acetaldehyde exposure increased with higher dosages of disulfiram and decreased ALDH2 efficiency, and that moderate consumption rates of ethanol could lead to unexpected accumulations in acetaldehyde. This modelling framework combines the comprehensive steady-state analyses from genome-scale models with the dynamics of traditional PK models to create a highly personalized form of PBPK modelling that can push the boundaries of precision medicine.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">The Δ40p53 isoform inhibits p53-dependent eRNA transcription and enables regulation by signal-specific transcription factors during p53 activation</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Cecilia B. Levandowski, Taylor Jones, Margaret Gruca, Sivapriya Ramamoorthy, Robin D. Dowell, Dylan J. Taatjes</p>

The naturally occurring Δ40p53 isoform heterotetramerizes with wild-type p53 (WTp53) to regulate development, aging, and stress responses. How Δ40p53 alters WTp53 function remains enigmatic because their co-expression causes tetramer heterogeneity. We circumvented this issue with a well-tested strategy that expressed Δ40p53:WTp53 as a single transcript, ensuring a 2:2 tetramer stoichiometry. Human MCF10A cell lines expressing Δ40p53:WTp53, WTp53, or WTp53:WTp53 (as controls) from the native TP53 locus were examined with transcriptomics (precision nuclear run-on sequencing [PRO-seq] and RNA sequencing [RNA-seq]), metabolomics, and other methods. Δ40p53:WTp53 was transcriptionally active, and, although phenotypically similar to WTp53 under normal conditions, it failed to induce growth arrest upon Nutlin-induced p53 activation. This occurred via Δ40p53:WTp53-dependent inhibition of enhancer RNA (eRNA) transcription and subsequent failure to induce mRNA biogenesis, despite similar genomic occupancy to WTp53. A different stimulus (5-fluorouracil [5FU]) also showed Δ40p53:WTp53-specific changes in mRNA induction; however, other transcription factors (TFs; e.g., E2F2) could then drive the response, yielding similar outcomes vs. WTp53. Our results establish that Δ40p53 tempers WTp53 function to enable compensatory responses by other stimulus-specific TFs. Such modulation of WTp53 activity may be an essential physiological function for Δ40p53. Moreover, Δ40p53:WTp53 functional distinctions uncovered herein suggest an eRNA requirement for mRNA biogenesis and that human p53 evolved as a tetramer to support eRNA transcription.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">IL-25–induced shifts in macrophage polarization promote development of beige fat and improve metabolic homeostasis in mice</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Lingyi Li, Lei Ma, Zewei Zhao, Shiya Luo, Baoyong Gong, Jin Li, Juan Feng, Hui Zhang, Weiwei Qi, Ti Zhou, Xia Yang, Guoquan Gao, Zhonghan Yang</p>

Beige fat dissipates energy and functions as a defense against cold and obesity, but the mechanism for its development is unclear. We found that interleukin (IL)-25 signaling through its cognate receptor, IL-17 receptor B (IL-17RB), increased in adipose tissue after cold exposure and β3-adrenoceptor agonist stimulation. IL-25 induced beige fat formation in white adipose tissue (WAT) by releasing IL-4 and IL-13 and promoting alternative activation of macrophages that regulate innervation and up-regulate tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) up-regulation to produce more catecholamine including norepinephrine (NE). Blockade of IL-4Rα or depletion of macrophages with clodronate-loaded liposomes in vivo significantly impaired the beige fat formation in WAT. Mice fed with a high-fat diet (HFD) were protected from obesity and related metabolic disorders when given IL-25 through a process that involved the uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1)-mediated thermogenesis. In conclusion, the activation of IL-25 signaling in WAT may have therapeutic potential for controlling obesity and its associated metabolic disorders.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Retinal vein occlusion as the first clinical manifestation of systemic lupus erythematosus in a male patient [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic, autoimmune disease characterized by widespread clinical manifestations and immunological disorders. A myriad of ocular manifestations can be seen in patients with SLE. The most vision-threatening complication is vaso-occlusive retinopathy including retinal vein occlusion (RVO). RVO associated with SLE is well described in the literature and its association with antiphospholipid antibodies is recognized. However, RVO as the initial manifestation of SLE is scarcely reported. Herein, we report the first case of recurrent RVO as the primary manifestation of SLE in a 40-year-old male patient. He had two consecutive episodes of decreased vision. Ophthalmologic examination disclosed a branch retinal vein occlusion the first time and a central retinal vein occlusion the second time. The diagnosis of SLE was established based on clinical and immunological criteria. He was prescribed antiplatelet therapy, hydroxychloroquine at 5.5 mg/kg/day, and intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antibodies regimen. He slowly improved under treatment.

     alt="The RNA-binding protein and stress granule component ATAXIN-2 is expressed in mouse and human tissues associated with glaucoma pathogenesis"/>
<p>The RNA-binding protein Ataxin 2 (ATXN2) is associated with neurodegenerative diseases and vision loss. Retinal ATXN2 is confined to spiking neurons (ganglion cells and amacrine cells) and largely absent from photoreceptors/bipolar cells and glia. The strong expression in the trabecular meshwork and the ciliary body suggests relevance to glaucoma.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Polyglutamine repeat expansions in the <i>Ataxin-2</i> (<i>ATXN2)</i> gene were first implicated in Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 2, a disease associated with degeneration of motor neurons and Purkinje cells. Recent studies linked single nucleotide polymorphisms in the gene to elevated intraocular pressure in primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) yet the localization of ATXN2 across glaucoma-relevant tissues of the vertebrate eye has not been thoroughly examined. This study characterizes ATXN2 expression in the mouse and human retina, and anterior eye, using an antibody validated in ATXN2<sup>-/-</sup> retinas. ATXN2-ir was localized to cytosolic sub compartments in retinal ganglion cell (RGC) somata and proximal dendrites in addition to GABAergic, glycinergic and cholinergic amacrine cells in the inner plexiform layer (IPL), and displaced amacrine cells. Human, but not mouse retinas showed modest immunolabeling of bipolar cells. ATXN2 immunofluorescence was prominent in the trabecular meshwork and pigmented and nonpigmented cells of the ciliary body, with analyses of primary human trabecular meshwork cells confirming the finding. The expression of ATXN2 in key POAG-relevant ocular tissues supports the potential role in autophagy and stress granule formation in response to ocular hypertension.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Philympics 2021: Prophage Predictions Perplex Programs [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Most bacterial genomes contain integrated bacteriophages—prophages—in various states of decay. Many are active and able to excise from the genome and replicate, while others are cryptic prophages, remnants of their former selves. Over the last two decades, many computational tools have been developed to identify the prophage components of bacterial genomes, and it is a particularly active area for the application of machine learning approaches. However, progress is hindered and comparisons thwarted because there are no manually curated bacterial genomes that can be used to test new prophage prediction algorithms. Methods We present a library of gold-standard bacterial genome annotations that include manually curated prophage annotations, and a computational framework to compare the predictions from different algorithms. We use this suite to compare all extant stand-alone prophage prediction algorithms to identify their strengths and weaknesses. We provide a FAIR dataset for prophage identification, and demonstrate the accuracy, precision, recall, and f1 score from the analysis of seven different algorithms for the prediction of prophages. Results We identified different strengths and weaknesses between the prophage prediction tools. Several tools exhibit exceptional f1 scores, while others have better recall at the expense of more false positives. The tools vary greatly in runtime performance with few exhibiting all desirable qualities for large-scale analyses. Conclusions Our library of gold-standard prophage annotations and benchmarking framework provide a valuable resource for exploring strengths and weaknesses of current and future prophage annotation tools. We discuss caveats and concerns in this analysis, how those concerns may be mitigated, and avenues for future improvements. This framework will help developers identify opportunities for improvement and test updates. It will also help users in determining the tools that are best suited for their analysis.

                Background: Stroke is a significant global health hazard that ripples continuum multi-spectral effects to the patients as well their caretakers.   Methods: We studied 28 consecutive cohorts of patients with recurrent strokes managed in our centre within the last two years.  Results: The most common recurrence stroke pattern was of that of hemorrhagic to hemorrhagic subtype observed in 50% of the patients. The most common anatomical region of involvement was cortical – cortical seen in 39.28% of our cohorts. The surgical intervention was required in 17.85% whereas 42.85% of them were managed conservatively. Paradoxically, 39.28% of patients left against medical advice. The receiver operating curve (ROC) predicting mode of management was highest (area under the curve (AUC) =0.635) for compliance to therapy followed by stroke territory (AUC=0.578), age (AUC=0.457) and motor grading (AUC=0.374). The receiver operating curve (ROC) for influencing decision to leave against medical advice was highest (area under the curve (AUC) =0.861) for motor score followed by sex (AUC=0.701) and age (AUC=0.564). The analysis of variance (ANOVA) study pertaining to the mode of management was significantly connoted by the motor score and the stroke territory only. The ANOVA study pertaining to the decision to leave against medical advice was significantly governed by the motor score, stroke territory, and sex respectively. The multivariate analysis for variables governing mode of management was significant for motor score and the stroke territory only. The multivariate analysis for variables governing leave against medical advice was significant for sex, motor score and the stroke territory.  Conclusions: This study aims to appraise early dichotomization of high-risk patients for recurrent strokes to reduce the continuum of neurological events as well as to mitigate the financial aspects governing stroke care.

                Aging is a key risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the reasons for this association are not well understood. Senescent cells accumulate in aged tissues and have been shown to play causal roles in age-related pathologies through their proinflammatory secretome. The question arises whether senescence-induced inflammation might contribute to AD and bridge the gap between aging and AD. Here, we highlight the role of cellular senescence as a driver of the aging phenotype, and discuss the current evidence that connects senescence with AD and neurodegeneration.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Unsupervised machine learning reveals key immune cell subsets in COVID-19, rhinovirus infection, and cancer therapy</a></h4>

              
                For an emerging disease like COVID-19, systems immunology tools may quickly identify and quantitatively characterize cells associated with disease progression or clinical response. With repeated sampling, immune monitoring creates a real-time portrait of the cells reacting to a novel virus before disease specific knowledge and tools are established. However, single cell analysis tools can struggle to reveal rare cells that are under 0.1% of the population. Here, the machine learning workflow Tracking Responders Expanding (T-REX) was created to identify changes in both very rare and common cells in diverse human immune monitoring settings. T-REX identified cells that were highly similar in phenotype and localized to hotspots of significant change during rhinovirus and SARS-CoV-2 infections. Specialized reagents used to detect the rhinovirus-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> cells, MHCII tetramers, were not used during unsupervised analysis and instead 'left out' to serve as a test of whether T-REX identified biologically significant cells. In the rhinovirus challenge study, T-REX identified virus-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells based on these cells being a distinct phenotype that expanded by ≥95% following infection. T-REX successfully identified hotspots containing virus-specific T cells using pairs of samples comparing Day 7 of infection to samples taken either prior to infection (Day 0) or after clearing the infection (Day 28). Mapping pairwise comparisons in samples according to both the direction and degree of change provided a framework to compare systems level immune changes during infectious disease or therapy response. This revealed that the magnitude and direction of systemic immune change in some COVID-19 patients was comparable to that of blast crisis acute myeloid leukemia patients undergoing induction chemotherapy and characterized the identity of the immune cells that changed the most. Other COVID-19 patients instead matched an immune trajectory like that of individuals with rhinovirus infection or melanoma patients receiving checkpoint inhibitor therapy. T-REX analysis of paired blood samples provides an approach to rapidly identify and characterize mechanistically significant cells and to place emerging diseases into a systems immunology context.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Met and Cxcr4 cooperate to protect skeletal muscle stem cells against inflammation-induced damage during regeneration</a></h4>

              
                Acute skeletal muscle injury is followed by an inflammatory response, removal of damaged tissue, and the generation of new muscle fibers by resident muscle stem cells, a process well characterized in murine injury models. Inflammatory cells are needed to remove the debris at the site of injury and provide signals that are beneficial for repair. However, they also release chemokines, reactive oxygen species as well as enzymes for clearance of damaged cells and fibers, which muscle stem cells have to withstand in order to regenerate the muscle. We show here that MET and CXCR4 cooperate to protect muscle stem cells against the adverse environment encountered during muscle repair. This powerful cyto-protective role was revealed by the genetic ablation of <i>Met</i> and <i>Cxcr4</i> in muscle stem cells of mice, which resulted in severe apoptosis during early stages of regeneration. TNFα neutralizing antibodies rescued the apoptosis, indicating that TNFα provides crucial cell-death signals during muscle repair that are counteracted by MET and CXCR4. We conclude that muscle stem cells require MET and CXCR4 to protect them against the harsh inflammatory environment encountered in an acute muscle injury.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Characterization of cephalic and non-cephalic sensory cell types provides insight into joint photo- and mechanoreceptor evolution</a></h4>

              
                Rhabdomeric opsins (r-opsins) are light-sensors in cephalic eye photoreceptors, but also function in additional sensory organs. This has prompted questions on the evolutionary relationship of these cell types, and if ancient r-opsins were non-photosensory. A molecular profiling approach in the marine bristleworm <i>Platynereis dumerilii</i> revealed shared and distinct features of cephalic and non-cephalic of <i>r-opsin1</i>-expressing cells. Non-cephalic cells possess a full set of phototransduction components, but also a mechanosensory signature. Prompted by the latter, we investigated <i>Platynereis </i>putative mechanotransducer, and found <i>nompc </i>and<i> pkd2.1</i> co-expressed with <i>r-opsin1 </i>in TRE cells by HCR RNA-FISH. To further assess the role of r-Opsin1 in these cells, we studied its signaling properties and unraveled that r-Opsin1 is a Gαq-coupled blue-light receptor. Profiling of cells from <i>r-opsin1</i> mutants versus wild-types, and a comparison under different light conditions reveals that in the non-cephalic cells, light - mediated by r-Opsin1 - adjusts the expression level of a calcium transporter relevant for auditory mechanosensation in vertebrates. We establish a deep learning-based quantitative behavioral analysis for animal trunk movements, and identify a light- and r-Opsin-1-dependent fine-tuning of the worm's undulatory movements in headless trunks, which are known to require mechanosensory feedback. Our results provide new data on peripheral cell types of likely light-sensory/mechanosensory nature. These results point towards a concept in which such a multisensory cell type evolved to allow for fine-tuning of mechanosensation by light. This implies that light-independent mechanosensory roles of r-opsins may have evolved secondarily.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Precise optical control of gene expression in C. elegans using improved genetic code expansion and Cre recombinase</a></h4>

              
                Synthetic strategies for optically controlling gene expression may enable the precise spatiotemporal control of genes in any combination of cells that cannot be targeted with specific promoters. We develop an improved genetic code expansion system in <i>C. elegans</i> and use it to create a photo-activatable Cre recombinase. We laser-activate Cre in single neurons within a bilaterally symmetric pair to selectively switch on expression of a loxP controlled optogenetic channel in the targeted neuron. We use the system to dissect, in freely moving animals, the individual contributions of the mechanosensory neurons PLML/PLMR to the <i>C. elegans</i> touch response circuit, revealing distinct and synergistic roles for these neurons. We thus demonstrate how genetic code expansion and optical targeting can be combined to break the symmetry of neuron pairs and dissect behavioural outputs of individual neurons that cannot be genetically targeted.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Ancient viral genomes reveal introduction of human pathogenic viruses into Mexico during the transatlantic slave trade</a></h4>

              
                After the European colonization of the Americas there was a dramatic population collapse of the Indigenous inhabitants caused in part by the introduction of new pathogens. Although there is much speculation on the etiology of the Colonial epidemics, direct evidence for the presence of specific viruses during the Colonial era is lacking. To uncover the diversity of viral pathogens during this period, we designed an enrichment assay targeting ancient DNA (aDNA) from viruses of clinical importance and applied it to DNA extracts from individuals found in a Colonial hospital and a Colonial chapel (16<sup>th</sup> c. - 18<sup>th</sup> c.) where records suggest victims of epidemics were buried during important outbreaks in Mexico City. This allowed us to reconstruct three ancient human parvovirus B19 genomes, and one ancient human hepatitis B virus genome from distinct individuals. The viral genomes are similar to African strains, consistent with the inferred morphological and genetic African ancestry of the hosts as well as with the isotopic analysis of the human remains, suggesting an origin on the African continent. This study provides direct molecular evidence of ancient viruses being transported to the Americas during the transatlantic slave trade and their subsequent introduction to New Spain. Altogether, our observations enrich the discussion about the etiology of infectious diseases during the Colonial period in Mexico.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Evolution of diversity in metabolic strategies</a></h4>

              
                Understanding the origin and maintenance of biodiversity is a fundamental problem. Many theoretical approaches have been investigating ecological interactions, such as competition, as potential drivers of diversification. Classical consumer-resource models predict that the number of coexisting species should not exceed the number of distinct resources, a phenomenon known as the competitive exclusion principle. It has recently been argued that including physiological tradeoffs in consumer-resource models can lead to violations of this principle and to ecological coexistence of very high numbers of species. Here we show that these results crucially depend on the functional form of the tradeoff. We investigate the evolutionary dynamics of resource use constrained by tradeoffs and show that if the tradeoffs are non-linear, the system either does not diversify, or diversifies into a number of coexisting species that does not exceed the number of resources. In particular, very high diversity can only be observed for linear tradeoffs.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Adipocyte NR1D1 dictates adipose tissue expansion during obesity</a></h4>

              
                The circadian clock component NR1D1 (REVERBα) is considered a dominant regulator of lipid metabolism, with global <i>Nr1d1</i> deletion driving dysregulation of white adipose tissue (WAT) lipogenesis and obesity. However, a similar phenotype is not observed under adipocyte-selective deletion (<i>Nr1d1<sup>Flox2-6</sup>:Adipoq<sup>Cre</sup></i>), and transcriptional pro1ling demonstrates that, under basal conditions, direct targets of NR1D1 regulation are limited, and include the circadian clock and collagen dynamics. Under high-fat diet (HFD) feeding, <i>Nr1d1<sup>Flox2-6</sup>:Adipoq<sup>Cre</sup></i> mice do manifest profound obesity, yet without the accompanying WAT in2ammation and 1brosis exhibited by controls. Integration of the WAT NR1D1 cistrome with differential gene expression reveals broad control of metabolic processes by NR1D1 which is unmasked in the obese state. Adipocyte NR1D1 does not drive an anticipatory daily rhythm in WAT lipogenesis, but rather modulates WAT activity in response to alterations in metabolic state. Importantly, NR1D1 action in adipocytes is critical to the development of obesity-related WAT pathology and insulin resistance.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Risk of motor vehicle collisions after methadone use</a></h4>

              
                Methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) can alleviate opioid dependence. However, MMT possibly increases the risk of motor vehicle collisions. The current study investigated preliminary estimation of motor vehicle collision incidence rates. Furthermore, in this population-based retrospective cohort study with frequency-matched controls, opiate adults receiving MMT (cases) and those not receiving MMT (controls) were identified at a 1:2 ratio by linking data from several nationwide administrative registry databases. From 2009 to 2016, the crude incidence rate of motor vehicle collisions was the lowest in the general adult population, followed by that in opiate adults, and it was the highest in adults receiving MMT. The incidence rates of motor vehicle collisions were significantly higher in opiate users receiving MMT than in those not receiving MMT. Kaplan–Meier curves of the incidence of motor vehicle collisions differed significantly between groups, with a significant increased risk during the first 90 days of follow-up. In conclusion, drivers receiving MMT have higher motor vehicle collision risk than those not receiving MMT in opiate users, and it is worthy of noticing road safety in such drivers, particularly during the first 90 days of MMT.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Distinctive neural correlates of phonological processing and reading impairment in fetal alcohol-exposed adolescents with and without facial dysmorphology</a></h4>

              
                Background: Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) has been linked to atypical brain development and a wide range of cognitive and behavioral impairments, including poor reading performance in childhood and adolescence. However, little is known about how structural and/or functional teratogenesis in the brain mediate reading impairment in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) and whether neural correlates of reading and phonological processing differ between FASD subtypes with different clinical presentations in facial morphology. Methods: The current study utilized functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to characterize functional and structural mechanisms mediating reading deficits in 26 syndromal adolescents with PAE-related facial dysmorphology (i.e., fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) or partial FAS (PFAS)) and 30 heavily exposed (HE) without this dysmorphology, in comparison with 19 typically developing controls. Importantly, the levels of PAE and reading ability were comparable between the FAS/PFAS and HE groups in the current study. Results: Compared to the nonsyndromal HE and control groups, the syndromal adolescents showed greater activation in the right precentral gyrus during an fMRI phonological processing task and rightward lateralization in an important reading-related tract (inferior longitudinal fasciculus, ILF), suggesting an atypical reliance on the right hemisphere during reading. By contrast, in the HE group, better reading skills were associated with increased neural activation in the left angular gyrus (LAG) and higher fractional anisotropy in the white matter organization of the left ILF. However, the brain function-behavior relation was weaker in the HE than among the controls, suggesting less efficient function of the typical reading neural network that may contribute to the observed reading impairments. Conclusions: Our findings provide the first evidence for the distinctive functional and structural mechanisms underlying atypical reading and phonological processing in PAE adolescents with and without FAS facial dysmorphology.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The decoy SNARE Tomosyn sets tonic versus phasic release properties and is required for homeostatic synaptic plasticity</a></h4>

              
                Synaptic vesicle release probability (Pr) is a key presynaptic determinant of synaptic strength established by cell intrinsic properties and further refined by plasticity. To characterize mechanisms that generate Pr heterogeneity between distinct neuronal populations, we examined glutamatergic tonic (Ib) and phasic (Is) motoneurons in Drosophila with stereotyped differences in Pr and synaptic plasticity. We found the decoy SNARE Tomosyn is differentially expressed between these motoneuron subclasses and contributes to intrinsic differences in their synaptic output. Tomosyn expression enables tonic release in Ib motoneurons by reducing SNARE complex formation and suppressing Pr to generate decreased levels of synaptic vesicle fusion and enhanced resistance to synaptic fatigue. In contrast, phasic release dominates when Tomosyn expression is low, enabling high intrinsic Pr at Is terminals at the expense of sustained release and robust presynaptic potentiation. In addition, loss of Tomosyn disrupts the ability of tonic synapses to undergo presynaptic homeostatic potentiation (PHP).

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Synaptic plasticity is predicted by spatiotemporal firing rate patterns and robust to in vivo-like variability</a></h4>

              
                Synaptic plasticity, the experience-induced change in connections between neurons, underlies learning and memory in the brain. Most of our understanding of synaptic plasticity derives from in vitro experiments with precisely repeated stimulus patterns; however, neurons exhibit significant variability in vivo during repeated experiences. Further, the spatial pattern of synaptic inputs to the dendritic tree influences synaptic plasticity, yet is not considered in most synaptic plasticity rules. Here, we address the sensitivity of plasticity to trial-to-trial variability and delineate how spatiotemporal synaptic input patterns produce plasticity with in vivo-like conditions using a data-driven computational model with a calcium-based plasticity rule. Using in vivo spike train recordings as inputs, we show that plasticity is strongly robust to trial-to-trial variability of spike timing, and derive general synaptic plasticity rules describing how spatiotemporal patterns of synaptic inputs control the magnitude and direction of plasticity. Specifically, a high temporal input firing rate to a synapse late in a trial correlated with neighboring synaptic activity produces potentiation, while an earlier, moderate firing rate that is negatively correlated with neighboring synaptic activity produces depression. Together, our results reveal that calcium dynamics can unify diverse plasticity rules and reveal how spatiotemporal firing rate patterns control synaptic plasticity.

                Concerns about animal welfare and meat quality have encouraged research on new methods for the stunning of broilers during animal slaughter. In this study, the electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) of broilers were acquired during stunning using an electrical hybrid instead of a single frequency. Considering a square wave with a current of 220 mA and a frequency of 1100 Hz (duty-cycle 50%), the hybrid-frequency waveform is obtained generating pulses at 6600 Hertz in the pulse-width phase. Sixty broilers aged 42 days were randomly sampled; thirty were used for EEG measurement and thirty for ECG measurement. For EEG measurements, the birds' scalps were anesthetized, and EEG electrode needles were inserted on the subcutaneous part of the occipital scalp. For ECG, the non-invasive surface electrode was used. The electrodes were connected to a digital EEG/ECG system. The results showed that the hybrid-frequency waveform system generated epileptic forms in the birds' EEGs. Therefore, a hybrid-frequency system may present better carcass quality results, while preserving the birds' welfare, when compared with a single frequency system use.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Distinct Roles of Dopamine D1 and D2 Receptor-expressing Neurons in the Nucleus Accumbens for a Strategy Dependent Decision Making</a></h4>

              
                To optimize decision making, animals need to execute not only a strategy to choose a good option but sometimes also one to avoid a bad option. A psychological study indicates that positive and negative information is processed in a different manner in the brain. The nucleus accumbens (NAc) contains two different types of neurons, dopamine D1 and D2 receptor-expressing neurons which are implicated in reward-based decision making and aversive learning. However, little is known about the neural mechanisms by which D1 or D2 receptor-expressing neurons in the NAc contribute to the execution of the strategy to choose a good option or one to avoid a bad option under decision making. Here, we have developed two novel visual discrimination tasks for mice to assess the strategy to choose a good option and one to avoid a bad option. By chemogenetically suppressing the subpopulation of the NAc neurons, we have shown that dopamine D2 receptor-expressing neurons in the NAc selectively contribute to the strategy to avoid a bad option under reward-based decision making. Furthermore, our optogenetic and calcium imaging experiments indicate that dopamine D2 receptor-expressing neurons are activated by error choices and the activation following an error plays an important role in optimizing the strategy in the next trial. Our findings suggest that the activation of D2 receptor-expressing neurons by error choices through learning enables animals to execute the appropriate strategy.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Brain Laterality Dynamics Support Human Cognition</a></h4>

              
                Hemispheric lateralization constitutes a core architectural principle of human brain organization underlying cognition, often argued to represent a stable, trait-like feature. However, emerging evidence underlines the inherently dynamic nature of brain networks, in which time-resolved alterations in functional lateralization remain uncharted. Integrating dynamic network approaches with the concept of hemispheric laterality, we map the spatiotemporal architecture of whole-brain lateralization in a large sample of high-quality resting-state fMRI data (N=991, Human Connectome Project). We reveal distinct laterality dynamics across lower-order sensorimotor systems and higher-order associative networks. Specifically, we expose two aspects of the laterality dynamics: laterality fluctuations, defined as the standard deviation of laterality time series, and laterality reversal, referring to the number of zero-crossings in laterality time series. These two measures are associated with moderate and extreme changes in laterality over time, respectively. While laterality fluctuations depict positive association with language function and cognitive flexibility, laterality reversal shows a negative association with the same neurocognitive factors. These opposing interactions indicate a dynamic balance between intra- and inter-hemispheric communication, i.e., segregation and integration of information across hemispheres. Furthermore, in their time-resolved laterality index, the default-mode and language networks correlate negatively with visual/sensorimotor and attention networks, indicating flexible while parallel processing capabilities that are linked to better out-of-scanner cognitive performance. Finally, the laterality dynamics correlate with regional metabolism and structural connectivity and showed significant heritability. Our results provide insights into the adaptive nature of the lateralized brain and new perspectives for future studies of human cognition, genetics and brain disorders.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">KIF2C regulates synaptic plasticity and cognition by mediating dynamic microtubule invasion of dendritic spines</a></h4>

              
                Dynamic microtubules play a critical role in cell structure and function. In nervous system, microtubules specially extend into and out of synapses to regulate synaptic development and plasticity. However, the detailed polymerization especially the depolymerization mechanism that regulates dynamic microtubules in synapses is still unclear. In this study, we find that KIF2C, a dynamic microtubule depolymerization protein without known function in the nervous system, plays a vital role in the structural and functional plasticity of synapses and regulates cognitive function. Using RNAi knockdown and conditional knockout approaches, we showed that KIF2C regulates spine morphology and synaptic membrane expression of AMPA (- amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionic acid) receptors. Moreover, KIF2C deficiency leads to impaired excitatory transmission, long-term potentiation, and altered cognitive behaviors in mice. Mechanistically, KIF2C regulates microtubule dynamics and microtubule invasion of spines in neurons by its microtubule depolymerization capability in a neuronal activity-dependent manner. This study explores a novel function of KIF2C in the nervous system and provides an important regulatory mechanism on how microtubule invasion of spines regulates synaptic plasticity and cognition behaviors.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The road not taken: disconnection of a human-unique cortical pathway in schizophrenia and its effects on naturalistic social cognition</a></h4>

              
                Background: Efficient processing of complex and dynamic social scenes relies on intact connectivity of many underlying cortical areas and networks, but how connectivity deficits affect this functioning in social cognition remains unknown. Here we measure these relationships using functionally based localization of social cognition areas, resting-state functional connectivity, and movie-watching data. Methods: In 42 schizophrenia participants (SzP) and 41 healthy controls (HC), we measured the functional connectivity of areas localized by face-emotion processing, theory-of-mind, and attention tasks. We quantified the weighted shortest path length between visual and medial prefrontal theory-of-mind areas in both populations to assess the impact of functional connectivity deficits on network structure. We then correlated connectivity along the shortest path in each group with movie-evoked activity in a key node of the theory-of-mind network (TPJp). Results: SzP had pronounced connectivity deficits in temporoparietal junction/posterior superior temporal sulcus (TPJ-pSTS) areas involved in face-emotion processing (t(81)=4.4, p=0.00002). In HC the shortest path connecting visual and medial prefrontal theory-of-mind areas passed through TPJ-pSTS, whereas in SzP the shortest path passed through prefrontal cortex (PFC). While movie-evoked TPJp activity correlated with connectivity along the TPJ-pSTS pathway in both groups (r=0.43, p=0.002), it additionally correlated with connectivity along the PFC pathway only in SzP (rSzP=0.56, p=0.003). Conclusions: Connectivity along the human-unique TPJ-pSTS pathway affects both the network architecture and functioning of areas involved in processing complex dynamic social scenes. These results demonstrate how focal deficits can have widespread impacts across cortex.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Microarray Analysis of Potential Biomarkers for brachial plexus avulsion caused neuropathic pain</a></h4>

              
                Nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain remains a challenging clinical problem due to a lack of satisfactory treatment. Pain after BPA (Brachial Plexus Avulsion) is resistant to most traditional pain relief treatments due to the lack of understanding of the cellular or molecular mechanism of pain development. The present study aimed to investigate the expression of mRNA in the brachial plexus avulsion neuropathic pain model and analyze biological functions. Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with complete brachial plexus avulsion. An animal behavior test was carried out to distinguish the pain group from the control group. In this study, a microarray mRNA assay and reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was conducted. The whole blood was collected from two groups for Microarray mRNA analysis. The predicted mRNA targets were studied by gene ontology analysis and pathway analysis. The PIK3CB, HRAS, and JUN genes were verified by RT-PCR. In total, differentially expressed genes(DEGs) were identified between individuals with or without neuropathic pain (case and control), and A biological processes were enriched. We identified 3 targeted mRNAs, including PIK3CB, HRAS, and JUN, which may be potential biomarkers for BPA-caused NP. The results showed that PIK3CB, HRAS, and JUN gene expression was increased in the control group but decreased in the neuropathic pain group. The PIK3CB gene was part of the Neurotrophin signaling pathway. The function of the HRAS gene was synergetic in the aspect of axon guidance and the Neurotrophin signaling pathway. The JUN gene participates in axon regeneration. These results suggest that PIK3CB, HRAS, and JUN genes might become potential biomarkers for the prediction of and new targets for the prevention and treatment of neuropathic pain after BPA. These findings indicate that mRNA expression changes in the blood may play an important role in the development of NP after BPA, which is of theoretical and clinical importance for future research and clinical-treatment strategies.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Highly accurate local functional fingerprints and their stability</a></h4>

              
                The neural underpinnings of individual identity reflected in cognition, behavior, and disease remain elusive. Functional connectivity profiles have been used as a "fingerprint" with which an individual can be identified in a dataset. These established functional connectivity fingerprints generally show high accuracy but are still sensitive to mental states. A truly unique, and especially state-independent, neural fingerprint will shed light on fundamental intra-individual brain organization. Moreover, a fingerprint that also captures inter-individual differences in brain-behavior associations will provide the necessary ingredients for the development of biomarkers for precision medicine. With resting-state and task fMRI-data of the Human Connectome Project and the enhanced Nathan Kline Institute sample, we show that the local functional fingerprint, and especially regional homogeneity (ReHo), is 1) a highly accurate neural fingerprint, 2) more stable within an individual regardless of their mental state (compared to the baseline functional connectome fingerprint), and 3) captures specific inter-individual differences. Our findings are replicable across parcellations as well as resilient to confounding effects. Further analyses showed that the attention networks and the Default Mode Network contributed most to individual "uniqueness". Moreover, with the OpenNeuro.ds000115 sample, we show that ReHo is also stable in individuals with schizophrenia and that its stability relates to intelligence subtest scores. Altogether, our findings show the potential of the application of local functional fingerprints in precision medicine.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Retinal degeneration: Multilevel protection of photoreceptor and ganglion cell viability and function with the novel PKG inhibitor CN238.</a></h4>

              
                Hereditary retinal degeneration (RD) is often associated with excessive cGMP-signaling in photoreceptors. Previous research has shown that inhibition of cGMP-dependent protein kinase G (PKG) can slow down the loss of photoreceptors in different RD animal models. In this study, we identified a novel PKG inhibitor, the cGMP analogue CN238, with strong protective effects on photoreceptors in retinal degeneration rd1 and rd10 mutant mice. In long-term organotypic retinal explants, CN238 preserved rd1 and rd10 photoreceptor viability and function. Surprisingly, in explanted retinae CN238 also protected retinal ganglion cells from axotomy induced retrograde degeneration and preserved their functionality. Together, these results confirm the strong neuroprotective capacity of PKG inhibitors for both photoreceptors and retinal ganglion cells, thereby significantly broadening their potential applications for the treatment of retinal diseases and possibly neurodegenerative diseases in general.

                Emotion is a constructed phenomenon that emerges from the dynamic interaction of multiple components neurologically, physiologically and behaviorally. Such dynamics can not be captured by static and controlled experiments. Hence, the study of emotion with a naturalistic paradigm is needed. In this dataset, multimedia naturalistic stimuli are used to acquire the emotional dynamics using EEG, ECG, EMG and behavioural scales. The stimuli are multimedia videos collected from youtube for 372 affective words, analyzed with multimedia content analysis to filter out non-emotional stimuli and then validated with university students. The validated stimuli had the least variance in subjective ratings on self-assessment scales. The stimuli are then used to acquire neurological dynamics along with peripheral channels and subjective ratings-valence, arousal, dominance, liking, familiarity, relevance and emotion category. Both the raw data and pre-processed data is provided along with the pre-processing pipeline. This data can be utilized to study dynamic activation and connectivity in the whole brain source localization study, understand the mutual interaction between the central and autonomic nervous system, understand temporal hierarchy using multiresolution tools, and perform machine learning-based classification and complex networks analysis. The data is accessible at url{10.18112/openneuro.ds003751.v1.0.0}

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A toolbox for studying cortical physiology in primates</a></h4>

              
                Lesioning and neurophysiological studies have facilitated the elucidation of cortical functions and mechanisms of functional recovery following injury. Clinical translation of such studies is contingent on their employment in non-human primates (NHPs), yet tools for monitoring and modulating cortical physiology are incompatible with conventional NHP lesioning techniques. To address these challenges, we developed a toolbox demonstrated in seven macaques. We introduce the photothrombotic method to induce focal cortical lesions alongside a quantitative model for the design of lesion profiles based on experimental needs. Large-scale (~5 cm2) vascular and neural dynamics can be monitored and lesion induction can be validated in vivo with optical coherence tomography angiography and our electrocorticographic array, the latter of which also enables testing stimulation-based interventions. By combining optical and electrophysiological techniques in NHPs, we can enhance our understanding of cortical functions, investigate functional recovery mechanisms, integrate physiological and behavioral findings, and develop treatments for neurological disorders.

Biophysical Network Models (BNMs) have been used to produce networks corresponding to MEG-derived networks of phase-synchronization, but the roles of inter-regional conduction delays, the structural connectome and dynamics of model of individual brain regions, in obtaining this correspondence remain unknown. In this study, we investigated the roles of conduction delays, the structural connectome, and dynamics of models of individual regions, in obtaining a correspondence between model-generated and MEG-derived networks between left-hemispheric regions. To do this, we compared three BNMs, respectively comprising Wilson-Cowan oscillators interacting with diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)-based patterns of structural connections through zero delays, constant delays and distance-dependent delays respectively. For the BNM whose networks corresponded most closely to the MEG-derived network, we used comparisons against null models to identify specific features of each model component, e.g. the pattern of connections in the structure connectome, that contributed to the observed correspondence. The Wilson-Cowan zero delays model produced networks with a closer correspondence to the MEG-derived network than those produced by the constant delays model, and the same as those produced by the distance-dependent delays model. Hence, there is no evidence that including conduction delays improves the correspondence between model-generated and MEG-derived networks. Given this, we chose the Wilson-Cowan zero delays model for further investigation. Comparing the Wilson-Cowan zero delays model against null models revealed that both the pattern of structural connections and Wilson-Cowan oscillatory dynamics contribute to the correspondence between model-generated and MEG-derived networks. Our investigations yield insight into the roles of conduction delays, the structural connectome and dynamics of models of individual brain regions, in obtaining a correspondence between model-generated and MEG-derived networks. These findings result in a parsimonious BNM that produces networks corresponding closely to MEG-derived networks of phase-synchronization.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Chronic behavioral manipulation via orally delivered chemogenetic actuator in macaques</a></h4>

              
                The chemogenetic technology referred to as designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) offers reversible means to control neuronal activity for investigating its functional correlation with behavioral action. Deschloroclozapine (DCZ), a recently-developed highly potent and selective DREADDs actuator, displays a capacity to expand the utility of DREADDs for chronic manipulation without side-effects in nonhuman primates, which has not yet been validated. Here we investigated the pharmacokinetics and behavioral effects of orally administered DCZ in macaque monkeys. Pharmacokinetic analysis and positron emission tomography (PET) occupancy examination demonstrated that oral administration of DCZ yielded slower and prolonged kinetics, and that its bioavailability was 10-20% of that in the case of systemic injection. Oral DCZ (300-1000 g/kg) induced significant working memory impairments for at least 4 h in monkeys with hM4Di expressed in the prefrontal cortex. Repeated daily oral doses of DCZ consistently caused similar impairments over two weeks without discernible desensitization. Our results indicate that orally delivered DCZ affords a less invasive strategy for chronic but reversible chemogenetic manipulation of neuronal activity in nonhuman primates, and this has potential for clinical application.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Chronic and progressive deficits after a single closed head injury in mice</a></h4>

              
                Background: Acute injury following brain trauma may evolve into a chronic and progressive disorder. Assessment of chronic consequences of TBI must distinguish between effects of age and injury. Methods: C57BL/6 mice receive single closed head injury (CHI) and are analyzed at 14DPI or 180DPI for cortical atrophy and 7DPI or 180DPI for behavioral outcomes. Results: CHI induces ipsilesional atrophy at 14DPI that increases 180 DPI due to an effect of age. On open field, injured mice develop a turn bias at 180DPI not present at 7DPI. On rotarod, injured mice have shorter latencies at 7DPI, but not at 180DPI due to worsening performance of aging uninjured mice. On beam walk, both groups at 180DPI more slowly traverse a 2cm and 1cm beam than at 7DPI. Foot-faults show no significant effects of age or injury. Limb position was assessed using DeeplabcutTM markerless tracking followed by computation of absition (integral of limb displacement over time) using custom Python scripts. On the 2cm beam, age increased absition in all limbs of uninjured mice and both forelimbs of injured mice. Injury increased left hindlimb absition at 7DPI. On the 1cm beam both forelimbs and the left hindlimb of injured mice at 180DPI have larger absition than uninjured mice at 180DPI or injured mice at 7DPI. These data suggest chronic and progressive motor deficits of injured mice at 180DPI. Conclusions: A single impact produces ipsilesional cortical atrophy and chronic and progressive motor deficits. Quantitative behavioral analysis reveals deficits not seen using standard outcomes.
