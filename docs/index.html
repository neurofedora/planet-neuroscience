	<p>Motor recovery is related to the corticospinal tract (CST) lesion in post-stroke patients. The CST originating from the supplementary motor area (SMA) affects the recovery of impaired motor function. We confirmed the effects of transcranial direct current electrical stimulation (tDCS) over the SMA combined with walk training on CST excitability. This study involved a stroke patient with severe sensorimotor deficits and a retrospective AB design. Walk training was conducted only in phase A. Phase B consisted of anodal tDCS (1.5 mA) combined with walk training. Walking speed, stride time variability (STV; reflecting gait stability), and beta-band intramuscular coherence&amp;amp;mdash;derived from the paired tibialis anterior on the paretic side (reflecting CST excitability)&amp;amp;mdash;were measured. STV quantified the coefficient of variation in stride time using accelerometers. Intramuscular coherence during the early stance phase noticeably increased in phase B compared with phase A. Intramuscular coherence in both the stance and swing phases was reduced at follow-up. Walking speed showed no change, while STV was noticeably decreased in phase B compared with phase A. These results suggest that tDCS over the SMA during walking improves gait stability by enhancing CST excitability in the early stance phase.</p>

	<p>The study is focused on applying ex-Gaussian parameters of eye-tracking and cognitive measures in the classification process of cognitive workload level. A computerised version of the digit symbol substitution test has been developed in order to perform the case study. The dataset applied in the study is a collection of variables related to eye-tracking: saccades, fixations and blinks, as well as test-related variables including response time and correct response number. The application of ex-Gaussian modelling to all collected data was beneficial in the context of detection of dissimilarity in groups. An independent classification approach has been applied in the study. Several classical classification methods have been invoked in the process. The overall classification accuracy reached almost 96%. Furthermore, the interpretable machine learning model based on logistic regression was adapted in order to calculate the ranking of the most valuable features, which allowed us to examine their importance.</p>

	<p>Endurance, which is dependent at least partly upon the activation of the brain cortex, is important for performance in rowing. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has shown benefits for endurance, but its effects on the endurance performance of elite rowing athletes are unknown, and are examined in this study. Eight elite female rowers completed 5 km of rowing on an ergometer following stimulation of the tDCS and sham over motor cortices. Each session lasted 20 min and the current was set at 2.2 mA. Time, 500 m/split, power, time corresponding to 500 m (TC500) and power corresponding to 500 m (PC500) were recorded continuously throughout the tests. No significant differences in time, 500 m/split and power were observed between baseline, tDCS and sham. Compared to the sham, tDCS induced a percentage reduction in TC500 from baseline to 2500 m and 4000 m, and a percentage increase in PC500 from baseline to 500 m, 1000 m, 1500 m, 2000 m, 2500 m, 4000 m, 4500 m and 5000 m. One-session tDCS did not have significant benefits for rowing endurance performance in elite professional rowers, and had only marginally greater efficacy compared to sham. These findings offer knowledge helpful to the design of future studies exploring the effects of tDCS on the endurance performance of elite rowers.</p>

	<p>Cerebral palsy describes a group of permanent disorders of movement, motor function and posture that occur due to non-progressive insults to the developing brain. Most of the information concerning the early diagnosis of cerebral palsy originates from studies conducted in high-income countries. In this scoping review, we aimed to explore the tools used in low- and middle-income countries for the early diagnosis of cerebral palsy. A systematic search was conducted using OVID Medline and PubMed databases. &amp;amp;ldquo;Early diagnosis&amp;amp;rdquo; was defined as diagnosis prior to 12 months of age, and low- and middle-income countries were classified according to the World Bank classification system. We identified nine studies on the early diagnosis of cerebral palsy from low- and middle-income countries. The tools featured (n = number of studies) were: General Movement Assessment (6), neonatal magnetic resonance imaging (3), Hammersmith Neonatal Neurological Examination (2), Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination (1) and cranial ultrasound (1). We found a paucity of published literature on the early diagnosis of cerebral palsy from low- and middle-income countries. Further research is needed to determine the tools that are accurate and feasible for use in low-resource settings, particularly since cerebral palsy is more prevalent in these areas.</p>

	<p>There is joint agreement among professionals internationally on the importance of diagnosing autism spectrum disorders (ASD) in the early stages of the emergence of symptoms. Criteria changes for the diagnosis of ASD need updated versions of the scale to make the diagnosis feasible. This study aimed to evaluate the level of overlap between two different versions of the Gilliam Autism Rating Scale (GARS-2 and GARS-3), which have been updated based on changes in DSM-IV and DSM-5 on a Kurdish sample of individuals at risk of having ASD and Intellectual Disability, referred to the Bahoz center in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. A group of 148 cases with ASD and developmental disabilities (DD) was evaluated using the 2nd and 3rd versions of the GARS scale to understand the level of cases that confirm an ASD diagnosis in both scales. Ninety-six individuals (65%) scored about the cut-off score for being diagnosed with ASD based on the GARS-2, and 137 individuals (93%) scored above the cut-off score based on the GARS-3. Moreover, keeping updated and meeting the changing demand of standardization and cultural suitability of the updating scales is a challenge. This challenge is due to the shortage of infrastructure sources and lack of established professionals in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Findings indicated that GARS-3, updated based on the DSM-5, tends to diagnose children with accompanying diagnoses and different levels of symptoms severity of ASD at different age levels. Further studies are needed to help professionals and policymakers in low- and middle-income countries understand the updated versions of the available scales and depend on the older version, which must be considered cautiously.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Cell type-specific mechanisms of information transfer in data-driven biophysical models of hippocampal CA3 principal neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Daniele Linaro, Matthew J. Levy, David L. Hunt</p>

The transformation of synaptic input into action potential output is a fundamental single-cell computation resulting from the complex interaction of distinct cellular morphology and the unique expression profile of ion channels that define the cellular phenotype. Experimental studies aimed at uncovering the mechanisms of the transfer function have led to important insights, yet are limited in scope by technical feasibility, making biophysical simulations an attractive complementary approach to push the boundaries in our understanding of cellular computation. Here we take a data-driven approach by utilizing high-resolution morphological reconstructions and patch-clamp electrophysiology data together with a multi-objective optimization algorithm to build two populations of biophysically detailed models of murine hippocampal CA3 pyramidal neurons based on the two principal cell types that comprise this region. We evaluated the performance of these models and find that our approach quantitatively matches the cell type-specific firing phenotypes and recapitulate the intrinsic population-level variability in the data. Moreover, we confirm that the conductance values found by the optimization algorithm are consistent with differentially expressed ion channel genes in single-cell transcriptomic data for the two cell types. We then use these models to investigate the cell type-specific biophysical properties involved in the generation of complex-spiking output driven by synaptic input through an information-theoretic treatment of their respective transfer functions. Our simulations identify a host of cell type-specific biophysical mechanisms that define the morpho-functional phenotype to shape the cellular transfer function and place these findings in the context of a role for bursting in CA3 recurrent network synchronization dynamics.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Updating age-specific contact structures to match evolving demography in a dynamic mathematical model of tuberculosis vaccination</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Chathika Krishan Weerasuriya, Rebecca Claire Harris, Christopher Finn McQuaid, Gabriela B. Gomez, Richard G. White</p>

We investigated the effects of updating age-specific social contact matrices to match evolving demography on vaccine impact estimates. We used a dynamic transmission model of tuberculosis in India as a case study. We modelled four incremental methods to update contact matrices over time, where each method incorporated its predecessor: fixed contact matrix (M0), preserved contact reciprocity (M1), preserved contact assortativity (M2), and preserved average contacts per individual (M3). We updated the contact matrices of a deterministic compartmental model of tuberculosis transmission, calibrated to epidemiologic data between 2000 and 2019 derived from India. We additionally calibrated the M0, M2, and M3 models to the 2050 TB incidence rate projected by the calibrated M1 model. We stratified age into three groups, children (<15y), adults (≥15y, <65y), and the elderly (≥65y), using World Population Prospects demographic data, between which we applied POLYMOD-derived social contact matrices. We simulated an M72-AS01<sub>E</sub>-like tuberculosis vaccine delivered from 2027 and estimated the per cent TB incidence rate reduction (IRR) in 2050 under each update method. We found that vaccine impact estimates in all age groups remained relatively stable between the M0–M3 models, irrespective of vaccine-targeting by age group. The maximum difference in impact, observed following adult-targeted vaccination, was 7% in the elderly, in whom we observed IRRs of 19% (uncertainty range 13–32), 20% (UR 13–31), 22% (UR 14–37), and 26% (UR 18–38) following M0, M1, M2 and M3 updates, respectively. We found that model-based TB vaccine impact estimates were relatively insensitive to demography-matched contact matrix updates in an India-like demographic and epidemiologic scenario. Current model-based TB vaccine impact estimates may be reasonably robust to the lack of contact matrix updates, but further research is needed to confirm and generalise this finding.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Allostery in the dynamic coactivator domain KIX occurs through minor conformational micro-states</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Amanda L. Peiffer, Julie M. Garlick, Stephen T. Joy, Anna K. Mapp, Charles L. Brooks III</p>

The coactivator KIX of CBP uses two binding surfaces to recognize multiple activators and exhibits allostery in ternary complex formation. Activator•coactivator interactions are central to transcriptional regulation, yet the microscopic origins of allostery in dynamic proteins like KIX are largely unknown. Here, we investigate the molecular recognition and allosteric manifestations involved in two KIX ternary systems c-Myb•KIX•MLL and pKID•KIX•MLL. Exploring the hypothesis that binary complex formation prepays an entropic cost for positive cooperativity, we utilize molecular dynamics simulations, side chain methyl order parameters, and differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) to explore conformational entropy changes in KIX. The protein’s configurational micro-states from structural clustering highlight the utility of protein plasticity in molecular recognition and allostery. We find that apo KIX occupies a wide distribution of lowly-populated configurational states. Each binding partner has its own suite of KIX states that it selects, building a model of molecular recognition fingerprints. Allostery is maximized with MLL pre-binding, which corresponds to the observation of a significant reduction in KIX micro-states observed when MLL binds. With all binding partners, the changes in KIX conformational entropy arise predominantly from changes in the most flexible loop. Likewise, we find that a small molecule and mutations allosterically inhibit/enhance activator binding by tuning loop dynamics, suggesting that loop-targeting chemical probes could be developed to alter KIX•activator interactions. Experimentally capturing KIX stabilization is challenging, particularly because of the disordered nature of particular activators. However, DSF melting curves allow for inference of relative entropic changes that occur across complexes, which we compare to our computed entropy changes using simulation methyl order parameters.

Molecular biology holds a vast potential for tackling climate change and biodiversity loss. Yet, it is largely absent from the current strategies. We call for a community-wide action to bring molecular biology to the forefront of climate change solutions.

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">Bridging the big (data) gap: levels of control in small- and large-scale cognitive neuroscience research</a></h4>

              
                Recently, cognitive neuroscience has experienced unprecedented growth in the availability of large-scale datasets. These developments hold great methodological and theoretical promise: they allow increased statistical power, the use of nonparametric and generative models, the examination of individual differences, and more. Nevertheless, unlike most ‘traditional’ cognitive neuroscience research, which uses controlled experimental designs, large-scale projects often collect neuroimaging data not directly related to a particular task (e.g., resting state).

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A tRNA processing enzyme is a key regulator of the mitochondrial unfolded protein response</a></h4>

              
                The mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPR<sup>mt</sup>) has emerged as a predominant mechanism that preserves mitochondrial function. Consequently, multiple pathways likely exist to modulate UPR<sup>mt</sup>. We discovered that the tRNA processing enzyme, homolog of ELAC2 (HOE-1), is key to UPR<sup>mt</sup> regulation in <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i>. We find that nuclear HOE-1 is necessary and sufficient to robustly activate UPR<sup>mt</sup>. We show that HOE-1 acts via transcription factors ATFS-1 and DVE-1 that are crucial for UPR<sup>mt</sup>. Mechanistically, we show that HOE-1 likely mediates its effects via tRNAs, as blocking tRNA export prevents HOE-1-induced UPR<sup>mt</sup>. Interestingly, we find that HOE-1 does not act via the integrated stress response, which can be activated by uncharged tRNAs, pointing towards its reliance on a new mechanism. Finally, we show that the subcellular localization of HOE-1 is responsive to mitochondrial stress and is subject to negative regulation via ATFS-1. Together, we have discovered a novel RNA-based cellular pathway that modulates UPR<sup>mt</sup>.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Oligogenic heterozygous inheritance of sperm abnormalities in mouse</a></h4>

              
                Male infertility is an important health concern that is expected to have a major genetic etiology. Although high-throughput sequencing has linked gene defects to more than 50% of rare and severe sperm anomalies, less than 20% of common and moderate forms are explained. We hypothesized that this low success rate could at least be partly due to oligogenic defects - the accumulation of several rare heterozygous variants in distinct, but functionally connected, genes. Here, we compared fertility and sperm parameters in male mice harboring one to four heterozygous truncating mutations of genes linked to multiple morphological anomalies of the flagellum (MMAF) syndrome. Results indicated progressively deteriorating sperm morphology and motility with increasing numbers of heterozygous mutations. This first evidence of oligogenic inheritance in failed spermatogenesis strongly suggests that oligogenic heterozygosity could explain a significant proportion of asthenoteratozoospermia cases. The findings presented pave the way to further studies in mice and man.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Cerebellum encodes and influences the initiation, performance, and termination of discontinuous movements in mice</a></h4>

              
                The cerebellum is hypothesized to represent timing information important for organizing salient motor events during periodically performed discontinuous movements. To provide functional evidence validating this idea, we measured and manipulated Purkinje cell (PC) activity in the lateral cerebellum of mice trained to volitionally perform periodic bouts of licking for regularly allocated water rewards. Overall, PC simple spiking modulated during task performance, mapping phasic tongue protrusions and retractions, as well as ramping prior to both lick-bout initiation and termination, two important motor events delimiting movement cycles. The ramping onset occurred earlier for the initiation of un-cued exploratory licking that anticipated water availability relative to licking that was reactive to water allocation, suggesting that the cerebellum is engaged differently depending on the movement context. In a subpopulation of PCs, climbing-fiber-evoked responses also increased during lick-bout initiation, but not termination, highlighting differences in how cerebellar input pathways represent task-related information. Optogenetic perturbation of PC activity disrupted the behavior by degrading lick-bout rhythmicity in addition to initiating and terminating licking bouts confirming a causative role in movement organization. Together, these results substantiate that the cerebellum contributes to the initiation and timing of repeated motor actions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Role of YAP in early ectodermal specification and a Huntington's Disease model of human neurulation</a></h4>

              
                The Hippo pathway, a highly conserved signaling cascade that functions as an integrator of molecular signals and biophysical states, ultimately impinges upon the transcription coactivator Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP). Hippo-YAP signaling has been shown to play key roles both at the early embryonic stages of implantation and gastrulation, and later during neurogenesis. To explore YAP’s potential role in neurulation, we used self-organizing neuruloids grown from human embryonic stem cells on micropatterned substrates. We identified YAP activation as a key lineage determinant, first between neuronal ectoderm and nonneuronal ectoderm, and later between epidermis and neural crest, indicating that YAP activity can enhance the effect of BMP4 stimulation and therefore affect ectodermal specification at this developmental stage. Because aberrant Hippo-YAP signaling has been implicated in the pathology of Huntington’s Disease (HD), we used isogenic mutant neuruloids to explore the relationship between signaling and the disease. We found that HD neuruloids demonstrate ectopic activation of gene targets of YAP and that pharmacological reduction of YAP’s transcriptional activity can partially rescue the HD phenotype.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Enhanced C/EBPβ function promotes hypertrophic versus hyperplastic fat tissue growth and prevents steatosis in response to high-fat diet feeding</a></h4>

              
                Chronic obesity is correlated with severe metabolic and cardiovascular diseases as well as with an increased risk for developing cancers. Obesity is usually characterized by fat accumulation in enlarged - hypertrophic – adipocytes that are a source of inflammatory mediators, which promote the development and progression of metabolic disorders. Yet, in certain healthy obese individuals, fat is stored in metabolically more favorable hyperplastic fat tissue that contains an increased number of smaller adipocytes that are less inflamed. In a previous study we demonstrated that loss of the inhibitory protein-isoform C/EBPβ-LIP and the resulting augmented function of the transactivating isoform C/EBPβ-LAP promotes fat metabolism under normal feeding conditions and expands health- and lifespan in mice. Here we show that in mice on a high-fat diet, LIP-deficiency results in adipocyte hyperplasia associated with reduced inflammation and metabolic improvements. Furthermore, fat storage in subcutaneous depots is significantly enhanced specifically in LIP-deficient male mice. Our data identify C/EBPβ as a regulator of adipocyte fate in response to increased fat intake, which has major implications for metabolic health and aging.

                Topographic cortical maps are essential for spatial localisation of sensory stimulation and generation of appropriate task-related motor responses. Somatosensation and nociception are finely mapped and aligned in the adult somatosensory (S1) cortex, but in infancy, when pain behaviour is disorganised and poorly directed, nociceptive maps may be less refined. We compared the topographic pattern of S1 activation following noxious (clinically required heel lance) and innocuous (touch) mechanical stimulation of the same skin region in newborn infants (n=32) using multi-optode functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Within S1 cortex, touch and lance of the heel elicit localised, partially overlapping increases in oxygenated haemoglobin concentration (D[HbO]), but while touch activation was restricted to the heel area, lance activation extended into cortical hand regions. The data reveals a widespread cortical nociceptive map in infant S1, consistent with their poorly directed pain behaviour.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A cryptic K48 ubiquitin chain binding site on UCH37 is required for its role in proteasomal degradation</a></h4>

              
                Degradation by the 26 S proteasome is an intricately regulated process fine tuned by the precise nature of ubiquitin modifications attached to a protein substrate. By debranching ubiquitin chains composed of K48 linkages, the proteasome-associated ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase UCHL5/UCH37 serves as a positive regulator of protein degradation. How UCH37 achieves specificity for K48 chains is unclear. Here, we use a combination of hydrogen-deuterium mass spectrometry, chemical crosslinking, small-angle X-ray scattering, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), molecular docking, and targeted mutagenesis to uncover a cryptic K48 ubiquitin (Ub) chain-specific binding site on the opposite face of UCH37 relative to the canonical S1 (cS1) ubiquitin-binding site. Biochemical assays demonstrate the K48 chain-specific binding site is required for chain debranching and proteasome-mediated degradation of proteins modified with branched chains. Using quantitative proteomics, translation shutoff experiments, and linkage-specific affinity tools, we then identify specific proteins whose degradation depends on the debranching activity of UCH37. Our findings suggest that UCH37 and potentially other DUBs could use more than one S1 site to perform different biochemical functions.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Oxytocin neurons mediate the effect of social isolation via the VTA circuits</a></h4>

              
                Social interaction during adolescence strongly influences brain function and behavior, and the recent pandemic has emphasized the devastating effect of social distancing on mental health. While accumulating evidence has shown the importance of the reward system in encoding specific aspects of social interaction, the consequences of social isolation on the reward system and the development of social skills later in adulthood are still largely unknown. Here, we found that one week of social isolation during adolescence in male mice increased social interaction at the expense of social habituation and social novelty preference. Behavioral changes were accompanied by the acute hyperexcitability of putative dopamine (pDA) neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and long-lasting expression of GluA2-lacking AMPARs at excitatory inputs onto pDA neurons that project to the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Social isolation-dependent behavioral deficits and changes in neural activity and synaptic plasticity were reversed by chemogenetic inhibition of oxytocin neurons in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus. These results demonstrate that social isolation in male mice has acute and long-lasting effects on social interaction and suggest that homeostatic adaptations mediate these effects within the reward circuit.

                Our recent single cell sequencing of most adult Drosophila circadian neurons indicated striking gene expression heterogeneity, about 2-3 cells per clock neuron group. To extend this characterization to other adult fly brain neurons, we used the identical plate-based methods to generate single cell data from a similar subset of dopaminergic neurons. To minimize batch effects and to apply an additional sequencing strategy, we also assayed these two populations together with 10X Chromium. An unsupervised clustering algorithm indicates that dopaminergic neurons are comparably heterogeneous, suggesting that the transcriptomic diversity of adult fly brain neurons parallels its EM connectome. The results here further indicate that connectivity molecules like cell surface molecules best characterize all neuron groups. We suggest that these surprising features are general and make major contributions to neuronal identity and connectivity of the adult central brain as well as underlie the complex behavioral repertoire of Drosophila.

                Listening can be conceptualized as a process of active inference, in which the brain forms internal models to predict and integrate auditory information in a complex interaction of bottom-up and top-down processes. Whether inter-individual "prediction tendencies" shape listening experiences of real-world stimuli such as speech is, however, unknown. In the current study, we used a passive paradigm presenting tone sequences of varying entropy level, to independently quantify auditory prediction tendency (as the tendency to anticipate low-level acoustic features according to their contextual probability) for each individual. This measure was then used to predict the magnitude of cortical speech (envelope) tracking in a multi speaker listening task, where participants listened to audiobooks narrated by a target speaker in isolation or interfered by 1 or 2 distractors. Furthermore, rare semantic violations were introduced into the story, enabling us to also examine effects of word surprisal during continuous speech processing. Our results show that individual prediction tendency facilitates cortical speech tracking. Furthermore, we find interactions between individual prediction tendency and background noise as well as word surprisal in disparate brain regions. In sum, our findings suggest that individual prediction tendencies are generalizable across different listening situations and may serve as a valuable element to explain interindividual differences in natural listening experience.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cocaine regulation of Nr4a1 chromatin bivalency and mRNA in male and female mice.</a></h4>

              
                BACKGROUND: Cocaine epigenetically regulates gene expression via changes in histone post-translational modifications (HPTMs). We previously found that the immediate early gene Nr4a1 is epigenetically activated by cocaine in mouse brain reward regions. HPTMs act combinatorically, yet few studies examine multiple HPTMs at a single gene. Bivalent gene promoters are simultaneously enriched in both activating (H3K4me3 (K4)) and repressive (H3K27me3 (K27)) HPTMs. As such, bivalent genes are lowly expressed but poised for activity-dependent gene regulation. In the current study, we defined regulation of K4&K27 bivalency at Nr4a1 following cocaine treatment in male and female mice. The inclusion of female mice can shed light on the epidemiological relevance of sex to cocaine use disorder. METHODS: Male and female mice were injected with saline or cocaine (i.p. 20mg/kg). We applied sequential chromatin immunoprecipitation and qPCR to define Nr4a1 bivalency and expression in striatum (STR), prefrontal cortex (PFC), and hippocampus (HPC). Pearson correlation matrices quantified relationships within each brain region across treatment conditions for each sex. RESULTS: We defined K4&K27 bivalency at the Nr4a1 promoter in all three brain regions, in both sexes. In female STR, cocaine increased Nr4a1 mRNA, coupled to maintenance of Nr4a1 K4&K27 bivalency. In male STR, cocaine enriched repressive H3K27me3 and K4&K27 bivalency at Nr4a1 and failed to increase Nr4a1 mRNA. Furthermore, cocaine epigenetically regulated a putative NR4A1 target, Cartpt, in male PFC. CONCLUSION: This study defined the epigenetic regulation of Nr4a1 in reward brain regions in male and female mice. Cocaine treatment in female mice increased Nr4a1 mRNA in STR, but there was no change in Nr4a1 H3K27me3 or K4&K27 promoter bivalency. Following cocaine treatment in male mice, Nr4a1 mRNA did not change in STR, HPC, or PFC, and Nr4a1 H3K27me3 and K4&K27 promoter bivalency increased in the STR.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Ventral Hippocampal Infusions of C20:0 Ceramide Stimulate Microglia and Induce Anhedonia-like Behavior in Female and Male Rats</a></h4>

              
                Increased long-chain C20:0 ceramides have been found in the serum of patients with depression. Moreover, ceramides are linked with increased microglia reactivity and inflammatory cytokine production, which are associated with depression. Since ceramides can readily cross the blood brain barrier, peripheral C20:0 ceramides could enter the brain, activate microglia, and induce depressive-like behavior. In this study, we determined whether localized infusion of C20:0 ceramides into the ventral hippocampus (VH) of rats is sufficient to activate microglia and induce depressive-like behaviors. Adult male and female rats received infusions of C20:0 ceramides or vehicle solution every other day for 2 weeks. After the third infusion, C20:0-infused animals showed reduced sucrose preference suggesting anhedonia-like behavior. However, 4-6 days after the last infusion, animals infused with C20:0 ceramides did not show anhedonia-like or despair-like behavior suggesting the behavioral effect was reversible. After the final behavioral test, C20:0-infused animals had more Iba-1+ microglia in the VH. Despite the increased number of VH microglia, the expression of inflammatory genes was not increased. In conclusion, our data suggest that localized increases in C20:0 ceramides in the VH are sufficient to induce microglia activation and reversible anhedonia-like behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">The effect of sleep continuity disruption on multimodal emotion processing and regulation: a laboratory-based, randomized, controlled experiment in good sleepers</a></h4>

              
                Previous research shows that experimental sleep deprivation alters emotion processing, suggesting a potential mechanism linking sleep disruption to mental ill-health. Extending previous work, we experimentally disrupted sleep continuity in good sleepers and assessed next-day emotion processing and regulation using tasks with established sensitivity to depression. In a laboratory-based study, 51 good sleepers (37 female; mean age = 24 years, SD= 3.63) were randomized to one night (23:00-07:00) of uninterrupted sleep (n=24) or sleep continuity disruption (n=27). We assessed emotion perception, attention, and memory the following day. Participants also completed an emotion regulation task and measures of self-reported affect, anxiety, sleepiness, overnight declarative memory consolidation, and psychomotor vigilance. Confirming the effects of the manipulation, sleep continuity disruption led to a marked decrease in polysomnography-defined total sleep time (229.98 mins vs 434.57 mins), increased wake-time after sleep onset (260.66 mins vs 23.84 mins) and increased sleepiness (d=0.81). Sleep continuity disruption led to increased anxiety (d=0.68), decreased positive affect (d=-0.62), reduced overnight declarative memory consolidation (d=-1.08) and reduced psychomotor vigilance [longer reaction times (d=0.64) and more lapses (d=0.74)], relative to control. However, contrary to our hypotheses, experimental sleep disruption had no effect on perception of, or bias for, emotional facial expressions, emotional memory for words, or emotion regulation following worry induction. In conclusion, one night of sleep continuity disruption had no appreciable effect on objective measures of emotion processing or emotion regulation in response to worry induction, despite clear effects on memory consolidation, vigilance, and self-reported affect and anxiety.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Protein preference and elevated plasma FGF21 induced by dietary protein restriction is similar in both male and female mice</a></h4>

              
                Animals that are moderately protein restricted respond to this dietary stress by increasing consumption of protein-containing foods. This is true in many species, including rodents. Rodent models of protein restriction have typically relied on only male subjects, and there are plausible reasons why female rodents may respond differently to dietary protein restriction. To address this gap in knowledge, the current experiments examined protein preference after two weeks on a 5% protein diet or 20% protein control diet, in male and female mice. We found that female mice, like male mice, increase consumption of 4% casein (protein) relative to 4% maltodextrin (carbohydrate) when presented with both simultaneously. Interestingly, this increased consumption was due to more bursts in females and more licks per burst in males, indicating possible differences in mechanism by which increased intake is achieved. Stage of the estrous cycle did not affect female responses. Moreover, we measured plasma FGF21 - a hormone induced by protein restriction and necessary for protein preference - in male and female mice. Here, we found no statistical differences between protein-restricted males, females in diestrus, or females in proestrus. In non-restricted mice FGF21 levels were low, but significantly higher in females in proestrus than females in diestrus or males. Overall, these experiments highlight the importance of including female subjects in studies of food choice and macronutrient restriction.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Synapses learn to utilize pre-synaptic noise for the prediction of postsynaptic dynamics</a></h4>

              
                Synapses in the brain are highly noisy, which leads to a large trial-by-trial variability. Given how costly synapses are in terms of energy consumption these high levels of noise are surprising. Here we propose that synapses use their noise to represent uncertainties about the activity of the post-synaptic neuron. To show this we utilize the free-energy principle (FEP), a well-established theoretical framework to describe the ability of organisms to self-organize and survive in uncertain environments. This principle provides insights on multiple scales, from high-level behavioral functions such as attention or foraging, to the dynamics of single microcircuits in the brain, suggesting that the FEP can be used to describe all levels of brain function. The synapse-centric account of the FEP that is pursued here, suggests that synapses form an internal model of the somatic membrane dynamics, being updated by a synaptic learning rule that resembles experimentally well-established LTP/LTD mechanisms. This approach entails that a synapse utilizes noisy processes like stochastic synaptic release to also encode its uncertainty about the state of the somatic potential. Although each synapse strives for predicting the somatic dynamics of its neuron, we show that the emergent dynamics of many synapses in a neuronal network resolve different learning problems such as pattern classification or closed-loop control in a dynamic environment. Hereby, synapses coordinate their noise processes to represent and utilize uncertainties on the network level in behaviorally ambiguous situations.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Single-cell mosaicism analysis reveals cell-type-specific somatic mutational burden in Alzheimer's Dementia</a></h4>

              
                Despite significant advances in identifying genetic drivers of neurodegenerative disorders, the majority of affected individuals lack molecular genetic diagnosis, with somatic mutations proposed as one potential contributor to increased risk. Here, we report the first cell-type-specific map of somatic mosaicism in Alzheimer's Dementia (AlzD), using 4,014 cells from prefrontal cortex samples of 19 AlzD and 17 non-AlzD individuals. We integrate full-transcript single-nucleus RNA-seq (SMART-Seq) with matched individual-level whole-genome sequencing to jointly infer mutational events and the cell-type in which they occurred. AlzD individuals show increased mutational burden, localized in excitatory neurons, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes and disease-associated "senescent" cells. High-mutational-burden cells showed mutational enrichment and similar single-cell expression profiles in AlzD cases versus non-AlzD individuals, indicating cellular-level genotype-to-phenotype correlation. Somatic mutations are specifically enriched for known AlzD genes, and implicate biologically meaningful cell-type specific processes, including: neuronal energy regulation, endocytic trafficking (NEFM), lipid metabolism (CNP, CRYAB), proteostasis (USP34), cytoskeleton, and microtubule dynamics (MACF1).

                The expression of the corticotropin-releasing hormone (PmCRH) and the CRH-binding protein (PmCRHBP) mRNAs was studied by in situ hybridization in the brain of prolarvae, larvae and adults of the sea lamprey Petromyzon marinus. We also generated an antibody against the PmCRH mature peptide to study the distribution of PmCRH-immunoreactive cells and fibers. PmCRH immunohistochemistry was combined with anti-tyrosine hydroxylase immunohistochemistry, PmCRHBP in situ hybridization or neurobiotin transport from the spinal cord. The most numerous PmCRH-expressing cells were observed in the magnocellular preoptic nucleus-paraventricular nucleus and in the superior and medial rhombencephalic reticular formation. PmCRH expression was more extended in adults than in larvae, and some cell populations were mainly (olfactory bulb) or only (striatum, ventral hypothalamus, prethalamus) observed in adults. The preopto-paraventricular fibers form conspicuous tracts coursing towards the neurohypophysis, but many immunoreactive fibers were also observed coursing in many other brain regions. Brain descending fibers in the spinal cord come from cells located in the isthmus and in the medial rhombencephalic reticular nucleus. The distribution of PmCRHBP-expressing neurons was different from that of PmCRH cells, with cells mainly present in the septum, striatum, preoptic region, tuberal hypothalamus, pretectum, pineal complex, isthmus, reticular formation, and spinal cord. Again, expression in adults was more extended than in larvae. PmCRH- and PmCRHBP-expressing cells are different, excluding colocalization of these substances in the same neuron. Present findings reveal a complex CRH/CRHBP system in the brain of the oldest extant vertebrate group, the agnathans, which shows similarities but important divergences with that of mammals.

                The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and its major downstream target within the basal ganglia-the rostromedial caudate nucleus (rmCD)-are involved in reward-value processing and goal-directed behavior. However, a causal contribution of the pathway linking these two structures to goal-directed behavior has not been established. Using the chemogenetic technology of Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs with a crossed inactivation design, we functionally and reversibly disrupted interactions between the OFC and rmCD in two male macaque monkeys. We injected an adeno-associated virus vector expressing an inhibitory designer receptor (hM4Di) into the OFC and contralateral rmCD, the expression of which was visualized in vivo by positron emission tomography (PET) and confirmed by post-mortem immunohistochemistry. Functional disconnection of the OFC and rmCD resulted in a significant and reproducible loss of sensitivity to the cued reward value for goal-directed action. This decreased sensitivity was most prominent when monkeys had accumulated a certain amount of reward. These results provide causal evidence that the interaction between the OFC and the rmCD is needed for motivational control of action on the basis of the relative reward value and internal drive. This finding extends current understanding of the physiological basis of psychiatric disorders in which goal-directed behavior is affected, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder.

                Facial expressions are indispensable for daily communication. Previous neuroimaging studies investigating facial expression processing presented pre-recorded stimuli and lacked live face-to-face interactions. Our paradigm alternated between presentations of models' real-time performance and pre-recorded videos of dynamic facial expressions to participants. Simultaneous fMRI and facial electromyography activity recordings, as well as post-scan valence and arousal ratings were acquired. Live facial expressions enhanced the subjective valence and arousal ratings as well as facial muscular responses. Live performances showed greater engagement of the right posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) and right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) more, and modulated the effective connectivity between them. A support vector machine reliably classified multivoxel activation patterns in brain regions involved in dynamic facial expression processing in mentalizing and salience networks. The results suggest that live social interaction modulates the activity and connectivity of the right mirror neuron system and enhances spontaneous mimicry, further facilitating emotional contagion.

                Background and Objectives: Fluid biomarkers are a recent field of interest in Huntington disease (HD). We focused on small circulating RNAs from plasma of subjects with prodromal (pre-HD) and overt disease by a two-stage approach: an unbiased investigation by an array method and a validation study to quantify a significant small nucleolar RNA. Methods: Through Affymetrix Gene-Chip-miRNA-Array we performed an exploratory study on 9 HD patients, 8 healthy subjects (HS) and 5 psychiatric patients (PP; who share drugs with HD patients, to control for iatrogenic effects). Through real time PCR we validated the results in an independent population of 23 HD patients, 15 pre-HD, 24 PP, 28 Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients (added to control the disease-specificity of our finding) and 24 HS. A bioinformatic analysis was also performed to interpret our finding. Results: The microarray results showed a significant signal for U13 small nucleolar RNA (SNORD13) that was increased in plasma of HD patients compared to controls (fold change, 1.54, p =0.003 HD vs. HS, and fold change 1.44 p = 0.0026 HD vs. PP). In the validation population the significant increase in HD patients was evident compared to both pre-HD and the three control groups (p<0.00001). The plasma levels of SNORD13 correlated with the status of mutant huntingtin carrier and the disease duration (respectively R=0.69; p<0.000001; R=0.49; p=0.015). Through receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, we showed high accuracy of plasmatic SNORD13 in discriminating HD patients from pre-HD and control groups (AUC=0.963), outperforming values reported in another study for intrathecal or plasmatic mutant huntingtin and neurofilament light chain as biomarkers of overt HD. The bioinformatic analysis on SNORD13 interactome and pathway analysis showed enrichments for factors involved in nuclear functions beyond the ribosome biogenesis. Discussion: We report the unprecedented finding of a potential role of small nucleolar RNAs in HD. Circulating SNORD13 seems a good biomarker for clinical purposes. It seems to be specific for HD and to peripherally report a plausible tipping point in the pathogenic cascade at neuronal level, possibly paving the way for new therapeutic targets.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Targeting diverse operational regimes in recurrent spiking networks</a></h4>

              
                Neural computations emerge from recurrent neural circuits that comprise hundreds to a few thousand neurons. Continuous progress in connectomics, electrophysiology, and calcium imaging require tractable spiking network models that can consistently incorporate new information about the network structure and reproduce the recorded neural activity features. However, it is challenging to predict which spiking network connectivity configurations and neural properties can generate fundamental operational states and specific experimentally reported nonlinear cortical computations. Theoretical descriptions for the computational state of cortical spiking circuits are diverse, including the balanced state where excitatory and inhibitory inputs balance almost perfectly or the inhibition stabilized state (ISN) where the excitatory part of the circuit is unstable. It remains an open question whether these states can co-exist with experimentally reported nonlinear computations and whether they can be recovered in biologically realistic implementations of spiking networks. Here, we show how to identify spiking network connectivity patterns underlying diverse nonlinear computations such as XOR, bistability, inhibitory stabilization, supersaturation, and persistent activity. We established a mapping between the stabilized supralinear network (SSN) and spiking activity which allowed us to pinpoint the location in parameter space where these activity regimes occur. Notably, we found that biologically-sized spiking networks can have irregular asynchronous activity that does not require strong excitation-inhibition balance or large feedforward input and we showed that the dynamic firing rate trajectories in spiking networks can be precisely targeted without error-driven training algorithms.

                Sociality is classified as one of the major transitions in evolution, and the most advanced level of sociality is found in eusocial insects such as the honey bees. This sophisticated social behavior seems to be associated with higher cognitive abilities in these insects, however the study of their neural bases has been limited by the lack of tools that allow measuring neuronal activity simultaneously in different brain regions of the honey bee brain. Here, we developed the first pan-neuronal genetic driver in a Hymenopteran model organism, the honey bee, and expressed the calcium indicator GCaMP6f under the control of the honey bee synapsin promoter. We show that GCaMP6f is widely expressed in the honey bee brain, allowing to record neural activity from multiple brain regions simultaneously, including from poorly investigated brain regions such as the mushroom body calyces or the lateral horn. Our recordings show that while odorant quality (chemical structure) and quantity are faithfully encoded in the honeybee antennal lobe, odor coding in the lateral horn departs from this simple physico-chemical coding, in line with the role of this structure in coding the biological value of odorants. These brain recordings represent the first use of a neurogenetic tool for recording neural activity in a eusocial insect.

                Synaptic proteins are immobilized at synapses via interactions with scaffolding proteins. Scaffolding proteins for glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses have been extensively studied; however, far less is known about how scaffolds shape the function of cholinergic synapses. Here we analyze the role of two C. elegans post-synaptic scaffolding proteins (LIN-2/CASK and FRM-3/FARP) at cholinergic neuromuscular junctions. Constitutive knockouts or muscle specific inactivation of lin-2 and frm-3 dramatically reduced spontaneous and evoked post-synaptic currents. These synaptic defects resulted from decreased abundance of post-synaptic ionotropic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) and decreased presynaptic ACh release. Thus, our findings show that post-synaptic LIN-2/FRM-3 complexes coordinately control pre- and post-synaptic function, thereby promoting cholinergic synaptic transmission.

                Despite limited evidence for competent infection and viral replication of SARS-CoV-2 in the central nervous system (CNS), neurologic dysfunction is a common post-acute medical condition reported in recovered COVID-19 patients. To identify a potential noninfectious route for SARS-CoV-2-mediated neurological damage, we constructed colloidal nanocrystal quantum dots linked to micelles decorated with spike protein (COVID-QDs) as a biomimetic to interrogate how blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysregulation may subsequently induce neuroinflammation in the absence of infection. In transwell co-culture of endothelial bEnd.3 monolayers and primary neuroglia, we exposed only the bEnd.3 monolayers to COVID-QDs and examined by fluorescence microscopy whether such treatment led to (i) increased inflammation and leakage across the bEnd.3 monolayers, (ii) permeability of the COVID-QDs across the monolayers, and (iii) induction of neuroinflammation in neuroglial cultures. The results of our study provide evidence of neuroinflammatory hallmarks in cultured neurons and astrocytes without direct exposure to SARS-CoV-2-like nanoparticles. Additionally, we found that pre-treatment of our co-cultures with a small-molecule, broad-spectrum inhibitor of mixed lineage and leucine rich repeat kinases led to reversal of the observed dysregulation in endothelial monolayers and resulted in neuroglial protection. The results reported here may serve to guide future studies into the potential mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 mediates neurologic dysfunction.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cluster-Based Inference for Memory-Based Cognition</a></h4>

              
                This paper proposes a model of hippocampal-based category learning using a cluster-based inference framework which produces two systems (i) an extendable cluster-based memory module (CMM) that provides representations of learning episodes with strong pattern separation, and supports online decision making during that learning, (ii) cluster-based task modules (CTMs) which consolidate clusters learnt by CMM to support higher-accuracy decision making in the mid-term. Learning in CMMs optimises the joint probability of stimuli and category labels, whereas learning in CTMs optimises the probability of categories given stimuli. The latter system learns from the former via a process of "cluster consolidation". We apply the model to data from a behavioral learning task and find that, as well as improving categorisation performance, cluster consolidation decreases recognition scores for old cues but increases them for novel cues. This model-based perspective explains forgetting and false memory effects as serving future categorisation performance. The paper also expresses a view that models of memory-based cognition should provide human-level performance on complex categorisation tasks, and do so with minimal labelled data. In working toward this goal we therefore compared the accuracy of CMM- and CTM-based decision making to standard Softmax Regression approaches on benchmark machine learning datasets. This produced mixed results. We found some significant improvements of CMM over Softmax Regression and of CTM over CMM. Overall, our framework reconciles complementary learning systems theory with more recent findings from cognitive neuroscience of generative replay and hippocampal-based generalisation.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Dissection of a sensorimotor circuit that regulates aversion to odors and pathogenic bacteria in C. elegans by whole-brain simulation</a></h4>

              
                Altering behavior to reduce pathogen exposure is a key line of defense against pathogen attack for nearly all animals. The use of Caenorhabditis elegans bacterial infection models have allowed for many insights into the molecular mechanisms of behavioral immunity. However, the neural circuitry between chemosensory neurons that sense pathogenic bacterial cues and the motor neurons responsible for avoidance-associated locomotion remains unknown. We found that backward locomotion was a component of learned pathogen avoidance, as animals pre-exposed to Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Enterococcus faecalis showed reflexive aversion to drops of the bacteria, requiring ASI, AWB, and AWC neurons and ASE, AWB, and AWC neurons, respectively. This response also involved intestinal distention and, for E. faecalis, required expression of TRPM channels in the intestine and excretory system. Using whole-brain simulation and functional assays, we uncovered a sensorimotor circuit governing learned reflexive aversion. This behavior is controlled by a four-layer neural circuit composed of olfactory neurons, interneurons, and motor neurons that control backward locomotion crucial for learned reflexive aversion to pathogenic bacteria, learned avoidance, and a repulsive odor. The discovery of a complete sensorimotor circuit for reflexive aversion demonstrates the utility of using the C. elegans connectome and computational modeling in uncovering new neuronal regulators of behavior.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">GABAergic regulation of cell proliferation within the adult mouse spinal cord</a></h4>

              
                Manipulation of neural stem cell proliferation and differentiation in the postnatal CNS is receiving significant attention due to therapeutic potential. In the spinal cord, such manipulations may promote repair in conditions such as multiple sclerosis or spinal cord injury, but may also limit excessive cell proliferation contributing to tumours such as ependymomas. Here we show that when ambient GABA is increased in vigabatrin-treated or decreased in glutamic acid decarboxylase67-green fluorescent protein (GAD67-GFP) mice, the numbers of proliferating cells respectively decreased or increased. Thus, intrinsic spinal cord GABA levels are correlated with the extent of cell proliferation, providing important evidence for the possibility of manipulating these levels. Diazepam binding inhibitor, an endogenous protein that interacts with GABA receptors and its breakdown product, octadecaneuropeptide, which preferentially activates central benzodiazepine (CBR) sites, were highly expressed in the spinal cord, especially in ependymal cells surrounding the central canal. Furthermore, animals with reduced CBR activation via treatment with flumazenil or Ro15-4513, or with a G2F77I mutation in the CBR binding site had greater numbers of Ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine positive cells compared to control, which maintained their stem cell status since the proportion of newly proliferated cells becoming oligodendrocytes or astrocytes was significantly lower. Altering endogenous GABA levels or modulating GABAergic signaling through specific sites on the GABA receptors therefore influences NSC proliferation in the adult spinal cord. These findings provide a basis for further study into how GABAergic signaling could be manipulated to enable spinal cord self-regeneration and recovery or limit pathological proliferative activity.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Differential regulation of gene expression pathways with dexamethasone and ACTH after early life seizures</a></h4>

              
                Early-life seizures (ELS) are associated with persistent cognitive deficits such as ADHD and memory impairment. These co-morbidities have a dramatic negative impact on the quality of life of patients. Therapies that improve cognitive outcomes have enormous potential to improve patients quality of life. Our previous work in a rat flurothyl-induction model showed that administration of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) at time of seizure induction led to improved learning and memory in the animals despite no effect on seizure latency or duration. Administration of dexamethasone (Dex), a corticosteroid, did not have the same positive effect on learning and memory and has even been shown to exacerbate injury in a rat model of temporal lobe epilepsy. We hypothesized that ACTH exerted positive effects on cognitive outcomes through beneficial changes to gene expression and proposed that administration of ACTH at seizure induction would return gene-expression in the brain towards the normal pattern of expression in the Control animals whereas Dex would not. Twenty-six Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized into vehicle- Control, and ACTH-, Dex-, and vehicle- ELS. Rat pups were subjected to 60 flurothyl seizures from P5 to P15. After seizure induction, brains were removed and the hippocampus and PFC were dissected, RNA was extracted and sequenced, and differential expression analysis was performed using generalized estimating equations. Differential expression analysis showed that ACTH pushes gene expression in the brain back to a more normal state of expression through enrichment of pathways involved in supporting homeostatic balance and down-regulating pathways that might contribute to excitotoxic cell-damage post-ELS.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Tbx3 is required for mammalian retinal angiogenesis.</a></h4>

              
                Neural tissue formation requires coordinated, interwoven development of both neural and vascular cells. Spatially distinct regions of the central nervous system (CNS) express factors that are predicted to affect vasculature in one area but not another, yet an example of this idea has not been found. Due to its accessibility, the eye is an excellent tissue to study this question. The factor TBX3 is required for frog eye development, yet its role in mammalian eye formation was not known. To determine how Tbx3 loss-of-function affected eye formation, we crossed the validated Tbx3-floxed mice with the optic cup-Cre recombinase driver, BAC-Dkk3-CRE. We confirmed earlier expression studies of Tbx3 RNA and protein in the embryonic dorsal optic vesicle and, postnatally, in sporadic clusters of cells of the inner nuclear layer. Surprisingly, we also found TBX3 in astrocyte precursors at P0. With Tbx3 loss, blood vessels were malformed throughout the retina, but with more severe effects seen in the dorsal retina. Astrocyte precursors were reduced in number and failed to form a lattice at the dorsal edge. We next examined retinal ganglion cells, as they have been shown to play a critical role in retinal angiogenesis. We found that a subset of intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) were missing melanopsin in the dorsal half of the retina. In previous studies, loss of melanopsin has been linked to hyaloid artery persistence, which we also observed in the Tbx3 cKO retina. Together, these results show that TBX3 is required for retinal angiogenesis.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Motor pattern generation is robust to neural network anatomical imbalance favoring inhibition but not excitation</a></h4>

              
                Animals display rich and coordinated motor patterns during walking and running. Previous modelling as well as experimental results suggest that the balance between excitation and inhibition in neural networks may be critical for generating such structured motor patterns. However, biological neural networks have an anatomical imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory neural populations. We explore the influence of such an anatomical imbalance on the ability of a reservoir computing artificial neural network to learn human locomotor patterns for slow walking, fast walking and running. We varied the numbers of neurons, connections percentages and connection strengths of excitatory and inhibitory populations. We showed that performance depended on the network anatomy. First, it deteriorated when the total number of neurons was too small or the total connection strength was too large. Second, performance was critically dependent on the balance between excitation and inhibition. Imbalance towards excitation caused a reduction in the richness of internal network dynamics, leading to a stereotypical motor output and poor overall performance. In contrast, rich internal dynamics and good overall performance were found when the network anatomy was either balanced or imbalanced towards inhibition. This suggests that motor pattern generation may be robust to increased inhibition but not increased excitation in neural networks.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Mind the gap: decoding decreases in tonic firing in populations of spiking neurons</a></h4>

              
                A stimulus can be encoded in a population of spiking neurons through any change in the statistics of their spike patterns. Thus, the baseline spike statistics in the absence of a stimulus can impact the populations encoding capacity. Some neurons maintain a baseline firing pattern and can decrease their spike rate in response to a stimulus. Not only do baseline firing rates vary widely among different types of neurons, but so do their higher-order statistics, like the degree to which they tend to group their spikes together into bursts and how those bursts are grouped across the population. We investigated how higher-order statistics of baseline spike patterns impact how much information a neural population can transmit about a stimulus that drives a gap in firing using a novel information-theoretic decoding mechanism which we call an "information train." We discover that there is an optimal level of burstiness for gap detection that is robust to other parameters of the neural population like its size, mean firing rate, and level of correlation. We consider this theoretical result in the context of experimental data from different types of retinal ganglion cells with different baseline spike statistics and determine that the spike statistics of bursty suppressed-by-contrast (bSbC) retinal ganglion cells support nearly optimal detection of both the onset and strength of a contrast step.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Upregulated Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum leads to impaired presynaptic function in Alzheimer's disease</a></h4>

              
                Neurotransmitter release from presynaptic terminals is primarily regulated by rapid Ca2+ influx through membrane-resident voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCCs). Also, accumulating evidence indicates that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is extensively present in axonal terminals of neurons and plays a modulatory role in synaptic transmission by regulating Ca2+ levels. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is marked by enhanced Ca2+ release from the ER and downregulation of Ca2+ buffering proteins. However, the precise consequence of impaired Ca2+ signalling within the vicinity of VGCCs (active zone (AZ)) on exocytosis is poorly understood. Here, we perform in-silico experiments of intracellular Ca2+ signalling and exocytosis in a detailed biophysical model of hippocampal synapses to investigate the effect of aberrant Ca2+ signalling on neurotransmitter release in AD. Our model predicts that enhanced Ca2+ release from the ER increases the probability of neurotransmitter release in AD. Moreover, over very short timescales (30-60 msec), the model exhibits activity-dependent and enhanced short-term plasticity in AD, indicating neuronal hyperactivity -- a hallmark of the disease. Similar to previous observations in AD animal models, our model reveals that during prolonged stimulation (~450 msec), pathological Ca2+ signalling increases depression and desynchronization with stimulus, causing affected synapses to operate unreliably. Overall, our work provides direct evidence in support of a crucial role played by altered Ca2+ homeostasis mediated by intracellular stores in AD.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural resources shift under Methylphenidate: a computational approach to examine anxiety-cognition interplay</a></h4>

              
                The reciprocal interplay between anxiety and cognition is well documented. Anxiety negatively impacts cognition, while cognitive engagement can down-regulate anxiety. The brain mechanisms and dynamics underlying such interplay are not fully understood. To study this question, we experimentally and orthogonally manipulated anxiety (using a threat of shock paradigm) and cognition (using methylphenidate; MPH). The effects of these manipulations on the brain and behavior were evaluated in 50 healthy participants (25 MPH, 25 placebo), using an n-back working memory fMRI task (with low and high load conditions). Behaviorally, improved response accuracy was observed as a main effect of the drug across all conditions. We employed two approaches to understand the neural mechanisms underlying MPH-based cognitive enhancement in safe and threat conditions. First, we performed a hypothesis-driven computational analysis using a mathematical framework to examine how MPH putatively affects cognitive enhancement in the face of induced anxiety across two levels of cognitive load. Second, we performed an exploratory data analysis using Topological Data Analysis (TDA)-based Mapper to examine changes in spatiotemporal brain activity across the entire cortex. Both approaches provided converging evidence that MPH facilitated greater differential engagement of neural resources (brain activity) across low and high working memory load conditions. Furthermore, load-based differential management of neural resources reflects enhanced efficiency that is most powerful during higher load and induced anxiety conditions. Overall, our results provide novel insights regarding brain mechanisms that facilitate cognitive enhancement under MPH and, in future research, may be used to help mitigate anxiety-related cognitive underperformance.

                Recent advances in head-mounted microscopes have enabled imaging of neuronal activity using genetic-tools in freely moving mice but these microscopes are restricted to recording in minimally lit arenas and imaging upper cortical layers. Here we built a 2 gram, three-photon excitation-based microscope, containing a z-drive that enabled access to all cortical layers while mice freely behaved in a fully lit environment. We show that neuronal population activity in cortical layer-4 and layer-6 was differentially modulated by lit and dark conditions during free exploration.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Bridging scales from spiking activity to the local field potential through latent dynamics</a></h4>

              
                During wakefulness, cortical networks exhibit diverse states of activity arising from fluctuations in modulatory inputs, any of which may shape the recorded neural activity across a range of scales, from local field potential (LFP) to the spiking of individual neurons. Multiple studies have uncovered state-dependent changes in single neuron activity specific to cell type. These changes are heterogeneous across cell types, suggesting that there is a link between changes in states of wakefulness and the dynamic patterns of spiking activity across the population, yet this is currently not well understood. Here, we use an unsupervised statistical modeling framework to link fluctuations in the state of the LFP to the dynamics of spiking activity of populations of neurons in the whisker area of primary somatosensory cortex of awake male mice. By identifying latent states from population spiking activity, we show that these spiking states are more informative of states of the LFP than a direct readout of the spiking activity of single neurons or of the population. Further, we find that the latent spiking states predict trial-by-trial variability in sensory responses as well as one aspect of behavior, whisking activity. Taken together, our approach captures the latent variables that underlie the dynamics of the spiking activity of cortical neuronal populations, providing a framework to relate cortical activity across different scales.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Pallidal neuromodulation of the explore/exploit trade-off in decision-making</a></h4>

              
                Every decision that we make involves a conflict between exploiting our current knowledge of an actions value or exploring alternative courses of action that might lead to a better, or worse outcome. The sub-cortical nuclei that make up the basal ganglia have been proposed as a neural circuit that may contribute to resolving this explore-exploit  dilemma. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effects of neuromodulating the basal ganglias output nucleus, the globus pallidus interna, in patients who had undergone deep brain stimulation (DBS) for isolated dystonia. Neuromodulation enhanced the number of exploratory choices to the lower value option in a 2-armed bandit probabilistic reversal-learning task. Enhanced exploration was explained by a reduction in both rate of evidence accumulation (drift rate) and by the amount of evidence needed to decide (boundary separation) in a reinforcement learning drift diffusion model. We estimated the functional connectivity profile between the stimulating DBS electrode and the rest of the brain using a normative functional connectome derived from heathy controls. Variation in the extent of neuromodulation induced exploration between patients was predicted by the degree of functional connectivity between the stimulating electrode and prefrontal and sensorimotor cortices. We conclude that the basal ganglias output nucleus, the globus pallidus interna, can adaptively modify decision choice when faced with the dilemma to explore or exploit.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Molecular-enriched functional connectivity in the human brain using multiband multi-echo simultaneous ASL/BOLD fMRI</a></h4>

              
                Receptor-Enriched Analysis of functional Connectivity by Targets (REACT) is a novel analytical strategy that enriches functional connectivity (FC) information from functional MRI (fMRI) with molecular information on the neurotransmitter distribution density in the human brain, providing a biological basis to the FC analysis. So far, this integrative approach has been used in blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI studies only, providing new insights into the brain mechanisms underlying specific disorders and its response to pharmacological challenges. In this study, we demonstrate that the application of REACT can be further extended to arterial spin labelling (ASL) fMRI. Some of the advantages of this extension include the combination of neurotransmitter specific information provided by molecular imaging with a quantitative marker of neuronal activity, the suitability of ASL for pharmacological MRI (phMRI) studies assessing drug effects on baseline brain function, and the possibility to acquire images that are not affected by susceptibility artifacts in the regions linked to major neurotransmitter systems.

In this work, we tested the feasibility of applying REACT to resting state ASL fMRI and compared the molecular-enriched FC maps derived from ASL data with those derived from BOLD data. We applied REACT to high-resolution, whole-brain simultaneous ASL/BOLD resting-state fMRI data of 29 healthy subjects and estimated the ASL- and BOLD-based FC maps related to six molecular systems, including the transporters of dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and vesicular acetylcholine, and the GABA-A and mGlu5 receptors. We then compared the ASL and BOLD FC maps in terms of spatial similarity, using the Dice Similarity Index and the voxel-wise spatial correlation. On a data subsample (N=19) we also evaluated the test-retest reproducibility of each modality using the regional intraclass correlation coefficient, and compared the two modalities.

Our results showed robust spatial patterns of molecular-enriched functional connectivity for both modalities, moderate to high similarity between BOLD- and ASL-derived FC maps and mixed results in terms of reproducibility (i.e., none of the modalities outperformed the other). Overall, our findings show that the ASL signal is as informative as BOLD in detecting functional circuits associated with specific molecular pathways, and that the two modalities may provide complementary information related to these circuits.

Considering the more direct link of ASL imaging with neuronal acrivity compared to BOLD and its suitability for phMRI studies, this new integrative approach could become a valuable asset in clinical studies investigating functional alterations in patients with brain disorders, or in pharmacological studies investigating the effects of new or existing compounds on the brain.

                Are conspecific emotional vocalizations special? Although often investigated in non-human primates using functional magnetic resonance imaging or positron emission tomography, it remains unclear whether the listening of conspecific vocal emotions leads to similar or different cerebral activations when compared to heterospecific calls (i.e. expressed by another primate species). Using a neuroimaging technique rarely employed in monkeys so far, functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS), the present study investigated cortical temporal activities during exposure to both conspecific and heterospecific calls in three female adult baboons (Papio anubis). The three subjects were lightly anesthetized and passively exposed to agonistic baboon and chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) vocalizations, as well as energy matched white noises in order to control for this low-level acoustic feature. Despite inter-individual variabilities, permutation test analyses on the extracted OxyHemoglobin signal revealed for two subjects out of three significant differences between the passive listening of baboon versus chimpanzee stimuli. Additionally, in one subject, a modulation of the left temporal cortex activity was found for the perception of baboon calls contrasted to chimpanzee vocalizations as well as for the passive listening of baboon white noises compared to chimpanzee ones. Although the lack of generalization of those findings in all three subjects prevents us to drawn any conclusion and that more subjects would be needed, the hypothesis that baboons cortical temporal regions may be more sensitive to the processing of conspecific sounds compared to heterospecific stimuli is not excluded. Our study highlights that fNIRS may be a promising alternative to further investigate the auditory mechanisms at play in the right and left baboons temporal cortices for the processing of emotional vocalizations.

	<p>Attention focus changes performance, and external focus (EF) improves performance compared to internal focus (IF). However, recently, the dominance of attention focus, rather than the effectiveness of unilateral EF, has been examined. Although the positive effects of EF on standing postural control have been reported, the dominance of attention focus has not yet been examined. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the dominance of attention focus and its neural mechanism in standing postural control using electroencephalography (EEG). A standing postural control task under IF and EF conditions was performed on healthy young men. Gravity center sway and cortical activity simultaneously using a stabilometer and an EEG were measured. Participants were classified into IF-dominant and EF-dominant groups according to their index of postural stability. The EEG was analyzed, and cortical activity in the theta-wave band was compared between the IF-dominant and EF-dominant groups. Significant neural activity was observed in the left parietal lobe of the IF-dominant group in the IF condition, and in the left frontal lobe of the EF-dominant group in the EF condition (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.05). Differences in EEG activity between IF-dominant and EF-dominant groups, in standing postural control, were detected. This contributes to the development of training methods that consider attentional focus dominance in postural control.</p>

	<p>The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, continues to impact global health regarding both morbidity and mortality. Although SARS-CoV-2 primarily causes acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the virus interacts with and influences other organs and tissues, including blood vessel endothelium, heart, gastrointestinal tract, and brain. We are learning much about the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection; however, we are just beginning to study and understand the long-term and chronic health consequences. Since the pandemic&amp;amp;rsquo;s beginning in late 2019, older adults, those with pre-existing illnesses, or both, have an increased risk of contracting COVID-19 and developing severe COVID-19. Furthermore, older adults are also more likely to develop the neurodegenerative disorder Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD), with advanced age as the most significant risk factor. Thus, does SARS-CoV-2 potentially influence, promote, or accelerate the development of PD in older adults? Our initial focus was aimed at understanding SARS-CoV-2 pathophysiology and the connection to neurodegenerative disorders. We then completed a literature review to assess the relationship between PD and COVID-19. We described potential molecular and cellular pathways that indicate dopaminergic neurons are susceptible, both directly and indirectly, to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We concluded that under certain pathological circumstances, in vulnerable persons-with-Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PwP), SARS-CoV-2 acts as a neurodegenerative enhancer to potentially support the development or progression of PD and its related motor and non-motor symptoms.</p>

	<p>Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a visual obstacle caused by diabetic disease, which forms because of long-standing diabetes mellitus, which damages the retinal blood vessels. This disease is considered one of the principal causes of sightlessness and accounts for more than 158 million cases all over the world. Since early detection and classification could diminish the visual impairment, it is significant to develop an automated DR diagnosis method. Although deep learning models provide automatic feature extraction and classification, training such models from scratch requires a larger annotated dataset. The availability of annotated training datasets is considered a core issue for implementing deep learning in the classification of medical images. The models based on transfer learning are widely adopted by the researchers to overcome annotated data insufficiency problems and computational overhead. In the proposed study, features are extracted from fundus images using the pre-trained network VGGNet and combined with the concept of transfer learning to improve classification performance. To deal with data insufficiency and unbalancing problems, we employed various data augmentation operations differently on each grade of DR. The results of the experiment indicate that the proposed framework (which is evaluated on the benchmark dataset) outperformed advanced methods in terms of accurateness. Our technique, in combination with handcrafted features, could be used to improve classification accuracy.</p>

	<p>Background: Previous studies have investigated the relationship between schizotypal traits and odor identification ability as well as the relationship between schizotypal traits and odor hedonic capacity in adults. However, very little is known about the relationship among these three factors, especially in children and adolescents. The current study aimed to explore the relationship among these three factors in children and adolescents as well as the potential role of odor identification ability. Method: A total of 355 non-clinical children and adolescents (aged 9&amp;amp;ndash;16 years) were recruited in the study. They were asked to complete the Universal Sniff Test (U-Sniff), the Chemosensory Pleasure Scale for Children (CPS-C), and the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire&amp;amp;mdash;Child (SPQ-C). Results: The SPQ-C scores were negatively correlated with both the odor identification scores and the odor hedonic scores (p = 0.022 and p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001, respectively). Only the interpersonal&amp;amp;ndash;affective factor of the SPQ-C was negatively correlated with the odor identification scores (p = 0.031). The odor identification scores were significantly positively associated with the odor hedonic scores (p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Moreover, the relationship between odor hedonic capacity and schizotypal traits, especially the interpersonal&amp;amp;ndash;affective factor, was mediated by odor identification ability. Conclusions: Schizotypal traits were negatively correlated with both odor identification ability and odor hedonic capacity in children and adolescents, while odor identification ability was found to mediate the relationship between odor hedonic capacity and schizotypal traits, especially the interpersonal&amp;amp;ndash;affective factor. Our study indicated that improving odor identification ability through olfactory training may have a positive influence on odor hedonic capacity in individuals with schizotypal traits.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Identifying Inputs to Visual Projection Neurons in Drosophila Lobula by Analyzing Connectomic Data</a></h4>

              
                <p>Electron microscopy (EM)-based connectomes provide important insights into how visual circuitry of fruit fly <I>Drosophila</I> computes various visual features, guiding and complementing behavioral and physiological studies. However, connectomic analyses of the lobula, a neuropil putatively dedicated to detecting object-like features, remains underdeveloped, largely because of incomplete data on the inputs to the brain region. Here, we attempted to map the columnar inputs into the <I>Drosophila</I> lobula neuropil by performing connectivity-based and morphology-based clustering on a densely reconstructed connectome dataset. While the dataset mostly lacked visual neuropils other than lobula, which would normally help identify inputs to lobula, our clustering analysis successfully extracted clusters of cells with homogeneous connectivity and morphology, likely representing genuine cell types. We were able to draw a correspondence between the resulting clusters and previously identified cell types, revealing previously undocumented connectivity between lobula input and output neurons. While future, more complete connectomic reconstructions are necessary to verify the results presented here, they can serve as a useful basis for formulating hypotheses on mechanisms of visual feature detection in lobula.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Impaired Subcortical Processing of Amplitude-Modulated Tones in Mice Deficient for Cacna2d3, a Risk Gene for Autism Spectrum Disorders in Humans</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Temporal processing of complex sounds is a fundamental and complex task in hearing and a prerequisite for processing and understanding vocalization, speech, and prosody. Here, we studied response properties of neurons in the inferior colliculus (IC) in mice lacking <I>Cacna2d3</I>, a risk gene for autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). The &alpha;<SUB>2</SUB>3 auxiliary Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel subunit encoded by <I>Cacna2d3</I> is essential for proper function of glutamatergic synapses in the auditory brainstem. Recent evidence has shown that much of auditory feature extraction is performed in the auditory brainstem and IC, including processing of amplitude modulation (AM). We determined both spectral and temporal properties of single- and multi-unit responses in the IC of anesthetized mice. IC units of &alpha;<SUB>2</SUB>3<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice showed normal tuning properties yet increased spontaneous rates compared with &alpha;<SUB>2</SUB>3<sup>+/+</sup>. When stimulated with AM tones, &alpha;<SUB>2</SUB>3<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> units exhibited less precise temporal coding and reduced evoked rates to higher modulation frequencies (f<SUB>m</SUB>). Whereas first spike latencies (FSLs) were increased for only few modulation frequencies, population peak latencies were increased for f<SUB>m</SUB> ranging from 20 to 100 Hz in &alpha;<SUB>2</SUB>3<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> IC units. The loss of precision of temporal coding with increasing f<SUB>m</SUB> from 70 to 160 Hz was characterized using a normalized offset-corrected (Pearson-like) correlation coefficient, which appeared more appropriate than the metrics of vector strength. The processing deficits of AM sounds analyzed at the level of the IC indicate that &alpha;<SUB>2</SUB>3<sup>&ndash;/&ndash;</sup> mice exhibit a subcortical auditory processing disorder (APD). Similar deficits may be present in other mouse models for ASDs.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Dynamic {theta} Frequency Coordination within and between the Prefrontal Cortex-Hippocampus Circuit during Learning of a Spatial Avoidance Task</a></h4>

              
                <p>-Scale coordination of prelimbic medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) local field potentials (LFPs) and its influence via direct or indirect projections to the ventral hippocampus (vHC) and dorsal hippocampus (dHC) during spatial learning remains poorly understood. We hypothesized that  frequency coordination dynamics within and between the mPFC, dHC, and vHC would be predetermined by the level of connectivity rather than reflecting differing circuit throughput relationships depending on cognitive demands. Moreover, we hypothesized that coherence levels would not change during learning of a complex spatial avoidance task. Adult male rats were bilaterally implanted with EEG electrodes and LFPs recorded in each structure. Contrary to predictions,  coherence averaged across "Early" or "Late" training sessions in the mPFC-HC, mPFC-mPFC, and HC-HC increased as a function of task learning. Coherence levels were also highest between the indirectly connected mPFC-dHC circuit, particularly during early training. Although mPFC postacquisition coherence remained higher with dHC than vHC, dynamic mPFC coherence patterns with both hippocampal poles across avoidance epochs were similar. In the 3 s before avoidance, a regional temporal sequence of transitory coherence peaks emerged between the mPFC-mPFC, the mPFC-HC, and then dHC-dHC. During this sequence, coherence within  bandwidth fluctuated between epochs at distinct subfrequencies, suggesting frequency-specific roles for the propagation of task-relevant processing. On a second timescale, coherence frequency within and between the mPFC and hippocampal septotemporal axis change as a function of avoidance learning and cognitive demand. The results support a role for  coherence subbandwidths, and specifically an 8- to 9-Hz mPFC  signal, for generating and processing qualitatively different types of information in the organization of spatial avoidance behavior in the mPFC-HC circuit.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">The Listening Zone of Human Electrocorticographic Field Potential Recordings</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Intracranial electroencephalographic (icEEG) recordings provide invaluable insights into neural dynamics in humans because of their unmatched spatiotemporal resolution. Yet, such recordings reflect the combined activity of multiple underlying generators, confounding the ability to resolve spatially distinct neural sources. To empirically quantify the listening zone of icEEG recordings, we computed correlations between signals as a function of distance (full width at half maximum; FWHM) between 8752 recording sites in 71 patients (33 female) implanted with either subdural electrodes (SDEs), stereo-encephalography electrodes (sEEG), or high-density sEEG electrodes. As expected, for both SDEs and sEEGs, higher frequency signals exhibited a sharper fall off relative to lower frequency signals. For broadband high  (BHG) activity, the mean FWHM of SDEs (6.6 &plusmn; 2.5 mm) and sEEGs in gray matter (7.14 &plusmn; 1.7 mm) was not significantly different; however, FWHM for low frequencies recorded by sEEGs was 2.45 mm smaller than SDEs. White matter sEEGs showed much lower power for frequencies 17&ndash;200 Hz (q &lt; 0.01) and a much broader decay (11.3 &plusmn; 3.2 mm) than gray matter electrodes (7.14 &plusmn; 1.7 mm). The use of a bipolar referencing scheme significantly lowered FWHM for sEEGs, relative to a white matter reference or a common average reference (CAR). These results outline the influence of array design, spectral bands, and referencing schema on local field potential recordings and source localization in icEEG recordings in humans. The metrics we derive have immediate relevance to the analysis and interpretation of both cognitive and epileptic data.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Host phenotype classification from human microbiome data is mainly driven by the presence of microbial taxa</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Renato Giliberti, Sara Cavaliere, Italia Elisa Mauriello, Danilo Ercolini, Edoardo Pasolli</p>

Machine learning-based classification approaches are widely used to predict host phenotypes from microbiome data. Classifiers are typically employed by considering operational taxonomic units or relative abundance profiles as input features. Such types of data are intrinsically sparse, which opens the opportunity to make predictions from the presence/absence rather than the relative abundance of microbial taxa. This also poses the question whether it is the presence rather than the abundance of particular taxa to be relevant for discrimination purposes, an aspect that has been so far overlooked in the literature. In this paper, we aim at filling this gap by performing a meta-analysis on 4,128 publicly available metagenomes associated with multiple case-control studies. At species-level taxonomic resolution, we show that it is the presence rather than the relative abundance of specific microbial taxa to be important when building classification models. Such findings are robust to the choice of the classifier and confirmed by statistical tests applied to identifying differentially abundant/present taxa. Results are further confirmed at coarser taxonomic resolutions and validated on 4,026 additional 16S rRNA samples coming from 30 public case-control studies.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=15318249&type=etoc&feed=rss">Prolonged Unconsciousness is Common in COVID‐19 and Associated with Hypoxemia</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The purpose of this study was to estimate the time to recovery of command-following and associations between hypoxemia with time to recovery of command-following.</p>
<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>In this multicenter, retrospective, cohort study during the initial surge of the United Statesʼ pandemic (March–July 2020) we estimate the time from intubation to recovery of command-following, using Kaplan Meier cumulative-incidence curves and Cox proportional hazard models. Patients were included if they were admitted to 1 of 3 hospitals because of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), required endotracheal intubation for at least 7 days, and experienced impairment of consciousness (Glasgow Coma Scale motor score &lt;6).</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Five hundred seventy-one patients of the 795 patients recovered command-following. The median time to recovery of command-following was 30 days (95% confidence interval [CI] = 27–32 days). Median time to recovery of command-following increased by 16 days for patients with at least one episode of an arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO<sub>2</sub>) value ≤55 mmHg (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), and 25% recovered ≥10 days after cessation of mechanical ventilation. The time to recovery of command-following  was associated with hypoxemia (PaO<sub>2</sub> ≤55 mmHg hazard ratio [HR] = 0.56, 95% CI = 0.46–0.68; PaO<sub>2</sub> ≤70 HR = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.85–0.91), and each additional day of hypoxemia decreased the likelihood of recovery, accounting for confounders including sedation. These findings were confirmed among patients without any imagining evidence of structural brain injury (n = 199), and in a non-overlapping second surge cohort (N = 427, October 2020 to April 2021).</p>
<h2>Interpretation</h2>
<p>Survivors of severe COVID-19 commonly recover consciousness weeks after cessation of mechanical ventilation. Long recovery periods are associated with more severe hypoxemia. This relationship is not explained by sedation or brain injury identified on clinical imaging and should inform decisions about life-sustaining therapies. ANN NEUROL 2022</p>

                <p>Oxidative stress induces inflammation which in turn exacerbates oxidative stress (OS) and the expression of acute phase proteins (APPs). Regulatory T lymphocyte (Treg) therapy was assessed for suppression of OS and APP responses in longitudinal serum samples from subjects with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis enrolled in a phase I clinical trial. The first round of Treg therapy suppressed levels of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL). During a six-month washout period, ox-LDL levels increased. A second round of therapy again suppressed ox-LDL levels and then rose following the cessation of treatment. Serum levels of APPs, soluble CD14, lipopolysaccharide binding protein, and C-reactive protein, were stabilized during Treg administrations, but rose during the washout period and again after therapy was discontinued. Treg therapy potentially suppresses peripheral OS and the accompanying circulating pro-inflammatory induced APPs, both of which may serve as peripheral candidates for monitoring efficacies of immunomodulating therapies.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">Circadian clock, diurnal glucose metabolic rhythm, and dawn phenomenon</a></h4>

              
                The circadian clock provides cue-independent anticipatory signals for diurnal rhythms of baseline glucose levels and glucose tolerance. The central circadian clock is located in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), which comprises primarily GABAergic neurons. The SCN clock regulates physiological diurnal rhythms of endogenous glucose production (EGP) and hepatic insulin sensitivity through neurohumoral mechanisms. Disruption of the molecular circadian clock is associated with the extended dawn phenomenon (DP) in type 2 diabetes (T2D), referring to hyperglycemia in the early morning without nocturnal hypoglycemia.

                Bharioke, Munz et al. discovered that different general anesthetics consistently synchronize spontaneous activity of mouse layer 5 pyramidal neurons, but of no other cortical cell type, in vivo. Strikingly, changes in synchrony across layer 5 pyramidal neurons, during transitions to and from anesthesia, coincide with loss and recovery of consciousness.

                Somatostatin is a peptide hormone that regulates endocrine systems by binding to G-protein-coupled somatostatin receptors. Somatostatin receptor 2 (SSTR2) is a human somatostatin receptor and is highly implicated in hormone disorders, cancers and neurological diseases. Here, we report the high resolution cryo-EM structure of full-length human SSTR2 bound to the agonist somatostatin (SST-14) in complex with inhibitory G (G<sub>i</sub>) proteins. Our structural and mutagenesis analyses show that seven transmembrane helices form a deep pocket for ligand binding and that SSTR2 recognizes the highly conserved Trp-Lys motif of SST-14 at the bottom of the pocket. Furthermore, our sequence analysis combined with AlphaFold modeled structures of other SSTR isoforms provide a structural basis for the mechanism by which SSTR family proteins specifically interact with their cognate ligands. This work provides the first glimpse into the molecular recognition mechanism of somatostatin receptors and a crucial resource to develop therapeutics targeting somatostatin receptors.

                Most research on glutamate spillover focuses on the deleterious consequences of postsynaptic glutamate receptor overactivation. However, two decades ago, it was noted that the glial coverage of hippocampal synapses is asymmetric: astrocytic coverage of postsynaptic sites exceeds coverage of presynaptic sites by a factor of four. The fundamental relevance of this glial asymmetry remains poorly understood. Here, we used the glutamate biosensor iGluSnFR, and restricted its expression to either CA3 or CA1 neurons to visualize glutamate dynamics at pre- and postsynaptic microenvironments, respectively. We demonstrate that inhibition of the primarily astrocytic glutamate transporter-1 (GLT-1) slows glutamate clearance to a greater extent at presynaptic compared to postsynaptic membranes. GLT-1 expression was reduced early in a mouse model of AD, resulting in slower glutamate clearance rates at presynaptic but not postsynaptic membranes that opposed presynaptic short-term plasticity. Overall, our data demonstrate that the presynapse is particularly vulnerable to GLT-1 dysfunction and may have implications for presynaptic impairments in a variety of brain diseases.

                Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by loss of motor neurons and skeletal muscle atrophy which is caused by ubiquitous deficiency in the survival motor neuron (SMN) protein. Several cellular defects contribute to sensory-motor circuit pathology in SMA mice, but the underlying mechanisms have often been studied in one mouse model without validation in other available models. Here, we used Smn2B/- mice to investigate specific behavioral, morphological, and functional aspects of SMA pathology that we previously characterized in the SMND7 model. Smn2B/- SMA mice on a pure FVB/N background display deficits in body weight gain and muscle strength with onset in the second postnatal week and median survival of 19 days. Morphological analysis revealed severe loss of proprioceptive synapses on the soma of motor neurons and prominent denervation of neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) in axial but not distal muscles. In contrast, no evidence of cell death emerged from analysis of several distinct pools of lumbar motor neurons known to be lost in the disease. Moreover, SMA motor neurons from Smn2B/- mice showed robust nuclear accumulation of p53 but lack of phosphorylation of serine 18 at its amino-terminal, which selectively marks degenerating motor neurons in the SMND7 mouse model. These results indicate that NMJ denervation and deafferentation, but not motor neuron death, are conserved features of SMA pathology in Smn2B/- mice.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Synaptotagmin 7 docks synaptic vesicles for Doc2α-triggered asynchronous neurotransmitter release</a></h4>

              
                The molecular basis of asynchronous neurotransmitter release remains enigmatic despite decades of intense study. Synaptotagmin (syt) 7 and Doc2 have both been proposed as Ca2+ sensors that trigger this mode of exocytosis, but conflicting findings have led to controversy. Here, we demonstrate that at excitatory mouse hippocampal synapses, Doc2 is the major Ca2+ sensor for asynchronous release, while syt7 supports this process through activity-dependent docking of synaptic vesicles. In synapses lacking Doc2, asynchronous release after single action potentials is strongly reduced, while deleting syt7 has no effect. However, in the absence of syt7, docked vesicles cannot recover on millisecond timescales. Consequently, both synchronous and asynchronous release depress from the second pulse on during repetitive activity. By contrast, synapses lacking Doc2 have normal activity-dependent docking, but continue to exhibit decreased asynchronous release after multiple stimuli. Moreover, disruption of both Ca2+ sensors is non-additive. These findings result in a new model whereby syt7 drives activity-dependent docking, thus 'feeding' synaptic vesicles to Doc2 for asynchronous release during on-going transmission.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">rTg(TauP301L)4510 mice exhibit increased VGLUT1 in hippocampal presynaptic glutamatergic vesicles and increased extracellular glutamate release</a></h4>

              
                The molecular pathways that contribute to the onset of symptoms in tauopathy models, including Alzheimers Disease (AD), are difficult to distinguish because multiple changes can happen simultaneously at different stages of disease progression. Understanding early synaptic alterations and their supporting molecular pathways is essential in order to develop better pharmacological targets to treat AD. Here we focus on an early onset rTg(TauP301L)4510 tauopathy mouse model that exhibits hyperexcitability in hippocampal neurons of adult mice that is correlated with presynaptic changes and increased extracellular glutamate levels. However, it is not clear if increased extracellular glutamate is caused by presynaptic changes alone, or if presynaptic changes are a contributing factor among other factors. To determine whether pathogenic tau alters presynaptic function and glutamate release, we studied cultured hippocampal neurons at 14-18 DIV from animals of both sexes to measure presynaptic changes in tauP301L positive mice. We observed that presynaptic vesicles exhibit increased vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGLUT1) using immunohistochemistry of fixed cells and an established pH-sensitive green fluorescent protein approach. We show that tauP301L positive neurons exhibit a 40% increase in VGLUT1 per vesicle compared to tauP301L negative littermates. Further, we use the extracellular glutamate reporter iGluSnFR to show that increased VGLUT1 per vesicle directly translates into a 40% increase in extracellular glutamate. Together, these results show that increased extracellular glutamate levels observed in tauP301L mice are not caused by increased vesicle exocytosis probability but rather are directly related to increased VGLUT1 transporters per synaptic vesicle.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Rapid learning of predictive maps with STDP and theta phase precession</a></h4>

              
                The predictive map hypothesis is a promising candidate principle for hippocampal function. A favoured formalisation of this hypothesis, called the successor representation, proposes that each place cell encodes the expected state occupancy of its target location in the near future. This predictive framework is supported by behavioural as well as electrophysiological evidence and has desirable consequences for both the generalisability and efficiency of reinforcement learning algorithms. However, it is unclear how the successor representation might be learnt in the brain. Error-driven temporal difference learning, commonly used to learn successor representations in artificial agents, is not known to be implemented in hippocampal networks. Instead, we demonstrate that spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP), a form of Hebbian learning, acting on temporally compressed trajectories known as "theta sweeps", is sufficient to rapidly learn a close approximation to the successor representation. The model is biologically plausible - it uses spiking neurons modulated by theta-band oscillations, diffuse and overlapping place cell-like state representations, and experimentally matched parameters. We show how this model maps onto known aspects of hippocampal circuitry and explains substantial variance in the true successor matrix, consequently giving rise to place cells that demonstrate experimentally observed successor representation-related phenomena including backwards expansion on a 1D track and elongation near walls in 2D. Finally, our model provides insight into the observed topographical ordering of place field sizes along the dorsal-ventral axis by showing this is necessary to prevent the detrimental mixing of larger place fields, which encode longer timescale successor representations, with more fine-grained predictions of spatial location.

                Previous studies have shown that a re-organization of the brains functional connectome expressed in terms of integration and segregation may play a pivotal role. However, it has been proven difficult to capture both processes within a single network-based framework. In this study we apply a hierarchical, spatiotemporally flexible network perspective onto fMRI data to track changes in integration and segregation in time. Our results show that network integration and segregation occur simultaneously in the brain. During task performance, global changes in synchronization between networks arise which are tied to the underlying temporal design of the experiment. We show that a hallmark property of the dynamics of the brains functional connectome is a presence of quasiperiodic patterns of network activation and deactivation, which during task performance becomes intertwined with the underlying temporal structure of the experimental paradigm. The proposed approach to study spatiotemporal changes in network reconfiguration during rest as well as task performance could be useful to identify aberrant network motifs in disease.

It has not been investigated whether cortical oscillatory activity exhibits features distinguishing these syndromes. Therefore, we measured resting-state magnetoencephalography in 13 patients with corticobasal syndrome, 10 patients with progressive supranuclear palsy, 23 patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease and 23 healthy controls. We compared spectral power as well as amplitude and frequency of power peaks between the groups. Atypical Parkinsonism was associated with spectral slowing, distinguishing both corticobasal syndrome and progressive supranuclear palsy from age-matched healthy controls and Parkinson's disease. Patients with atypical Parkinsonism showed a shift of beta peaks (13-30 Hz) towards lower frequencies in frontal and central areas bilaterally. A concomitant increase in theta/alpha power relative to controls was observed in both atypical parkinsonian syndromes and in Parkinson's disease. Our results demonstrate that slowing of frontocentral beta oscillations is characteristic of atypical Parkinsonism. Spectral slowing with a different topography has previously been observed in other neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, suggesting that spectral slowing might be an electrophysiological marker of cortical neurodegeneration. As such, it might support differential diagnosis of parkinsonian syndromes in the future.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Statistical learning of distractor co-occurrences facilitates visual search</a></h4>

              
                Visual search depends on the relationship between the target and the distractors, including how the target differs from the distractors and where the target is likely to be amongst the distractors. Whether the statistical structure amongst distractors themselves facilitates search is less well understood. Here, we assessed the benefit of distractor structure using novel shapes whose relationship to each other was learned implicitly during visual search. Participants searched for target items in arrays of shapes that comprised either four pairs of co-occurring distractor shapes (structured scenes) or eight distractor shapes randomly partitioned into four pairs on each trial (unstructured scenes). Across five online experiments (N=1140), we found that after a period of search training, participants were more efficient when searching for targets in structured than unstructured scenes. This structure-benefit emerged independently of whether the position of the shapes within each pair was fixed or varied, and despite participants having no explicit knowledge of the structured pairs they had seen. These results show that learned co-occurrence statistics between distractor shapes increases search efficiency. An increased efficiency of the rejection of regular distractors may contribute to the efficiency of visual search in natural scenes, where such regularities are abundant.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Adaptive plasticity in the healthy reading network investigated through combined neurostimulation and neuroimaging</a></h4>

              
                The reading network in the human brain comprises several regions, including the left inferior frontal cortex (IFC), ventral occipito-temporal cortex (vOTC) and dorsal temporo-parietal cortex (TPC). The left TPC is crucial for phonological decoding, i.e., for learning and retaining sound-letter mappings. Here, we tested the causal contribution of this area for reading with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and explored the response of the reading network using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). 28 healthy adult readers overtly read simple and complex words and pseudowords during fMRI after effective or sham TMS over the left TPC. Behaviorally, effective stimulation slowed pseudoword reading. A multivariate pattern analysis showed a shift in activity patterns in the left IFC for pseudoword reading after effective relative to sham TMS. Furthermore, active TMS led to increased effective connectivity from the left vOTC to the left TPC, specifically for pseudoword processing. The observed changes in task-related activity and connectivity suggest compensatory reorganization in the reading network following TMS-induced disruption of the left TPC. Our findings provide first evidence for a causal role of the left TPC for overt pseudoword reading and emphasize the relevance of functional interactions in the healthy reading network for successful pseudoword processing.

	<p>Migraine is a complex neurovascular disorder affecting one billion people worldwide, mainly females. It is characterized by attacks of moderate to severe headache pain, with associated symptoms. Receptor activity modifying protein (RAMP1) is part of the Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (CGRP) receptor, a pharmacological target for migraine. Epigenetic processes, such as DNA methylation, play a role in clinical presentation of various diseases. DNA methylation occurs mostly in the gene promoter and can control gene expression. We investigated the methylation state of the RAMP1 promoter in 104 female blood DNA samples: 54 migraineurs and 50 controls. We treated DNA with sodium bisulfite and performed PCR, Sanger Sequencing, and Epigenetic Sequencing Methylation (ESME) software analysis. We identified 51 CpG dinucleotides, and 5 showed methylation variability. Migraineurs had a higher number of individuals with all five CpG methylated when compared to controls (26% vs. 16%), although non-significant (p = 0.216). We also found that CpG &amp;amp;minus;284 bp, related to the transcription start site (TSS), showed higher methylation levels in cases (p = 0.011). This CpG may potentially play a role in migraine, affecting RAMP1 transcription or receptor malfunctioning and/or altered CGRP binding. We hope to confirm this finding in a larger cohort and establish an epigenetic biomarker to predict female migraine risk.</p>

	<p>An important problem in many fields dealing with noisy time series, such as psychophysiological single trial data during learning or monitoring treatment effects over time, is detecting a change in the model underlying a time series. Here, we present a new method for detecting a single changepoint in a linear time series regression model, termed residuals permutation-based method (RESPERM). The optimal changepoint in RESPERM maximizes Cohen&amp;amp;rsquo;s effect size with the parameters estimated by the permutation of residuals in a linear model. RESPERM was compared with the SEGMENTED method, a well-established and recommended method for detecting changepoints, using extensive simulated data sets, varying the amount and distribution characteristics of noise and the location of the change point. In time series with medium to large amounts of noise, the variance of the detected changepoint was consistently smaller for RESPERM than SEGMENTED. Finally, both methods were applied to a sample dataset of single trial amplitudes of the N250 ERP component during face learning. In conclusion, RESPERM appears to be well suited for changepoint detection especially in noisy data, making it the method of choice in neuroscience, medicine and many other fields.</p>

	<p>Previous studies on the neural cognitive mechanisms of aspectual processing in second language (L2) learners have focused on Indo-European languages with rich inflectional morphology. These languages have aspects which are equipped with inflected verb forms combined with auxiliary or modal verbs. Meanwhile, little attention has been paid to Mandarin Chinese, which has limited morphological inflection, and its aspect is equipped with aspectual particles (e.g., le, zhe, guo). The present study explores the neurocognitive mechanism of Mandarin Chinese aspect processing among two groups of late Mandarin Chinese proficient learners with Thai (with Mandarin Chinese-like aspect markers) and Indonesian (lack of Mandarin Chinese-like aspect markers) as their first language (L1). We measured event-related potentials (ERPs) time locked to the aspect marker le in two different conditions (the aspect violation sentences and the correct sentences). A triphasic ELAN-LAN-P600 effect was produced by the Mandarin Chinese native speakers. However, there was no ELAN and LAN in Indonesian native speakers and Thai native speakers, except a 300&amp;amp;ndash;500 ms negativity widely distributed in the right hemisphere and P600-like effect. This suggests that both groups of Mandarin Chinese learners cannot reach the same level as Mandarin Chinese native speakers to process Mandarin Chinese aspect information, probably due to the complex feature of Mandarin Chinese aspect maker, the participants&amp;amp;rsquo; L2 proficiency and age of L2 acquisition.</p>

	<p>Many studies of bilingual arithmetic report better performance when verifying arithmetic facts in the language of learning (LA+) over the other language (LA&amp;amp;minus;). This could be due to language-specific memory representations, processes established during learning, or to language and task factors not related to math. The current study builds on a small number of event-related potential (ERP) studies to test this question while controlling language proficiency and eliminating potential task confounds. Adults proficient in two languages verified single-digit multiplications presented as spoken number words in LA+ and LA&amp;amp;minus;, separately. ERPs and correctness judgments were measured from solution onset. Equivalent P300 effects, with larger positive amplitude for correct than incorrect solutions, were observed in both languages (Experiment 1A), even when stimuli presentation rate was shortened to increase difficulty (Experiment 1B). This effect paralleled the arithmetic correctness effect for trials presented as all digits (e.g., 2 4 8 versus 2 4 10), reflecting efficient categorization of the solutions, and was distinct from an N400 generated in a word&amp;amp;ndash;picture matching task, reflecting meaning processing (Experiment 2). The findings reveal that the language effects on arithmetic are likely driven by language and task factors rather than differences in memory representation in each language.</p>

	<p>Previous research has shown that resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) between different brain regions (seeds) is related to motor learning and motor memory consolidation. Using high-density electroencephalography (hdEEG), we addressed this question from a brain network perspective. Specifically, we examined frequency-dependent functional connectivity in resting-state networks from twenty-nine young healthy participants before and after they were trained on a motor sequence learning task. Consolidation was assessed with an overnight retest on the motor task. Our results showed training-related decreases in gamma-band connectivity within the motor network, and between the motor and functionally distinct resting-state networks including the attentional network. Brain-behavior correlation analyses revealed that baseline beta, delta, and theta rsFC were related to subsequent motor learning and memory consolidation such that lower connectivity within the motor network and between the motor and several distinct resting-state networks was correlated with better learning and overnight consolidation. Lastly, training-related increases in beta-band connectivity between the motor and the visual networks were related to greater consolidation. Altogether, our results indicate that connectivity in large-scale resting-state brain networks is related to&amp;amp;mdash;and modulated by&amp;amp;mdash;motor learning and memory consolidation processes. These finding corroborate previous seed-based connectivity research and provide evidence that frequency-dependent functional connectivity in resting-state networks is critically linked to motor learning and memory consolidation.</p>

	<p>Prospective memory (PM) is essential in the everyday activities of children because it involves remembering intentions for the future, such as doing their homework or bringing written parental permissions to school. Developmental studies have shown increases in PM performance throughout childhood, but the specific processes underlying this development are still under debate. In the present study, event-related potentials were used to examine whether the focality of the PM task is related to the PM increments by testing two groups of children (first and last cycle of primary school) and assessing differences in N300 (cue detection), frontal positivity (switching), parietal positivity (retrieval of the intention) and frontal slow waves (monitoring of the retrieved intention). The results showed significant differences in focality in the group of older children but no differences in any of the components for their younger counterparts. In addition, the differences between prospective and ongoing trials were smaller for younger than older children. These findings suggest that the ability to adjust attentional strategies, monitor, switch and retrieve the intention develops across childhood and affects PM performance in attentionally demanding conditions.</p>

	<p>A concomitant presentation of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is quite rare. However, a review of the literature showed an increased co-occurrence of both diseases, including in genetically determined cases. We report the case of a 49-year-old woman with a history of RRMS who developed a progressive subacute loss of strength in her left arm. The patient&amp;amp;rsquo;s father died from ALS, and her paternal uncle had Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease. Brain and cervical MRIs were performed, and new demyelinating lesions were excluded. Electromyography (EMG) of the upper limbs showed fibrillations and fasciculations in distal muscles of both arms. In the following months, the patient presented a progressive loss of strength in the proximal and distal muscles of the right arm and hyperreflexia in the lower limbs. EMG and central motor conduction were consistent with ALS. A genetic test was carried out, revealing a mutation in the FUS gene (exon 15; c. 1562 G&amp;amp;gt;A). To our knowledge, the co-occurrence of MS and ALS in patients with FUS mutation is extremely rare. We hypothesize a common pathway for both diseases based on the possibility of a shared oligodendroglial dysfunction due to FUS mutation.</p>

	<p>Financial abilities (FA) are a multi-dimensional domain comprising a wide range of conceptual, pragmatical, and judgmental skills ranging from basic abilities, such as bill payment, to high level abilities, such as financial decision-making (FDM). Preserved FDM abilities include the capacity to recognize fraud attempts, and they are fundamental for a person&amp;amp;rsquo;s independence. Previous studies have reported decreased FDM in older adults and in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), who consequently become more susceptible to fraud attempts. However, FDM has scarcely been investigated in other neurological populations, and it is unclear whether FDM may be predicted by more basic FA. The aim of the present study was to investigate FDM across patients with MCI, Parkinson&amp;amp;rsquo;s disease (PD), or stroke, as well as healthy controls (HC), and to explore to what extent FDM could be inferred by other FA. We collected FDM and FA performances using the NADL-F short battery. Performances in the NADL-F short subtests were compared among groups. Additionally, the relationship between the scores at the FDM subtest and the performance obtained in other financial subtests of the NADL-F short were investigated for each group of participants. MCI patients performed worse than HC in FDM and in several FA domains. Conversely, FDM was relatively preserved in our sample of PD and stroke patients. In HC, FDM was associated with numeracy and financial knowledge applied to everyday situations, whereas this was true with some basic FA in both MCI and PD patients. No significant association was observed in stroke patients. Our results suggest that FDM is a complex ability, only partially inferable from other FA.</p>

	<p>Intracranial vessel wall lesions are involved in a variety of neurological diseases. The advanced technique 7T MRI provides greater efficacy in the diagnosis of the pathology changes in the vessel wall and helps to identify potential subtle lesions. The purpose of this literature review was to systematically describe and evaluate the existing literature focusing on the use of 7T MRI in the detection and characterization of intracranial vessel wall lesions and their associated neurological disorders, to highlight the current knowledge gaps, and to formulate a framework to guide future applications and investigations. We systematically reviewed the existing articles up to July 2021, seeking the studies that assessed intracranial vessel wall lesions and their associated neurological disorders using 7T MRI. The literature search provided 12 studies that met the inclusion criteria. The most common intracranial vessel wall lesions were changes related to intracranial atherosclerosis (n = 8) and aneurysms (n = 4), such as intracranial atherosclerosis burden and aneurysm wall enhancement. The associated neurological disorders included aneurysms, ischemic stroke or TIA, small vessel disease, cognitive decline, and extracranial atherosclerosis. No paper studied the use of 7T MRI for investigating vessel wall conditions such as moyamoya disease, small vessel disease, or neurological disorders related to central nervous vasculitis. In conclusion, the novel 7T MRI enables the identification of a wider spectrum of subtle changes and associations. Future research on cerebral vascular diseases other than intracranial atherosclerosis and aneurysms may also benefit from 7T MRI.</p>

	<p>Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the leading causes of morbidity, disability and mortality across all age groups globally. Currently, only palliative treatments exist, but these are suboptimal and do little to combat the progressive damage to the brain that occurs after a TBI. However, multiple experimental treatments are currently available that target the primary and secondary biochemical and cellular changes that occur after a TBI. Some of these drugs have progressed to clinical trials and are currently being evaluated for their therapeutic benefits in TBI patients. The aim of this study was to identify which drugs are currently being evaluated in clinical trials for TBI. A search of ClinicalTrials.gov was performed on 3 December 2021 and all clinical trials that mentioned &amp;amp;ldquo;TBI&amp;amp;rdquo; OR &amp;amp;ldquo;traumatic brain injury&amp;amp;rdquo; AND &amp;amp;ldquo;drug&amp;amp;rdquo; were searched, revealing 362 registered trials. Of the trials, 46 were excluded due to the drug not being mentioned, leaving 138 that were completed and 116 that were withdrawn. Although the studies included 267,298 TBI patients, the average number of patients per study was 865 with a range of 5&amp;amp;ndash;200,000. Of the completed studies, 125 different drugs were tested in TBI patients but only 7 drugs were used in more than three studies, including amantadine, botulinum toxin A and tranexamic acid (TXA). However, previous clinical studies using these seven drugs showed variable results. The current study concludes that clinical trials in TBI have to be carefully conducted so as to reduce variability across studies, since the severity of TBI and timing of therapeutic interventions were key aspects of trial success.</p>

     alt="BET protein inhibition in macrophages enhances dorsal root ganglion neurite outgrowth in female mice"/>
<p>Treatment with the BET inhibitor JQ1 does not enhance sensory and motor regeneration after sciatic nerve crush injury in female mice (Top). Direct neuronal BET inhibition reduces neurite outgrowth in DRG explants (Middle). However, BET-inhibited macrophages secrete pro-regenerative factors, probably anti-inflammatory cytokines that enhance STAT 6 phosphorylation and neuritogenesis ex vivo (Bottom).</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Peripheral nerve regeneration is limited after injury, especially in humans, due to the large distance the axons have to grow in the limbs. This process is highly dependent on the expression of neuroinflammatory factors produced by macrophages and glial cells. Given the importance of the epigenetic BET proteins on inflammation, we aimed to ascertain if BET inhibition may have an effect on axonal outgrowth. For this purpose, we treated female mice with JQ1 or vehicle after sciatic nerve crush injury and analyzed target reinnervation. We also used dorsal root ganglion (DRG) culture explants to analyze the effects of direct BET inhibition or treatment with conditioned medium from BET-inhibited macrophages. We observed that although JQ1 produced an enhancement of IL-4, IL-13, and GAP43 expression, it did not have an effect on sensory or motor reinnervation after crush injury in vivo. In contrast, JQ1 reduced neurite growth when interacting directly with DRG neurons ex vivo, whereas conditioned medium from JQ1-treated macrophages promoted neurite outgrowth. Therefore, BET-inhibited macrophages secrete pro-regenerative factors that induce neurite outgrowth, and that may counteract the direct inhibition of BET proteins in neurons in vivo. Finally, we observed an activation of the STAT6 pathway in DRG explants treated with conditioned medium from JQ1-treated macrophages. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that BET protein inhibition in macrophages provides a mechanism to enhance axonal outgrowth. However, specific targeting of BET proteins to macrophages will be needed to efficiently enhance functional recovery after nerve injury.</p>

     alt="Gray matter volume reduction in the emotional brain networks in adults with anosmia"/>
<p>In our study, we examined the network-level changes of the gray matter volumes in anosmia. Patients with anosmia had the lower gray matter volumes in the emotional brain networks relative to healthy controls. Based on a significant association between the gray matter volume loss and lower olfactory-specific quality of life, we assume that these morphometric network changes may be closely related to emotional dysfunctions in anosmia.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Loss of olfaction, or anosmia, frequently accompanies emotional dysfunctions, partly due to the overlapping brain regions between the olfactory and emotional processing centers. Here, we investigated whether anosmia was associated with gray matter volume alterations at a network level, and whether these alterations were related to the olfactory-specific quality of life (QOL) and depressive symptoms. Structural brain magnetic resonance imaging was acquired in 22 individuals with postinfectious or idiopathic anosmia (the anosmia group) and 30 age- and sex-matched controls (the control group). Using independent component analysis on the gray matter volumes, we identified 10 morphometric networks. The gray matter volumes of these networks were compared between the two groups. Olfactory-specific QOL and depressive symptoms were assessed by self-report questionnaires and clinician-administered interviews, respectively. The anosmia group showed lower gray matter volumes in the hippocampus–amygdala and the precuneus networks, relative to the control group. Lower gray matter volumes in the hippocampus–amygdala network were also linearly associated with lower olfactory-specific QOL and higher depressive symptom scores. These findings suggest a close relationship between anosmia and gray matter volume alterations in the emotional brain networks, albeit without determined causal relations.</p>

<p>Regulation of ferroptosis is expected to be a new direction for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. And organelles play a role in different cellular interactions with ferroptosis. Targeting organelle metabolic pathways and redox responses may be an effective strategy for disease treatment.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Alzheimerʼs disease (AD), an age-related neurodegenerative disease, is a striking global health problem. Ferroptosis is a newly discovered form of cell death characterized by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation products and the accumulation of lethal reactive oxygen species. Strict regulation of iron metabolism is essential to ensure neuronal homeostasis. Excess and deficiency of iron are both associated with neurodegeneration. Studies have shown that oxidative stress caused by cerebral iron metabolism disorders in the body is involved in the process of AD, ferroptosis may play an important role in the pathogenesis of AD, and regulating ferroptosis is expected to be a new direction for the treatment of AD. Various organelles are closely related to ferroptosis: mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and lysosome are involved in the regulation of ferroptosis from the aspects of iron metabolism and redox imbalance. In this review, the relationship between AD and the dysfunction of organelles (including mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, lysosome, and Golgi apparatus) and the role of organelles in ferroptosis of AD were reviewed to provide insights for understanding the relationship between organelles and ferroptosis in AD and the treatment of AD.</p>

<p>Compared to controls, cannabis users show a relatively larger decrease in performance with increasing working memory (WM) load and a relatively smaller reduction in WM related activity in the precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex at higher WM load. No sex differences emerged generally or in cannabis users in WM and WM load related activity or performance.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Although cannabis use patterns differ between men and women, studies on sex differences on the effects of cannabis on the brain and cognitive control are largely lacking. Working memory (WM) is a component of cognitive control believed to be involved in the development and maintenance of addiction. In this study, we evaluated the association between cannabis use and WM (load) related brain activity in a large sample, enabling us to assess sex effects in this association. The brain activity of 104 frequent cannabis users (63% men) and 85 controls (53% men) was recorded during an N-back WM task. Behavioral results showed a significant interaction between WM load and group for both accuracy and reaction time, with cannabis users showing a relatively larger decrease in performance with increasing WM load. Cannabis users compared to controls showed a relatively smaller reduction in WM (load) related activity in the precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex at higher WM load. This WM (load) related activity was not associated with performance nor cannabis use and related problems. An exploratory analysis showed higher WM-related activity in the superior frontal gyrus in men compared to women. While cannabis users showed higher WM (load) related activity in central nodes of the default mode network, this was not directly attributable to group specific worsening of performance under higher cognitive load. Further research is necessary to assess whether observed group differences increase with higher cognitive load, how group differences relate to measures of cannabis use, and how sex affects these group differences.</p>

<p>Astrocyte calcium signaling in individual dentate gyrus astrocytes increases with Aß pathology and age. Increased calcium signaling in individual dentate gyrus astrocytes does not affect astrocyte network activity.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Astrocytes are critical for healthy brain function. In Alzheimer’s disease, astrocytes become reactive, which affects their signaling properties. Here, we measured spontaneous calcium transients <i>ex vivo</i> in hippocampal astrocytes in brain slices containing the dentate gyrus of 6- (6M) and 9-month-old (9M) APPswe/PSEN1dE9 (APP/PS1) mice. We investigated the frequency and duration of calcium transients in relation to aging, amyloid-β (Aβ) pathology, and the proximity of the astrocyte to Aβ plaques. The 6M APP/PS1 astrocytes showed no change in spontaneous calcium-transient properties compared to wild-type (WT) astrocytes. 9M APP/PS1 astrocytes, however, showed more hyperactivity compared to WT, characterized by increased spontaneous calcium transients that were longer in duration. Our data also revealed an effect of aging, as 9M astrocytes overall showed an increase in calcium activity compared to 6M astrocytes. Subsequent calcium-wave analysis showed an increase in sequential calcium transients (i.e., calcium waves) in 9M astrocytes, suggesting increased network activity <i>ex vivo</i>. Further analysis using null models revealed that this network effect is caused by chance, due to the increased number of spontaneous transients. Our findings show that alterations in calcium signaling in individual hippocampal astrocytes of APP/PS1 mice are subject to both aging and Aβ pathology but these do not lead to a change in astrocyte network activity. These alterations in calcium dynamics of astrocytes may help to understand changes in neuronal physiology leading to cognitive decline and ultimately dementia.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Concomitant exploration of structural, functional, and neurochemical brain mechanisms underlying age-related cognitive decline is crucial in promoting healthy aging. Here, we present the DopamiNe, Age, connectoMe, and Cognition (DyNAMiC) project, a multimodal, prospective 5-year longitudinal study spanning the adult human lifespan. DyNAMiC examines age-related changes in the brain’s structural and functional connectome in relation to changes in dopamine D1 receptor availability (D1DR), and their associations to cognitive decline. Critically, due to the complete lack of longitudinal D1DR data, the true trajectory of one of the most age-sensitive dopamine systems remains unknown. The first DyNAMiC wave included 180 healthy participants (20–80 years). Brain imaging included magnetic resonance imaging assessing brain structure (white matter, gray matter, iron), perfusion, and function (during rest and task), and positron emission tomography (PET) with the [<sup>11</sup>C]SCH23390 radioligand. A subsample (<i>n</i> = 20, &gt;65 years) was additionally scanned with [<sup>11</sup>C]raclopride PET measuring D2DR. Age-related variation was evident for multiple modalities, such as D1DR; D2DR, and performance across the domains of episodic memory, working memory, and perceptual speed. Initial analyses demonstrated an inverted u-shaped association between D1DR and resting-state functional connectivity across cortical network nodes, such that regions with intermediate D1DR levels showed the highest levels of nodal strength. Evident within each age group, this is the first observation of such an association across the adult lifespan, suggesting that emergent functional architecture depends on underlying D1DR systems. Taken together, DyNAMiC is the largest D1DR study worldwide, and will enable a comprehensive examination of brain mechanisms underlying age-related cognitive decline.</p>

<p>Interleukin-18 may regulate the inflammatory response after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) through the activation of microglia. It is expected to be a promising therapeutic target for secondary brain injury after ICH.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Interleukin-18 (IL-18), a pro-inflammatory cytokine, is thought to be associated with inflammation in many neurological diseases such as ischemic stroke and poststroke depression, but the role of IL-18 in inflammatory injury after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) remains unclear. In this study, we established the ICH model in male mice and found that IL-18 expression including protein and mRNA levels was significantly increased in brain tissues after ICH. Meanwhile, exogenous IL-18 exacerbated cerebral hematoma and neurological deficits following ICH. In the IL-18 knockout group, the size of hematoma and neurological functions after ICH was decreased compared with the wild-type group, suggesting the critical role of IL-18 on the modulation of brain injury after ICH. Importantly, exogenous IL-18 increased microglial activation in brain tissues after ICH. Furthermore, IL-18 knockout resulted in the reduction of activated microglia after ICH. These results indicated that IL-18 may regulate the inflammatory response after ICH through the activation of microglia. Thus, IL-18 is expected to be a promising therapeutic target for secondary brain injury after ICH.</p>

<p>Activating subpopulations of <i>parafascicular</i> (Pf) neurons selected on the basis of their projections to different basal ganglia components shows that the activity of the <i>substantia nigra pars reticulata</i> (SNr) can be shaped by convergent information processed through direct thalamonigral (1), trans-subthalamic (2), and trans-striatal direct (3) and indirect (4) subcircuits.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Accumulating evidence implicates the <i>parafascicular nucleus</i> of the thalamus (Pf) in basal ganglia (BG)-related functions and pathologies. Despite Pf connectivity with all BG components, most attention is focused on the thalamostriatal system and an integrated view of thalamic information processing in this network is still lacking. Here, we addressed this question by recording the responses elicited by Pf activation in single neurons of the <i>substantia nigra pars reticulata</i> (SNr), the main BG output structure in rodents, in anesthetized mice. We performed optogenetic activation of Pf neurons innervating the striatum, the subthalamic nucleus (STN), or the SNr using virally mediated transcellular delivery of Cre from injection in either target in Rosa26-LoxP-stop-ChR2-EYFP mice to drive channelrhodopsin expression. Photoactivation of Pf neurons connecting the striatum evoked an inhibition often followed by an excitation, likely resulting from the activation of the trans-striatal direct and indirect pathways, respectively. Photoactivation of Pf neurons connecting the SNr or the STN triggered one or two early excitations, suggesting partial functional overlap of trans-subthalamic and direct thalamonigral projections. Excitations were followed in about half of the cases by an inhibition that might reflect recruitment of intranigral inhibitory loops. Finally, global Pf stimulation, electrical or optogenetic, elicited similar complex responses comprising up to four components: one or two short-latency excitations, an inhibition, and a late excitation. These data provide evidence for functional connections between the Pf and different BG components and for convergence of the information processed through these pathways in single SNr neurons, stressing their importance in regulating BG outflow.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/showFeed?jc=10974547&type=etoc&feed=rss">What does gender has to do with math? Complex questions require complex answers</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Whether mathematics is a gendered domain or not is a long-lasting issue bringing along major social and educational implications. The females' underrepresentation in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) has been considered one of the key signs of the math gender gap, although the current view largely attributes the origin of this phenomenon to sociocultural factors. Indeed, recent approaches to math gender differences reached the universal conclusion that nature and nurture exert reciprocal effects on each other, establishing the need for approaching the study of the math gender issue only once its intrinsic complexity has been accepted. Building upon a flourishing literature, this review provides an updated synthesis of the evidence for math gender equality at the start, and for math gender inequality on the go, challenging the role of biological factors. In particular, by combining recent findings from different research areas, the paper discusses the persistence of the “math male myth” and the associated “female are not good at math myth,” drawing attention to the complex interplay of social and cultural forces that support such stereotypes. The suggestion is made that longevity of these myths results from the additive effects of two independent cognitive biases associated with gender stereotypes and with math stereotypes, respectively. Scholars' responsibility in amplifying these myths by pursuing some catching lines of research is also discussed.</p>

                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Pathological outcomes of traumatic brain injury (TBI), including diffuse axonal injury, are influenced by the direction, magnitude, and duration of head acceleration during the injury exposure. Ovine models have been used to study injury mechanics and pathological outcomes of TBI. To accurately describe the kinematics of the head during an injury exposure, and better facilitate comparison with human head kinematics, anatomical coordinate systems (ACS) with an origin at the head or brain center of mass (CoM), and axes that align with the ovine Frankfort plane equivalent, are required. The aim of this study was to determine the mass properties of the sheep head and brain, and define an ACS<sub>virtual</sub> for the head and brain, using anatomical landmarks on the skull with the aforementioned origins and orientation. Three-dimensional models of 10 merino sheep heads were constructed from computed tomography images, and the coordinates of the head and brain CoMs, relative to a previously reported sheep head coordinate system (ACS<sub>physical</sub>), were determined using the Hounsfield unit–mass density relationship. The ACS<sub>physical</sub> origin was 34.8 ± 3.1 mm posterosuperior of the head CoM and 43.7 ± 1.7 anteroinferior of the brain CoM. Prominent internal anatomical landmarks were then used to define a new ACS (ACS<sub>virtual</sub>) with axes aligned with the Frankfort plane equivalent and an origin 10.4 ± 3.2 mm from the head CoM. The CoM and ACS<sub>virtual</sub> defined in this study will increase the potential for comparison of head kinematics between ovine models and humans, in the context of TBI.</p>

     alt="Serotonin 5-HT7 receptor overexpression in the raphe nuclei area produces antidepressive effect and affects brain serotonin system in male mice"/>
<p>5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptor overexpression in the midbrain produces antidepressive effect in both “normal” C57Bl/6J and “depressive” ASC/Icg mice. This effect is accompanied by increased 5-HT metabolism.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Heterodimerization between 5-HT<sub>7</sub> and 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors seems to play an important role in the mechanism of depression and antidepressant drug action. It was suggested that the shift of the ratio between 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>/5-HT<sub>7</sub> hetero- and 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>/5-HT<sub>1A</sub> homodimers in presynaptic neurons toward 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>/5-HT<sub>1A</sub> homodimers is one of the reasons of depression. Consequently, the artificial elevation of 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptor number in presynaptic terminals might restore physiological homo-/heterodimer ratio resulting in antidepressive effect. Here we showed that adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptor overexpression in the midbrain raphe nuclei area produced antidepressive effect in male mice of both C57Bl/6J and genetically predisposed to depressive-like behavior ASC (antidepressant sensitive cataleptics) strains. These changes were accompanied by the elevation of 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptor mRNA level in the frontal cortex of C57Bl/6J and its reduction in the hippocampus of ASC mice. The presence of engineered 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptor in the midbrain of both mouse strains was further demonstrated. Importantly that 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptor overexpression resulted in the reduction of 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor level in the membrane protein fraction from the midbrain samples of C57Bl/6J, but not ASC, mice. 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptor overexpression caused an increase of 5-HIAA/5-HT ratio in the midbrain and the frontal cortex of C57Bl/6J and in all investigated brain structures of ASC mice. Thus, 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptor overexpression in the raphe nuclei area affects brain 5-HT system and causes antidepressive effect both in C57Bl/6J and in “depressive” ASC male mice. Obtained results indicate the involvement of 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptor in the mechanisms underlying depressive behavior.</p>
