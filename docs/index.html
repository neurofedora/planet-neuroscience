                Background The success of the theories of special and general relativity in describing localised phenomena, such as objects undergoing high speed motion or located in gravitational fields, needs no further elaboration. However, when applied to the evolution of the universe several problems arise which can require an additional model, e.g., inflation during the early expansion, and adjustments to parameters to account for phenomena such as the late-time acceleration of the universe. Methods Focusing on the difference between the ways in which space and time are measured, this paper shows that there are two paths which allow the equations of special relativity to be produced from the same basic postulates. Results Both the standard theory and the energy/momentum, or dynamic model, utilise the Minkowski metric, but with different coordinate systems. The dynamic model transforms Cartesian coordinates into an Euclidean form by multiplying the coordinates by functions of γ (= (1– ν 2/c 2)-1/2). When utilising these coordinates, the relativistic equations are unchanged for local phenomena such as the Lorentz coordinate transformation and the energy/momentum equation for high-velocity objects. Conclusions However, the derived coordinates alter the perceived overall structure of the universe in a manner that, for the simplest model under this system, allows the reproduction of observed cosmological features, such as the intrinsic flatness of the universe and the apparent late-time acceleration of its expansion, without the need of additional models or changes in parameter values.

                Background Vector-borne diseases transmitted by various arthropods account for approximately 17% of the global burden of infectious diseases. These arthropods, especially mosquitoes, are particularly rampant in Mangalore because of the humid coastal climate and scaling urbanization. Objectives To identify key environmental and household determinants of mosquito presence in urban Mangalore, to assess household-level prevention practices, and to evaluate community perceptions and self-reported disease burden towards mosquito-borne diseases. Methods The study involved households in selected wards of the urban field practice area of the Department of Community Medicine, a teaching and service field area under the Mangalore City Corporation, selected through convenience sampling. Data were collected using a semi-structured questionnaire covering sociodemographic details, mosquito proliferation, breeding determinants, behavioral measures, perception of mosquito control, and self-reported cases of mosquito-borne diseases. The data were analyzed using Jamovi version 2.6.26. Results Among 95 respondents (70.5% female and 94.8% literate), 42.1% reported an increase in mosquito breeding sites over the past year, 69.4% recognized the rainy season as the peak period of mosquito activity. Water stagnation [74.7% (95% CI: 64.8–83.1)] and ongoing construction activity [32.4% (95% CI: 21.8–44.1)] emerged as significant environmental determinants of higher mosquito density which was not statistically significant. A large majority of households (91.6%) reported using chemical measures for mosquito prevention, while 92.6% of participants were aware of mosquito-borne diseases. Despite this, nearly one-third (29.4%) of respondents had experienced a mosquito-borne illness in the preceding year, with 71.4% dengue infection. The use of mosquito repellents was paradoxically associated with a higher prevalence of mosquito-borne diseases (OR = 3.7; 95% CI: 1.4–9.6; p = 0.024). Conclusion Although awareness and preventive measure uptake were high, gaps remain in consistent environmental control and municipal interventions. Strengthening local authority action on water stagnation and construction-site management is essential for sustainable vector control.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14743">The Role of Affect and Priors in the Generation of Hallucinations in Early Psychosis</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.14743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Stress and negative affect play significant roles in developing psychosis. Bayesian analyses applied to the conditioned hallucinations (CH) task suggest that hallucinations arise when maladaptive prior beliefs outweigh sensory evidence. Prior weighting is linked to hallucination severity, yet the nature of these priors remains unclear. Negative affect may influence the strength of maladaptive priors. We hypothesized that, under stress, participants will show increased CH rates and prior weighting, with this effect more pronounced in patients.
  Methods: This study employs a modified CH task using valenced linguistic stimuli and stress and non-stress affective manipulations. The sample for this pilot study included those at risk for psychosis and patients with first episode psychosis (N=12) and healthy controls (N=15). The objective of this study was first to validate this affective version of the CH task and then to demonstrate an effect of affect on CH rates and prior weighting.
  Results: Replicating past results, patients had higher CH rates (b = 0.061, p < 0.001) and prior weighting (b = 0.097, p < 0.001) for session 1 compared to controls (n=15) across conditions. Further, runs with stress manipulations had higher prior weighting across patients and controls compared to runs with non-stress manipulations (b = 0.054, p = 0.033).
  Conclusions: This study validates this affective version of the CH task and provides preliminary evidence of a relationship between affective state and prior weighting. Future work will be aimed at confirming and extending these findings, with the objective of developing biomarkers of early psychosis.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15671">When sufficiency is insufficient: the functional information bottleneck for identifying probabilistic neural representations</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.15671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The neural basis of probabilistic computations remains elusive, even amidst growing evidence that humans and other animals track their uncertainty. Recent work has proposed that probabilistic representations arise naturally in task-optimized neural networks trained without explicitly probabilistic inductive biases. However, prior work has lacked clear criteria for distinguishing probabilistic representations, those that perform transformations characteristic of probabilistic computation, from heuristic neural codes that merely reformat inputs. We propose a novel information bottleneck framework, the functional information bottleneck (fIB), that crucially evaluates a neural representation based not only on its statistical sufficiency but also on its minimality, allowing us to disambiguate heuristic from probabilistic coding. To demonstrate the power of this framework, we study a variety of task-optimized neural networks that had been suggested to develop probabilistic representations in earlier work: networks trained to perform static inference tasks (such as cue combination and coordinate transformation) or dynamic state estimation tasks (Kalman filtering). In contrast to earlier claims, our minimality requirement reveals that probabilistic representations fail to emerge in these networks: they do not develop minimal codes of Bayesian posteriors in their hidden layer activities, and instead rely on heuristic input recoding. Therefore, it remains an open question under which conditions truly probabilistic representations emerge in neural networks. More generally, our work provides a stringent framework for identifying probabilistic neural codes. Thus, it lays the foundation for systematically examining whether, how, and which posteriors are represented in neural circuits during complex decision-making tasks.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17260">A tutorial on electrogastrography using low-cost hardware and open-source software</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2509.17260v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electrogastrography is the recording of changes in electric potential caused by the stomach's pacemaker region, typically through several cutaneous sensors placed on the abdomen. It is a worthwhile technique in medical and psychological research, but also relatively niche. Here we present a tutorial on the acquisition and analysis of the human electrogastrogram. Because dedicated equipment and software can be prohibitively expensive, we demonstrate how data can be acquired using a low-cost OpenBCI Ganglion amplifier. We also present a processing pipeline that minimises attrition, which is particularly helpful for low-cost equipment but also applicable to top-of-the-line hardware. Our approach comprises outlier rejection, frequency filtering, movement filtering, and noise reduction using independent component analysis. Where traditional approaches include a subjective step in which only one channel is manually selected for further analysis, our pipeline recomposes the electrogastrogram from all recorded channels after automatic rejection of nuisance components. The main benefits of this approach are reduced attrition, retention of data from all recorded channels, and reduced influence of researcher bias. In addition to our tutorial on the method, we offer a proof-of-principle in which our approach leads to reduced data rejection compared to established methods. We aimed to describe each step in sufficient detail to be implemented in any programming language. In addition, we made an open-source Python package freely available for ease of use.

                arXiv:2511.20179v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scalable assessments of mental illness remain a critical roadblock toward accessible and equitable care. Here, we show that everyday human-computer interactions encode mental health with state-of-the-art biomarker precision. We introduce MAILA, a MAchine-learning framework for Inferring Latent mental states from digital Activity. We trained MAILA on 20,000 cursor and touchscreen recordings labelled with 1.3 million mental-health self-reports collected from 9,000 participants. The dataset includes 2,000 individuals assessed longitudinally, 1,500 diagnosed with depression, and 500 with obsessive-compulsive disorder. MAILA tracks dynamic mental states along three orthogonal dimensions, identifies individuals living with mental illness, and achieves near-ceiling accuracy when predicting group-level mental health. By extracting non-verbal signatures of psychological function that have so far remained untapped, MAILA represents a key step toward scalable digital phenotyping and foundation models for mental health.

              <h4><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14160">Forecasting Excessive Anesthesia Depth Using EEG {\alpha}-Spindle Dynamics and Machine Learning</a></h4>

              
                arXiv:2512.14160v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Objectives. Accurately predicting transitions to anesthetic drugs overdosage is a critical challenge in general anesthesia as it requires the identification of EEG indicators relevant for anticipating the evolution of the depth of anesthesia. Methods. In this study, we introduce a real-time, data-driven framework based on alpha spindle dynamics extracted from frontal EEG recordings. Using Empirical Mode Decomposition, we segment transient alpha spindle events and extract statistical features such as amplitude, duration, frequency, and suppression intervals. We apply these features to train a Light Gradient Boosting Machine, LGBM, classifier on a clinical EEG dataset spanning induction, maintenance, and emergence phases of general anesthesia. Results. Our model accurately classifies anesthesia phases with over 80 percent accuracy and anticipates the onset of isoelectric suppression, a marker of anesthetic drugs overdosage, with 96 percent accuracy up to 90 seconds in advance. Conclusion. The spindle-based metrics provides a non-invasive, interpretable, and predictive approach. This real-time method can be used to forecast unintentional anesthetic drugs overdosage, enabling proactive anesthesia management based solely on EEG signals. Significance. This new method is the first to provide a way to prevent too deep anesthesia and its consequence for the well-being of patients after the recovery from anesthesia.

                arXiv:2507.10383v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural networks storing multiple discrete attractors are canonical models of biological memory. Previously, the dynamical stability of such networks could only be guaranteed under highly restrictive conditions. Here, we derive a theory of the local stability of discrete fixed points in a broad class of networks with graded neural activities and in the presence of noise. By directly analyzing the bulk and the outliers of the Jacobian spectrum, we show that all fixed points are stable below a critical load that is distinct from the classical \textit{critical capacity} and depends on the statistics of neural activities in the fixed points as well as the single-neuron activation function. Our analysis highlights the computational benefits of threshold-linear activation and sparse-like patterns.

                arXiv:2512.14708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current deep learning approaches for physiological signal monitoring suffer from static topologies and constant energy consumption. We introduce SGEMAS (Self-Growing Ephemeral Multi-Agent System), a bio-inspired architecture that treats intelligence as a dynamic thermodynamic process. By coupling a structural plasticity mechanism (agent birth death) to a variational free energy objective, the system naturally evolves to minimize prediction error with extreme sparsity. An ablation study on the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database reveals that adding a multi-scale instability index to the agent dynamics significantly improves performance. In a challenging inter-patient, zero-shot setting, the final SGEMAS v3.3 model achieves a mean AUC of 0.570 +- 0.070, outperforming both its simpler variants and a standard autoencoder baseline.

                arXiv:2512.14869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an oscillatory neuromorphic primitive implemented with networks of coupled Wien bridge oscillators and tunable resistive couplings. Phase relationships between oscillators encode patterns, and a local Hebbian learning rule continuously adapts the couplings, allowing learning and recall to emerge from the same ongoing analog dynamics rather than from separate training and inference phases. Using a Kuramoto-style phase model with an effective energy function, we show that learned phase patterns form attractor states and validate this behavior in simulation and hardware. We further realize a 2-4-2 architecture with a hidden layer of oscillators, whose bipartite visible-hidden coupling allows multiple internal configurations to produce the same visible phase states. When inputs are switched, transient spikes in energy followed by relaxation indicate how the network can reduce surprise by reshaping its energy landscape. These results support coupled oscillator circuits as a hardware platform for energy-based neuromorphic computing with autonomous, continuous learning.

                arXiv:2512.15002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing computational demands of modern AI systems have exposed fundamental limitations of digital hardware, driving interest in alternative paradigms for efficient large-scale inference. Dense Associative Memory (DenseAM) is a family of models that offers a flexible framework for representing many contemporary neural architectures, such as transformers and diffusion models, by casting them as dynamical systems evolving on an energy landscape. In this work, we propose a general method for building analog accelerators for DenseAMs and implementing them using electronic RC circuits, crossbar arrays, and amplifiers. We find that our analog DenseAM hardware performs inference in constant time independent of model size. This result highlights an asymptotic advantage of analog DenseAMs over digital numerical solvers that scale at least linearly with the model size. We consider three settings of progressively increasing complexity: XOR, the Hamming (7,4) code, and a simple language model defined on binary variables. We propose analog implementations of these three models and analyze the scaling of inference time, energy consumption, and hardware. Finally, we estimate lower bounds on the achievable time constants imposed by amplifier specifications, suggesting that even conservative existing analog technology can enable inference times on the order of tens to hundreds of nanoseconds. By harnessing the intrinsic parallelism and continuous-time operation of analog circuits, our DenseAM-based accelerator design offers a new avenue for fast and scalable AI hardware.

                arXiv:2512.15149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-driven evolutionary algorithms has shown surprising results in addressing expensive optimization problems through robust surrogate modeling. Though promising, existing surrogate modeling schemes may encounter limitations in complex optimization problems with many sub-objectives, which rely on repeated and tedious approximation. To address such technical gap, we propose Q-MetaSur as a plug-and-play surrogate modeling scheme capable of providing unified and generalized surrogate learning. Specifically, we consider multi-task-multi-objective optimization~(MTMOO) in offline setting. Several key designs are proposed: 1) we transform objective approximation into sequence-to-sequence modeling where MTMOO problem can be represented by tenxual tokenization. To operate under such auto-regressive modeling, we introduce a Large Language Model-based surrogate model that first encodes a MTMOO instance and then decodes objective values of unseen decision variables. To ensure stability in training the proposed model, we propose a two-stage offline training strategy that operates as a synergy of supervised tuning and RL fine-tuning, which first exploits offline dataset to fit existing knowledge and then leverages RL to enhance model's generalization performance. Extensive empirical results on the CEC2019 benchmark demonstrate that Q-MetaSur not only outperforms representative surrogate baselines in objective approximation accuracy, but also helps underlying evolutionary algorithms achieve both desired optimization convergence and improved pareto optimality.

Abstract: Modern data centers contain thousands of servers making them major consumers of electricity. To minimize their environmental impact, it is critical that we use their resources efficiently. In this paper we study how to discover the optimal placement of virtual network functions in large scale data centers. We propose a novel parallel metaheuristic, fast heuristic objective functions of the QoS and new memory efficient data structures for large networks. We further identify a simple, fast heuristic that can produce competitive solutions to very large problem instances. Using these new concepts, we are able to find high quality solutions for data centres with up to 64,000 servers.

                arXiv:2510.08582v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a modular and scalable design optimization framework for the wing design process that enables faster early-phase design while ensuring aerodynamic stability. The pipeline starts with the generation of initial wing geometries and then proceeds to optimize the wing using several algorithms. Aerodynamic performance is assessed using a Vortex Lattice Method (VLM) applied to a carefully selected dataset of wing configurations. These results are employed to develop surrogate neural network models, which can predict lift and drag rapidly and accurately. The stability evaluation is implemented by setting the control surfaces and components to fixed positions in order to have realistic flight dynamics. The approach unifies and compares several optimization techniques, including Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Genetic Algorithms (GA), gradient-based MultiStart methods, Bayesian optimization, and Lipschitz optimization. Each method ensures constraint management via adaptive strategies and penalty functions, where the targets for lift and design feasibility are enforced. The progression of aerodynamic characteristics and geometries over the optimization iterations will be investigated in order to clarify each algorithm's convergence characteristics and performance efficiency. Our results show improvement in aerodynamic qualities and robust stability properties, offering a mechanism for wing design at speed and precision. In the interest of reproducibility and community development, the complete implementation is publicly available at Github.

                arXiv:2512.13857v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to evolve programs and multi-agent systems, yet most existing approaches rely on overwrite-based mutations that maintain only a single candidate at a time. Such methods discard useful variants, suffer from destructive edits, and explore a brittle search space prone to structural failure. We introduce EvoLattice, a framework that represents an entire population of candidate programs or agent behaviors within a single directed acyclic graph. Each node stores multiple persistent alternatives, and every valid path through the graph defines a distinct executable candidate, yielding a large combinatorial search space without duplicating structure. EvoLattice enables fine-grained alternative-level evaluation by scoring each alternative across all paths in which it appears, producing statistics that reveal how local design choices affect global performance. These statistics provide a dense, data-driven feedback signal for LLM-guided mutation, recombination, and pruning, while preserving successful components. Structural correctness is guaranteed by a deterministic self-repair mechanism that enforces acyclicity and dependency consistency independently of the LLM. EvoLattice naturally extends to agent evolution by interpreting alternatives as prompt fragments or sub-agent behaviors. Across program synthesis (proxy and optimizer meta-learning), EvoLattice yields more stable evolution, greater expressivity, and stronger improvement trajectories than prior LLM-guided methods. The resulting dynamics resemble quality-diversity optimization, emerging implicitly from EvoLattice's internal multi-alternative representation rather than an explicit external archive.

                <p>People with epilepsy may experience sudden death due to respiratory failure through mechanisms that are currently not well understood. Epilepsy causing mutations are thought to elicit seizures due to altered function of forebrain circuits, yet breathing is controlled largely by the brainstem. To investigate how altered forebrain activity could impact breathing, we examined respiratory and seizure phenotypes in a mouse epilepsy model with a forebrain-specific deletion of the phosphatase and tensin homolog (<I>Pten</I>) gene. Using chronic diaphragm electromyography and cortical electroencephalography, we monitored <I>Pten</I> conditional knock-out (PTEN&ndash;cKO) mice (six males and four females) and control littermates (six males and three females) continuously from preseizure onset through end-stage disease. PTEN&ndash;cKO mice develop spontaneous seizures that progress in frequency with age, accompanied by gradual changes in respiratory function, even during interictal periods. As seizure burden increases, PTEN&ndash;cKO mice experience an increased frequency of interictal apneas, slowing of respiratory rhythm, prolongation of inspiratory bursts, and elevation of inspiratory effort. All animals experienced a terminal apnea prior to cardiac arrest. These findings demonstrate that <I>P</I><I>ten</I> deletion in the forebrain disrupts the control of breathing and leads to terminal respiratory failure.</p>

                <p>Neural signals necessary for gaze holding are produced in the excitatory networks of oculomotor neural integrators including the prepositus hypoglossi nucleus (PHN) and the interstitial nucleus of Cajal (INC). Our previous studies have shown that the activation of the networks can be evaluated by sustained excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) responses in vitro, in which a higher EPSC frequency after burst stimulation (100&nbsp;Hz, 20 trains) than the frequency before the stimulation lasts for &gt;1&nbsp;s. Both the PHN and the INC receive serotonergic inputs mainly from the dorsal raphe nucleus, and serotonin (5-HT) induces depolarizing responses via 5-HT<SUB>2</SUB> or 5-HT<SUB>3</SUB> receptors and hyperpolarizing responses via 5-HT<SUB>1A</SUB> receptors in PHN and INC neurons. However, how 5-HT affects sustained EPSC responses remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the effects of 5-HT on sustained EPSC responses using whole-cell recordings in brainstem slices obtained from rats of either sex. Compared with the control treatment, bath application of 10&nbsp;&mu;M 5-HT significantly reduced the duration and frequency of the EPSC responses in the PHN and the INC. The application of 8-OH-DPAT, an agonist of the 5-HT<SUB>1A</SUB> receptor, suppressed sustained EPSC responses, but agonists of the 5-HT<SUB>2</SUB> and 5-HT<SUB>3</SUB> receptors had no effect on the responses, indicating that 5-HT has a suppressive effect on sustained EPSC responses via 5-HT<SUB>1A</SUB> receptors. These results suggest that neurons that express 5-HT<SUB>1A</SUB> receptors participate in excitatory networks and that the suppressive effect of 5-HT can facilitate exploratory behavior through eye movements rather than gaze holding.</p>

                Animal movement datasets are growing in number and depth, and researchers require a growing number of analytical approaches to adequately answer questions using movement datasets. As the complexity of questions and analyses increase, deciding on the best approach both in terms of study design and analysis can become more difficult. A potential solution is to simulate an array of synthetic datasets under varying study designs and simulation parametrisations to gain insight into the impact of analysis choice(s) in different contexts. The abmAnimalMovement R package provides the means of simulating animal movement for this purpose. The abmAnimalMovement simulations use a discrete time agent-based model and does not require previous movement data as an input. The simulations include a number of key internal and external movement influences, as well as parameters for navigation and mobility capacity of the animal. Internal influences include three predefined behavioural states (e.g., shelter, explore, forage) and any number of activity cycles (e.g., diel, seasonal). External influences are implemented via matrices describing landscape characteristics (e.g., shelter quality, foraging resources, movement ease), and predefined points describing shelter sites and points the animal aims to avoid. Navigation capacity is defined by the range the animal can dynamically choose a foraging location to which it is subsequently attracted. Mobility capacity is implemented by user defined distributions, from which step length and turn angles are draw at each time step, governing the possible subsequent locations of the animal. Critically, the navigation capacity (the choice of destination) operates on a different time scale to the mobility capacity, allowing the internal state of the animal to differ from the observed movements. When combined with other emergent properties, such as site fidelity generated via repeated shelter site use, the simulations offer opportunities to test whether movement analyses can accurately recover hidden mechanisms, states, and drivers.

In an effort to avert future pandemics, surveillance studies aim to identify animal viruses at high risk of spilling over into humans. These studies have revealed substantial diversity in identified viruses. However, the number of tools currently available to assess pandemic risk is limited. Methods currently in use include the characterization of candidate viruses using <i>in vitro</i> laboratory assays and experimental transmission studies in animal models. However, transmission experiments yield relatively low-resolution outcomes that are not immediately translatable to projections of viral dynamics at the level of a host population. To address this gap, we present an analytical framework to extend the use of measurements from experimental transmission studies to generate more quantitative risk assessments. Specifically, we use within-host viral titer data from index and contact animals to estimate parameters relevant to transmission between pairs of individuals. We then extend this model to estimate epidemiological parameters, such as reproduction numbers and generation intervals. We present our analytical framework in the context of two influenza A virus (IAV) ferret transmission experiments: one using influenza A/California/07/2009 (Cal/2009) and one using influenza A/Hong Kong/1/1968 (Hong Kong/1968). In a head-to-head comparison, we find that Cal/2009 has higher pandemic potential than Hong Kong/1968. Our results depend on several assumptions, including that within-host viral dynamics in humans and those in the model animal used (here, ferrets) share quantitative similarities and that viral transmissibility between model animals reflects viral transmissibility between humans. The methods we present to assess pandemic risk of viral isolates can be used to improve relative risk assessment of other emerging viruses of pandemic concern.

                <p>by Christopher H. Bohrer, Daniel R. Larson</p>

Numerous functions hinge on the spatial arrangement of different genomic loci. Hence, microscopy techniques, such as chromatin tracing, have been developed to localize multiple loci in fixed cells. Depending on the throughput and specifics of the experiment, localization errors can still obscure the true spatial locations. We have developed a post-processing methodology to address this challenge without the need for additional experimentation: Loci Enabled Advanced Resolution (LEAR). By leveraging the fact that localization errors increase the variability of the displacements between loci, and given an approximation of the localization error, we can approximate the ground truth spatial variation for each pair of loci to guide an iterative error correction process. After validating our approach with simulation and experiment, we then applied our approach to existing chromatin tracing data that probed the relation between chromatin organization and <i>Sox2</i> regulation, where previous work found no clear correlation between enhancer-promoter proximity and transcription bursts in individual cells. We discovered a correlation previously obscured by localization error, clearly demonstrating the need for the methodology. We then investigated the influence of loop-extrusion on higher order multi-way contact frequencies, which dramatically increased with the application of the LEAR method, finding that certain multi-way contacts were only present with loop-extrusion.

                Background The integration of mathematical competencies and critical thinking in secondary education has become increasingly relevant to equip students with the ability to reason, argue, and solve complex real-world problems. Despite its recognized importance, this integration remains fragmented across curricula and inconsistently applied in classroom practice. Methods A systematic review was conducted in accordance with PRISMA 2020 guidelines to analyze empirical evidence published between 2019 and 2025. Searches were performed in Scopus, Web of Science, SciELO, and Dialnet databases. Inclusion criteria focused on open-access, peer-reviewed studies in English or Spanish addressing the integration of mathematical competencies and critical thinking in secondary education. From 1,457 records initially retrieved, 24 empirical studies were selected for full analysis. Results The studies reviewed indicate that mathematical competencies, defined as the ability to model, interpret, and solve problems through logical reasoning, are reinforced when integrated with critical thinking skills such as evaluation, argumentation, and evidence-based decision-making. Active methodologies, including Problem-Based Learning (PBL), Project-Based Learning (PjBL), STEM, and gamification, were identified as the most effective strategies to foster this integration. However, their implementation is often constrained by structural barriers such as limited teacher training, rigid curricula, and insufficient technological infrastructure. Conclusion Integrative, student-centered approaches supported by active learning methodologies enhance higher-order cognitive development and prepare learners to meet the demands of 21st-century education. Future research should address methodological standardization, teacher preparation, and institutional conditions to ensure the sustainable and equitable implementation of these strategies.

                In this issue of Neuron, Gleichman et al. reveal that astrocytes exhibit region-specific features after stroke. Cortical astrocytes, but not white matter astrocytes, leverage Lamc1 to promote vascular remodeling, highlighting the complexity of harnessing astrocytes for neurorepair.

                Winner effects, where past victories enhance success, shape competition. In this issue of Neuron, Zheng et al. show that female mice form hierarchies with weaker winner effects because prefrontal interneurons limit thalamic-prefrontal synaptic strengthening, revealing a framework for sex differences in social dominance.

                Ripples support memory consolidation via neuronal replay. Castelli et al. identify two ripple types with distinct inputs and dynamics. This Preview discusses their findings in the context of current views on ripple diversity and hypothesizes that such diversity reflects a replay grammar.

                In this issue of Neuron, Choi et al. demonstrate that stroke disrupts cortical state transitions underlying reach-to-grasp control.

                Variable spiking is a ubiquitous neuronal feature. Pattadkal et al. show that physiological spiking variability is reflective of input drive characteristics. They demonstrate that weak input synchrony induces physiological variability and identify synchrony timescales to be critical in regulating variability shifts, using in vivo, in vitro, and in silico approaches.

                Oelschlegel et al. report that the schizophrenia-risk gene calneuron-1 is elevated in schizophrenia, elicits schizophrenia-like behavior, and impairs network communication in mice. Calneuron-1 is an accessory subunit of muscarinic M1R that inhibits G-protein coupling and shuts off M1R signaling in schizophrenia. The M1R agonist xanomeline interrupts calneuron-1/M1R interaction and rescues schizophrenia-related deficits.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/108207">An increase of NPY1 expression leads to inhibitory phosphorylation of PIN-FORMED (PIN) proteins and suppression of pinoid (pid) null mutants</a></h4>

              
                The PINOID (PID) protein kinase is required for flower initiation in <i>Arabidopsis</i>. The <i>pid</i> mutants fail to initiate flowers on inflorescences, a phenotype that is mimicked by disrupting either the <i>NAKED PINS IN YUC MUTANTS</i> (<i>NPY</i>) gene family or <i>PIN FORMED 1</i> (<i>PIN1</i>). Both PID and NPY1 have been reported to positively modulate PIN-mediated polar auxin transport. Here, we show that overexpression of <i>NPY1</i> (<i>NPY1 OE</i>) completely suppressed <i>pid</i> null mutants, demonstrating that <i>NPY1</i> functions downstream of <i>PID. NPY1 OE</i> triggered phosphorylation of PIN proteins at multiple sites that are mostly different from the previously characterized phosphorylation sites regardless of the presence of <i>PID</i>. Phosphorylation of the newly identified PIN sites in <i>NPY1 OE</i> plants likely leads to the inhibition of PIN functions, as we previously showed that <i>pid</i> is suppressed by decreasing <i>PIN1</i> gene dosage or decreasing PIN1 activity. Furthermore, we show that the Ser/Thr-rich C-terminal motif in NPY1 is phosphorylated and is required for <i>pid</i> suppression by <i>NPY1 OE</i>. Overexpression of <i>NPY1</i> that lacked the C-terminal motif (<i>NPY1∆C</i>) failed to rescue <i>pid</i>, but overexpression of <i>NPY1∆C</i> was still able to trigger phosphorylation of PIN proteins, including PIN2, which is known to cause agravitropic roots when mutated. <i>NPY1∆C</i> overexpression plants displayed a complete loss of root gravitropic response, likely caused by PIN2 phosphorylation. Our results suggest a pathway for auxin-mediated flower initiation, in which PID regulates NPY1 accumulation and/or activity, and subsequently, NPY1 triggers phosphorylation of PIN proteins and inhibition of PIN functions.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/104855">Extracellular adenosine deamination primes tip organizer development in Dictyostelium</a></h4>

              
                Ammonia is a morphogen in <i>Dictyostelium</i> and is known to arise from the catabolism of proteins and RNA. However, we show that extracellular adenosine deamination catalysed by ‘adenosine deaminase-related growth factor’ (ADGF) is a major source of ammonia and demonstrate a direct role of ammonia in tip organizer development. The tip formed during early development in <i>Dictyostelium</i> functions analogously to the embryonic organizer of higher vertebrates. <i>Dictyostelium</i> strains carrying mutations in the gene <i>adgf</i> fail to establish an organizer, and this could be reversed by exposing the mutants to volatile ammonia. Interestingly, <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> physically separated from the <i>Dictyostelium adgf</i> mutants in a partitioned dish also rescues the mound arrest phenotype. Both the substrate, adenosine and the product, ammonia, regulate <i>adgf</i> expression, and ADGF acts downstream of the histidine kinase DhkD in regulating tip formation. Thus, the consecutive transformation of extracellular cAMP to adenosine, and adenosine to ammonia is integral steps during <i>Dictyostelium</i> development. Remarkably, in higher vertebrates, <i>adgf</i> expression is elevated during gastrulation and thus adenosine deamination may be a conserved process driving organizer development in different organisms.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/105932">Endothelial Slit2 guides the Robo1-positive sympathetic innervation during heart development</a></h4>

              
                Axon guidance cues direct nerves in the heart during development, disease, and regeneration. These cues determine cardiac innervation patterning by regulating the balance between chemo-attraction and chemo-repulsion. However, the role of one of the most crucial ligand-receptor combinations among axon guidance molecules, the Slit chemo-active ligands and their Roundabout (Robo) transmembrane receptors, remains unknown during cardiac innervation patterning. To test if Slit-Robo signalling is important for cardiac innervation guidance, we analysed Slit and Robo mouse knock-outs. Constitutive <i>Slit2<sup>-/-</sup></i> ventricles showed significantly reduced innervation, while <i>Slit3<sup>-/-</sup></i> hearts showed temporary increased levels of innervation compared to wild-type littermate controls. Whereas innervation was not affected in <i>Robo2<sup>-/-</sup></i>mice, the phenotype seen in <i>Slit2<sup>-/-</sup></i> ventricles was recapitulated in <i>Robo1<sup>-/-</sup></i> mice. Detailed expression analysis identified expression of Slit2 ligand in the endothelium of the coronary vessels, while Slit3 was highly present in the coronary smooth muscle wall and in the innervation. Both the Robo1 and Robo2 receptors were present in the nerves and at low levels in the vessels. Knocking out <i>Slit2</i> specifically in the endothelium recapitulated the defects seen in the constitutive <i>Slit2<sup>-/-</sup></i> hearts. Ex vivo axon guidance cultures showed that attraction of axons extending from the ganglia was strongly reduced in ventricles with absence of endothelial Slit2 compared to wild-type controls. In the absence of endothelial Slit2, adult mice showed reduced response to challenging the sympathetic innervation. In conclusion, we have identified an important new chemo-active Slit2-Robo1 pathway required for correct cardiac innervation development.

                Systemic infections leading to sepsis are life-threatening conditions that remain difficult to treat, and the limitations of current experimental models hamper the development of innovative therapies. Animal models are constrained by species-specific differences, while 2D cell culture systems fail to capture the complex pathophysiology of infection. To overcome these limitations, we developed a laser photoablation-generated, three-dimensional microfluidic model of meningococcal vascular colonization, a human-specific bacterium that causes sepsis and meningitis. Laser photoablation-generated hydrogel engineering allows the reproduction of vascular networks that are major infection target sites, and this model provides the relevant microenvironment reproducing the physiological endothelial integrity and permeability in vitro. By comparing with a human-skin xenograft mouse model, we show that the model system not only replicates in vivo key features of the infection, but also enables quantitative assessment with a higher spatiotemporal resolution of bacterial microcolony growth, endothelial cytoskeleton rearrangement, vascular E-selectin expression, and neutrophil response upon infection. Our device thus provides a robust solution bridging the gap between animal and 2D cellular models, paving the way for a better understanding of disease progression and developing innovative therapeutics.

              <h4><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/106201">On CA1 ripple oscillations in rats and the reassessment of asynchronicity evidence</a></h4>

              
                Sharp-wave ripples (SWRs) are hippocampal network oscillations associated with memory consolidation. They are characterized by the co-occurrence of fast and slow field potentials across CA1 layers: the fast-frequency oscillations, known as ripples, are prominent in the pyramidal cell layer, where they coincide with increased neuronal spiking, while slower negative transients, referred to as sharp waves, occur simultaneously in the <i>stratum radiatum</i>. SWRs have traditionally been considered globally synchronous across the hippocampus; however, recent evidence suggests that ripples may be less synchronous than previously thought, particularly between the two hemispheres (Villalobos et al., 2017). In this study, we revisited this question using a unique dataset from probes spanning the septo-temporal axis of CA1 in rats. Our results demonstrate that ripples are phase-locked within but not between hemispheres, although their occurrence remains time-locked across both the septo-temporal axis and hemispheres. We also observed a similar synchronicity pattern for spiking activity: neurons are locally phase-coupled and globally time-coupled to ripple events. Interneurons exhibit a much stronger phase coupling to both ipsilateral and contralateral ripples than pyramidal neurons. These findings suggest that ripples are locally phase-coupled through pyramidal–interneuron interactions, with global time-locking likely driven by a common bilateral CA3 input and potentially modulated by interneuron circuits.

Whether there exist the <span class="underline">G</span>enes St<span class="underline">e</span>adily <span class="underline">A</span>ssociated with P<span class="underline">r</span>ognosis (GEARs) and functions remains largely elusive.

We employed a network construction approach to identify hub genes from GEARs and utilized them for cancer classification. In the case of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), the GEARs were found to be related to mitosis. Our analysis suggested that LUAD cell lines carrying <i>PIK3CA</i> mutations exhibit increased drug resistance. For breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA), the GEARs were related to immunity. Further analysis revealed that <i>CDH1</i> mutation might regulate immune infiltration through the EMT process. Moreover, we explored the prognostic relevance of mitosis and immunity through their respective scores and demonstrated it as valuable biomarkers for predicting patient prognosis. In summary, our study offered significant biological insights into GEARs and highlights their potentials as robust prognostic indicators across diverse cancer types.

">BAG3 modulates clathrin-mediated endocytosis and tau uptake in astrocytes</a></h4>

              
                In a healthy brain, astrocytes maintain neuronal homeostasis by removing proteins like tau from the extracellular space, preventing their uptake by neurons. In Alzheimer disease (AD), this function is impaired, contributing to tau accumulation. Many AD risk genes are linked to endocytosis pathways, suggesting their role in AD pathogenesis. Astrocytes can internalize, degrade, and release tau, but the mechanisms remain unclear. BAG3, a multifunctional protein, regulates vacuolar processes and interacts with clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) components. However, its role in astrocytic CME and tau processing is not fully understood. We show BAG3 depletion in astrocytes reduces clathrin-AP-2 interaction, inhibits CME-dependent epidermal growth factor receptor internalization, and decreases tau uptake. Live-cell imaging reveals BAG3 depletion impairs CME dynamics, increasing clathrin particle lifetimes. BAG3 depletion also alters endolysosomal compartments, increasing Lamp1+ puncta and tau co-localization. These findings highlight BAG3s role in CME, tau trafficking, and vacuolar processes, suggesting its dysfunction may contribute to AD pathogenesis.

">Hippocampal cell- and circuit-specific differences in mitochondrial form and function</a></h4>

              
                Mitochondrial morphology varies by neuronal cell type and subcellular compartment; however, the functional significance of these differences is unclear. Hippocampal CA2 neurons are enriched for genes encoding mitochondrial proteins compared to CA1 neurons, suggesting a difference in metabolic demand across hippocampal circuits. However, whether CA2 neuron mitochondria are structurally or functionally distinct to support circuit-specific energy demands is unknown. Here we compared mitochondrial morphology, protein expression, and calcium levels across CA1 and CA2 circuits. We found mitochondria in CA2 dendrites were larger than mitochondria in CA1 dendrites. However, both subregions harbored larger mitochondria in the entorhinal cortex (EC)-contacting distal dendrites compared to CA3-contacting proximal dendrites. Together, these data demonstrate both cell type- and input specific regulation of mitochondrial morphology that likely influences the function of these distinct circuits. To determine whether differences in mitochondrial fission or fusion account for cell and/or layer specific differences in morphology, we immunostained for OPA1 and MFF, which showed a general enrichment in distal dendrites relative to proximal dendrites, and an unexpected increase in CA1 distal dendrites compared to CA2 distal dendrites. To show whether these morphological differences result in functionally distinct mitochondria, we measured mitochondrial calcium levels in live slices. We found a striking enrichment of mitochondrial calcium levels in CA2 distal dendrites relative to proximal dendrites, and this layer-specific effect was significantly different from that in CA1 dendrites at baseline and after activity. Collectively, these findings reveal discrete morphological and functional differences in mitochondria across hippocampal subregions and dendritic layers, which likely confer unique circuit properties and/or vulnerabilities to disease.

">Caveolin-1 controls lineage fidelity of adult neural stem cells via lysosomal degradation of PDGFRα</a></h4>

              
                Caveolae are cell-surface signaling hubs involved in stem cell proliferation and differentiation. However, the molecular details of how they influence stem cell quiescence remain poorly understood. In this study, we show that most caveolae components, particularly caveolin-1 (Cav-1), are specifically upregulated in quiescent neural stem cells (NSCs). Furthermore, we demonstrate that Cav-1 restricts platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR)  signaling, a key regulator for NSC proliferation and oligodendrocyte differentiation in the adult brain, through lysosomal degradation. Genetic ablation of Cav-1 leads to aberrant NSC activation, reduced neurogenesis, and enhanced ectopic oligodendrocyte differentiation on the ventricular surface in the ventral side of the ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ), a key NSC niche responsible for neuroblast differentiation. Mechanistically, we show that Cav-1 deficiency suppresses the endo-lysosomal degradation of PDGFR, leading to PDGFR accumulation and excessive signaling for oligodendrocyte differentiation. Taken together, our results uncover a crucial homeostatic mechanism wherein caveolae function as a safeguard to maintain adult NSC quiescence and lineage fidelity by controlling lysosomal turnover of PDGFR in a niche-specific manner.

">Residual photoreceptors affect the response of a degenerate retina to electrical stimulation</a></h4>

              
                Patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) implanted with the PRIMA photovoltaic subretinal prosthesis demonstrated letter acuity closely matching the device's 100 {micro}m pixel size. Improving visual acuity requires smaller pixels, which, in turn, require relaxation of electric field confinement to maintain effective stimulation of bipolar cells. Eliminating local return electrodes broadens the electric field but may inadvertently engage residual photoreceptors adjacent to the implant, thereby altering electrically evoked visual percepts. Here we quantify the contribution of residual photoreceptors to electrically evoked retinal responses across various implant configurations. Monopolar photovoltaic arrays with 20 {micro}m pixels and bipolar arrays with 100 {micro}m pixels were implanted subretinally in Long Evans rats, resulting in local degeneration of photoreceptors directly above the device. Responses were compared with those obtained in RCS rats, which lack functional photoreceptors. Implants were activated by patterns of 880 nm laser at pulse durations varying from 0.5 to 10 ms. Visually evoked potentials were measured in scotopic and photopic conditions, with and without the intravitreal application of mGluR6 agonist L-AP4 to block photoreceptor-driven ON pathways. Experimental thresholds were interpreted using a computational model of retinal network activation in distinct electric field geometries. In locally degenerate retina stimulated with monopolar arrays, blocking photoreceptor input yielded a rheobase (0.06 mW/mm2) and chronaxie (~3 ms) of the stimulation threshold, matching that measured in fully degenerate RCS retina, indicating direct activation of bipolar cells. In contrast, when photoreceptor input was intact, stimulation thresholds decreased significantly, and dark adaptation further modulated the threshold in a pulse-duration dependent manner. Bipolar arrays provided identical thresholds in locally degenerate and fully degenerate retina (0.2 mW/mm2) when stimulation was confined to the implant center; however, shifting stimulation to the implant's edge lowered the thresholds, revealing a contribution from adjacent photoreceptors. These findings demonstrate that residual photoreceptors can substantially influence responses evoked by subretinal prostheses in a degenerate retina, with direct consequences for perceptual uniformity in patients, such as edge brightening. These results provide guidance for design of the next-generation higher-resolution implants, supporting the use of local return electrodes to maximize resolution while minimizing the effect of photoreceptors in clinical applications.

">An fMRI study of composition in noun and verb phrases</a></h4>

              
                How do the language areas of the human brain combine multiple words into meaningful phrases and sentences remains ill-understood. Here, to address this question, we determined the response profile of temporal and inferior frontal language areas to the composition of up to four words into phrases. We tested whether brain activity increases with the number of merged words, and whether this profile differs for noun and verb phrases. To this aim, we used fMRI to quantify the brain responses to individual noun and verb phrases of varying length and to tightly matched word lists. Increasing phrase length was associated to an increase in activation in all regions of the temporo-frontal language network. The effect was more pronounced for phrases built around verbs than for phrases built around nouns, suggesting that verbs involve a more complex syntactic tree structure than nouns. Even with word lists, several regions, notably the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) pars triangularis and opercularis and the posterior superior temporal sulcus showed clear increases in activity with the length of sequences, although the words could not be merged into phrases. By contrast, other regions (IFG pars orbitalis, anterior temporal lobe, temporo-parietal junction) did not react to scrambled word lists. Those different functional response profiles inform theories of how composition is implemented in the human brain.

">Distributed fMRI patterns coupled to low-frequency cardiorespiratory dynamics provide markers of aging</a></h4>

              
                How aging affects brain-body connections can be investigated through changes in the coupling between functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals and bodily autonomic processes across the adult lifespan. Recent studies using univariate approaches have identified age-related changes in the association between fMRI signals from multiple individual brain regions and low-frequency respiratory and cardiac activity. Here, we investigate if whole-brain spatial fMRI patterns associated with low-frequency physiological processes (heart rate and respiratory volume fluctuations) present generalizable changes with age. Data from human participants of both sexes are included in the analysis. We find that chronological age can be predicted statistically beyond chance from patterns of low-frequency fMRI-physiology coupling, even after accounting for individual differences in physiological signal characteristics and brain anatomy. Notably, brain areas implicated in central autonomic regulation, including nodes within salience and ventral attention networks (e.g., insula and middle cingulate cortex), are amongst the strongest contributors to age prediction. Further, we observe that after removing physiological effects from fMRI data, the residual blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal variability is still a reliable indicator of age. Together, these findings underscore the close integration between brain and body physiology, and highlight this interaction as a potential biomarker of the aging process.

">Post-weaning social isolation impairs the orbitofrontal cortical circuit subserving contagious pain and prosocial behaviors</a></h4>

              
                Empathic behaviors are sensitive to environmental factors like post-weaning social isolation (SI), yet the mechanisms by which SI affects empathy remain unclear. Here, we show that mice subjected to SI exhibit marked impairments in contagious pain and prosocial behaviors, including allo-grooming and allo-licking toward cagemates experiencing inflammatory pain. Mechanistically, we identify the glutamatergic projection from the ventromedial thalamic nucleus (VM) to the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) as critical for these empathy-like responses. SI induces hypoexcitability of OFC glutamatergic neurons and attenuates excitatory synaptic transmission within the VM[-&gt;]OFC pathway. Remarkably, chemogenetic activation of OFC neurons or the VM[-&gt;]OFC projection restores empathic behaviors in SI mice. Furthermore, we uncover a molecular basis for SI-induced OFC hypoexcitability: the downregulation of Grik3, encoding a kainate-type glutamate receptor subunit. These findings reveal a previously uncharacterized thalamocortical mechanism through which early-life social deprivation disrupts empathic behaviors, offering insights into the underpinnings of social-affective dysfunction.

">A Concept-Driven Disentanglement Framework for Interpretable Graph Neural Networks in Structure-Function Coupling</a></h4>

              
                Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) achieve state-of-the-art performance in predicting brain functional connectivity (FC) from structural connectivity (SC), yet their "black-box" nature limits interpretability and scientific utility. We present a concept-driven disentanglement framework that builds inherently interpretable GNNs for quantitative hypothesis testing of structure-function relationships. The framework employs an ensemble of GNN branches, each architecturally biased to learn from a predefined structural concept (e.g., strong vs. weak connections) by processing a filtered version of the SC graph. This design enforces verifiably disentangled node embeddings, ensuring each branch captures a distinct structural feature. Using SHAP (Shapley additive explanations), we quantify the predictive contribution of each concept and assess its statistical significance against null distributions. Our framework demonstrates high predictive accuracy for FC, achieving a group-level correlation coefficient of 0.91 on a public human connectome dataset, while simultaneously yielding interpretable neuroscientific insights. This interpretable-by-design methodology bridges the gap between predictive power and scientific transparency, enabling deep learning models to provide mechanistic insights into the brain's network organization.

">The Sweet Spot of Plasticity in Perceptual Learning Dependson Training Variability</a></h4>

              
                Perceptual learning improves sensory discrimination, yet the brain must balance specificity and generalization, especially in variable environments. To investigate how variability shapes perceptual learning, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging while human subjects performed an orientation discrimination task with low or high task-irrelevant variability in spatial frequency. Behaviorally, both training regimes improved performance, but only high variability training enabled transfer to a novel location. Retinotopic orientation representations in early visual areas changed similarly across groups, indicating that variability does not alter local sensory representations. In contrast, functional connectivity differed: low variability training enhanced task-dependent coupling between the intraparietal sulcus and V2, while high variability training differentially affected connectivity with hV4. These results support a "sweet spot" model of perceptual learning, in which the locus of learning flexibly depends on the training environment. But rather than modifying sensory representations, variability reconfigures network-level readout, enabling specific or generalizable improvements in perception.

">Strengthening interhemispheric connectivity increases interregional information transfer between human primary motor areas</a></h4>

              
                Communication between brain regions is thought to be supported by the temporal alignment of their oscillatory activity creating rhythmic windows of opportunity for efficient information transfer. We examined this possibility by manipulating the strength of coupling between the left primary motor cortex (lM1) and the right primary motor cortex (rM1) and examined the impact on activity transfer between the two areas measurable in the electroencephalogram (EEG) in 60 right-handed individuals. In three experiments we manipulated the strength of the pathway connecting the lM1 and rM1 by applying paired associative stimulation (ccPAS) using three different patterns, two of which increase interregional coupling strength. We measured the impact on EEG communication transfer in the alpha, beta, and theta bands at rest. Augmenting the strength of the lM1-to-rM1 pathway enhanced the interregional communication volume in the high-theta/low alpha band, and both volume and speed in the beta band, respectively. These changes, visible at rest, are related to changes in the transcallosal inhibitory influence of the lM1 over rM1 cortical excitability following ccPAS. By contrast, augmenting the rM1-to-lM1 route failed to modulate communication transfer in right-handed individuals. The results provide direct evidence of oscillatory intra-areal information transfer, demonstrating a link between motor network physiology and the resonant frequencies mediating its interactions.

">High-Frequency Spinal Cord Stimulation Reorganizes Cortical Cross-Frequency Coupling in a Region- and Time-Dependent Manner</a></h4>

              
                Pain management strategies have progressed beyond traditional pharmacologic and physical interventions, integrating advanced neuromodulation techniques such as deep brain stimulation, peripheral nerve stimulation, and high-frequency spinal cord stimulation (hSCS). Despite its clinical efficacy, the supraspinal mechanisms underlying hSCS remain poorly understood. Prior work in sheep demonstrated that hSCS modulates gamma band (70-150 Hz) activity in the primary somatosensory and association cortices, implicating cortical involvement in pain modulation. Given, the interaction between low and high oscillations, we hypothesized that hSCS modulates gamma activity in a region- and time-dependent manner through specific coupling with theta rhythms (4-8 Hz). Using 96-channel subdural electrocorticography (ECoG), we computed theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) and the corresponding modulation index (MI) to quantify the effects of hSCS. While the preferred theta phase of gamma activity remained consistent across conditions and regions, MI increased significantly post-stimulation, most prominently in the association cortex, where robust theta-gamma phase locking was observed. In contrast, the somatosensory cortex exhibited weaker and more variable locking. Temporally, both cortices demonstrated an early, rapid increase in MI post-hSCS, accompanied by a shift (association) and attenuation (somatosensory) of the secondary peak. These findings reveal distinct regional and temporal dynamics in PAC following hSCS and suggest complementary roles of somatosensory and association cortices in processing neuromodulatory input. hSCS appears to reorganize cortical cross-frequency interactions, supporting its role in reorganizing functional network dynamics relevant to sensory processing and the subjective pain experience.

">DYT1 mutation alters gut microbiome composition and gut-brain axis dynamics in a mouse model</a></h4>

              
                Dystonia is a neurological movement disorder characterized by involuntary, sustained, or intermittent muscle contractions, that result in twisting movements, repetitive motor patterns, or abnormal postures. While genetic mutations such as Tor1a+/{triangleup}GAG are known contributors, the environmental and peripheral factors influencing disease onset and progression remain poorly understood. Emerging evidence implicates the gut microbiome in shaping neurodevelopment and host behavioral function, yet its contribution to dystonia pathobiology is largely unexplored. Here, we longitudinally profiled the gut microbiome of Tor1a+/{triangleup}GAG mouse model using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and uncovered early emerging, persistent disruptions in microbial diversity and community composition that track with progressive motor impairment. Mutant mice exhibited an alteration of key commensal taxa, and molecular signatures indicative of compromised gut-barrier integrity. Parallel transcriptomic profiling of colonic epithelium reveals coordinated dysregulation of pathways governing epithelial stress responses, endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis, lipid signaling, autophagy, and DNA damage and repair, pointing to a previously unrecognized epithelial stress state in Tor1a+/{triangleup}GAG mouse model. Integrative microbial-host interaction correlation analyses uncovered robust associations between specific dysbiotic taxa and host signaling pathways. These peripheral perturbations coincide with longitudinal motor deficits, suggesting a mechanistic gut-brain axis linking intestinal dysfunction to central neuronal vulnerability. Together, our findings provide the first experimental framework connecting microbiome perturbations, gut-barrier disruption, and neuronal vulnerability in a genetic model of dystonia. This work positions the gut microbiome and its regulation of epithelial and neuronal homeostasis as a novel entry point for disease modification in individuals carrying deleterious dystonia-associated variants.

">Maternal IL-17A administration fails to disrupt fetal cortical lamination in the absence of maternal microbes</a></h4>

              
                Maternal inflammation during pregnancy can disrupt fetal neurodevelopment and contribute to the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders. Interleukin-17A (IL-17A) has emerged as a potential mediator linking maternal immune activation (MIA) to neurodevelopmental abnormalities in offspring. Production of this cytokine is in-part regulated by the maternal gastrointestinal microbiome. However, it remains unclear whether IL-17A alone is sufficient to induce offspring brain abnormalities independent of maternal microbial signals. This study tests the potential for IL-17A to mediate fetal brain cortical architecture through administration of recombinant (r)IL-17A to pregnant germ-free (GF) dams. Pregnant GF mice received daily intraperitoneal injections of rIL-17A for six days, covering the mid- to latter half of the gestational period. Placental tissue was processed for histopathological evaluation, and cortical lamination was examined in the fetal brain using gold-standard immunohistochemical approaches. Spatial Light Interference Microscopy (SLIM), a novel label-free imaging technique, was employed to further quantify cortical architecture. This is the first report of SLIM imaging performed in the mouse embryonic brain. Overall, administration of rIL-17A to pregnant GF dams during mid-to-late gestation resulted in normal placental morphology and fetal cortical lamination patterns, suggesting that IL-17A alone is insufficient for altering cortical neurodevelopment, at least at this gestational timepoint. These findings highlight the importance of accounting for the maternal microbiome when interpreting the impacts of prenatal inflammation on brain development in utero.

">Progressive muscle metabolic reprogramming in asymptomatic ALS gene mutation carriers</a></h4>

              
                Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a rapidly fatal neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor neuron loss leading to extensive paralysis. There is emerging evidence that the disease involves a prolonged presymptomatic period during which motor function is preserved. Understanding the molecular mechanisms involved is key as the presymptomatic phase represents a critical window of opportunity for early intervention. Using RNA sequencing, we investigated changes in gene expression patterns in the skeletal muscle of ten asymptomatic carriers of ALS mutations (8 C9ORF72 expansion carriers and 2 SOD1 mutation carriers). We found that specific modifications of gene expression profiles are present in skeletal muscle before asymptomatic ALS gene carriers exhibit biomarker changes predictive of phenoconversion. We identified insulin signaling, AMPK signaling, and thermogenesis pathways, together with the TCA cycle as the main contributors to the dysregulated muscle transcriptome. Our data suggest that this metabolic reprogramming of skeletal muscle develops progressively during the transition to phenoconversion, characterized by a gradual increase in the expression of SREBF1 which encodes SREPB1, the key transcriptional regulator of lipid synthesis, in parallel with the progressive activation of AMPK and insulin signaling pathways. Our findings are consistent with a progressive enhancement in fatty acid metabolism and oxidative capacity in skeletal muscle, followed by a decline in oxidative phosphorylation efficiency as phenoconversion approaches. Evidence of muscle metabolic reprogramming in ALS long before motor onset identifies the dysregulation of muscle energy homeostasis as a critical early event in ALS pathogenesis.

">Implicit adaptations effect on sensorimotor and motor confidence</a></h4>

              
                Sensorimotor adaptation maintains movement accuracy by counteracting perturbations or miscalibrations. It can operate explicitly, by consciously adjusting motor plans to correct errors, or implicitly, by automatically recalibrating sensorimotor mappings without altering the motor plan. While explicit adaptation is known to reduce sensorimotor confidence -- the perceived likelihood of successful action -- it is unclear whether implicit adaptation similarly affects confidence in sensorimotor judgments or motor awareness (knowledge of one's own limb position). To investigate this, participants made reaching movements to visual targets without seeing their hand. Cursor feedback followed an '' error-clamped '' trajectory: its radial position matched the hand, but its angular direction was fixed and independent of actual hand direction, a manipulation participants were told to ignore. The clamp direction varied sinusoidally over trials ({+/-} 10 {degrees} ; 12 cycles per session). Participants reported confidence by adjusting the size of an arc centered on the target or, in another task, centered on reported reach direction; larger arcs indicated lower confidence. Points were awarded when the arc encompassed the true reach direction, with fewer points for larger arcs, encouraging accurate and meaningful confidence reports. Fourier analysis of reach and report time series revealed a strong 12-cycle component in both, demonstrating robust implicit adaptation and corresponding changes in motor awareness. These findings indicate that although implicit adaptation operates unconsciously, the resulting mismatch between motor plans and proprioceptive signals can bias judgments of reach outcomes. However, confidence judgments were not consistently affected, suggesting that sensorimotor confidence and confidence in proprioceptive awareness may rely on partially distinct mechanisms.

                The endothelial glycocalyx is a key regulator of cerebrovascular function and remains one of the most difficult structures to study in vivo. Here we uncover new structural and dynamical features of the brain endothelial glycocalyx using in vivo two-photon microscopy. We identified glycocalyx enrichment at endothelial junctions and arteriolar branch points, visualized its vesicular transport in real-time, and found evidence for its compositional variations along the arteriovenous axis. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching revealed two distinct kinetics of wheat germ agglutinin binding, including a previously undescribed one. Finally, super-localization of the glycocalyx estimated glycocalyx thickness as 775{+/-}17 nm and 622{+/-}34 nm before and after enzymatic shedding, reconciling discrepancies between past optical and electron microscopy estimates. Together these findings establish the first milti-scale framework of glycocalyx distribution and heterogeneity, transport, and molecular interaction kinetics in the living brain.

">Targeting Putrescine Homeostasis with Lactiplantibacillus plantarum PS128 to Mitigate Autism-like Behaviors in Fmr1 KO Mice</a></h4>

              
                Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) often presents with gastrointestinal disturbances, yet the molecular mechanisms linking gut alterations to behavioral dysfunction remain incompletely understood. Using Fragile X mental retardation 1 (Fmr1) knockout mice, we found that autism-like behaviors are associated with disrupted gut microbiota-polyamine metabolism and elevated putrescine in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Supplementation with Lactiplantibacillus plantarum PS128 reshaped gut microbial communities, improved intestinal integrity, and restored arginine-ornithine-polyamine metabolic homeostasis. PS128 normalized the serum-to-PFC putrescine imbalance and reduced expression of putrescine transporters in the PFC. Consistent with a causal role, peripheral putrescine elevation induced autism-like behaviors in wild-type mice, whereas inhibition of putrescine synthesis ameliorated behavioral deficits in Fmr1 knockout mice. Together, these findings identify putrescine dysregulation as an important metabolic contributor to autism-like phenotypes, support a metabolically stratifiable ASD subtype, and implicate PS128 as a psychobiotic intervention acting through the microbiota-gut-brain axis.

">Unpredictable chronic stress does not alter social behavior in zebrafish</a></h4>

              
                Stress-related disorders encompass diverse behavioral alterations, including impaired social functioning. The zebrafish (Danio rerio) is a valuable model for studying these phenomena, particularly because of its robust and ethologically conserved social behaviors. Unpredictable chronic stress (UCS) produces behavioral, physiological, and molecular changes in zebrafish that parallel core features of human anxiety and depressive disorders; however, its impact on social outcomes remains unclear. Here, we examined whether a 14-day UCS protocol alters social behavior in adult zebrafish using two complementary assays: the social preference test and the shoal cohesion test. Across two independent experiments, UCS did not elicit detectable changes in individual social approach or group-level cohesion. In contrast, UCS induced clear anxiety-like behavior in the novel tank test, validating the stress manipulation, with stressed fish displaying reduced vertical exploration and decreased time in the upper zone. Shoal cohesion measures showed a time-dependent decrease in both groups, consistent with habituation to the testing environment rather than a stress-specific effect. Together, these results suggest that social behavior in adult zebrafish is relatively resilient to UCS under the conditions tested, whereas anxiety-like responses are markedly affected. Future work should investigate whether factors such as stressor intensity, developmental stage, sex composition, or social hierarchy modulate the sensitivity of social behavior to chronic stress.

">Neuronal recordings in head-fixed and freely-moving mole-rats</a></h4>

              
                Mole-rats are subterranean rodents that have evolved remarkable sensory adaptations to life in underground tunnel systems, yet their neural mechanisms remain largely unexplored. Here, we present a protocol for in vivo electrophysiological recordings in awake, head-fixed, and freely moving African mole-rats (Fukomys anselli/micklemi), overcoming unique challenges of studying the neurobiology of subterranean species. We find that mole-rat brain physiology impacts survival after surgeries, with higher carbon dioxide concentrations required for recovery compared to other rodents, likely due to a mutation in the chloride-potassium symporter KCC2. Having addressed these challenges through our optimized methodology, we used tetrodes and Neuropixels probes to record single-unit activity and local field potentials (LFP) across several cortical and subcortical regions for several weeks. We observed single units responsive to auditory and visual stimuli in the superior colliculus, and hippocampal recordings in freely moving mole-rats revealed prominent theta rhythms at frequencies lower than those observed in any other rodent species to date. Finally, we performed integrated three-dimensional and two-dimensional probe-track analysis within the same brain using tissue clearing, light sheet imaging, rehydration, and vibratome sectioning, and we present a newly developed stereotaxic brain atlas for implantation and histological alignment. This established methodology will guide future studies in comparative rodent neurobiology, providing further insights into neurobiological adaptations to subterranean environments. Given their phylogenetic and ecological similarities, we expect our protocols to be transferable to other subterranean species, including the widely studied naked mole-rat (Heterocephalus glaber).

">Anesthesia-triggered dopaminergic bursts actively induce forgetting: a paradigm shift in understanding cold-shock amnesia</a></h4>

              
                Retrograde memory loss, the inability to recall events preceding amnesia onset, is a well-documented consequence of anesthesia. Recent discoveries, pioneered by Drosophila research, have challenged the view that forgetting is a passive process, and have demonstrated that rather it is a highly active, well-regulated biological process. This work builds on this and makes a remarkable and unexpected discovery that anesthesia itself triggers a robust, widespread burst of activity in dopaminergic neurons (DANs). Here, we report that both cold-shock and CO2 anesthesia elicits strong activation in PAM and PPL1 DAN populations. This calcium activity is accompanied by robust synaptic release of dopamine. Strikingly, pharmacological experiments show that this response is input-driven, as it is completely abolished by Na+ channel blockers and dampened by nAChR antagonists. Using behavioral methods, crucially, we show that anesthesia-induced amnesia can be prevented by blocking activity in PAM and PPL1 neurons during anesthesia. Together, our findings reveal a previously unrecognized active mechanism by which anesthesia induces forgetting, mediated by rapid dopaminergic signaling. This paradigm-shifting discovery redefines how we think about anesthesia-induced amnesia and the biology of forgetting.

">Infra-slow (<0.1 Hz) modulation of human brain pulsations in awake and sleep states</a></h4>

              
                Human brain exhibits three propagating pulsations, namely cardiovascular, respiratory, and vasomotor waves, which together propel the flow of intracranial fluids. While their pulsation characteristics have been extensively studied, their causal interconnections have not been systematically investigated. Using ultrafast whole brain magnetic resonance encephalography (MREG), we analysed the frequency domain up to 5 Hz for cross-frequency oscillatory interactions in awake and NREM-sleep states of 23 healthy volunteers. Using transfer entropy (TE) analysis, we found that in the awake state the infra-slow (ISF < 0.1 Hz) oscillations of statistically independent resting state networks (RSN) largely drove the neurofluid (NF) pulsatility. NREM-sleep was associated with increased power of infra-slow fluctuation (ISF) vasomotor oscillations and with altered driving patterns between RSN and NF networks in the direction of a causally chained pattern. Importantly, within these independent signal sources, we found three distinct cross-frequency coupling frequency ranges occurring at ISF (<0.1 Hz), respiratory (~0.25 Hz), and cardiovascular (~1 Hz) frequencies, where the slower pulsations generally modulated the faster ones, except for a finding of inverted cardiorespiratory drive in NREM-2 sleep. These results indicate the presence of directional ISF-coordinated mechanisms underlying brain pulsations that contribute to driving the intracranial fluid transfer processes.

">Echoes as Signal, Not Noise: Reverberation Sharpens Sensitivity to Temporal Structure</a></h4>

              
                Sensitivity to temporal structure is fundamental to hearing, yet how natural reverberation shapes this sensitivity is unclear. Here we identify a general principle we term echo-facilitated temporal sensitivity (EFTS), in which the auditory system exploits reverberation as a computational resource to selectively and dose dependently enhance perceptual and neural responses to rapid temporal changes. Using transitional click trains with subtle inter click interval (ICI) shifts, human listeners showed monotonically improved change detection across simulated echo levels. Concurrent EEG revealed systematic increases of a late change response with echo strength, while onset responses remained stable, indicating a selective boost to temporal-structure-transition processing. In awake rats, electrocorticography over auditory cortex replicated these effects; single units exhibited echo level dependent increases in ICI transition evoked firing, and receiver operating characteristic neurometrics yielded steeper functions and lower discrimination thresholds. Laminar local field potential analysis further revealed that echo-dependent divergence emerged last in the supragranular layer, after appearing in the granular and infragranular layers, consistent with an initial thalamocortical drive followed by intracortical amplification. Together, these findings establish EFTS as a cross-species mechanism for ecologically grounded temporal computation, through which reverberation sharpens neural representations of temporal structure and enhances sensitivity to rapid pattern changes, reframing echoes as structured signals that the brain uses to naturally optimize temporal integration in everyday listening.

">SpotDMix: informed mRNA transcript assignment using mixture models</a></h4>

              
                Unveiling the genetic profiles of spatially distinguished cells is an important aspect in many areas of brain research, as the genetic identity contains information about a cell's physiological properties and internal state. On top of this, knowledge of the genetic details of each cell can reveal structural organization within tissue. As image-based spatial transcriptomics moves toward applications in tissues with dense cellular packing, accurate assignment of detected mRNA transcripts ("spots") to correct segmented cells becomes increasingly difficult, rendering simple methods insufficient with many incorrect assignments to neighboring cells. Here we introduce SpotDMix, a statistical model for assigning spots to cells by modeling spots as coming from a mixture model of distributions matching segmented cell shapes, with assignment probabilities and shape parameters optimized using the Expectation Maximization algorithm. Performance is assessed and compared against several simple methods in various scenarios on both surrogate data and larval zebrafish data. In all tested scenarios SpotDMix outperforms the simple methods on all evaluated metrics, including individual transcript assignment accuracy, total assigned number of spots per cell error and cell type classification. Further, SpotDMix produces a higher degree of exclusivity between genes which are known to not or rarely co-express.

">Neuronal activity induces myelin voltage changes that reflect action potential dependent myelin potassium buffering</a></h4>

              
                Vertebrate axons can be wrapped by myelin produced by oligodendrocytes. This cellular interaction ensures fast and accurate propagation of action potentials, but the physiology of the myelin sheath is almost completely unknown. To investigate the physiology of the myelin sheath, we implemented an imaging strategy that allowed optical measurements of myelin membrane voltage, with the aim to identify physiological changes of the myelin membrane during neuronal firing. We expressed the genetically encoded voltage indicator ASAP3 in mouse oligodendrocytes in vivo and subsequently investigated myelin physiology by optically measuring myelin membrane voltage. We found that myelin depolarizes during neuronal activity, which is blocked by inhibiting neuronal action potentials. Pharmacological and knock-out experiments of Kir4.1 showed that potassium uptake channels mediate action potential induced depolarization. Blocking myelin dependent potassium uptake and direct application of high potassium to identified axons induced axonal initiated and antidromic propagating action potentials. Our study shows that myelin is not an electrically passive insulator, but exhibits ion dynamics and its physiological response is fine tuned to neuronal activity. By facilitating potassium removal during action potentials, myelin supports high precision axonal firing. Genetically encoded sensors are thus a useful tool to study physiological properties of myelin, inaccessible by classical techniques.

">Temporal contrast enhancement generalizes across pain and auditory modalities</a></h4>

              
                The human brain continuously processes sensory inputs whose perceptual impact depends on stimulus intensity, salience, and context. Temporal filtering shapes this processing by dynamically modulating neural responses according to stimulus repetition, temporal structure, and predictive contingencies. Higher-order percepts such as pain are likewise a subject to temporal filtering, as exemplified by temporal contrast enhancement (TCE), a stimulation paradigm eliciting pain inhibition. However, given the prevalence of filtering mechanisms across sensory domains, it remains unclear whether TCE is specific to pain or represents a supramodal filtering mechanism. Here, we contrasted behavioral and neurophysiological responses, including electroencephalography and pupillometry, in a TCE paradigm for painful heat versus uncomfortable auditory stimulation. We sought to establish whether TCE generalizes across modalities and bases on similar or distinct underlying neurophysiological processes. Human participants took part in either a purely behavioral investigation (n = 33) or in a neurophysiological and behavioral investigation (n = 29). Both painful heat and loud sounds induced TCE effects, suggesting a supramodal temporal filtering mechanism with modality-specific temporal dynamics. Increasing pupil size and decreasing power of neural alpha oscillations (~10 Hz) with higher painful heat indicate bottom-up modulation of the autonomic nervous system and a release of neural inhibition, respectively. Critically, expectation of pain - but not loud sound - induced an alpha power increase, demonstrating to-down contributions to temporal filtering of pain. However, no direct neurophysiological correlates of subjectively experienced TCE effects were found. Findings suggests that a supramodal temporal filtering mechanism with modality-specific neurophysiological dynamics shapes the processing of aversive stimulation.

">Sleep-modulated disinhibition enables replay for memory consolidation, accelerated by ripples</a></h4>

              
                Memory consolidation involves elusive neural mechanisms. Here, we develop a biophysically detailed model of the entorhinal-hippocampal-cortical network to reveal that disinhibition drives synaptic and systems consolidation. Transitioning to slow-wave sleep via neuromodulatory dampening of inhibition generates up-down states and spontaneous, time-compressed replays of spatial sequences encoded with theta-phase precession. Lateral inhibition levels unify physiological and pathological ripple diversity. Cortical disinhibition enables memory transfer from hippocampus. Weakened afferent CA1 synapses eliminate ripples but spare replays, proposing strategies to mitigate ripple disruptions. Replays sustain systems consolidation even without ripples, albeit slower; excessive weakening halts it, rescuable by enhanced hippocampal-to-cortical connectivity. Inducing disinhibition during wakefulness--mimicking medial-entorhinal-cortex-input-dependent quiet wakefulness replay--activates these processes, underscoring disinhibition's state-agnostic role. These insights elucidate disinhibition's centrality in engraining memories and fostering hippocampal independence, reconciling empirical observations, yielding testable predictions, and identifying therapeutic avenues for memory disorders.

">Multi-timescale Rhythmic Dynamics in Rostral Ventromedial Medulla Neurons</a></h4>

              
                Neural circuits involved in sensory control must integrate fast, reflexive responses with slower, state-dependent modulation. This coordination is especially critical in the pain system, where rapid withdrawal must be balanced against slower adjustments in nociceptive sensitivity that reflect arousal, physiology, and internal state. We hypothesized that neurons of the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM), the principal brainstem node for descending pain control, operate across multiple temporal scales, combining fast stimulus-evoked responses with slower intrinsic dynamics. Using single-unit recordings from identified RVM ON-, OFF-, and NEUTRAL-cells and probabilistic modeling, we find that ON- and OFF-cells exhibit multi-phase population responses characterized by rapid activation and prolonged recovery dynamics lasting tens of seconds. In the absence of stimulation, the same neurons display coherent, quasi-periodic oscillations on the order of minutes, captured by Gaussian process models as predictable, low-frequency fluctuations. These rhythmic dynamics were specific to ON- and OFF-cells and occasionally coherent with autonomic parameters, suggesting coupling between nociceptive and homeostatic control loops. Together, these results identify a multi-timescale organizational principle within descending brainstem circuits, in which fast, reflex-related and slow, rhythmic processes jointly structure sensory modulation and internal state control.

">Reverberation exacerbates effects of interruption on auditory spatial selective attention</a></h4>

              
                Everyday listening requires focusing on one talker while ignoring competing sounds, a process challenged by reverberation and unexpected distractions. Here, we asked whether reverberation decreases effects of distractions by reducing the salience of new onsets, or compounds disruption by increasing task difficulty. Across five online experiments, participants recalled spatialized syllable streams presented with or without interrupters under pseudo-anechoic and reverberant conditions. Interrupters consistently impaired recall, especially the syllables following the interrupter. For the syllable immediately after the interruption, this effect was larger in reverberation than in anechoic conditions. These results demonstrate that distractions are especially disruptive in reverberant settings.

">The first comprehensive case study of early-emerging prosopometamorphopsia</a></h4>

              
                Prosopometamorphopsia (PMO) is a rare perceptual disorder characterized by facial distortions. This report presents the first thorough study of a case of PMO that emerged early in life. Zed, age 15 at the time of testing, has experienced lifelong, dynamic facial distortions in which features move, droop, disappear, expand, shrink, and rotate. He also experiences identity misrecognitions, in which he perceives familiar faces as strangers and vice versa (e.g., seeing his grandfather when viewing a young woman). Behavioral assessments indicate that Zed's distortions occur across viewpoints, visual field positions, picture-plane orientations, and visual angles. Neuropsychological testing revealed face identity recognition deficits, yet, despite his facial distortions, Zed can make accurate fine-grained perceptual judgments about facial age and sex. Structural MRI showed no lesions, but face-selectivity in two right posterior face-selective areas was reduced, and diffusion tensor imaging revealed lower white matter integrity in the left inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus. Zed's case offers new insights into early-emerging PMO, its manifestations, co-occurrence with other face-processing disorders, and underlying neural correlates.

                <span class="paragraphSection"><div class="boxTitle">Abstract</div>Working memory depends on the temporary retention and manipulation of information, bridging the gap between short-term memory and information processing functions. When the same working memory task is repeated over several days, it raises the question of whether the rule or task set becomes automated (or proceduralized). The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is crucial for working memory. Yet, the role of the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) in the automation (proceduralization) of rules or task sets remains to be clarified. Using a longitudinal approach of the “delay non-match to place” (DNMP) task in a T-maze combined to chemogenetic inhibition of the mPFC or DLS in mice, we show that the mPFC becomes less critical in the maintenance phase of the task as behavior progressively shifts towards automation. During this phase, the DLS facilitates automated processing. Silencing through chemogenetic inhibition of the DLS during maintenance triggers an adaptation in learning strategies, reactivating a goal-directed behavior. Our findings strengthen memory traces as a dynamic reorganization of neural networks, challenging the classical view of information migration between brain structures. We propose that the memory trace remains in a dormant state—less energy-consuming for the system—while allowing for rapid flexibility in case of task modification.</span>

                Background Flare-ups may occur after root canal treatment which consist of acute exacerbation of asymptomatic pulpal and/or periradicular pathologic condition. The causative factors of interappointment pain include mechanical, chemical or microbial irritation to the pulp or periradicular tissues. The potential role of microorganisms in interappointment pain is why the success of endodontic treatment depends on complete eradication of microorganisms capable of causing an intraradicular or extraradicular infection. This can be achieved by mechanical cleaning and shaping, in conjunction with irrigation and antibacterial agents. The aim of this study was to assess the ability of triple antibiotic paste with the anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac potassium versus calcium hydroxide used as an intra-canal medication in reducing post-operative pain. Methods 84 patients with asymptomatic uniradicular necrotic teeth were randomly assigned into two groups according to the intra-canal medication used: calcium hydroxide group (CH) and triple antibiotic paste with diclofenac potassium group (TAPC). In the first treatment session, intracoronal cavity preparation was performed after rubber dam isolation followed by chemo-mechanical preparation using rotary Protaper Universal files with saline irrigation followed by intra-canal medication placement then postoperative pain was assessed at 24, 48 and 72 hours postoperatively using Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). In the second treatment session, intracanal medications were removed by irrigation using saline followed by obturation. Results Both intracanal medicaments resulted in a statistically significant decrease in mean pain value from 24 to 48 and 72 hours postoperatively. While when comparing both groups, TAPC intracanal medication showed less post-operative pain compared to that of the CH group at 24, 48 and 72 hours with a statistically significant difference at 48 hours only. Conclusion Both intracanal medicaments were efficient in reducing post-operative pain in asymptomatic uniradicular necrotic teeth.

                Background Crop residue application can maintain soil fertility and sustain agriculture. However, the effects of residue application for crop growth are unstable because of variable weather conditions and the residual effects of crop residue application. Furthermore, residue application often reduces crop yields. Therefore, I tried to clarify effective residue application factors in an environment which was has stable weather conditions and low residualafter effects. Methods Majuro atoll, a coral sand atoll near the equator, was selected for the experiment site because of its stable weather and low residualafter effect of coral sand. A factorial design experiment using sweet corn was conducted based on the following four factors: fungi propagation before application, cutting residue into pieces, dispersion (or accumulationwindrowing) of applied residue, and placement (on the surface or incorporation) with an equal amount of crop residue. The effects of each factors on the corn yields were evaluated using Cohen’s effect size analysis. Results The dispersion showed the largest effect (1.2 in Cohen’s), which exceeded the effect of incorporation (0.7). The interaction of dispersion and incorporation showed a huge effect (4.9) on corn yield. Discussion The effect of dispersion was not positive but it avoided the negative effects of residue clustering. Because, the toxicity of the plant residue and generation of toxic substances by anaerobic decomposition are widely known. Anaerobic decomposition occurs inside the residue clusters. However, dispersion reduced the toxicity by adsorption in soil and avoiding anaerobic decomposition. Furthermore, incorporation showed an interaction effect, but surface placement did not. Conclusion The dispersion of crop residue enhanced the positive effect of crop residue incorporation by avoiding the toxicity from crop residue. This finding adds a new viewpoint for the controversy between conventional and conservation agriculture.

                <p>by Chenhui Ma, Evren Gurkan-Cavusoglu</p>

Understanding how chemotherapy perturbs cell cycle dynamics is critical for advancing cancer treatment. We develop a probabilistic, multi-generational framework based on a Bellman–Harris branching process to quantify treatment-induced shifts in tumor cell dynamics. The model incorporates key drug-responsive behaviors, including checkpoint activation, apoptosis, and checkpoint adaptation that propagates inherited DNA damage, enabling the characterization of heterogeneous survival outcomes after treatment. Biological parameters map directly onto DNA repair fidelity and cell-fate decisions, providing mechanistic insights beyond what is accessible from experiments alone. Dose-dependent extensions further allow exploration of treatment-induced perturbations. Model parameters were calibrated to empirical cell cycle measurements using the robust adaptive Metropolis algorithm. Global sensitivity analysis shows that scale parameters governing unfaithful DNA repair under G2/M- and S phase–specific agents exert major influence on model predictions, particularly at later time points. Across three chemotherapies, the framework reveals consistent dose-dependent alterations in cell cycle dynamics, with higher doses driving pronounced disruptions. Together, these results demonstrate how model-informed analyses can provide quantitative insight into treatment-induced cell cycle perturbations and support the refinement of therapeutic strategies.

                <p>by Naoyuki Okamoto, Michael Taylor, Takatomi Kubo, Shin Ishii, Benedetto De Martino, Aurelio Cortese</p>

Mistakes are valuable learning opportunities, yet in uncertain environments, whether a lack of reward is due to poor performance or bad luck can be hard to tell. To investigate how humans address this issue, we developed a visuomotor task where rewards depended on either skill or chance. Participants consistently displayed a self-attribution bias, crediting successes to their own ability while blaming failures on randomness, an effect that influenced their subsequent decisions. Computational modelling revealed two underlying mechanisms—a distorted perception of ability and a positivity bias in the skill condition. Notably, while distorted self-perception shaped behaviour, it did not affect confidence; instead, self-attribution bias led to overconfidence in external blame. These findings suggest a more complex picture in which self-attribution biases arise from both perceptual distortions and post-decision evaluations, highlighting the need for an interplay between experimental design and computational modelling to understand behavioural biases.

When faced with a choice between exploring an unknown option vs exploiting an option they know well, older adults explore less and exploit more than younger adults. Recent work has suggested that one cause of this age difference in exploration is a reduction in the extent to which older adults use “random exploration” – exploration driven by behavioral variability. Here we investigate potential mechanisms for this age-related difference in random exploration through the lens of a drift diffusion model (DDM) of the explore-exploit choice. In this model, random exploration can be modulated by two mechanisms – the fidelity with which information about the choice is represented in the brain, the “signal-to-noise ratio” (SNR), and the amount of information required to make a decision, the “decision threshold.” Reduced random exploration in aging could be caused either by an increase in signal-to-noise ratio or an increase in decision threshold in older adults. By fitting the DDM to choices and response times in a sample of healthy younger and older adults, we found that older adults had a lower SNR and a higher threshold than younger adults. This suggests that reduced random exploration in aging is driven by higher response thresholds in older adults, which may compensate for the reduced signal-to-noise ratio with which decision information is represented in the brain.

                <p>by Alexandros Gaitanidis, Veronica Pampanin, Jessica Thiem, Georgios Kalaras, Lion Huthmacher, Silvan Hürkey, Dimitrios Kadas, Agapi Dimitriadou, Andriana Ntogka, Subhabrata Sanyal, Christos Consoulas, Carsten Duch</p>

Brain aging can cause cognitive and motor disabilities which often correlate with changes in dendritic branch, axon collateral, and synapse numbers. However, from invertebrates to mammals, age-related decline is typically restricted to specific neuron types or brain parts, indicating differential vulnerability. The rules to pinpoint the susceptibility of distinct brain elements to aging remain largely unknown. Here, we combine longitudinal studies with neuroanatomical, electrophysiological, and optophysiological analyses in the <i>Drosophila</i> genetic model to identify aging-susceptible and aging-resilient elements in a sensorimotor circuit that underlies escape. Young and mid-aged flies escape predator-like visual stimuli with a jump followed by flight, but behavioral performance declines with age. Mapping the underlying functional decline into the brain shows that most circuit components are robust against aging and remain functional even in old flies that have lost the behavior. By contrast, behavioral decline is caused by the selective decay of synaptic transmission between one specific visual projection neuron type (LC4) and the dendrite of one identified descending neuron (GF). Structurally, presynaptic active zone marker density is reduced whereas postsynaptic marker density remains normal. Other central synapses in this circuit as well as neuromuscular synapses are robust to aging. The synaptic connection susceptible to aging is also the circuit element most vulnerable to starvation or oxidative stress. Moreover, the vulnerable circuit element is also required for habituation, and thus, underlying circuit plasticity. In conjunction with data from mammalian brains our data suggest that a trade-off for functional neural circuit plasticity might be vulnerability to aging.

                <p>by Yanying Yu, Nicole E. Wheeler, Lars Barquist</p>

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a growing threat to human health. Increasingly, genome sequencing is being applied for the surveillance of bacterial pathogens, producing a wealth of data to train machine learning (ML) applications to predict AMR and identify resistance determinants. However, bacterial populations are highly structured, and sampling is biased towards human disease isolates, violating ML assumptions of independence between samples. This is rarely considered in applications of ML to AMR. Here, we demonstrate the confounding effects of sample structure by analyzing over 24,000 whole genome sequences and AMR phenotypes from five diverse pathogens, using pathological training data where resistance is confounded with phylogeny. We show the resulting ML models perform poorly and that increasing the training sample size fails to rescue performance. A comprehensive analysis of 6,740 models identifies species- and drug-specific effects on model accuracy. These findings highlight the limitations of current ML approaches in the face of realistic sampling biases and underscore the need for population structure-aware methods and more diverse datasets to improve AMR prediction and surveillance.

                <p>by Salsabil Arabi, Chaoqun Ni, B. Ian Hutchins</p>

During career advancement and funding allocation decisions in biomedicine, reviewers have traditionally depended on journal-level measures of scientific influence like the impact factor. Prestigious journals reject large quantities of papers, many of which may be meritorious. It is possible that this process could create a system whereby some influential articles are prospectively identified and recognized by journal brands, but most influential articles are overlooked. Here, we measure the degree to which journal prestige hierarchies capture or overlook influential science. We quantify the fraction of scientists’ articles that would receive recognition because (a) they are published in journals above a chosen impact factor threshold, or (b) they are at least as well-cited as articles appearing in such journals. We find that the number of papers cited at least as well as those appearing in high-impact factor journals vastly exceeds the number of papers published in such venues. At the investigator level, this phenomenon extends across gender, racial, and career stage groupings of scientists. We also find that approximately half of researchers never publish in a venue with an impact factor above 15, which, under journal-level evaluation regimes, may exclude them from consideration for opportunities. Many of these researchers publish equally influential work; however, raising the possibility that the traditionally chosen journal-level measures that are routinely considered under decision-making norms, policy, or law, may recognize as little as 10%–20% of this influential work.

                Abstract* Background Traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, with outcomes influenced by multiple factors, including the timeliness of surgical intervention. This study aimed to investigate the association between surgical waiting time and clinical outcomes in TBI patients at Dr. Sardjito General Hospital, Yogyakarta, using the Glasgow Outcome Scale–Extended (GOSE) as the assessment tool. Methods This prospective cohort study included TBI patients who underwent craniotomy at Dr. Sardjito General Hospital between May and November 2024. Data were obtained from electronic medical records, and regression analysis was performed to evaluate the effect of surgical waiting time on outcomes. Results Among the 70 patients who met the inclusion criteria, the median age was 19 years (IQR 14.5–41) and 71.4% were male. Over half of the patients (51.4%) presented with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 13–15. Based on GOSE assessment, 27.1% achieved good recovery, 27.1% upper moderate disability, 10% lower moderate disability, 21.4% upper severe disability, 5.7% lower severe disability, and 8.6% died. The median hospital stay was 10 days. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that increasing age (OR = 1.04; 95% CI: 1.00–1.09; p = 0.028) and surgical delay >17 hours from injury to craniotomy (OR = 7.94; 95% CI: 1.35–46.67; p = 0.022) were independently associated with poorer GOSE outcomes. Shorter injury-to-incision times are associated with higher GOSE scores. However, surgical waiting time alone was not significantly associated with clinical deterioration (OR = 1.58; 95% CI: 0.19–1.80; p = 0.113; median = 7 hours; ROC = 0.597; p = 0.908). Conclusions Craniotomy performed >17 hours after injury was associated with an increased risk of severe disability or death. In contrast, a median surgical waiting time of 7 hours showed no significant impact on GOSE outcomes.

                This study aims to identify and synthesise the main factors that influence knowledge management (KM) in business environments. Using the PRISMA approach, a systematic review of 44 empirical and conceptual articles published between 2020 and 2024 was conducted. The findings indicate eight key variables that are critical for strengthening KM: leadership, technology, entrepreneurial orientation, strategic orientation, learning orientation, innovation, human resource management, and high-performance work systems. The findings show that leadership promotes collaboration and trust, creating a supportive environment for KM. Technological advancements facilitate efficient knowledge sharing and application, while strategic alignment ensures KM supports organizational goals. Human resource practices engage employees in knowledge processes, and high-performance work systems enhance knowledge acquisition and utilization. Innovation drives the generation of new ideas, and entrepreneurial orientation encourages a proactive approach to leveraging knowledge for competitive advantage. Despite the growing interest in KM, challenges such as resistance to change, inadequate infrastructure, and varying employee readiness hinder its effective implementation. This study emphasizes the need for an integrated KM approach that addresses these barriers while aligning KM strategies with organizational needs. Future research should investigate how these factors interact across different industries and cultural contexts to optimize KM practices and improve organizational performance.

     alt="Frequency and Timing-Dependent Effects of Ultrasound on Neural Responses: Comparative Analysis With Whisker Stimulation in Rats"/>
<p>In the W–U sequence, short intervals (10 ms) induced strong suppression of ultrasound responses by preceding whisker input, consistent with forward inhibition in the barrel cortex. In the U–W sequence, whisker responses were enhanced at the intermediate interval (25 ms), suggesting that ultrasound may transiently facilitate cortical excitability.</p>
<br/>
<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>This study explores whether ultrasound can induce short-term synaptic plasticity (STP)-like effects at the systems level by modulating cortical excitability and sensory responsiveness. We designed a temporally shifted sensory paradigm to test how ultrasound frequency (1, 2, and 4 MHz), inter-stimulus interval (10, 25, and 100 ms), and stimulation order (ultrasound–whisker vs. whisker–ultrasound) affect cortical responses in the rat barrel cortex. Thirty Sprague–Dawley rats underwent an identical experimental protocol. Electrocorticography (ECoG) signals were recorded from the C2 barrel column, and neural responses were assessed by peak amplitude, latency, and power spectral density. Whisker stimulation alone evoked strong cortical responses, significantly greater than ultrasound stimulation. Notably, when ultrasound preceded whisker stimulation by 25 ms, subsequent whisker responses were significantly enhanced, suggesting the existence of a cortical “excitability window” for neuromodulation. This facilitation effect was absent with time intervals of 10 and 100 ms. Mechanistically, ultrasound may modulate membrane tension and activate mechanosensitive ion channels to transiently lower the activation threshold of cortical neurons. These findings reveal that ultrasound can temporally enhance cortical excitability and sensory responsiveness in a frequency- and timing-dependent manner. Our results provide systems-level evidence of STP-like neuromodulation and provide the potential of ultrasound as a noninvasive method for dynamic control of sensory processing.</p>

Putative miRNA targeting sequences on downregulated genes were investigated by three prediction databases, MiRWalk, TargetScan, and miRDB, and compared to GSE207345’s differential expression with creation of Affymetrix Multispecies miRNA-4 Array. The miRNA–mRNA interaction network was established in Cytoscape. Results Memory CD4+ T cells were significantly enriched in PDAC TME. At the same time, we observed genotype-specific repression of major immune and metabolic genes in these cells. Some miRNAs were significantly overexpressed in PDAC, and hsa-miR-1207-5p, hsa-miR-6805-5p, and hsa-miR-149-3p might target many immune-related or pancreatic enzyme-associated genes. Of these, a core of CLPS, NR4A2, and SOCS3 was most frequently targeted, which likely indicated the importance of these genes in immune evasion. Conclusions While memory CD4+ T cells exist within the PDAC TME, their activity is suppressed by miRNA-associated gene dysregulation. These data suggest candidate therapeutic approaches in which targeting of miRNAs could be used to normalize immune cells and promote anti-tumor immunity.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1403/v1?src=rss">Properties of Fuzzy Soft Codes and Their Role in Decision-Making [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background Fuzzy soft sets are well-established for decision-making under uncertainty. However, integrating soft set theory with fuzzy codes remains unexplored, as fuzzy soft code sets have not addressed these concepts. This study presents novel fuzzy soft codes and discusses their application in diagnosing medical conditions and decision-making, bridging a critical gap in the literature. Methods Numerous scholars have examined fuzzy sets, fuzzy codes, and the theory of fuzzy soft sets and their applications over the years. This paper introduces the novel concept of fuzzy soft codes by combining fuzzy soft set theory with the notion of fuzzy codes, inspired by Ozkan’s 2002 definition of fuzzy codes. Results We define fuzzy soft codes as a parameterized family of fuzzy codes, detailing their matrix representation, set-theoretic operations, and algebraic properties. A new decision-making method using choice and score values from comparison tables is introduced. An example demonstrates its effectiveness for selecting optimal objects, proving its real-world potential in areas like medical diagnosis. This bridges a key theoretical gap and enables future extensions like intuitionistic fuzzy soft codes. Conclusions This study addresses a gap in the integration of soft set theory with the notion of fuzzy codes. The primary objective is to introduce the concept of fuzzy soft codes within the context of decision-making by merging fundamental ideas from soft set theory and fuzzy coding, while also examining several of their key properties. Additionally, a practical example is provided to demonstrate how this approach can be effectively utilized across a range of real world problem.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/14-1402/v1?src=rss">A New Analytical Method for Solving the Fractional Swift-Hohenberg Equation with Atangana-Baleanu Derivative [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                This work introduces a hybrid analytical technique for solving the Swift–Hohenberg equation by integrating the newly formulated Yasser–Jassim integral transform with the variational iteration method. The proposed framework is designed to efficiently handle both the classical and fractional forms of the equation, providing fast-convergent and highly accurate approximate solutions. To capture memory effects and nonlocal features more realistically, the Atangana–Baleanu fractional derivative in the Caputo sense is incorporated into the model. A rigorous convergence analysis is conducted, establishing sufficient conditions to ensure the stability, reliability, and accuracy of the iterative solutions. The performance of the method is assessed through a setiries of numerical experiments supported by graphical illustrations and tables of absolute error values, which collectively confirm the method’s superior accuracy and rapid convergence when compared with standard analytical approaches. Additionally, a detailed stability study of the fractional solutions is carried out and clearly verified through analytical arguments and numerical simulations. The results demonstrate that the combined Yasser–Jassim transform and variational iteration method offer a versatile and powerful tool for solving fractional-order partial differential equations. Beyond the Swift–Hohenberg equation, the proposed approach can be extended to a wide range of mathematical models, including nonlinear ordinary differential equations and integro-differential systems. Overall, the findings highlight the potential of this hybrid scheme to advance analytical methodologies within fractional calculus and nonlinear dynamical systems.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1319/v3?src=rss">Workload Assessment of Technical Staff in a Clinical Laboratory in South India. [version 3; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Clinical laboratories play a significant role in healthcare, providing tests for diagnosis and treatment monitoring. Having skilled and adequate staffing is crucial for clinical laboratories to operate efficiently, manage their workload effectively, and deliver timely results. Despite being critical for healthcare delivery, ensuring adequate staffing levels in clinical laboratories remains a complex challenge for healthcare providers worldwide due to resource constraints and workforce shortages. Methods This study evaluates the workload in clinical laboratory staff using Workload Indicators of Staffing Need (WISN) method, focusing on workload, work pressure, and staffing requirements to optimize staffing levels and ensure an efficient clinical laboratory environment. Annual clinical laboratory data from June 2021 to May 2023 were collected to calculate the average number of days (234) worked annually, percentage of workload, distribution of activity time measurement units, and the ratio of needed, surplus, and existing staff (n=33, complete enumeration) from the laboratory registers and hospital statistics. WISN software was used to calculate staffing requirements, workload pressure, and WISN ratio. The Shapiro–Wilk test assessed normality and the Kruskal–Wallis test evaluated differences across clinical laboratory sections. Result A total of 33 technical staff employed, performed approximately 3.7 million tests across hematology and clinical pathology during the study period, WISN ratios ranged from 0.2 to 0.7, indicating the existing 33 staff members face a high workload burden. The calculated ideal staffing level was 46.33 personnel, indicating a shortfall of 13.3 staff (28.3%). A p < 0.01 confirmed a significant disparity in workload distribution. Conclusion The results highlight the importance of optimizing staffing levels in clinical laboratories to ensure quality service delivery. The WISN methodology can be a useful tool in healthcare facilities for making evidence-based staff allocation, maximizing the utilization of employee skill sets, and establishing standard staffing benchmarks tailored to the needs of clinical laboratories.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/13-1368/v2?src=rss">Performance of Forensic Age Estimation by Aspartic Acid Racemization and DNA Methylation: A Systematic Review [version 2; peer review: 2 approved with reservations]</a></h4>

              
                Background Forensic age estimation is not difficult when the body is found in good condition, but in cases of severe decomposition or damage, such as burnt or separated body parts, then the analysis can only be done with bones and teeth. There has been abundant research and development in the field of related biochemistry over the years. Various molecular changes occur in hard tissues and long-lived proteins, such as those in bones and teeth during the physiological process of aging. Aspartic acid racemization and DNA methylation are still the most frequently used age estimation methods because of their advantages in accuracy. Method This study aimed to compare the accuracy of DNA methylation and aspartic acid racemization methods for age estimation. Journal articles were searched in the electronic databases PubMed, Scopus, and Semantic Scholar of 2017-2022 according to PRISMA guidelines. Result Twelve journal articles were eligible for review. The DNA methylation method is quite simple to use because of commercially available methylation kits. Furthermore, the results can be obtained relatively quickly without requiring many samples, and the method is less sensitive to thermal and other damage than the aspartic acid racemization method. Conclusion The aspartic acid racemization method for age estimation has high accuracy, especially in determining age at death. However, temperature and the condition of the teeth affect the racemization of aspartic acid. Given that DNA methylation is generally stable in a wide range of temperatures, it provides a better approach to determining the chronological age even from charred remains.

                Shirasaka et al. show that the Cardiovirus-derived protein VPg functions as an interferon-γ receptor agonist, activating its canonical signaling cascade that sensitizes cells to TNF-α-triggered cell death. This synergistic cell death reduces virus load, revealing a non-canonical role of VPg in modulating host antiviral responses.
