              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Targeting A-kinase anchoring protein 12 phosphorylation in hepatic stellate cells regulates liver injury and fibrosis in mouse models</a></h4>

              
                Trans-differentiation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) to activated state potentiates liver fibrosis through release of extracellular matrix (ECM) components, distorting the liver architecture. Since limited antifibrotics are available, pharmacological intervention targeting activated HSCs may be considered for therapy. A-kinase anchoring protein 12 (AKAP12) is a scaffolding protein that directs protein kinases A/C (PKA/PKC) and cyclins to specific locations spatiotemporally controlling their biological effects. It has been shown that AKAP12’s scaffolding functions are altered by phosphorylation. In previously published work, observed an association between AKAP12 phosphorylation and HSC activation. In this work, we demonstrate that AKAP12’s scaffolding activity toward the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident collagen chaperone, heat-shock protein 47 (HSP47) is strongly inhibited by AKAP12’s site-specific phosphorylation in activated HSCs. CRISPR-directed gene editing of AKAP12’s phospho-sites restores its scaffolding toward HSP47, inhibiting HSP47’s collagen maturation functions, and HSC activation. AKAP12 phospho-editing dramatically inhibits fibrosis, ER stress response, HSC inflammatory signaling, and liver injury in mice. Our overall findings suggest a pro-fibrogenic role of AKAP12 phosphorylation that may be targeted for therapeutic intervention in liver fibrosis.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Experimental evidence that group size generates divergent benefits of cooperative breeding for male and female ostriches</a></h4>

              
                Cooperative breeding allows the costs of parental care to be shared, but as groups become larger, such benefits often decline as competition increases and group cohesion breaks down. The counteracting forces of cooperation and competition are predicted to select for an optimal group size, but variation in groups is ubiquitous across cooperative breeding animals. Here, we experimentally test if group sizes vary because of sex differences in the costs and benefits of cooperative breeding in captive ostriches, <i>Struthio camelus,</i> and compare this to the distribution of group sizes in the wild. We established 96 groups with different numbers of males (1 or 3) and females (1, 3, 4, or 6) and manipulated opportunities for cooperation over incubation. There was a clear optimal group size for males (one male with four or more females) that was explained by high costs of competition and negligible benefits of cooperation. Conversely, female reproductive success was maximised across a range of group sizes due to the benefits of cooperation with male and female group members. Reproductive success in intermediate sized groups was low for both males and females due to sexual conflict over the timing of mating and incubation. Our experiments show that sex differences in cooperation and competition can explain group size variation in cooperative breeders.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The Drosophila ZAD zinc finger protein Kipferl guides Rhino to piRNA clusters</a></h4>

              
                RNA interference systems depend on the synthesis of small RNA precursors whose sequences define the target spectrum of these silencing pathways. The <i>Drosophila</i> Heterochromatin Protein 1 (HP1) variant Rhino permits transcription of PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) precursors within transposon-rich heterochromatic loci in germline cells. Current models propose that Rhino’s specific chromatin occupancy at piRNA source loci is determined by histone marks and maternally inherited piRNAs, but also imply the existence of other, undiscovered specificity cues. Here, we identify a member of the diverse family of zinc finger associated domain (ZAD)-C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> zinc finger proteins, Kipferl, as critical Rhino cofactor in ovaries. By binding to guanosine-rich DNA motifs and interacting with the Rhino chromodomain, Kipferl recruits Rhino to specific loci and stabilizes it on chromatin. In <i>kipferl</i> mutant flies, Rhino is lost from most of its target chromatin loci and instead accumulates on pericentromeric Satellite arrays, resulting in decreased levels of transposon targeting piRNAs and impaired fertility. Our findings reveal that DNA sequence, in addition to the H3K9me3 mark, determines the identity of piRNA source loci and provide insight into how Rhino might be caught in the crossfire of genetic conflicts.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A shared neural code for social interaction encoding and memory in the human superior temporal sulcus</a></h4>

              
                Recognizing and remembering social information is a crucial cognitive skill. Neural patterns in the superior temporal sulcus (STS) support our ability to perceive others' social interactions. However, despite the prominence of social interactions in memory, the neural basis of retrieving social interactions is still unknown. To fill this gap, we investigated the brain mechanisms underlying memory of others' social interactions during free spoken recall of a naturalistic movie. By applying machine learning-based fMRI encoding analyses to densely labeled movie and recall data we found that STS activity patterns evoked by viewing social interactions predicted neural responses to social interaction memories. This finding suggests that the STS contains high-level conceptual, representations of social interactions, and its reactivation underlies our ability to remember others' interactions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Estrogen receptor beta in the central amygdala regulates the deleterious behavioral and neuronal consequences of repeated social stress in female rats</a></h4>

              
                While over 95% of the population has reported experiencing extreme stress or trauma, females of reproductive age develop stress-induced neuropsychiatric disorders at twice the rate of males. This suggests that ovarian hormones may facilitate neural processes that increase stress susceptibility and underlie the heightened rates of these disorders, like depression and anxiety, that result from stress exposure in females. However, there is contradicting evidence in the literature regarding estrogen's role in stress-related behavioral outcomes. Estrogen signaling through estrogen receptor beta (ERb) has been traditionally thought of as anxiolytic, but recent studies suggest estrogen exhibits distinct effects in the context of stress. Furthermore, ERb is found abundantly in many stress-sensitive brain loci, including the central amygdala (CeA), in which transcription of the vital stress hormone, corticotropin releasing factor (CRF), can be regulated by an estrogen response element. Therefore, these experiments sought to identify the role of CeA ERb activity during stress on behavioral outcomes in naturally cycling, adult, female Sprague-Dawley rats. Rats were exposed to an ethological model of vicarious social stress, witness stress (WS), in which they experienced the sensory and psychological aspects of an aggressive social defeat encounter between two males. Following stress, rats exhibited stress-induced anxiety-like behaviors in the marble burying task, and, finally, brain analysis revealed increased ERb and CRF specifically within the CeA following exposure to stress cues. Subsequent experiments were designed to target this receptor in the CeA using microinjections of the ERb antagonist, PHTPP, prior to each stress session. Sucrose preference, acoustic startle, and marble burying tasks determined that blocking ERb in the CeA during WS prevented the development of depressive-,anxiety-like, and hypervigilant behaviors. Additionally, brain analysis revealed a long-term decrease of intra-CeA CRF expression in PHTPP-treated rats. These experiments indicate that ERb signaling in the CeA, through its effects on CRF, contributes to the development of negative valence behaviors that result from exposure to repeated social stress in female rats.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Strike different neural notes at distinct stages: An integrative process of attention modulation in naturalistic speech</a></h4>

              
                When we are following someone when there are multiple speakers, are we just paying attention to the sound the speaker makes, the word the speaker uses, or are we aligning our minds to the attended speaker? In this process, selective attention plays a critical role. Previous studies have mainly focused on attention modulation on the single types of features from the speaker. However, attending to a speaker needs an integrative process: the sound waves, which represent acoustic features, should be heard; the meaning of the text, which represents semantic features, needs to be understood; listeners and speakers need to form a common grounding during the process, which represent the inter-brain feature. We still do not know how our brain entrains different types of features from the speaker in an integrative way. In this study, naturalistic speech was adopted to explore attention modulation. The natural language processing models and the flourishing inter-brain recording methods were adopted to qualify the different types of information from the speaker. Our study revealed that attention modulated the acoustic, semantic, and speaker's neural activity in an integrative way. When the listener pays attention to a speaker, the sound is the first to be processed: The neural activity in the theta band entrains the acoustic feature with a latency of 200~350 ms. Then, the meaning of the attended speech is parsed: the delta band modulates the attention with a latency of 200~600 ms. The listener entrains the speaker's neural activity 5 seconds before the speech onset. The entrainment of the acoustic feature and the semantic feature is correlated with each other. Only the entrainment of the attended speaker has a significant negative correlation with the comprehension score. Together, these results illustrate an integrative view of how our brain is selectively entrained to different types of information from the speaker.

	<p>Blast-induced traumatic brain injury (bTBI) frequently results in sleep-wake disturbances. However, limited studies have investigated the molecular signaling mechanisms underlying these sleep disturbances, and potentially efficacious therapies are lacking. We investigated the levels of melatonin and genes involved in melatonin synthesis pathway in the pineal glands of Sprague Dawley rats exposed to single and tightly coupled repeated blasts during the night and daytime. Rats were exposed to single and tightly coupled repeated blasts using an advanced blast simulator. The plasma, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and pineal gland were collected at 6 h, 24 h, or 1 month postblast at two different time points: one during the day (1000 h) and one at night (2200 h). Differential expressions of genes involved in pineal melatonin synthesis were quantified using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Plasma and CSF melatonin levels were assessed using a commercial melatonin ELISA kit. The plasma and CSF melatonin levels showed statistically significant decreases at 6 h and 24 h in the blast-exposed rats euthanized in the night (in dim light), with no significant alterations noted in rats euthanized in the morning (daylight) at all three-time points. Blast-exposed rats showed statistically significant decreases in Tph1, Aanat, Asmt, and Mtnr1b mRNA levels, along with increased Tph2 mRNA, in the pineal gland samples collected at night at 6 h and 24 h. No significant changes in the mRNA levels of these genes were noted at 1 month. These findings imply that the melatonin circadian rhythm is disrupted following blast exposure, which may be a factor in the sleep disturbances that blast victims frequently experience.</p>

                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>What we see is intimately linked to how we actively and systematically explore the world through eye movements. However, it is unknown to what degree visual experience during early development is necessary for such systematic visual exploration to emerge. The present study investigated visual exploration behavior in 10 human participants whose sight had been restored only in childhood or adulthood, after a period of congenital blindness because of dense bilateral congenital cataracts. Participants freely explored real-world images while their eye movements were recorded. Despite severe residual visual impairments and gaze instability (nystagmus), visual exploration patterns were preserved in individuals with reversed congenital cataract. Modeling analyses indicated that, similar to healthy control subjects, visual exploration in individuals with reversed congenital cataract was based on the low-level (luminance contrast) and high-level (object components) visual content of the images. Moreover, participants used visual short-term memory representations for narrowing down the exploration space. More systematic visual exploration in individuals with reversed congenital cataract was associated with better object recognition, suggesting that active vision might be a driving force for visual system development and recovery. The present results argue against a sensitive period for the development of neural mechanisms associated with visual exploration.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">How Do Spike Collisions Affect Spike Sorting Performance?</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Recently, a new generation of devices have been developed to record neural activity simultaneously from hundreds of electrodes with a very high spatial density, both for <I>in vitro</I> and <I>in vivo</I> applications. While these advances enable to record from many more cells, they also challenge the already complicated process of spike sorting (i.e., extracting isolated single-neuron activity from extracellular signals). In this work, we used synthetic ground-truth recordings with controlled levels of correlations among neurons to quantitatively benchmark the performance of state-of-the-art spike sorters focusing specifically on spike collisions. Our results show that while modern template-matching-based algorithms are more accurate than density-based approaches, all methods, to some extent, failed to detect synchronous spike events of neurons with similar extracellular signals. Interestingly, the performance of the sorters is not largely affected by the spiking activity in the recordings, with respect to average firing rates and spike-train correlation levels. Since the performances of all modern spike sorting algorithms can be affected as function of the activity of the recorded neurons, scientific claims on correlations and synchrony should be carefully assessed based on the analysis provided in this paper.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://www.eneuro.org/rss/current.xml">Sound-Evoked Responses of Distinct Neuron Classes from the Tail of the Striatum</a></h4>

              
                <sec><st>Abstract</st>
<p>Given its inputs from auditory structures and neuromodulatory systems, the posterior tail of the striatum is ideally positioned to influence behavioral responses to acoustic stimuli according to context and previous rewards. Results from previous studies indicate that neurons in this striatal region display selective responses to sounds. However, it is not clear whether different striatal cell classes code for distinct features of sounds or how different striatal output pathways may use acoustic information to guide behavior. Here we compared the sound-evoked responses of posterior striatal neurons that form the striatal direct pathway (and express the dopamine receptor D<SUB>1</SUB>) to the responses of neighboring neurons in naive mice. We achieved this via optogenetic photo-identification of D<SUB>1</SUB>-expressing neurons during extracellular electrophysiological recordings in awake head-fixed mice of both sexes. We found that the frequency tuning of sound-responsive direct-pathway striatal neurons is comparable with that of their sound-responsive neighbors. Moreover, we found that both populations encode amplitude-modulated sounds in a similar fashion. These results suggest that different classes of neurons in the posterior striatum of naive animals have similar access to acoustic features conveyed by the auditory system even outside the context of an auditory task.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">Case Report: Case report: Non-invasive mechanical ventilation in combination with bronchoscopy in the treatment of respiratory failure of lung cancer patient. [version 1; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Respiratory failure (RF) is a common medical problem among cancer patients. Particularly active or ex-smokers diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or lung cancer may develop severe hypoxemic and hypercapnic respiratory failure. Moreover, pneumonitis as a complication of the currently widely used immunotherapy of various cancers, may cause respiratory disorders requiring ventilation support. Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) is recommended as the first-line treatment for this type of respiratory failure and reduces the need for endotracheal intubation. Case presentation: We present a case report of lung cancer patient, who received NIV in the treatment of RF due to an infectious exacerbation of COPD. In addition, NIV enabled assisted flexible bronchoscopy (NIV-FB) to be performed. During the procedure tumor samples were collected for further molecular diagnosis of lung cancer. Improvement of the patient general condition and quality of life was also achieved. Conclusions: NIV can be used at any stage of oncological management in patients with lung cancer. It can also be implemented during endoscopic procedures of the respiratory system, as well as support in palliative care of patients with lung cancer at the end of life. Further studies should evaluate the use of NIV in conjunction with various oncological treatments and identify the exact contradictions for BF with NIV support in advanced cancer patients with RF.

                Background: Routine Outcome Monitoring (ROM) systems have been used to monitor how a client’s life changes over the course of therapy. However, if a ROM system is to be used, the system should have sufficient construct validity to warrant its usage. In the current study we sought to test the construct of the “individual problems and strengths” (IPS) measurement scale, a sub-section of the “Systemic Therapy Inventory of Change” (STIC). Methods: We used a factorial construct validation procedure utilizing a stepwise confirmatory factor analysis approach on a sample of 841 clients of couple and family therapy. Results: We found support for the original “8-factor” version of the IPS but failed to find support for the “1-factor” version and the “higher order factor structure”. Conclusions: The investigation uncovered that the measurement tool is still under development and since the factorial construct (and the scale-reliability) was only supported for the original "8-factor" model, we encourage a pause in administering the IPS in clinical practice.

                Background: Prenatal growth retardation may increase the risk of later chronic non-communicable diseases (NCDs), including diabetes; however, long-term effects of wasting malnutrition in childhood or adulthood are less studied. Pancreatic exocrine and endocrine functions, both critical for nutrition and NCD aetiology, may not fully recover following malnutrition. However, the evidence and mechanistic information is piecemeal. We hypothesise that wasting malnutrition at any age has long-term detrimental effects on endocrine and exocrine pancreatic structure and function. Methods: The SAMPA international research programme will assess pancreatic structure and function in 3700 participants from ongoing observational nutrition cohorts, two adolescent and four adult, in Zambia, Tanzania, Philippines, and India. Pancreas size, structure, and calcification will be assessed by ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) scan; exocrine function by faecal elastase and serum lipase; and endocrine function by haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and blood glucose, insulin and C-peptide concentrations during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). In-depth hormonal analyses of incretins, glucagon, proinsulin and trypsinogen during OGTT and intravenous glucose tolerance tests will be done in subsets of adult participants. Pancreatic size and function outcomes will be compared between people with and without prior wasting malnutrition. Analyses will investigate effect modification by sex, current age, time since malnutrition, current body mass index and dietary patterns. Mathematical modelling of OGTT data will be used to estimate the relative contribution to glucose dysregulation of decreased insulin production, changes in insulin clearance and increased insulin resistance. Proinsulin/insulin ratio will be analysed in archived samples from the Tanzanian cohort using a nested case-control design to investigate whether abnormal values precede diabetes. Conclusions: SAMPA, a large-scale multi-centre research programme using data from people with or without prior wasting malnutrition to assess several aspects of pancreatic phenotype, will provide coherent evidence for future policies and programmes for malnutrition and diabetes.

While normative reinforcement learning models are critically dependent on external feedback, recent findings in the field of perceptual learning point to a crucial role of internally-generated reinforcement signals based on subjective confidence, when external feedback is not available. Here, we investigated the existence of such confidence-based learning signals in a key domain of reinforcement-based learning: instrumental conditioning. We conducted a value-based decision making experiment which included phases with and without external feedback and in which participants reported their confidence in addition to choices. Behaviorally, we found signatures of self-reinforcement in phases without feedback, reflected in an increase of subjective confidence and choice consistency. To clarify the mechanistic role of confidence in value-based learning, we compared a family of confidence-based learning models with more standard models predicting either no change in value estimates or a devaluation over time when no external reward is provided. We found that confidence-based models indeed outperformed these reference models, whereby the learning signal of the winning model was based on the prediction error between current confidence and a stimulus-unspecific average of previous confidence levels. Interestingly, individuals with more volatile reward-based value updates in the presence of feedback also showed more volatile confidence-based value updates when feedback was not available. Together, our results provide evidence that confidence-based learning signals affect instrumentally learned subjective values in the absence of external feedback.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">mPPases create a conserved anionic membrane fingerprint as identified via multi-scale simulations</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Alexandra O. M. Holmes, Adrian Goldman, Antreas C. Kalli</p>

Membrane-integral pyrophosphatases (mPPases) are membrane-bound enzymes responsible for hydrolysing inorganic pyrophosphate and translocating a cation across the membrane. Their function is essential for the infectivity of clinically relevant protozoan parasites and plant maturation. Recent developments have indicated that their mechanism is more complicated than previously thought and that the membrane environment may be important for their function. In this work, we use multiscale molecular dynamics simulations to demonstrate for the first time that mPPases form specific anionic lipid interactions at 4 sites at the distal and interfacial regions of the protein. These interactions are conserved in simulations of the mPPases from <i>Thermotoga maritima</i>, <i>Vigna radiata</i> and <i>Clostridium leptum</i> and characterised by interactions with positive residues on helices 1, 2, 3 and 4 for the distal site, or 9, 10, 13 and 14 for the interfacial site. Due to the importance of these helices in protein stability and function, these lipid interactions may play a crucial role in the mPPase mechanism and enable future structural and functional studies.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Fast and interpretable consensus clustering via minipatch learning</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Luqin Gan, Genevera I. Allen</p>

Consensus clustering has been widely used in bioinformatics and other applications to improve the accuracy, stability and reliability of clustering results. This approach ensembles cluster co-occurrences from multiple clustering runs on subsampled observations. For application to large-scale bioinformatics data, such as to discover cell types from single-cell sequencing data, for example, consensus clustering has two significant drawbacks: (i) computational inefficiency due to repeatedly applying clustering algorithms, and (ii) lack of interpretability into the important features for differentiating clusters. In this paper, we address these two challenges by developing IMPACC: Interpretable MiniPatch Adaptive Consensus Clustering. Our approach adopts three major innovations. We ensemble cluster co-occurrences from tiny subsets of both observations and features, termed minipatches, thus dramatically reducing computation time. Additionally, we develop adaptive sampling schemes for observations, which result in both improved reliability and computational savings, as well as adaptive sampling schemes of features, which lead to interpretable solutions by quickly learning the most relevant features that differentiate clusters. We study our approach on synthetic data and a variety of real large-scale bioinformatics data sets; results show that our approach not only yields more accurate and interpretable cluster solutions, but it also substantially improves computational efficiency compared to standard consensus clustering approaches.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Variant calling enhances the identification of cancer cells in single-cell RNA sequencing data</a></h4>

              
                <p>by William Gasper, Francesca Rossi, Matteo Ligorio, Dario Ghersi</p>

Single-cell RNA-sequencing is an invaluable research tool that allows for the investigation of gene expression in heterogeneous cancer cell populations in ways that bulk RNA-seq cannot. However, normal (i.e., non tumor) cells in cancer samples have the potential to confound the downstream analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data. Existing methods for identifying cancer and normal cells include copy number variation inference, marker-gene expression analysis, and expression-based clustering. This work aims to extend the existing approaches for identifying cancer cells in single-cell RNA-seq samples by incorporating variant calling and the identification of putative driver alterations. We found that putative driver alterations can be detected in single-cell RNA-seq data obtained with full-length transcript technologies and noticed that a subset of cells in tumor samples are enriched for putative driver alterations as compared to normal cells. Furthermore, we show that the number of putative driver alterations and inferred copy number variation are not correlated in all samples. Taken together, our findings suggest that augmenting existing cancer-cell filtering methods with variant calling and analysis can increase the number of tumor cells that can be confidently included in downstream analyses of single-cell full-length transcript RNA-seq datasets.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Cross-scale excitability in networks of quadratic integrate-and-fire neurons</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Daniele Avitabile, Mathieu Desroches, G. Bard Ermentrout</p>

From the action potentials of neurons and cardiac cells to the amplification of calcium signals in oocytes, excitability is a hallmark of many biological signalling processes. In recent years, excitability in single cells has been related to multiple-timescale dynamics through <i>canards</i>, special solutions which determine the effective thresholds of the all-or-none responses. However, the emergence of excitability in large populations remains an open problem. Here, we show that the mechanism of excitability in large networks and mean-field descriptions of coupled quadratic integrate-and-fire (QIF) cells mirrors that of the individual components. We initially exploit the Ott-Antonsen ansatz to derive low-dimensional dynamics for the coupled network and use it to describe the structure of canards via slow periodic forcing. We demonstrate that the thresholds for onset and offset of population firing can be found in the same way as those of the single cell. We combine theoretical analysis and numerical computations to develop a novel and comprehensive framework for excitability in large populations, applicable not only to models amenable to Ott-Antonsen reduction, but also to networks without a closed-form mean-field limit, in particular sparse networks.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Density-dependent effects are the main determinants of variation in growth dynamics between closely related bacterial strains</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Sabrin Hilau, Sophia Katz, Tanya Wasserman, Ruth Hershberg, Yonatan Savir</p>

Although closely related, bacterial strains from the same species show significant diversity in their growth and death dynamics. Yet, our understanding of the relationship between the kinetic parameters that dictate these dynamics is still lacking. Here, we measured the growth and death dynamics of 11 strains of <i>Escherichia coli</i> originating from different hosts and show that the growth patterns are clustered into three major classes with typical growth rates, maximal fold change, and death rates. To infer the underlying phenotypic parameters that govern the dynamics, we developed a phenomenological mathematical model that accounts not only for growth rate and its dependence on resource availability, but also for death rates and density-dependent growth inhibition. We show that density-dependent growth is essential for capturing the variability in growth dynamics between the strains. Indeed, the main parameter determining the dynamics is the typical density at which they slow down their growth, rather than the maximal growth rate or death rate. Moreover, we show that the phenotypic landscape resides within a two-dimensional plane spanned by resource utilization efficiency, death rate, and density-dependent growth inhibition. In this phenotypic plane, we identify three clusters that correspond to the growth pattern classes. Overall, our results reveal the tradeoffs between growth parameters that constrain bacterial adaptation.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Modulation of working memory duration by synaptic and astrocytic mechanisms</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Sophia Becker, Andreas Nold, Tatjana Tchumatchenko</p>

Short-term synaptic plasticity and modulations of the presynaptic vesicle release rate are key components of many working memory models. At the same time, an increasing number of studies suggests a potential role of astrocytes in modulating higher cognitive function such as WM through their influence on synaptic transmission. Which influence astrocytic signaling could have on the stability and duration of WM representations, however, is still unclear. Here, we introduce a slow, activity-dependent astrocytic regulation of the presynaptic release probability in a synaptic attractor model of WM. We compare and analyze simulations of a simple WM protocol in firing rate and spiking networks with and without astrocytic regulation, and underpin our observations with analyses of the phase space dynamics in the rate network. We find that the duration and stability of working memory representations are altered by astrocytic signaling and by noise. We show that astrocytic signaling modulates the mean duration of WM representations. Moreover, if the astrocytic regulation is strong, a slow presynaptic timescale introduces a ‘window of vulnerability’, during which WM representations are easily disruptable by noise before being stabilized. We identify two mechanisms through which noise from different sources in the network can either stabilize or destabilize WM representations. Our findings suggest that (i) astrocytic regulation can act as a crucial determinant for the duration of WM representations in synaptic attractor models of WM, and (ii) that astrocytic signaling could facilitate different mechanisms for volitional top-down control of WM representations and their duration.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Magnitude-sensitive reaction times reveal non-linear time costs in multi-alternative decision-making</a></h4>

              
                <p>by James A. R. Marshall, Andreagiovanni Reina, Célia Hay, Audrey Dussutour, Angelo Pirrone</p>

Optimality analysis of value-based decisions in binary and multi-alternative choice settings predicts that reaction times should be sensitive only to differences in stimulus magnitudes, but not to overall absolute stimulus magnitude. Yet experimental work in the binary case has shown magnitude sensitive reaction times, and theory shows that this can be explained by switching from linear to multiplicative time costs, but also by nonlinear subjective utility. Thus disentangling explanations for observed magnitude sensitive reaction times is difficult. Here for the first time we extend the theoretical analysis of geometric time-discounting to ternary choices, and present novel experimental evidence for magnitude-sensitivity in such decisions, in both humans and slime moulds. We consider the optimal policies for all possible combinations of linear and geometric time costs, and linear and nonlinear utility; interestingly, geometric discounting emerges as the predominant explanation for magnitude sensitivity.

Data clustering plays a significant role in biomedical sciences, particularly in single-cell data analysis. Researchers use clustering algorithms to group individual cells into populations that can be evaluated across different levels of disease progression, drug response, and other clinical statuses. In many cases, multiple sets of clusters must be generated to assess varying levels of cluster specificity. For example, there are many subtypes of leukocytes (e.g. T cells), whose individual preponderance and phenotype must be assessed for statistical/functional significance. In this report, we introduce a novel hierarchical density clustering algorithm (HAL-x) that uses supervised linkage methods to build a cluster hierarchy on raw single-cell data. With this new approach, HAL-x can quickly predict multiple sets of labels for immense datasets, achieving a considerable improvement in computational efficiency on large datasets compared to existing methods. We also show that cell clusters generated by HAL-x yield near-perfect F1-scores when classifying different clinical statuses based on single-cell profiles. Our hierarchical density clustering algorithm achieves high accuracy in single cell classification in a scalable, tunable and rapid manner.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A fibrin enhanced thrombosis model for medical devices operating at low shear regimes or large surface areas</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Rodrigo Méndez Rojano, Angela Lai, Mansur Zhussupbekov, Greg W. Burgreen, Keith Cook, James F. Antaki</p>

Over the past decade, much of the development of computational models of device-related thrombosis has focused on platelet activity. While those models have been successful in predicting thrombus formation in medical devices operating at high shear rates (> 5000 s<sup>−1</sup>), they cannot be directly applied to low-shear devices, such as blood oxygenators and catheters, where emerging information suggest that fibrin formation is the predominant mechanism of clotting and platelet activity plays a secondary role. In the current work, we augment an existing platelet-based model of thrombosis with a partial model of the coagulation cascade that includes contact activation of factor XII and fibrin production. To calibrate the model, we simulate a backward-facing-step flow channel that has been extensively characterized in-vitro. Next, we perform blood perfusion experiments through a microfluidic chamber mimicking a hollow fiber membrane oxygenator and validate the model against these observations. The simulation results closely match the time evolution of the thrombus height and length in the backward-facing-step experiment. Application of the model to the microfluidic hollow fiber bundle chamber capture both gross features such as the increasing clotting trend towards the outlet of the chamber, as well as finer local features such as the structure of fibrin around individual hollow fibers. Our results are in line with recent findings that suggest fibrin production, through contact activation of factor XII, drives the thrombus formation in medical devices operating at low shear rates with large surface area to volume ratios.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Spatial models of pattern formation during phagocytosis</a></h4>

              
                <p>by John Cody Herron, Shiqiong Hu, Bei Liu, Takashi Watanabe, Klaus M. Hahn, Timothy C. Elston</p>

Phagocytosis, the biological process in which cells ingest large particles such as bacteria, is a key component of the innate immune response. Fcγ receptor (FcγR)-mediated phagocytosis is initiated when these receptors are activated after binding immunoglobulin G (IgG). Receptor activation initiates a signaling cascade that leads to the formation of the phagocytic cup and culminates with ingestion of the foreign particle. In the experimental system termed “frustrated phagocytosis”, cells attempt to internalize micropatterned disks of IgG. Cells that engage in frustrated phagocytosis form “rosettes” of actin-enriched structures called podosomes around the IgG disk. The mechanism that generates the rosette pattern is unknown. We present data that supports the involvement of Cdc42, a member of the Rho family of GTPases, in pattern formation. Cdc42 acts downstream of receptor activation, upstream of actin polymerization, and is known to play a role in polarity establishment. Reaction-diffusion models for GTPase spatiotemporal dynamics exist. We demonstrate how the addition of negative feedback and minor changes to these models can generate the experimentally observed rosette pattern of podosomes. We show that this pattern formation can occur through two general mechanisms. In the first mechanism, an intermediate species forms a ring of high activity around the IgG disk, which then promotes rosette organization. The second mechanism does not require initial ring formation but relies on spatial gradients of intermediate chemical species that are selectively activated over the IgG patch. Finally, we analyze the models to suggest experiments to test their validity.

Heliorhodopsin, a retinal-binding membrane protein, has been recently discovered, however its function remains unknown. Herein, we investigated the relationship between <i>Actinobacteria bacterium</i> IMCC26103 heliorhodopsin (AbHeR) and an adjacent glutamine synthetase (AbGS) in the same operon. We demonstrate that AbHeR binds to AbGS and regulates AbGS activity. More specifically, the dissociation constant (K<sub>d</sub>) value of the binding between AbHeR and AbGS is 6.06 μM. Moreover, the absence of positively charged residues within the intracellular loop of AbHeR impacted K<sub>d</sub> value as they serve as critical binding sites for AbGS. We also confirm that AbHeR up-regulates the biosynthetic enzyme activity of AbGS both in vitro and in vivo in the presence of light. GS is a key enzyme involved in nitrogen assimilation that catalyzes the conversion of glutamate and ammonia to glutamine. Hence, the interaction between AbHeR and AbGS may be critical for nitrogen assimilation in <i>Actinobacteria bacterium</i> IMCC26103 as it survives in low-nutrient environments. Overall, the findings of our study describe, for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, a novel function of heliorhodopsin as a regulatory rhodopsin with the capacity to bind and regulate enzyme activity required for nitrogen assimilation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A novel lineage of the Capra genus discovered in the Taurus Mountains of Turkey using ancient genomics</a></h4>

              
                Direkli Cave, located in the Taurus Mountains of southern Turkey, was occupied by Late Epipaleolithic hunters-gatherers for the seasonal hunting and processing of game including large numbers of wild goats. We report genomic data from new and published <i>Capra</i> specimens from Direkli Cave and, supplemented with historic genomes from multiple <i>Capra</i> species, find a novel lineage best represented by a ~14,000 year old 2.59 X genome sequenced from specimen Direkli4. This newly discovered <i>Capra</i> lineage is a sister clade to the Caucasian tur species (<i>Capra cylindricornis</i> and <i>Capra caucasica</i>), both now limited to the Caucasus region. We identify genomic regions introgressed in domestic goats with high affinity to Direkli4, and find that West Eurasian domestic goats in the past, but not those today, appear enriched for Direkli4-specific alleles at a genome-wide level. This forgotten ‘Taurasian tur’ likely survived Late Pleistocene climatic change in a Taurus Mountain refuge and its genomic fate is unknown.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Molecular mechanism of active Cas7-11 in processing CRISPR RNA and interfering target RNA</a></h4>

              
                Cas7-11 is a Type III-E CRISPR Cas effector that confers programmable RNA cleavage and has potential applications in RNA interference. Cas7-11 encodes a single polypeptide containing four Cas7- and one Cas11-like segments that obscures the distinction between the multi-subunit Class 1 and the single-subunit Class-2 CRISPR-Cas systems. We report a cryo-EM structure of the active Cas7-11 from <i>Desulfonema ishimotonii</i> (DiCas7-11) that reveals the molecular basis for RNA processing and interference activities. DiCas7-11 arranges its Cas7- and Cas11-like domains in an extended form that resembles the backbone made up by four Cas7 and one Cas11 subunits in the multi-subunit enzymes. Unlike the multi-subunit enzymes, however, the backbone of DiCas7-11 contains evolutionarily different Cas7 and Cas11 domains, giving rise to their unique functionality. The first Cas7-like domain nearly engulfs the last 15 direct repeat nucleotides in processing and recognition of the CRISPR RNA, and its free-standing fragment retains most of the activity. Both the second and the third Cas7-like domains mediate target RNA cleavage in a metal-dependent manner. The structure and mutational data indicate that the long variable insertion to the fourth Cas7 domain has little impact to RNA processing or targeting, suggesting the possibility for engineering a compact and programmable RNA interference tool.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">RNA-binding protein Elavl1/HuR is required for maintenance of cranial neural crest specification</a></h4>

              
                While neural crest development is known to be transcriptionally controlled via sequential activation of gene regulatory networks (GRNs), recent evidence increasingly implicates a role for post-transcriptional regulation in modulating the output of these regulatory circuits. Using available single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets from avian embryos to identify potential post-transcriptional regulators, we found that <i>Elavl1</i>, which encodes for an RNA-binding protein with roles in transcript stability, was enriched in the premigratory cranial neural crest. Perturbation of Elavl1 resulted in premature neural crest delamination from the neural tube as well as significant reduction in transcripts associated with the neural crest specification GRN, phenotypes that are also observed with downregulation of the canonical Wnt inhibitor <i>Draxin</i>. That <i>Draxin</i> is the primary target for stabilization by Elavl1 during cranial neural crest specification was shown by RNA-sequencing, RNA immunoprecipitation, RNA decay measurement, and proximity ligation assays, further supporting the idea that the downregulation of neural crest specifier expression upon Elavl1 knockdown was largely due to loss of <i>Draxin</i>. Importantly, exogenous <i>Draxin</i> rescued cranial neural crest specification defects observed with Elavl1 knockdown. Thus, Elavl1 plays a critical a role in the maintenance of cranial neural crest specification via <i>Draxin</i> mRNA stabilization. Together, these data highlight an important intersection of post-transcriptional regulation with modulation of the neural crest specification GRN.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The transcription factor Bach2 negatively regulates murine natural killer cell maturation and function</a></h4>

              
                BTB domain And CNC Homolog 2 (Bach2) is a transcription repressor that actively participates in T and B lymphocyte development, but it is unknown if Bach2 is also involved in the development of innate immune cells, such as natural killer (NK) cells. Here, we followed the expression of Bach2 during murine NK cell development, finding that it peaked in immature CD27<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> cells and decreased upon further maturation. Bach2 showed an organ and tissue-specific expression pattern in NK cells. Bach2 expression positively correlated with the expression of transcription factor TCF1 and negatively correlated with genes encoding NK effector molecules and those involved in the cell cycle. Lack of Bach2 expression caused changes in chromatin accessibility of corresponding genes. In the end, Bach2-deficiency resulted in increased proportions of terminally differentiated NK cells with increased production of granzymes and cytokines. NK cell-mediated control of tumor metastasis was also augmented in the absence of Bach2. Therefore, Bach2 is a key checkpoint protein regulating NK terminal maturation.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">S6K1 phosphorylates Cdk1 and MSH6 to regulate DNA repair</a></h4>

              
                The mTORC1 substrate, S6 Kinase 1 (S6K1), is involved in the regulation of cell growth, ribosome biogenesis, glucose homeostasis, and adipogenesis. Accumulating evidence has suggested a role for mTORC1 signaling in the DNA damage response. This is mostly based on the findings that mTORC1 inhibitors sensitized cells to DNA damage. However, a direct role of the mTORC1-S6K1 signaling pathway in DNA repair and the mechanism by which this signaling pathway regulates DNA repair is unknown. In this study, we discovered a novel role for S6K1 in regulating DNA repair through the coordinated regulation of the cell cycle, homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair (HRR) and mismatch DNA repair (MMR) mechanisms. Here, we show that S6K1 orchestrates DNA repair by phosphorylation of Cdk1 at serine 39, causing G2/M cell cycle arrest enabling homologous recombination and by phosphorylation of MSH6 at serine 309, enhancing MMR. Moreover, breast cancer cells harboring <i>RPS6KB1</i> gene amplification show increased resistance to several DNA damaging agents and S6K1 expression is associated with poor survival of breast cancer patients treated with chemotherapy. Our findings reveal an unexpected function of S6K1 in the DNA repair pathway, serving as a tumorigenic barrier by safeguarding genomic stability.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">The structure-selective endonucleases GEN1 and MUS81 mediate complementary functions in safeguarding the genome of proliferating B lymphocytes</a></h4>

              
                During the development of humoral immunity, activated B lymphocytes undergo vigorous proliferative, transcriptional, metabolic, and DNA remodeling activities; hence, their genomes are constantly exposed to an onslaught of genotoxic agents and processes. Branched DNA intermediates generated during replication and recombinational repair must be eliminated to preserve the integrity of these DNA transactions for the faithful duplication and propagation of genomic material. To investigate the role of two structure-selective endonucleases, GEN1 and MUS81, in B cell biology, we established B-cell conditional knockout mouse models and found that targeted deletion of GEN1 and MUS81 in early B-cell precursors abrogates the development and maturation of B-lineage cells while selective loss of the enzymes in mature B cells inhibits the generation of robust germinal centers. Upon activation, these double-null mature B lymphocytes fail to proliferate and survive while exhibiting transcriptional signatures of p53 signaling, apoptosis, and type I interferon response. Metaphase spreads of these endonuclease-deficient cells showed severe and diverse chromosomal abnormalities, including a preponderance of chromosome breaks, consistent with a defect in resolving DNA recombination intermediates. These observations underscore the pivotal roles of GEN1 and MUS81 in safeguarding the genome to ensure the proper development and maintenance of B lymphocytes.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A visual sense of number emerges from divisive normalization in a simple center-surround convolutional network</a></h4>

              
                Many species of animals exhibit an intuitive sense of number, suggesting a fundamental neural mechanism for representing numerosity in a visual scene. Recent empirical studies demonstrate that early feedforward visual responses are sensitive to numerosity of a dot array but substantially less so to continuous dimensions orthogonal to numerosity, such as size and spacing of the dots. However, the mechanisms that extract numerosity are unknown. Here we identified the core neurocomputational principles underlying these effects: (1) center-surround contrast filters; (2) at different spatial scales; with (3) divisive normalization across network units. In an untrained computational model, these principles eliminated sensitivity to size and spacing, making numerosity the main determinant of the neuronal response magnitude. Moreover, a model implementation of these principles explained both well-known and relatively novel illusions of numerosity perception across space and time. This supports the conclusion that the neural structures and feedforward processes that encode numerosity naturally produce visual illusions of numerosity. Together, these results identify a set of neurocomputational properties that gives rise to the ubiquity of the number sense in the animal kingdom.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Real time, in vivo measurement of neuronal and peripheral clocks in Drosophila melanogaster</a></h4>

              
                Circadian clocks are highly conserved transcriptional regulators that control ~24-hour oscillations in gene expression, physiological function, and behavior. Circadian clocks exist in almost every tissue and are thought to control tissue-specific gene expression and function, synchronized by the brain clock. Many disease states are associated with loss of circadian regulation. How and when circadian clocks fail during pathogenesis remains largely unknown because it is currently difficult to monitor tissue-specific clock function in intact organisms. Here, we developed a method to directly measure the transcriptional oscillation of distinct neuronal and peripheral clocks in live, intact <i>Drosophila</i>, which we term Locally Activatable BioLuminescence, or LABL. Using this method, we observed that specific neuronal and peripheral clocks exhibit distinct transcriptional properties. Loss of the receptor for PDF, a circadian neurotransmitter critical for the function of the brain clock, disrupts circadian locomotor activity but not all tissue-specific circadian clocks. We found that, while peripheral clocks in non-neuronal tissues were less stable after the loss of PDF signaling, they continued to oscillate. We also demonstrate that distinct clocks exhibit differences in their loss of oscillatory amplitude or their change in period, depending on their anatomical location, mutation, or fly age. Our results demonstrate that LABL is an effective tool that allows rapid, affordable, and direct real-time monitoring of individual clocks <i>in vivo</i>.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Locus coeruleus norepinephrine selectively controls visual attention</a></h4>

              
                Norepinephrine (NE) neuromodulation plays a role in diverse non-specific physiological and cognitive functions including wakefulness, arousal, and cognitive performance. NE modulation of neuronal responses in the cerebral cortex has been proposed to mediate improved task-specific behavior by enhancing sensory processing. However, the sensory-specific NE contribution on performance remains unknown. We directly tested the role of NE-mediated neuromodulation of sensory signals on perceptual performance in non-human primates doing visual spatial attention tasks. We found that NE neurons in the locus coeruleus (LC) respond selectively to an attended stimulus. Optogenetically enhancing the sensory-specific responses of LC-NE neurons improved the monkeys' sensory discrimination in a spatially selectively way, without affecting motor processing. These findings identify a specific contribution of NE neuromodulation of sensory representations to selective attention and performance.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Comprehensive volumetric phenotyping of the neonatal brain in Down syndrome.</a></h4>

              
                Down syndrome (DS) is the most common genetic cause of intellectual disability with a wide spectrum of neurodevelopmental outcomes. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been used to investigate differences in whole and/or regional brain volumes in DS from infancy to adulthood. However, to date, there have been relatively few in vivo neonatal brain imaging studies in DS, despite the presence of clearly identifiable characteristics at birth. Improved understanding of early brain development in DS is needed to assess phenotypic severity and identify appropriate time windows for early intervention. In this study, we used in vivo brain MRI to conduct a comprehensive volumetric phenotyping of the neonatal brain in DS. Using a robust cross-sectional reference sample of close to 500 preterm- to term-born control neonates, we have performed normative modelling and quantified volumetric deviation from the normative mean in 25 individual infants with DS [postmenstrual age at scan, median (range) = 40.57 (32.43 - 45.57) weeks], corrected for sex, age at scan and age from birth. We found that absolute whole brain volume was significantly reduced in neonates with DS (pFDR <0.0001), as were most underlying absolute tissue volumes, except for the lentiform nuclei and the extracerebral cerebrospinal fluid (eCSF), which were not significantly different, and the lateral ventricles, which were significantly enlarged (pFDR <0.0001). Relative volumes, adjusting for underlying differences in whole brain volume, revealed a dynamic shift in brain proportions in neonates with DS. In particular, the cerebellum, as well as the cingulate, frontal, insular and occipital white matter (WM) segments were significantly reduced in proportion (pFDR <0.0001). Conversely, deep grey matter (GM) structures, such as the thalami and lentiform nuclei, as well as CSF-filled compartments, such as the eCSF and the lateral ventricles were significantly enlarged in proportion (pFDR <0.0001). We also observed proportionally reduced frontal and occipital lobar volumes, in contrast with proportionally enlarged temporal and parietal lobar volumes. Lastly, we noted age-related volumetric differences between neonates with and without a congenital heart defect (CHD), indicating that there may be a baseline brain phenotype in neonates with DS, which is further altered in the presence of CHD. In summary, we provide a comprehensive volumetric phenotyping of the neonatal brain in DS and observe many features that appear to follow a developmental continuum, as noted in older age cohorts. There are currently no paediatric longitudinal neuroimaging investigations in DS, starting from the earliest time points, which greatly impedes our understanding of the developmental continuum of neuroanatomical parameters in DS. Whilst life expectancy of individuals with DS has greatly improved over the last few decades, early interventions may be essential to help improve outcomes and quality of life.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A method to estimate contact regions between hands and objects during human multi-digit grasping</a></h4>

              
                In order to grasp an object successfully, we must select appropriate contact regions for our hands on the surface of the object. However, identifying such regions is challenging. Here, we describe a workflow to estimate contact regions from marker-based tracking data. Participants grasp real objects, while we track the 3D position of both the objects and the hand including the fingers' joints. We first determine joint Euler angles from a selection of tracked markers positioned on the back of the hand. Then, we use state-of-the-art hand mesh reconstruction algorithms to generate a mesh model of the participant's hand in the current pose and 3D position. Using objects that were either 3D printed, or 3D scanned--and are thus available as both real objects and mesh data--allows us to co-register the hand and object meshes. In turn, this allows us to estimate approximate contact regions by calculating intersections between the hand mesh and the co-registered 3D object mesh. The method may be used to estimate where and how humans grasp objects under a variety of conditions. Therefore, the method could be of interest to researchers studying visual and haptic perception, motor control, human-computer interaction in virtual and augmented reality, and robotics.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Defective neuritogenesis in Abcd1/2 deficient rat neurons due to intrinsic and astrocyte-dependent mechanisms</a></h4>

              
                X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) is a rare neurometabolic and demyelinating disorder caused by loss of function mutations of the ABCD1 transporter that imports very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFA) into the peroxisome for beta-oxidation. Impaired ABCD1 function results in VLCFA accumulation, which ultimately causes lethal forms of X-ALD in children (CCALD) and adults (CAMN). Because X-ALD is a genetic disorder, we looked for signs of altered neurodevelopmental pathways in the transcriptomes of brain cortical tissues free of pathology from patients that died of CALD or CAMN. Several categories related to brain development, axonal growth, synaptic signaling and synaptic compartments were significantly dysregulated in both CALD and CAMN, suggesting that congenital circuit abnormalities might be structural in brains of mutated ABCD1 carriers. We partially dissected the cellular origin of dysregulated pathways using rat neuronal and astrocytic cultures in which X-ALD was modeled by silencing of Abcd1 and Abcd2 by RNA interference. Abcd2 was silenced lest it compensated for Abcd1 loss. Abcd1/2 deficient neurons presented higher rates of death, reduced sizes and defective formation of spines, dendrites and axons. The aberrant neuron development was caused by cell-autonomous and astrocyte-dependent mechanisms, and involved Wnt signaling, as suggested by the rescue of the expression of a synaptic gene upon pharmacological activation of the Wnt pathway. As recently proposed for neurogenetic disorders such as Huntington's disease, our data suggest that X-ALD has a neurodevelopmental component that may cause psychiatric alterations and prime neural circuits for neurodegeneration. If this is the case, therapies aimed at restoring neural-circuit function in neurodevelopmental disorders may be reprofiled for X-ALD therapeutics.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Resting-State Electroencephalography for Continuous, Passive Prediction of Coma Recovery After Acute Brain Injury</a></h4>

              
                Accurately predicting emergence from disorders of consciousness (DoC) after acute brain injury can profoundly influence mortality, acute management, and rehabilitation planning. While recent advances in functional neuroimaging and stimulus-based EEG offer the potential to enrich shared decision-making, their procedural sophistication and expense limit widespread availability or repeated performance. We investigated continuous EEG (cEEG) within a passive, resting-state framework to provide continuously updated predictions of DoC recovery at 24-, 48-, and 72-hour prediction horizons. To develop robust, continuous prediction models from a large population of patients with acute brain injury (ABI), we leveraged a recently described pragmatic approach transforming Glasgow Coma Scale assessment sub-score combinations into frequently assessed DoC diagnoses: coma, vegetative state, minimally conscious state with or without language, and post-injury confusional or recovered states. We retrospectively identified consecutive patients undergoing cEEG following acute traumatic brain injury (TBI), subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), or intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Models continuously predicting DoC diagnosis for multiple prediction horizons were evaluated utilizing recent clinical assessments with or without cEEG information, which comprised a comprehensive EEG feature set of 288 time, frequency, and time-frequency characteristics computed from consecutive 5-minute EEG epochs, with 6 additional features capturing each EEG feature's temporal dynamics. Features were fed into a predictive model developed with cross-validation; the ordinal DoC diagnosis was discriminated using an ensemble of XGBoost binary classifiers. For 201 ABI patients (46 TBI, 140 SAH, 15 ICH patients comprising 27,280 cEEG-hours with concomitant clinical assessments), cEEG-augmented models accurately predicted the future DoC diagnosis at 24 hours (one-vs-rest AU-ROC, 92.4%; weighted-F1 84.1%), 48 hours (one-vs-rest AU-ROC=88%, weighted-F1=80%) and 72 hours (one-vs-rest AU-ROC=86.3%, weighted-F1=76.6%). Models were robust to utilizing different ordinal cut-points for the DoC prediction target and evaluating additional models derived from specific sub-populations using a confound-isolating cross-validation framework. The most robust features across evaluation configurations included Petrosian fractal dimension, relative power of high to low (gamma-beta to delta-alpha) EEG frequency spectra, energy within the 12-35 Hz frequency band in the short-time Fourier transform domain, and wavelet entropy. The cEEG-augmented model exceeded the performance of models using preceding clinical assessments, continuously predicting future DoC diagnosis with one-vs-rest AU-ROC in the range of 84.3-92.4% while utilizing approaches to limit overfitting. The proposed continuous, resting-state cEEG prediction method represents a promising tool to predict DoC emergence in ABI patients. Enabling these methods prospectively would represent a new paradigm of continuous prognostic monitoring for predicting coma recovery and assessing treatment response.

                Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a clear fluid surrounding and nourishing the brain and spinal cord. Molecular profiling of the CSF is a common diagnostic approach for central nervous system (CNS) diseases, including infectious diseases, autoimmune disorders, brain hemorrhage and traumatic brain injury, CNS tumors, and Alzheimer's disease. Rodent models are critical for investigating CNS disease mechanisms and therapeutics, however, both collecting CSF and injecting materials into CSF in small animals are technically challenging and often result in high rates of postoperative mortality. Here, we present an easy-to-practice and cost-effective protocol with minimum instrument requirements to access the CSF in live rodents for collection and infusion purposes. By introducing a metal needle tool bent at a unique angle and length, we could steadily reach the CSF via the foramen magnum. Compared with prior methods, this protocol requires neither the operator to discern the changes in resistance from solid tissues while puncturing the needle, nor surgical opening of the skin and muscle covering the rodent neck. Using this method, we frequently obtain 5-15 L of CSF from mice and 70-120 L from rats to enable diverse downstream analyses including mass spectrometry. Due to the minimal invasiveness, this procedure allows iterative CSF collection from the same animal every few days - a major improvement over prior protocols that require extensive surgical operations. Moreover, we demonstrate that this method could be used for injecting desired solutions including dyes into mouse CSF with high success rates. Our method shortens the time required for CSF collection or injection to 3-5 minutes. Notably, we could reach near 100% postoperative recovery rates in both mice and rats even with repetitive collections. Together, we establish an efficient and minimally-invasive protocol for collecting CSF and inoculating reagents into the CSF in live rodents to enable various longitudinal studies at the forefronts of CNS investigation.

                Background: Cerebellar brain inhibition (CBI), a neural connection between the cerebellum and primary motor cortex (M1), has been researched as a target pathway for neuromodulation to improve clinical outcomes in various neurological diseases. However, conflicting results of anodal cerebellar transcranial direct current stimulation (acb-tDCS) on M1 excitability indicate that additional investigation is required to examine its precise effect. Objective/Hypothesis: This study aimed to gather evidence of the neuromodulatory effect of acb-tDCS on the M1 using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Methods: Sixteen healthy participants were included in this cross-over study. Participants received real and sham acb-tDCS in a random order, with a minimum one-week washout period between them. The anode and cathode were placed on the right cerebellum and the right buccinator muscle, respectively. Stimulation lasted 20 min at an intensity of 2 mA, and fNIRS data were recorded for 42 min (including a 4 min baseline before stimulation and an 18 min post-stimulation duration) using eight channels attached bilaterally on the M1. Results: acb-tDCS induced a significant decrease in oxyhemoglobin (HbO) concentration (inhibitory effect) in the left (contralateral) M1, whereas it induced a significant increase in HbO concentration (excitatory effect) in the right (ipsilateral) M1 compared to sham tDCS during (p < 0.05) and after stimulation (p < 0.01) in a group level analysis. At the individual level, variations in the response to acb-tDCS were observed. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate the neuromodulatory effects of acb-tDCS on the bilateral M1 in terms of neuronal hemodynamics.

                Prevailing preclinical models of cocaine use have not resulted in an FDA-approved treatment for cocaine use disorder, potentially due to a focus on cocaine use in isolation, which may not translate well to polysubstance use in clinical populations. Clinically, nicotine has been shown to increase cocaine potency and reinforcing efficacy, but some preclinical studies suggest that non-contingent nicotine exposure is not sufficient to alter cocaine self-administration in rats; therefore, this experiment examined if the addition of nicotine to the cocaine solution would alter self-administration behavior. Male Sprague Dawley rats (N=7) were trained to self-administer cocaine (0.75mg/kg/inf), and tested on a long access, fixed ratio 1 schedule of reinforcement (6 hour sessions, unlimited inf, 5 days), for cocaine alone (0.75mg/kg/inf), followed by cocaine and nicotine (0.75mg/kg/inf cocaine +0.03mg/kg/inf nicotine). Finally, rats responded on a progressive ratio schedule for varied doses of cocaine with and without concurrent nicotine at a consistent dose (1.5, 0.75, 0.375, 0.19mg/kg/inf cocaine {+/-} 0.03mg/kg/inf nicotine). Unexpectedly, under long access conditions, rats self-administering cocaine and nicotine responded less than for cocaine alone, and did not escalate responding. However, under progressive ratio conditions, responding for cocaine and nicotine was greater than responding for cocaine alone across low and moderate cocaine doses, and decreased at high cocaine doses, indicating a leftward shift in the dose response curve. Together, these data highlight the importance of evaluating multiple outcome measures in nicotine + cocaine paradigms, and suggest that concurrent self-administration of cocaine and nicotine results in greater motivated responding than for cocaine alone.

Acoustic and electroencephalography signals were recorded in all conditions. The noise used in the Lombard condition consisted of speech-shaped noise at 80 dB SPL sent by headphones. Acoustic measure, and ERP responses were analyzed. Results During the Lombard condition, the participants increased the intensity of their voice, accompanied by an increase in CPP, and a decrease in H1-H2. The cortical response was characterized by the increased N1-P2 complex amplitude of the ERP elicited by the subject's own vocalizations in noise, The source localization showed neural activities in frontal and temporal cortical regions. Conclusions The variation in acoustic measures due to the Lombard Effect could be modulated by temporal, and cortical regions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A ubiquitous spectrolaminar motif of local field potential power across the primate cortex</a></h4>

              
                The mammalian cerebral cortex is anatomically organized into a six-layer motif. It is currently unknown whether a corresponding laminar motif of neuronal activity exists across the cortex. Here, we report the discovery of such a motif in the power of local field potentials (LFP). We implanted multicontact laminar probes in five macaque monkeys and recorded activity across layers in 12 cortical areas at various hierarchical processing stages in all cortical lobes. The anatomical laminar locations of recordings were histologically identified via electrolytic lesions. In all areas, we found a common spectrolaminar pattern characterized by an increasing deep-to-superficial layer gradient of gamma frequency LFP power peaking in layers 2/3, and an increasing superficial-to-deep gradient of alpha-beta power peaking in layers 5/6. Our results show a functional dissociation between superficial and deep layers that is preserved across the cortex, suggesting a ubiquitous layer and frequency-based mechanism for cortical computation.

                Grand efforts in neuroscience are working toward mapping the connectomes of many new species, including the near completion of the Drosophila melanogaster. It is important to ask whether these models could benefit artificial intelligence. In this work we ask two fundamental questions: (1) where and when biological connectomes can provide use in machine learning, (2) which design principles are necessary for extracting a good representation of the connectome. Toward this end, we translate the motor circuit of the C. Elegans nematode into artificial neural networks at varying levels of biophysical realism and evaluate the outcome of training these networks on motor and non-motor behavioral tasks. We demonstrate that biophysical realism need not be upheld to attain the advantages of using biological circuits. We also establish that, even if the exact wiring diagram is not retained, the architectural statistics provide a valuable prior. Finally, we show that while the C. Elegans locomotion circuit provides a powerful inductive bias on locomotion problems, its structure may hinder performance on tasks unrelated to locomotion such as visual classification problems.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Prior unsupervised experience leads to long lasting effects in sensory gating during discrimination learning</a></h4>

              
                As the animal moves in its environment, the brain detects and learns the structure of the surrounding stimuli, independently of the immediate relevance this has for the animal. This experience influences subsequent learning in a manner quantified using paradigms such as latent inhibition or stimulus preconditioning, which measure the effect that unsupervised (not-reinforced) learning has on subsequent reinforced learning. Despite our understanding of the behavioural consequences of prior neutral experience, there is little understanding about the influence of this previous experience on neuronal plasticity. Using latent inhibition, we have shown in mice that learning a two tone discrimination is slower in mice that have had previous neutral exposure to the same or similar tones (<2/3 octave away). Neutral exposure thus elicits profound changes in the brain that influence subsequent learning. To study how previous experience influences experience-dependent plasticity, and better understand the interactions between experience, learning, and plasticity, we recorded sound evoked responses in the auditory cortex of exposed and trained mice. We studied both changes in response magnitude and changes in sensory dynamics, and related both to the differential behavioral effects of different pre-exposure conditions. Here we describe the neuronal changes that paralleled the behavioral findings. We found that discrimination learning led to stronger initial sound-evoked responses and a long-lasting increase in response adaptation and an increase. The first effect was delayed in animals that showed latent inhibition, paralleling behavioural learning. Overall our data reveal that slow changes in behaviour that accompanied learning, paralleled the slow dynamics of experience-dependent plasticity in auditory cortex.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Improved whole-brain multivariate hemodynamic deconvolution for multi-echo fMRI with stability selection</a></h4>

              
                Blind estimation of neuronal-related activity from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data of resting-state, naturalistic paradigms or clinical conditions can be performed with paradigm free analysis methods such as hemodynamic deconvolution. These methods usually employ a linear hemodynamic convolution model and sparsity-pursuing regularized estimation techniques to detect single-trial blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) responses in the brain. Recently, a deconvolution algorithm tailored for multi-echo fMRI data, named multi-echo sparse paradigm free mapping (ME-SPFM), exploited the linear dependence of the BOLD percent signal change on the echo time (TE) to compute voxel-wise estimates of the changes in the apparent transverse relaxation ({Delta}R*2) associated with brain activity, achieving superior performance than its single-echo counterparts. In this work, we propose a novel multivariate formulation that operates at the whole brain level, considering all the voxels as a group in a mixed-norm regularization term to add spatial information in the deconvolution. In addition, we introduce a stability selection procedure that operates voxelwise and avoids the critical selection of the regularization parameter for the deconvolution. This procedure allow us to define a novel metric based on the area under the curve (AUC) of the stability path of the estimation, which provides valuable and complementary information about the probability of having a neuronal-related event at each voxel and time-point. We demonstrate that these novel features yield more robust results compared with the original ME-SPFM algorithm, and show high spatial and temporal agreement with the activation maps and BOLD signals obtained with a standard model-based linear regression approach. In summary, the proposed multivariate multi-echo sparse paradigm free mapping (MvME-SPFM) approach with stability selection provides more reliable estimates of {Delta}R*2 for the study of the dynamics of brain activity when no information about the timings of the BOLD events is available.

                The septal complex regulates both motivated and innate behaviors, chiefly by the action of its diverse population of long-range projection neurons. Among those cells are lateral septum somatostatin neurons which collateral axons profusely innervate cortically-projecting neurons located in the medial septum. Thus, somatostatin cells are ideally positioned at the crossroads of ascending and descending modulatory pathways, likely supporting functional roles in both anatomical directions. Here, we used optogenetic stimulation and extracellular recordings in acutely anesthetized transgenic mice to show that septal somatostatin neurons can disinhibit the cholinergic septo-hippocampal pathway, thus enhancing the amplitude and synchrony of theta oscillations, while depressing sharp wave ripple episodes in the dorsal hippocampus. Nonetheless, photosuppressing septal somatostatin cells hindered goal-directed behavior in a spatial memory task by disrupting task engagement, evidenced in increased immobility, followed by repetitive self-grooming, a hallmark innate behavior. These results suggest that septal somatostatin cells can recruit ascending cholinergic pathways to promote hippocampal theta oscillations, while gating repetitive displacement behaviors mediated by descending subcortical pathways.

                Pollution is a driving force in climate change and an important modifier of human health. Humans are chronically exposed to complex chemical mixtures and, correspondingly, researchers are disentangling the contribution of different contaminants to human neuropathologies. Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are biopersistent pollutants and, due to their diverse applications, have become global contaminants. Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), a prevalent PFAS congener, impairs humoral immunity; however, its impact on innate immunity is unclear. Given the critical roles of innate immune cells, namely microglia, in brain development and homeostasis, we asked whether exposure adversely affects microglial function. Herein, we demonstrate developmental PFOS exposure produces microglial activation and upregulation of the microglia activation gene p2ry12. PFOS-induced microglial activation heightened microglial responses to brain injury, in the absence of increased cell death or inflammation. Use of the photoconvertible calcium indicator CaMPARI revealed PFOS exposure heightened neural activity, while optogenetic silencing of neurons was sufficient to normalize microglial responses to injury. Exposure to perfluorooctanoic acid, an immunotoxic PFAS, did not alter neuronal activity or microglial behavior, further supporting a role for neural activity as a critical modifier of microglial function. Together, this study reveals how contaminant-induced changes in brain activity can shape brain health.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Intermediately Synchronised Brain States optimise trade-off between Subject Identifiability and Predictive Capacity</a></h4>

              
                Functional connectivity (FC) refers to the statistical dependencies between activity of distinct brain areas. To study temporal fluctuations in FC within the duration of a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning session, researchers have proposed the computation of an edge time series (ETS) and their derivatives. Evidence suggests that FC is driven by a few time points of high-amplitude co-fluctuation (HACF) in the ETS, which may also contribute disproportionately to interindividual differences. However, it remains unclear to what degree different time points actually contribute to brain-behaviour associations. Here, we systematically evaluate this question by assessing the predictive utility of FC estimates at different levels of co-fluctuation using machine learning (ML) approaches. We demonstrate that time points of lower and intermediate co-fluctuation levels provide overall highest subject specificity as well as highest predictive capacity of individual-level phenotypes.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">A primary rodent triculture model to investigate the role of glia-neuron crosstalk in regulation of neuronal activity.</a></h4>

              
                Neuroinflammation and hyperexcitability have been implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disease, and new models are required to investigate the cellular crosstalk involved in these processes. We developed an approach to generate a quantitative and reproducible triculture system that is suitable for pharmacological studies. While primary rodent cells were previously grown in a coculture medium formulated to support only neurons and astrocytes, we now optimised a protocol to generate tricultures containing neurons, astrocytes and microglia by culturing in a medium designed to support all three cell types and adding exogenous microglia to cocultures. Immunocytochemistry was used to confirm the intended cell types were present. The percentage of ramified microglia in the tricultures decreases as the number of microglia present increases. Multi-electrode array (MEA) recordings indicate that microglia in the triculture model suppress neuronal activity in a dose-dependent manner. Neurons in both cocultures and tricultures were responsive to the potassium channel blocker 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) suggesting that neurons remained viable and functional in the triculture model. Furthermore, suppressed neuronal activity in tricultures correlated with decreased densities of dendritic spines and of the postsynaptic protein Homer1 along dendrites, indicative of a direct or indirect effect of microglia on synapse function. We thus present a functional triculture model, which, due to its more complete cellular composition, is a more relevant model than standard cocultures. The model can be used to probe glia-neuron interactions and subsequently aid the development of assays for drug discovery, using neuronal excitability as a functional endpoint.

                Homing based on path integration (H-PI) is a form of navigation in which an animal uses self-motion cues to keep track of its position and return to a starting point. Despite evidence for a role of the hippocampus in H-PI, the firing patterns of hippocampal neurons associated with homing performance are unknown. Here we developed a behavioral task for mice to characterize spatially selective cells during H-PI. The task required a mouse to find a variably placed lever on an arena before returning to its home base. H-PI was assessed in complete darkness. Recordings from CA1 pyramidal neurons in mice showed that several firing fields were anchored to the lever position. The spatial stability of lever-anchored fields was reduced during trials with lower homing accuracy, and the activity of a subset of lever-anchored firing fields predicted homing direction. These results demonstrate how neurons with object-anchored firing fields contribute to navigation.

                Maternal one-carbon (1C) metabolism plays an important role in early life programming. There is a well-established connection between the fetal environment and the health status of the offspring. However, there is a knowledge gap on how maternal nutrition impacts stroke outcome in offspring. The aim of our study was to investigate the role of maternal dietary deficiencies in folic acid or choline on stroke outcome in 3-month-old offspring. Adult female mice were fed a folic acid deficient diet (FADD), choline deficient diet (ChDD), or control diet (CD) prior to pregnancy. They were continued on diets during pregnancy and lactation. Male and female offspring were weaned onto a CD and at 2 months of age were subject to ischemic stroke within the sensorimotor cortex via photothrombosis damage. At 3-months-of-age, motor function was measured in offspring and tissue was collected for analysis. Mothers maintained on either a FADD or ChDD had reduced levels of S-adenosylmethionine in liver and S-adenosylhomocysteine in plasma. After ischemic stroke, motor function was impaired in 3-month-old offspring from deficient mothers compared to CD animals. In brain tissue, there was no difference in ischemic damage volume. When protein levels were assessed in brain tissue, there were lower levels of neurodegeneration in males compared to females and betaine levels were reduced in offspring from ChDD mothers. Our results demonstrate that a deficient maternal diet during critical timepoints in neurodevelopment results in worse stroke outcomes. This study emphasizes the importance of maternal diet and the impact it can have on offspring health.

                Entorhinal cortex (EC) is a potential target of deep brain stimulation in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and fMRI can enable whole-brain dynamic mapping noninvasively. However, it remains challenging to study EC-based fMRI connectivity in rodents due to image signal loss and the lower sensitivity of the surface coil ring or array coil for deep brain areas. To reduce the magnetic susceptibility artifacts driven signal loss issue, we introduced baby cream into the middle ear. To improve detection sensitivity, we implemented novel inductively-coupled ear-bars (ICEs) in the 7 T Bruker scanner, which resulted in an approximately 2-fold signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) increase in EC over the conventional surface array. The ICE can be conveniently utilized as an add-on device, with no modulation to the scanner interface. To demonstrate the applicability of ICEs for both task and resting-state (rs) fMRI, whole-brain echo-planar imaging (EPI) was performed in anesthetized rats modeling AD mixed dementia. Seed-based rs-fMRI connectivity maps emanating from the left entorhinal cortex demonstrated its connectivity to the hippocampus, piriform cortex, septal nuclei, and prefrontal cortex. Hence, this work demonstrates an optimized procedure for ICE by acquiring large-scale networks emanating from a seed region that was not easily accessible by conventional MRI detectors, enabling better observation of EC-based brain fMRI connectivity studies with a higher signal-to-noise ratio in rodent models of dementia.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Noradrenergic input from nucleus of the solitary tract regulates parabrachial activity in mice</a></h4>

              
                The parabrachial complex (PB) is critically involved in aversive processes, including pain. We have reported that chronic pain is associated with amplified activity of PB neurons in rodent models of neuropathic pain. Here we demonstrate that catecholaminergic input from the caudal nucleus of the solitary tract (cNTScat)--a stress responsive region that integrates intero- and exteroceptive signals- causes amplification of PB activity and their sensory afferents. Using a virally mediated expression of a norepinephrine (NE) sensor, NE2h, and fiber photometry in anesthetized mice, noxious mechanical and thermal stimuli caused prolonged NE transients in PB that far outlast the noxious stimulus. Similar NE transients in PB were evoked by focal stimulation of the superficial cNTS, a region that contains the noradrenergic A2 cell group that projects densely upon PB. In vitro, optical stimulation of cNTScat terminals depolarized PB neurons and increased their frequency of spontaneous excitatory synaptic inputs. A dual opsin approach showed that sensory afferents from the caudal spinal trigeminal nucleus (SpVc) are potentiated by cNTScat terminal activation. This potentiation was coupled with a decrease in the paired pulse ratio, consistent with an cNTScat mediated increase in the probability of release at SpVc synapses. Together, these data suggest that A2 neurons of the cNTS generate long lasting NE transients in PB which increase excitability and potentiate responses of PB neurons to sensory inputs. These reveal a mechanism through which stressors from multiple modalities may potentiate the aversiveness of nociceptive stimuli.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Common brain areas for processing physiologically and socially 'needed' stimuli</a></h4>

              
                We looked at the overlap between brain areas related to perception of physiologically and socially needed stimuli and how they might regulate serotonin levels. First, we conducted separate ALE meta-analyses on published results pertaining to brain activation patterns when participants perceived food while hungry or water while thirsty, and social interactions while being excluded. This allowed us to identify common consistent brain activation patterns for physiological and social needed stimuli. We also looked at significant spatial association between the common network and serotonin receptor distribution. We found that regions within the mid-posterior insula, the anterior cingulate cortex and the caudate are at the intersection of physiological (hunger and thirst) and social (exclusion) aspects of needing. Furthermore, we found a significant positive spatial correlation between that common network and 5HT4 serotonin receptor. Our study suggests there is a common brain pattern during the processing of physiologically and socially needed stimuli, which modulates serotonin neurons possibly through a feedback loop from the PFC to the serotonergic neurons in the dorsal raphe nuclei.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Imaging crossing fibers in mouse, pig, monkey, and human brain using small-angle X-ray scattering</a></h4>

              
                Myelinated axons (nerve fibers) efficiently transmit signals throughout the brain via action potentials. Multiple methods that are sensitive to axon orientations, from microscopy to magnetic resonance imaging, aim to reconstruct the brain's structural connectome. As billions of nerve fibers traverse the brain with various possible geometries at each point, resolving fiber crossings is necessary to generate accurate structural connectivity maps. However, doing so with specificity is a challenging task because signals stemming from oriented fibers can be influenced by brain (micro)structures unrelated to myelinated axons. X-ray scattering can specifically probe myelinated axons due to the periodicity of the myelin sheath, which yields distinct peaks in the scattering pattern. Here, we show that scanning small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) can be used to detect myelinated, axon-specific fiber crossings. We first demonstrate the capability using strips of human corpus callosum to create artificial double and triple crossing fiber geometries, and then apply the method in mouse, pig, vervet monkey, and human brains. Given its specificity, capability of 3-dimensional sampling and high resolution, scanning SAXS can serve as a ground truth for validating MRI as well as microscopy-based methods.

                Amyloid deposits in Alzheimer's disease (AD) are surrounded by large numbers of plaque-associated axonal spheroids (PAAS). PAAS disrupt axonal electrical conduction and neuronal network function, and correlate with AD severity. However, the mechanisms that govern their formation remain unknown. To uncover the molecular architecture of PAAS, we applied proximity labeling proteomics of spheroids in human AD postmortem brains and mice. We then implemented a human iPSC-derived AD model recapitulating PAAS pathology for mechanistic studies. Using this strategy, we uncovered hundreds of previously unknown PAAS-enriched proteins and signaling pathways, including PI3K/AKT/mTOR. Phosphorylated mTOR was highly enriched in PAAS and strongly correlated with disease severity in humans. Importantly, pharmacological mTOR inhibition in iPSC-derived human neurons or AAV-mediated knockdown in mice, led to a marked reduction of PAAS pathology. Altogether, our study provides a novel platform to examine mechanisms of axonal pathology in neurodegeneration and to evaluate the therapeutic potential of novel targets.

                The pan ROCK inhibitor fasudil acts as a vasodilator and has been used as a medication post cerebral stroke for the past 27 years in Japan and China. More recently, on the basis of the involvement of ROCK inhibition on synaptic function, neuronal survival and processes associated with neuroinflammation, it has been suggested that the drug may be repurposed for neurodegenerative diseases. Indeed, fasudil has demonstrated preclinical efficacy in many neurodegenerative disease models. To facilitate an understanding of the wider biological processes at play due to ROCK inhibition in the context of neurodegeneration we performed a global gene expression analysis on the brains of Alzheimer's disease model mice treated with fasudil via peripheral i.p injection. Our results show that fasudil tends to drive gene expression in a reverse sense to that seen in postmortem neurodegenerative disease brains. The results are most striking in terms of pathway enrichment analysis where pathways regulated in Alzheimer's disease and by fasudil treatment are overwhelmingly regulated in opposite directions. Thus, our results bolster the repurposing potential of fasudil by demonstrating an anti-neurodegenerative phenotype in a disease context and highlight the potential of in vivo transcriptional profiling of drug activity.

                Cataloging the diverse cellular architecture of the primate brain is crucial for understanding cognition, behavior and disease in humans. Here, we generated a brain-wide single-cell multimodal molecular atlas of the rhesus macaque brain. Altogether, we profiled 2.58M transcriptomes and 1.59M epigenomes from single nuclei sampled from 30 regions across the adult brain. Cell composition differed extensively across the brain, revealing cellular signatures of region-specific functions. We also identified 1.19M candidate regulatory elements, many novel, allowing us to explore the landscape of cis-regulatory grammar and neurological disease risk in a cell-type- specific manner. Together, this multi-omic atlas provides an open resource for investigating the evolution of the human brain and identifying novel targets for disease interventions.

                A common cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia is the presence of a G4C2 intronic expansion in the C9orf72 gene. This expansion is translated by a non-AUG-dependent mechanism into five different dipeptide repeat proteins (DPRs), including the aggregation-prone poly glycine-arginine (GR), which is neurotoxic. Poly(GR) was found to interact with the nuclear importin Kap{beta}2 in non-neuronal cell lines. However, whether this interaction also occurs in neurons impacting their survival has not been studied. Here, we demonstrated that Kap{beta}2 and poly(GR) co-aggregate in neurons in-vitro and in-vivo in CNS tissue. Moreover, we showed that Kap{beta}2 mitigates poly(GR) neurotoxicity. Indeed, overexpression of Kap{beta}2 relieved poly(GR)-mediated neurotoxicity and restored nuclear TDP-43 levels, whereas silencing Kap{beta}2 increased the risk of death of neurons expressing poly(GR), suggesting that Kap{beta}2 plays a critical role in neurodegeneration. These findings open a new therapeutic avenue in C9-linked ALS/FTD focused on modulating Kap{beta}2 levels.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Task-based attentional and default mode connectivity associated with STEM anxiety profiles among university physics students</a></h4>

              
                Attentional control theory (ACT) posits that elevated anxiety increases the probability of re-allocating cognitive resources needed to complete a task to processing anxiety-related stimuli. This process impairs processing efficiency and can lead to reduced performance effectiveness. Science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) students frequently experience STEM-related anxiety, which can interfere with learning and performance and negatively impact student retention and graduation rates. The objective of this study was to extend the ACT framework to investigate the neurobiological associations between STEM-related anxiety and cognitive performance among 123 physics undergraduate students. Latent profile analysis (LPA) identified four profiles of student STEM-related anxiety, including two profiles that represented the majority of the sample (Low STEM Anxiety; 59.3% and High Math Anxiety; 21.9%) and two additional profiles that were not well represented (High STEM Anxiety; 6.5% and High Science Anxiety; 4.1%). Students underwent a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) session in which they performed two tasks involving physics cognition: the Force Concept Inventory (FCI) task and the Physics Knowledge (PK) task. No significant differences were observed in FCI or PK task performance between High Math Anxiety and Low STEM Anxiety students. During the three phases of the FCI task, we found no significant brain connectivity differences during scenario and question presentation, yet we observed significant differences during answer selection within and between the dorsal attention network (DAN), ventral attention network (VAN), and default mode network (DMN). Further, we found significant group differences during the PK task were limited to the DAN, including DAN-VAN and within-DAN connectivity. These results highlight the different cognitive processes required for physics conceptual reasoning compared to physics knowledge retrieval, provide new insight into the underlying brain dynamics associated with anxiety and physics cognition, and confirm the relevance of ACT theory for STEM-related anxiety.

                Globoid cell leukodystrophy (GLD) or Krabbes disease is a fatal genetic demyelinating disease of the central nervous system caused by loss-of-function mutations in the galactosylceramidase (galc) gene. While the metabolic basis for disease is known, the understanding of how this results in neuropathology is not well understood. Herein we report that the rapid and protracted elevation of CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes occurs coincident with clinical disease in a mouse model of GLD. Administration of a function blocking antibody against CD8a effectively prevented disease onset, reduced morbidity and mortality and prevented CNS demyelination in mice. These data indicate that subsequent to the genetic cause of disease, neuropathology is driven by pathogenic CD8+ T cells, thus offering novel therapeutic potential for treatment of GLD.

	<p>Skull base surgery has undergone significant progress following key technological developments. From early candle-lit devices to the modern endoscope, refinements in visualization techniques have made endoscopic skull base surgery (ESBS) a standard practice for treating a variety of conditions. The endoscope has also been integrated with other technologies to enhance visualization, including fluorescence agents, intraoperative neuronavigation with augmented reality, and the exoscope. Endoscopic approaches have allowed neurosurgeons to reevaluate skull base neuroanatomy from new perspectives. These advances now serve as the foundation for future developments in ESBS. In this narrative review, we discuss the history and development of ESBS, current visualization techniques, and future innovations.</p>

	<p>Numerous studies have established the link between ADHD and antisocial behavior, one of the most serious functional impairments caused by the disorder. However, research on protective factors that mitigate this link is still lacking. The Salutogenic Model of Health offers the &amp;amp;ldquo;Sense of Coherence&amp;amp;rdquo; (SOC), establishing that individuals who see their lives as logical, meaningful, and manageable are more resistant to various risk factors and diseases. The present study examines for the first time whether SOC is also a protective factor against different ADHD-related types of antisocial behaviors (severe/mild violent behavior, verbal violence, property crimes, public disorder, and drug abuse). A total of 3180 participants aged 15&amp;amp;ndash;50 completed online questionnaires assessing the level of ADHD symptoms, antisocial behaviors, and SOC. Structural equation modeling was applied to examine the research hypothesis. An interaction between ADHD symptoms and SOC was found in predicting each type of antisocial behavior (beta = &amp;amp;minus;0.06&amp;amp;ndash;&amp;amp;minus;0.17, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.01). The link between ADHD symptoms and antisocial behavior was significantly weaker for high than low SOC participants, regardless of age group. The current study found that people with high SOC are protected against the effect of ADHD symptoms on one of the most serious functional impairments, antisocial behavior. These findings suggest that SOC is a protective factor from the adverse effects of ADHD symptoms, justifying further prospective and intervention studies.</p>

	<p>Despite the increasing popularity of flow diverters (FDs) as an endovascular option for intracranial aneurysms, the treatment of complex aneurysms still represents a challenge. Combined strategies using a flow-preservation bypass could be considered in selected cases. In this study, we retrospectively reviewed our series of patients with complex intracranial aneurysms submitted to bypass. From January 2015 to May 2022, 23 patients were selected. We identified 11 cases (47.8%) of MCA, 6 cases (26.1%) of ACA and 6 cases (26.1%) of ICA aneurysms. The mean maximal diameter was 22.73 &amp;amp;plusmn; 12.16 mm, 8 were considered as giant, 9 were fusiform, 8 presented intraluminal thrombosis, 10 presented wall calcification, and 18 involved major branches or perforating arteries. Twenty-five bypass procedures were performed in 23 patients (two EC&amp;amp;ndash;IC bypasses with radial artery graft, seventeen single- or double-barrel STA&amp;amp;ndash;MCA bypasses and six IC&amp;amp;ndash;IC bypasses in anterior cerebral arteries). The long-term bypass patency rate was 94.5%, and the total aneurysm exclusion was 95.6%, with a mean follow-up of 28 months. Median KPS values at last follow-up was 90, and a favorable outcome (KPS &amp;amp;ge; 70 and mRS &amp;amp;le; 2) was obtained in 87% of the cases. The use of bypass techniques represents, in selected cases, a valid therapeutic option in the management of complex anterior circulation aneurysms when a simpler direct approach, including the use of FD, is considered not feasible.</p>

                <p><b>Brain Sciences, Vol. 12, Pages 1338: Experimental Sleep Deprivation Results in Diminished Perceptual Stability Independently of Psychosis Proneness</b></p>

	<p>Psychotic disorders as well as psychosis proneness in the general population have been associated with perceptual instability, suggesting weakened predictive processing. Sleep disturbances play a prominent role in psychosis and schizophrenia, but it is unclear whether perceptual stability diminishes with sleep deprivation, and whether the effects of sleep deprivation differ as a function of psychosis proneness. In the current study, we aimed to clarify this matter. In this preregistered study, 146 participants successfully completed an intermittent version of the random dot kinematogram (RDK) task and the 21-item Peters Delusion Inventory (PDI-21) to assess perceptual stability and psychosis proneness, respectively. Participants were randomized to sleep either as normal (8 to 9 hours in bed) (n = 72; Mage = 24.7, SD = 6.2, 41 women) or to stay awake through the night (n = 74; Mage = 24.8, SD = 5.1, 44 women). Sleep deprivation resulted in diminished perceptual stability, as well as in decreases in perceptual stability over the course of the task. However, we did not observe any association between perceptual stability and PDI-21 scores, nor a tendency for individuals with higher PDI-21 scores to be more vulnerable to sleep-deprivation-induced decreases in perceptual stability. The present study suggests a compromised predictive processing system in the brain after sleep deprivation, but variation in psychosis trait is not related to greater vulnerability to sleep deprivation in our dataset. Further studies in risk groups and patients with psychosis are needed to evaluate whether sleep loss plays a role in the occurrence of objectively measured perceptual-related clinical symptoms.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cortical thickness, gray matter volume and cognitive performance: a cross-sectional study of the moderating effects of age on their inter-relationships</a></h4>

              
                In a sample comprising younger, middle-aged and older cognitively healthy adults (N = 375), we examined associations between mean cortical thickness, gray matter volume (GMV) and performance in four cognitive domains - memory, speed, fluency and crystallized intelligence. In almost all cases, the associations were moderated significantly by age, with the strongest associations in the older age group. An exception to this pattern was identified in a younger adult sub-group aged less than 23 yrs, when a negative association between cognitive performance and cortical thickness was identified. Other than for speed, all associations between structural metrics and performance in specific cognitive domains were fully mediated by mean cognitive ability. Cortical thickness and GMV explained unique fractions of the variance in mean cognitive ability, speed and fluency. In no case, however, did the amount of variance jointly explained by the two metrics exceed 7% of the total variance. These findings suggest that cortical thickness and GMV are distinct correlates of domain-general cognitive ability, that the strength and, for cortical thickness, the direction of these associations is moderated by age, and that these structural metrics offer only limited insights into the determinants of individual differences in cognitive performance across the adult lifespan.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Early categorization of social affordances during the visual encoding of bodily stimuli</a></h4>

              
                Interpersonal interactions rely on various communication channels, both verbal and non-verbal, through which information regarding one's intentions and emotions is transmitted. Here, we investigated the neural correlates underlying the visual processing of hand postures conveying social affordances (i.e., hand-shaking), compared to control stimuli such as hands performing non-social actions (i.e., grasping) or showing no movement at all. Combining univariate and multivariate analysis on electroencephalography (EEG) data, our results show that occipito-temporal electrodes show an early (before 200 ms after image presentation) differential processing of stimuli conveying social information compared to non-social ones. First, the amplitude of two Event-Related Potentials related to the perception of body parts (i.e., the N190 and the Early Posterior Negativity - EPN) is modulated differently during the perception of social and non-social content carried by hands. Moreover, our multivariate classification analysis (MultiVariate Pattern Analysis - MVPA) expanded the univariate results by revealing two crucial time windows for distinguishing implied motion with and without social affordances over occipito-parietal sites. In conclusion, we provide new evidence suggesting that the encoding of socially relevant hand gestures is categorized in the early stages of visual processing and future studies will need to clarify whether and how fronto-parietal networks contribute to structuring this functional organization in the visual system.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Xanomeline restores endogenous nicotinic acetylcholine receptor signaling in mouse prefrontal cortex</a></h4>

              
                Cholinergic synapses in prefrontal cortex are vital for attention, but this modulatory system undergoes substantial pre- and post-synaptic alterations during adulthood. To examine the integrated impact of these changes, we optophysiologically probe cholinergic synapses ex vivo, revealing a clear decline in neurotransmission in middle adulthood. Pharmacological dissection of synaptic components reveals a selective reduction in postsynaptic nicotinic receptor currents. Other components of cholinergic synapses appear stable, by contrast, including acetylcholine autoinhibition, metabolism, and excitation of postsynaptic muscarinic receptors. Pursuing strategies to strengthen cholinergic neurotransmission, we find that positive allosteric modulation of nicotinic receptors with NS9283 is effective in young adults but wanes with age. To boost nicotinic receptor availability, we harness the second messenger pathways of the preserved excitatory muscarinic receptors. The muscarinic agonist and cognitive-enhancer xanomeline significantly restores nicotinic signaling in older mice in a muscarinic- and PKC-dependent manner. The rescued nicotinic component regains youthful sensitivity to allosteric enhancement: treatment with xanomeline and NS9283 restores cholinergic synapses in older mice to the strength, speed, and receptor mechanism of young adults. Our results reveal a new and efficient strategy to rescue age-related nicotinic signaling deficits, demonstrating a novel pathway for xanomeline to restore cognitively-essential endogenous cholinergic neurotransmission.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Active antennal movements in Drosophila tune wind encoding</a></h4>

              
                Many insects actively move their antennae, but how these movements influence sensory encoding is not fully understood. Antennae are used to smell odors, detect auditory cues, and sense mechanosensory stimuli such as wind and objects, frequently by combining active movement with sensation. Genetic access to antennal motor systems would thus provide a powerful tool for dissecting the circuit mechanisms underlying active sensing, but little is known about how the most genetically tractable insect, Drosophila melanogaster, moves its antennae. Here we use DeepLabCut to measure how tethered Drosophila move their antennae in the presence of sensory stimuli, and identify genetic reagents for controlling antennal movement. We find that flies perform both slow and fast antennal movements in response to wind-induced deflections, but not the attractive odor apple cider vinegar. We describe four muscles in the first antennal segment that control antennal movements, and identify genetic driver lines that provide access to two groups of antennal motor neurons and an antennal muscle. Through optogenetic inactivation, we provide evidence that antennal motor neurons are specialized for different movement speeds. Finally, we show that activation of antennal motor neurons and muscles can improve the gain and acuity of wind direction encoding. Together, our experiments provide insight into the neural control of antennal movement and suggest that Drosophila actively position their antennae to tune the precision of wind encoding.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Diversification of neuropil organization in specialized and broadly tuned olfactory glomerular circuits in Drosophila melanogaster</a></h4>

              
                To manage the great complexity of detecting and identifying olfactory cues, the insect olfactory system has evolved two main strategies: combinatorial coding and specialized, narrowly tuned olfactory pathways. In combinatorial coding, odorants are encoded by activation of multiple, broadly tuned olfactory sensory neurons that innervate distinct sets of glomeruli. In specialized olfactory pathways, information regarding a single or a few odorants is processed in a discrete, narrowly tuned circuit within a dedicated glomerulus. Here, we compared the narrowly tuned glomerulus DA2 with the broadly tuned glomerulus DL5 at the ultrastructural level, by using volume based focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy. We provide a detailed analysis of neuronal innervation, synaptic composition as well as a circuit diagram of the major glomerular cell types: olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs), uniglomerular projection neurons (uPNs) and multiglomerular neurons (MGNs). By comparing our data with a previously mapped narrowly tuned glomerulus (VA1v), we disclose putative generic features of narrowly tuned glomerular circuits: a high density of neuronal fibers and synapses, a low degree of sensory lateralization, strong axo-axonic connections between OSNs as well as dendro-dendritic connections between uPNs, and a low degree of presynaptic inhibition at the OSN axons. We also show a unique property of the large uPN dendrite in DL5, which forms substantial amount of autapses.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Internal needs drive the cephalic phase response in Drosophila melanogaster</a></h4>

              
                Animals are motivated to eat based on their internal need. When animals are hungry, the sensory detection of food elicits bursts of physiological changes in their bodies. This is the cephalic phase response (CPR), which prepares animals to properly digest food before nutrients enter their bodies. Despite animals uniformly exhibiting a strong CPR, to what extent and how the internal state influences CPR is largely unclear. Here, we demonstrate in Drosophila that tasting food triggers CPR, which is strongly influenced by the internal state. We found that feeding an artificial sweetener or gustatory excitation by optogenetics trigger CPR, which is a rapid and partial recovery from the starved state. While clock genes and hunger signals profoundly drive CPR, they are not required for the process of response after nutrient intake. Therefore, we propose that CPR is the critical layer of regulatory mechanisms representing internal energy homeostasis and metabolism.

                NMDA receptor autoimmune encephalitis (NMDAR-AE) is characterized by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-resident anti-NMDA receptor autoantibodies that cause behavioral and neurologic deficits. Although many symptoms are responsive to immunotherapy, for many patients functionally impairing deficits persist. We used patient-derived GluN1 and GluN2A-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to interrogate the molecular and circuit basis for persistent sensory-motor deficits following NMDAR-AE. During postnatal development, intracortical injection of either mAb disrupted callosal circuit formation with excess callosal projections in primary somatosensory cortex (S1), although the anti-GluN1 antibody provoked the more severe phenotype. S1 circuit disruption during development results in permanent axon morphology alterations and sensory-motor deficits lasting to adulthood. The severity of sensory-motor deficits was correlated with the severity of axon morphology alterations, and these anatomic changes are associated with sensory-motor behavior deficits similar to those in children NMDAR-AE. Our studies provide a molecular, cellular, and circuit basis for persistent neuropsychiatric deficits in NMDAR-AE.

                To examine mechanisms responsible for vestibular afferent sensitivity to transient air conducted sounds (ACS) and inter-aural bone conducted vibration (BCV), we performed simultaneous measurements of stimulus-evoked vestibular compound action potentials (vCAPs), utricular macula or stapes velocity, and Vestibular Microphonics (VMs) in the anaesthetized guinea pig. For short duration punctate stimuli (<1ms), the vCAP increases magnitude in close proportion to macular velocity and temporal bone (ear-bar) acceleration, rather than other kinematic variables. For longer duration stimuli, the vCAP magnitude switches from acceleration sensitive to linear jerk sensitive. vCAP input-output (IO) functions suggest primary afferent response generation has the same origins for both BCV and ACS, with similar macular velocity thresholds and IO functions for both stimuli. Frequency tuning curves evoked by tone-burst stimuli also show the vCAP increases magnitude in proportion to macular velocity, while in contrast, the VM increases magnitude in proportion to macular displacement across the entire frequency bandwidth tested. The subset of vestibular afferent neurons responsible for synchronized firing and vCAPs make calyceal synaptic contacts with type I hair cells in the striolar region of the epithelium and have irregularly spaced inter-spike intervals at rest. Present results provide new insight into mechanical and neural mechanisms underlying synchronized action potentials in these sensitive afferents, with clinical relevance for understanding the activation and tuning of neurons responsible for driving rapid compensatory reflex responses.

	<p>Objective: To investigate the relationship of lobar and deep brain regions with post-stroke dysphagia (PSD). Method: The databases of Medline, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library were searched from the establishment to May 2022. Studies that investigated the effects of lesions in lobar and deep brain regions on swallowing function after stroke were screened. The primary outcomes were PSD-related brain regions (including aspiration-related and oral transit time-related brain regions). The secondary outcomes were the incidence rate of PSD. The brain regions with the most overlap in the included studies were considered to be most relevant to PSD, and were presented as percentages. Data were compared utilizing the t-tests for continuous variables and &amp;amp;chi;2 for frequency-based variables. Result: A total of 24 studies and 2306 patients were included. The PSD-related lobar and deep brain regions included the insular cortex, frontal lobe, temporal gyrus, basal ganglia, postcentral, precentral, precuneus, corona radiate, etc. Among these brain regions, the insular cortex was most frequently reported (taking up 54.2%) in the included studies. Furthermore, the total incidence rate of PSD was around 40.4%, and the incidence of male was nearly 2.57 times as much as that of female (&amp;amp;chi;2 = 196.17, p &amp;amp;lt; 0.001). Conclusions: In lobar and deep brain regions, the insular cortex may be most relevant to PSD and aspiration, which may be a potentially promising target in the treatment of PSD.</p>

	<p>Decision making (DM) has a pivotal role in supporting individual autonomy and well-being. It is considered a complex ability exploiting many cognitive functions, among which executive functions (EFs) are crucial. Few studies analyzed the role played by EFs in DM in healthy adults under ambiguity and risk, which are common conditions for most decisions in daily life. This scoping review aims to analyze the relationships between two individual tasks widely used to assess DM under these conditions (Iowa Gambling Task and Game of Dice Task) and EFs. According to the organizing principle that conceptualizes hot and cold EFs, DM under such conditions mainly implies hot EFs, but the relationship with cold EFs is still unclear. Using such an approach, a comprehensive framework is provided, highlighting main findings and identifying possible gaps in the literature. The results suggest different roles played by cold EFs in DM under ambiguity and risk, according to the characteristics of the tasks. The findings can offer guidance to further studies and to design interventions to support DM in healthy adults.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Estrogens dynamically regulate neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of adult female rats</a></h4>

              
                Estrone and estradiol differentially modulate neuroplasticity and cognition but how they influence maturation pathways of new neurons is not known. The present study assessed the effects of estrone and estradiol on various aspects of neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus (DG) of ovariectomized young adult Sprague-Dawley rats using daily subcutaneous injections of 17{beta}-estradiol or estrone. Rats were injected with a DNA synthesis marker, 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU), and were perfused one, two, or three weeks after BrdU injection and treatment. Immunofluorescent labelling for Sox2 and Ki67 were used to examine the density of neural stem cells and proliferating cells, respectively. Double-immunofluorescent labelling of BrdU with doublecortin (DCX) or NeuN was used to examine the attrition and maturation of adult-born neurons over time. Estradiol reduced the density of neural stem cells in the dorsal DG, whereas estrone reduced the density of neural stem cells in the ventral DG. Furthermore, estradiol enhanced, whereas estrone reduced, cell proliferation after one week but not after longer exposure to hormones. Both estrogens increased the density of BrdU/DCX-ir cells after one week of exposure but showed greater attrition of new neurons between one and two weeks after exposure. Lastly, estradiol decreased the percentage of BrdU/NeuN-ir cells in the dorsal DG after three weeks of treatment. These results demonstrate that estrogens have differential effects to modulate several aspects of adult hippocampal neurogenesis in the short term, but fewer effects after long-term exposure and that estradiol and estrone modulate neurogenesis via different pathways.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Cross-modal interactions at the audiovisual cocktail-party revealed by behavior, ERPs, and neural oscillations</a></h4>

              
                Theories of attention argue that objects are the units of attentional selection. In real-word environments such objects can contain visual and auditory features. To understand how mechanisms of selective attention operate in multisensory environments, we created an audiovisual cocktail-party situation, in which two speakers (left and right of fixation) simultaneously articulated brief numerals. In three separate blocks, informative auditory speech was presented (a) alone or paired with (b) congruent or (c) uninformative visual speech. In all blocks, subjects localized a pre-defined numeral. While audiovisual-congruent and uninformative speech improved response times and speed of information uptake according to diffusion modeling, an ERP analysis revealed that this did not coincide with enhanced attentional engagement. Yet, consistent with object-based attentional selection, the deployment of auditory spatial attention (N2ac) was accompanied by visuo-spatial attentional orienting (N2pc) irrespective of the informational content of visual speech. Notably, an N2pc component was absent in the auditory-only condition, demonstrating that a sound-induced shift of visuo-spatial attention relies on the availability of audio-visual features evolving coherently in time. Additional analyses revealed cross-modal interactions in working memory and modulations of cognitive control.

	<p>Children with Down syndrome (DS) are at risk for challenges with aspects of executive function (EF). The current study explores whether heterogeneity in EF profiles can be detected within a sample of children with DS. Participants were 69 children with DS, ages 3&amp;amp;ndash;10 years (M = 6.23, SD = 1.91). T-scores from a caregiver-report measure of executive function were modeled using latent profile analysis, and auxiliary analyses examined the association between demographic and biomedical factors and probability of profile membership. The two-profile solution was the best fit for the sample, with a profile that involved elevated scores in working memory only (&amp;amp;ldquo;Working Memory Only&amp;amp;rdquo; profile; 43% of sample) and a &amp;amp;ldquo;Multi-Domain&amp;amp;rdquo; profile that involved elevated scores in planning, inhibition, and working memory (57%). The presence of congenital heart defects was associated with a higher probability of assignment to the Multi-Domain profile. Findings from this study contribute to the characterization of heterogeneous outcomes associated with DS.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">In silico comparison between the mutated and wild-type androgen receptors and their influence on the selection of optimum androgenic receptor blockers for the treatment of prostate cancer [version 3; peer review: awaiting peer review]</a></h4>

              
                Background: Prostate cancer is a disease that occurs in men aged more than 50 years. In Iraq, 8.89 men per 100,000 population suffer from prostate cancer, with the incidence being 14,016 cases and mortality being 6,367 cases. Despite advances in treatment against prostate cancer, it can become resistant to drugs. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to search and identify binding sites for the repositioning of drugs by computational methods (docking).  Methods: Based on the protein structure of the wild androgen receptor, the analysis parameters (22x22x22 on the X, Y, and Z axes) were established. Results: The interactions of the natural ligands with androgen receptor were 10.0 (testosterone) and 10.8 (dihydrotestosterone) while mutated androgen receptor (T877A) had a low affinity with testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (-5.3 and -6.7, respectively). In the interactions of both receptors with the reported inhibitors (antagonists), a decrease with Bicalutamide (-8.3 and -4.3, respectively) and an increase in affinity with Flutamide and Nilutamide (-7.7 and 8.6, wild AR; -8.7 and -9.3 AR T877A) were observed. As for Enzalutamide and Apalutamide (second-generation antagonists), the change was minimal between wild androgen receptor and T877A (-7.6 and -7.7; -7.3 and -7.3, respectively). The change in the affinity of the ligands with the androgen receptor and androgen receptor T877A shows how a mutation alters the bonds between these molecules. Conclusion: The identification of key sites and potent inhibitors against abnormal androgen receptor functions will enrich prostate cancer treatments.

              <h4><a href="https://f1000research.com/published/rss">A general hypothesis of multistable systems in pathophysiology [version 3; peer review: 2 approved]</a></h4>

              
                Despite intensive investigations numerous diseases remain etiologically puzzling and recalcitrant to treatments. A hypothesis is proposed here assuming that these difficulties are due to an unsuitable approach to the mechanisms of life, which is subjugated by an apparent complexity and fails to grasp the uniformity that lays behind. The stability of metabolism, despite the enormous complex of chemical reactions, suggests that reciprocal control is a prerequisite of life. Negative feedback loops have been known for a long time to maintain homeostasis, while more recently, different life processes involved in transitions or changes have been modeled by positive loops giving rise to bistable switches, also including various diseases. The present hypothesis makes a generalization, by assuming that any functional element of a biological system is involved in a positive or a negative feedback loop. Consequently, the hypothesis holds that the starting mechanism of any disease that affects a healthy human can be conceptually reduced to a bistable or multistationary loop system, thus providing a unifying model leading to the discovery of critical therapeutic targets.

                Background: Although nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) has a significant risk of spreading to other parts of the body early, orbital and ocular surrounding tissues metastases are uncommon. Case Report: This paper described a 16-year-old patient diagnosed with a locally advanced NPC and ocular metastasis and was treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy treatment. One of the rare early presentations is orbital metastases with vision problems. Discussion: Orbital metastases in children are considerably more uncommon. Cachexia and malnutrition are prevalent problems in people with cancer, affecting life and longevity. Anaemia is a severe issue for nasopharyngeal cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Conclusion: Orbital metastases frequently arise in advanced stages of the disease and in the scenario of many metastases the persistence of therapy and the nasopharyngeal cancer patient's standard of living is linked to the occurrence of anaemia.

                This paper describes a laboratory protocol to perform the NanoString nCounter Gene Expression Assay from nasopharyngeal swab samples.  It is urgently necessary to identify factors related to severe symptoms of respiratory infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, in order to assess the possibility of establishing preventive or preliminary therapeutic measures and to plan the services to be provided on hospital admission. At present, the samples recommended for microbiological diagnosis are those taken from the upper and/or the lower respiratory tract.  The NanoString nCounter Gene Expression Assay is a method based on the direct digital detection of mRNA molecules by means of target-specific, colour-coded probe pairs, without the need for mRNA conversion to cDNA by reverse transcription or the amplification of the resulting cDNA by PCR. This platform includes advanced analysis tools that reduce the need for bioinformatics support and also offers reliable sensitivity, reproducibility, technical robustness and utility for clinical application, even in RNA samples of low RNA quality or concentration, such as paraffin-embedded samples. Although the protocols for the analysis of blood or formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples are provided by the manufacturer, no corresponding protocol for the analysis of nasopharyngeal swab samples has yet been established. Therefore, the approach we describe could be adopted to determine the expression of target genes in samples obtained from nasopharyngeal swabs using the nCOUNTER technology.

                <p>by Luke Ternes, Jia-Ren Lin, Yu-An Chen, Joe W. Gray, Young Hwan Chang</p>

Recent state-of-the-art multiplex imaging techniques have expanded the depth of information that can be captured within a single tissue sample by allowing for panels with dozens of markers. Despite this increase in capacity, space on the panel is still limited due to technical artifacts, tissue loss, and long imaging acquisition time. As such, selecting which markers to include on a panel is important, since removing important markers will result in a loss of biologically relevant information, but identifying redundant markers will provide a room for other markers. To address this, we propose computational approaches to determine the amount of shared information between markers and select an optimally reduced panel that captures maximum amount of information with the fewest markers. Here we examine several panel selection approaches and evaluate them based on their ability to reconstruct the full panel images and information within breast cancer tissue microarray datasets using cyclic immunofluorescence as a proof of concept. We show that all methods perform adequately and can re-capture cell types using only 18 of 25 markers (72% of the original panel size). The correlation-based selection methods achieved the best single-cell marker mean intensity predictions with a Spearman correlation of 0.90 with the reduced panel. Using the proposed methods shown here, it is possible for researchers to design more efficient multiplex imaging panels that maximize the amount of information retained with the limited number of markers with respect to certain evaluation metrics and architecture biases.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">HAYSTAC: A Bayesian framework for robust and rapid species identification in high-throughput sequencing data</a></h4>

Identification of specific species in metagenomic samples is critical for several key applications, yet many tools available require large computational power and are often prone to false positive identifications. Here we describe High-AccuracY and Scalable Taxonomic Assignment of MetagenomiC data (HAYSTAC), which can estimate the probability that a specific taxon is present in a metagenome. HAYSTAC provides a user-friendly tool to construct databases, based on publicly available genomes, that are used for competitive reads mapping. It then uses a novel Bayesian framework to infer the abundance and statistical support for each species identification and provide per-read species classification. Unlike other methods, HAYSTAC is specifically designed to efficiently handle both ancient and modern DNA data, as well as incomplete reference databases, making it possible to run highly accurate hypothesis-driven analyses (<i>i</i>.<i>e</i>., assessing the presence of a specific species) on variably sized reference databases while dramatically improving processing speeds. We tested the performance and accuracy of HAYSTAC using simulated Illumina libraries, both with and without ancient DNA damage, and compared the results to other currently available methods (<i>i</i>.<i>e</i>., Kraken2/Bracken, KrakenUniq, MALT/HOPS, and Sigma). HAYSTAC identified fewer false positives than both Kraken2/Bracken, KrakenUniq and MALT in all simulations, and fewer than Sigma in simulations of ancient data. It uses less memory than Kraken2/Bracken, KrakenUniq as well as MALT both during database construction and sample analysis. Lastly, we used HAYSTAC to search for specific pathogens in two published ancient metagenomic datasets, demonstrating how it can be applied to empirical datasets. HAYSTAC is available from https://github.com/antonisdim/HAYSTAC.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">A hierarchical process model links behavioral aging and lifespan in C. elegans</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Natasha Oswal, Olivier M. F. Martin, Sofia Stroustrup, Monika Anna Matusiak Bruckner, Nicholas Stroustrup</p>

Aging involves a transition from youthful vigor to geriatric infirmity and death. Individuals who remain vigorous longer tend to live longer, and within isogenic populations of <i>C</i>. <i>elegan</i>s the timing of age-associated vigorous movement cessation (VMC) is highly correlated with lifespan. Yet, many mutations and interventions in aging alter the proportion of lifespan spent moving vigorously, appearing to “uncouple” youthful vigor from lifespan. To clarify the relationship between vigorous movement cessation, death, and the physical declines that determine their timing, we developed a new version of the imaging platform called “The Lifespan Machine”. This technology allows us to compare behavioral aging and lifespan at an unprecedented scale. We find that behavioral aging involves a time-dependent increase in the risk of VMC, reminiscent of the risk of death. Furthermore, we find that VMC times are inversely correlated with remaining lifespan across a wide range of genotypes and environmental conditions. Measuring and modelling a variety of lifespan-altering interventions including a new RNA-polymerase II auxin-inducible degron system, we find that vigorous movement and lifespan are best described as emerging from the interplay between at least two distinct physical declines whose rates co-vary between individuals. In this way, we highlight a crucial limitation of predictors of lifespan like VMC—in organisms experiencing multiple, distinct, age-associated physical declines, correlations between mid-life biomarkers and late-life outcomes can arise from the contextual influence of confounding factors rather than a reporting by the biomarker of a robustly predictive biological age.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/ploscompbiol/NewArticles">Individualised computational modelling of immune mediated disease onset, flare and clearance in psoriasis</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Fedor Shmarov, Graham R. Smith, Sophie C. Weatherhead, Nick J. Reynolds, Paolo Zuliani</p>

Despite increased understanding about psoriasis pathophysiology, currently there is a lack of predictive computational models. We developed a personalisable ordinary differential equations model of human epidermis and psoriasis that incorporates immune cells and cytokine stimuli to regulate the transition between two stable steady states of clinically healthy (non-lesional) and disease (lesional psoriasis, plaque) skin. In line with experimental data, an immune stimulus initiated transition from healthy skin to psoriasis and apoptosis of immune and epidermal cells induced by UVB phototherapy returned the epidermis back to the healthy state. Notably, our model was able to distinguish disease flares. The flexibility of our model permitted the development of a patient-specific “UVB sensitivity” parameter that reflected subject-specific sensitivity to apoptosis and enabled simulation of individual patients’ clinical response trajectory. In a prospective clinical study of 94 patients, serial individual UVB doses and clinical response (Psoriasis Area Severity Index) values collected over the first three weeks of UVB therapy informed estimation of the “UVB sensitivity” parameter and the prediction of individual patient outcome at the end of phototherapy. An important advance of our model is its potential for direct clinical application through early assessment of response to UVB therapy, and for individualised optimisation of phototherapy regimes to improve clinical outcome. Additionally by incorporating the complex interaction of immune cells and epidermal keratinocytes, our model provides a basis to study and predict outcomes to biologic therapies in psoriasis.

              <h4><a href="http://feeds.plos.org/plosbiology/NewArticles">Prior fear learning enables the rapid assimilation of new fear memories directly into cortical networks</a></h4>

              
                <p>by Giulia Concina, Annamaria Renna, Luisella Milano, Benedetto Sacchetti</p>

Long-term memory formation involves the reorganization of brain circuits, termed system consolidation. Whether and how a prior fear experience influences system consolidation of new memories is poorly understood. In rats, we found that prior auditory fear learning allows the secondary auditory cortex to immediately encode new auditory memories, with these new memories purely requiring the activation of cellular mechanisms of synaptic consolidation within secondary auditory cortex. Similar results were obtained in the anterior cingulate cortex for contextual fear memories. Moreover, prior learning enabled connections from these cortices to the basolateral amygdala (BLA) to support recent memory retention. We propose that the reorganization of circuits that characterizes system consolidation occurs only in the first instance that an event is learned, subsequently allowing the immediate assimilation of new analogous events in final storage sites.

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Obese male Zucker rats exhibit dendritic remodeling in neurons of the hippocampal trisynaptic circuit as well as spatial memory deficits</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Obesity is characterized by excessive fat accumulation. The Zucker rat displays genetic obesity due to a mutation in the leptin receptor gene; this model is of great interest because of its similarity to human obesity. Brain regions may be affected by obesity, but detailed information is lacking. In the present study, we analyzed the morphology of neurons in the hippocampal trisynaptic circuit as well as the spatial memory of obese Zucker rats. We performed two experiments. Each experiment contained two experimental groups: the control group (male Long Evans rats) and the study group (obese male Zucker rats). We monitored the body weights of all rats over 4 weeks. In the first experiment, we analyzed the morphology of hippocampal neurons. Under anesthesia, we measured the abdominal and hip circumferences and collected at least 1 ml of blood to assess serum glucose (GLU), triglyceride (TGC), and cholesterol (COL) concentrations. We perfused the brains of these rats with 0.9% saline solution, incubated the brains in Golgi-Cox solution, and subsequently evaluated the morphology of pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus (the CA1-CA3 regions) and the entorhinal cortex as well as the morphology of granule neurons in the dentate gyrus. In the second experiment, we assessed the spatial memory of animals with the Morris water maze. The Zucker rats had an obese phenotype, as indicated by their elevated body weight and increased abdominal and hip circumferences as well as elevated GLU, COL, and TGC concentrations. Analysis of neurons from the specified regions in obese male Zucker rats indicated reduced dendritic arborization and reduced dendritic spine density. In terms of spatial learning and memory, the obese Zucker rats exhibited intact spatial learning (i.e., of platform location) but deficits in spatial memory. These data provide evidence that obesity alters the morphology and function of hippocampal neurons.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/feed/10981063/most-recent">Hippocampal neurogenesis promotes effortful responding but does not regulate effort‐based choice</a></h4>

              
                <h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>A fundamental trait of depression is low motivation. Hippocampal neurogenesis has been associated with motivational deficits but detailed evidence on how it regulates human-relevant behavioral traits is still missing. We used the hGFAP-TK rat model to deplete actively dividing neural stem cells in the rat hippocampus. Use of the effort-discounting operant task allowed us to identify specific and detailed deficits in motivation behavior. In this task, rats are given a choice between small and large food rewards, where 2–20 lever presses are required to obtain the large reward (four sugar pellets) versus one press to receive the smaller reward (two sugar pellets). We found that depleting adult neurogenesis did not affect effort-based choice or general motivation to complete the task. However, lack of adult neurogenesis reduced the pressing rate and thus increased time to complete the required presses to obtain a reward. In summary, the present study finds that adult hippocampal neurogenesis specifically reduces response vigor to obtain rewards and thus deepens our understanding in how neurogenesis shapes depression.</p>

              <h4><a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/inpress.rss">High-resolution optogenetics in space and time</a></h4>

              
                To understand the neural mechanisms of behavior, it is necessary to both monitor and perturb the activity of ensembles of neurons with high specificity. While neural ensemble recordings have been available for decades, progress in high-resolution manipulation techniques has lagged behind. Optogenetics has enabled the manipulation of genetically defined cell types in behaving animals, and recent developments, including multipoint nanofabricated light sources, provide spatiotemporal resolution on a par with that of physiological recordings.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">In vivo generation of bone marrow from embryonic stem cells in interspecies chimeras</a></h4>

              
                Generation of bone marrow (BM) from embryonic stem cells (ESCs) promises to accelerate the development of future cell therapies for life-threatening disorders. However, such approach is limited by technical challenges to produce a mixture of functional BM progenitor cells able to replace all hematopoietic cell lineages. Herein, we used blastocyst complementation to simultaneously produce BM cell lineages from mouse ESCs in a rat. Based on FACS analysis and single-cell RNA sequencing, mouse ESCs differentiated into multiple hematopoietic and stromal cell types that were indistinguishable from normal mouse BM cells based on gene expression signatures and cell surface markers. Receptor-ligand interactions identified <i>Cxcl12-Cxcr4</i>, <i>Lama2-Itga6, App-Itga6</i>, <i>Comp-Cd47</i>, <i>Col1a1-Cd44</i> and <i>App-Il18rap</i> as major signaling pathways between hematopoietic progenitors and stromal cells. Multiple hematopoietic progenitors, including hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in mouse-rat chimeras derived more efficiently from mouse ESCs, whereas chondrocytes predominantly derived from rat cells. In the dorsal aorta and fetal liver of mouse-rat chimeras, mouse HSCs emerged and expanded faster compared to endogenous rat cells. Sequential BM transplantation of ESC-derived cells from mouse-rat chimeras rescued lethally-irradiated syngeneic mice and demonstrated long-term reconstitution potential of donor HSCs. Altogether, a fully functional bone marrow was generated from mouse ESCs using rat embryos as 'bioreactors'.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Protein evidence of unannotated ORFs in Drosophila reveals diversity in the evolution and properties of young proteins</a></h4>

              
                <i>De novo</i> gene origination, where a previously non-genic genomic sequence becomes genic through evolution, has been increasingly recognized as an important source of evolutionary novelty across diverse taxa. Many <i>de novo</i> genes have been proposed to be protein-coding, and in several cases have been experimentally shown to yield protein products. However, the systematic study of <i>de novo</i> proteins has been hampered by doubts regarding the translation of their transcripts without the experimental observation of protein products. Using a systematic, ORF-focused mass-spectrometry-first computational approach, we identify almost 1000 unannotated open reading frames with evidence of translation (utORFs) in the model organism <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>, 371 of which have canonical start codons. To quantify the comparative genomic similarity of these utORFs across <i>Drosophila</i> and to infer phylostratigraphic age, we further develop a synteny-based protein similarity approach. Combining these results with reference datasets on tissue- and life-stage-specific transcription and conservation, we identify different properties amongst these utORFs. Contrary to expectations, the fastest-evolving utORFs are not the youngest evolutionarily. We observed more utORFs in the brain than in the testis. Most of the identified utORFs may be of <i>de novo</i> origin, even accounting for the possibility of false-negative similarity detection. Finally, sequence divergence after an inferred <i>de novo</i> origin event remains substantial, raising the possibility that <i>de novo</i> proteins turn over frequently. Our results suggest that there is substantial unappreciated diversity in <i>de novo</i> protein evolution: many more may exist than have been previously appreciated; there may be divergent evolutionary trajectories; and <i>de novo</i> proteins may be gained and lost frequently. All in all, there may not exist a single characteristic model of <i>de novo</i> protein evolution, but instead, there may be diverse evolutionary trajectories for <i>de novo</i> proteins.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">A neutrophil–B-cell axis impacts tissue damage control in a mouse model of intraabdominal bacterial infection via Cxcr4</a></h4>

              
                Sepsis is a life-threatening condition characterized by uncontrolled systemic inflammation and coagulation, leading to multiorgan failure. Therapeutic options to prevent sepsis-associated immunopathology remain scarce. Here, we established a mouse model of long-lasting disease tolerance during severe sepsis, manifested by diminished immunothrombosis and organ damage in spite of a high pathogen burden. We found that both neutrophils and B cells emerged as key regulators of tissue integrity. Enduring changes in the transcriptional profile of neutrophils include upregulated Cxcr4 expression in protected, tolerant hosts. Neutrophil Cxcr4 upregulation required the presence of B cells, suggesting that B cells promoted disease tolerance by improving tissue damage control via the suppression of neutrophils’ tissue-damaging properties. Finally, therapeutic administration of a Cxcr4 agonist successfully promoted tissue damage control and prevented liver damage during sepsis. Our findings highlight the importance of a critical B-cell/neutrophil interaction during sepsis and establish neutrophil Cxcr4 activation as a potential means to promote disease tolerance during sepsis.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Evolution of cell size control is canalized towards adders or sizers by cell cycle structure and selective pressures</a></h4>

              
                Cell size is controlled to be within a specific range to support physiological function. To control their size, cells use diverse mechanisms ranging from ‘sizers’, in which differences in cell size are compensated for in a single cell division cycle, to ‘adders’, in which a constant amount of cell growth occurs in each cell cycle. This diversity raises the question why a particular cell would implement one rather than another mechanism? To address this question, we performed a series of simulations evolving cell size control networks. The size control mechanism that evolved was influenced by both cell cycle structure and specific selection pressures. Moreover, evolved networks recapitulated known size control properties of naturally occurring networks.  If the mechanism is based on a G1 size control and an S/G2/M timer, as found for budding yeast and some human cells, adders likely evolve. But, if the G1 phase is significantly longer than the S/G2/M phase, as is often the case in mammalian cells <i>in vivo</i>, sizers become more likely. Sizers also evolve when the cell cycle structure is inverted so that G1 is a timer, while S/G2/M performs size control, as is the case for the fission yeast <i>S. pombe</i>. For some size control networks, cell size consistently decreases in each cycle until a burst of cell cycle inhibitor drives an extended G1 phase much like the cell division cycle of the green algae <i>Chlamydomonas</i>. That these size control networks evolved such self-organized criticality shows how the evolution of complex systems can drive the emergence of critical processes.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Identification of orphan ligand-receptor relationships using a cell-based CRISPRa enrichment screening platform</a></h4>

              
                Secreted proteins, which include cytokines, hormones and growth factors, are extracellular ligands that control key signaling pathways mediating cell-cell communication within and between tissues and organs. Many drugs target secreted ligands and their cell-surface receptors. Still, there are hundreds of secreted human proteins that either have no identified receptors ('orphans') and are likely to act through cell surface receptors that have not yet been characterized. Discovery of secreted ligand-receptor interactions by high-throughput screening has been problematic, because the most commonly used high-throughput methods for protein-protein interaction (PPI) screening do not work well for extracellular interactions. Cell-based screening is a promising technology for definition of new ligand-receptor interactions, because multimerized ligands can enrich for cells expressing low affinity cell-surface receptors, and such methods do not require purification of receptor extracellular domains. Here, we present a proteo-genomic cell-based CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) enrichment screening platform employing customized pooled cell surface receptor sgRNA libraries in combination with a magnetic bead selection-based enrichment workflow for rapid, parallel ligand-receptor deorphanization. We curated 80 potentially high value orphan secreted proteins and ultimately screened 20 secreted ligands against two cell sgRNA libraries with targeted expression of all single-pass (TM1) or multi-pass (TM2+) receptors by CRISPRa. We identified previously unknown interactions in 12 of these screens, and validated several of them using surface plasmon resonance and/or cell binding. The newly deorphanized ligands include three receptor tyrosine phosphatase (RPTP) ligands and a chemokine like protein that binds to killer cell inhibitory receptors (KIR's). These new interactions provide a resource for future investigations of interactions between the human secreted and membrane proteomes.

              <h4><a href="http://elifesciences.org/rss/recent.xml">Airway basal cells show regionallydistinct potential to undergo metaplastic differentiation</a></h4>

              
                Basal cells are multipotent stem cells of a variety of organs, including the respiratory tract, where they are major components of the airway epithelium. However, it remains unclear how diverse basal cells are, and how distinct subpopulations respond to airway challenges. Using single cell RNA-sequencing and functional approaches, we report a significant and previously underappreciated degree of heterogeneity in the basal cell pool, leading to identification of six subpopulations in the adult murine trachea. Among these, we found two major subpopulations collectively comprising the most uncommitted of all the pool, but with distinct gene expression signatures. Notably, these occupy distinct ventral and dorsal tracheal niches and differ in their ability to self-renew and initiate a program of differentiation in response to environmental perturbations in primary cultures and in mouse injury models in vivo. We found that such heterogeneity is acquired prenatally, when the basal cell pool and local niches are still being established, and depends on the integrity of these niches, as supported by the altered basal cell phenotype of tracheal cartilage-deficient mouse mutants. Lastly, we show that features that distinguish these progenitor subpopulations in murine airways are conserved in humans. Together, the data provide novel insights into the origin and impact of basal cell heterogeneity on the establishment of regionally distinct responses of the airway epithelium during injury-repair and in disease conditions.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Harmonic memory signals in the human cerebral cortex induced by sematic relatedness of words</a></h4>

              
                When we memorize multiple words simultaneously, semantic relatedness among those words assists memory. For example, the information of 'apple', 'banana' and 'orange' will be connected via a common concept of 'fruits' and become easy to retain and recall. Neural mechanisms underlying this semantic integration in verbal working memory remain unclear. Here I used electroencephalography (EEG) and investigated neural signals when healthy human participants memorized five nouns semantically related (Sem trial) or not (NonSem trial). The regularity of oscillatory signals (8 to 30 Hz) during the retention period was found to be lower in NonSem than Sem trials, indicating that memorizing words unrelated to each other induced a non-harmonic (irregular) waveform in the temporal cortex. These results suggest that (i) semantic features of a word are retained as a set of neural oscillations at specific frequencies and (ii) memorizing words sharing a common semantic feature produces harmonic brain responses through a resonance or integration (sharing) of the oscillatory signals.

                Inter-subject modeling of cognitive processes has been a challenging task due to large individual variability in brain structure and function. Graph neural networks (GNNs) provide a potential way to project subject-specific neural responses onto a common representational space by effectively combining local and distributed brain activity through connectome-based constraints. Here we provide in-depth interpretations of biologically-constrained GNNs (BGNNs) that reach state-of-the-art performance in several decoding tasks and reveal inter-subject aligned neural representations underpinning cognitive processes. Specifically, the model not only segregates brain responses at different stages of cognitive tasks, e.g. motor preparation and motor execution, but also uncovers functional gradients in neural representations, e.g. a gradual progression of visual working memory (VWM) from sensory processing to cognitive control and towards behavioral abstraction. Moreover, the multilevel representations of VWM exhibit better inter-subject alignment in brain responses, higher decoding of cognitive states, and strong phenotypic and genetic correlations with individual behavioral performance. Our work demonstrates that biologically constrained deep-learning models have the potential towards both cognitive and biological fidelity in cognitive modeling, and open new avenues to interpretable functional gradients of brain cognition in a wide range of cognitive neuroscience questions.

                Speech, as the spoken form of language, is fundamental for human communication. The phenomenon of covert inner speech implies a functional independence of speech content and motor production. However, it remains unclear how a flexible mapping between speech content and production is achieved on the neural level. To address this, we recorded magnetoencephalography (MEG) in humans performing a rule-based vocalization task. On each trial, vocalization content (one of two vowels) and production form (overt or covert) were instructed independently. Using multivariate pattern analysis, we found robust neural information about vocalization content and production, mostly originating from speech areas of the left hemisphere. Production signals dynamically transformed upon presentation of the content cue, whereas content signals remained largely stable throughout the trial. In sum, our results show dissociable neural representations of vocalization content and production in the human brain and provide new insights into the neural dynamics underlying human vocalization.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Attentional inhibition ability predicts neural representation during challenging auditory streaming</a></h4>

              
                Focusing on a single source within a complex auditory scene is challenging. M/EEG-based auditory attention detection allows to detect which stream, within a set of multiple concurrent streams, an individual is attending to. The high inter-individual variability in the AAD performance is most often attributed to physiological factors and signal to noise ratio of neural data. Here we address the hypothesis that cognitive factors and in particular sustained attention, WM and attentional inhibition, may also partly explain the variability in AAD performance, because they support the cognitive processes required when listening to complex auditory scenes. Here, we chose a particularly challenging auditory scene, by presenting dichotically polyphonic classical piano excerpts lasting one minute each. Two different excerpts were presented simultaneously in each ear. Forty-one participants, with different degrees of musical expertise, listened to these complex auditory scenes focussing on one ear while we recorded the EEG. Participants also completed several tasks assessing executive functions. As expected, attended stimuli were better decoded than unattended stimuli. Importantly, attentional inhibition ability did explain around 10% of the reconstruction accuracy and around 8% of the classification accuracy. No other cognitive function was a significant predictor of reconstruction or of classification accuracies. No clear effect of musical expertise was found on reconstruction and classification performances. In conclusion, cognitive factors seem to impact the robustness of the auditory representation and hence the performance of neural based decoding approaches. Taking advantage of this relation could be useful to improve next-generation hearing aids.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Accelerated signal propagation speed in human neocortical microcircuits</a></h4>

              
                Human-specific cognitive abilities depend on information processing in the cerebral cortex, where neurons are significantly larger and sparser compared to rodents. We found that, in synaptically-connected layer 2/3 pyramidal cells (L2/3 PCs), soma-to-soma signal propagation delay is similar in humans and rodents. Thus, to compensate for the increase in neurons size, membrane potential changes must propagate faster in human axons and/or dendrites. Dual somato-dendritic and somato-axonal patch recordings show that action potentials (APs) propagation speed is similar in human and rat axons, but the forward propagation of the EPSPs and the back-propagating APs are ~1.7-fold faster in human dendrites. Faithful biophysical models of human and rat L2/3 PCs, combined with pharmacological manipulations of membrane properties, showed that the larger dendritic diameter, combined with differences in cable properties, underlie the accelerated signal propagation in human cortical circuits. The implication for information processing in the human brain are discussed.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">More than half of the variance in in-vivo 1H-MRS metabolite estimates is common to all metabolites</a></h4>

              
                The present study characterized associations among brain metabolite levels, applying bivariate and multivariate (i.e., factor analysis) statistical methods to tCr-referenced estimates of the major PRESS 1H-MRS metabolites (i.e., tNAA/tCr, tCho/tCr, mI/tCr, Glx/tCr), acquired from medial parietal lobe in a large (n=299), well-characterized international cohort of healthy volunteers (Povazan et al., 2020). Results supported the hypothesis that 1H-MRS-measured metabolite estimates are moderately intercorrelated (Mr = 0.42, SDr = 0.11, ps < 0.001), with more than half (i.e., 57%) of the total variability in metabolite estimates common to (i.e., shared by) all metabolites. Older age was significantly associated with lower levels of common metabolite variance (CMV; {beta} = -0.09, p = 0.048), despite not being associated with levels of any individual metabolite. Holding CMV levels constant, females had significantly lower levels of total choline (i.e., unique metabolite variance or UMV; {beta} = -0.19, p < 0.001), mirroring significant bivariate correlations between sex and total choline reported previously. If replicated, these results would suggest that applied 1H-MRS researchers should shift their analytical framework from examining bivariate associations between individual metabolites and specialty-dependent (e.g., clinical, research) variables of interest (e.g., using t-tests) to examining multi-variable (i.e., covariate) associations between multiple metabolites and specialty-dependent variables of interest (e.g., using multiple regression). Without this shift, clear interpretation of associations of 1H-MRS metabolites with specialty-dependent variables of interest may not be possible.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Accurate measurement of inhibition and excitation in human motor pools during sensory stimulation</a></h4>

              
                Surface electromyography (sEMG) is a pivotal approach in clinical and basic neurophysiology, allowing us to extract the summed activity of motor units in a given muscle. Due to the bipolar nature of the motor unit action potential, the sEMG is a non-linear representation of their underlying motor unit activity and therefore affected by signal cancellation. It is not clear how this signal cancellation influences stimulus evoked responses in sEMG. The aim of our study was to characterise how representative an evoked sEMG response was to the firing behaviour of the underlying motor pool. To do this, we first carried out simulations of a population of motor units (and their action potentials) that responded to a stimulus with a change in firing probability. Their activity was summed then rectified to generate a simulated sEMG signal or was rectified and then summed, to generate a sEMG signal with no cancellation. By comparing the two responses to that of the underlying pool we would then compare for discrepancies and for the contribution of signal cancellation. We repeated this process but by using the responses of tibialis anterior motor units to weak tibial nerve stimulation. We find that both for the simulated and experimental data the response measured through the sEMG is almost always an underestimate of the evoked response in the underlying motor pool. This is the case for both inhibitory and excitatory evoked responses. The magnitude of the inaccuracy depends on the size of the evoked response, but it cannot be accounted solely by signal cancellation, suggesting other factors may also contribute.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Neural correlates of extinction in a rat model of appetitive Pavlovian conditioning</a></h4>

              
                Extinction is a fundamental form of inhibitory learning that is important for adapting to changing environmental contingencies. While numerous studies have investigated the neural correlates of extinction using Pavlovian fear conditioning and appetitive operant reward-seeking procedures, less is known about the neural circuitry mediating the extinction of appetitive Pavlovian conditioned responding. Here, we aimed to generate an extensive brain activation map of extinction learning in a rat model of appetitive Pavlovian conditioning. Male Long-Evans rats were trained to associate a conditioned stimulus (CS; 20 s white noise) with the delivery of a 10% sucrose unconditioned stimulus (US; 0.3 ml/CS) to a fluid port. Control groups also received CS presentations, but sucrose was delivered either during the inter-trial interval or in the home-cage. After conditioning, 1 or 6 extinction sessions were conducted in which the CS was presented but sucrose was withheld. We performed Fos immunohistochemistry and network connectivity analyses on a set of cortical, striatal, thalamic, and amygdalar brain regions. Neural activity in the prelimbic cortex, ventral orbitofrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens core, and paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus was greater during recall relative to extinction. Conversely, prolonged extinction following 6 sessions induced increased neural activity in the infralimbic cortex, medial orbitofrontal cortex, and nucleus accumbens shell compared to home-cage controls. All these structures were similarly recruited during recall on the first extinction session. These findings provide novel evidence for the contribution of brain areas and neural networks that are differentially involved in the recall versus extinction of appetitive Pavlovian conditioned responding.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Voxel-Wise Brain Graphs from Diffusion MRI: Intrinsic Eigenspace Dimensionality and Application to fMRI</a></h4>

              
                Structural brain graphs are conventionally limited to defining nodes as gray matter regions from an atlas, with edges reflecting the density of axonal projections between pairs of nodes. Here we explicitly model the entire set of voxels within a brain mask as nodes of high-resolution, subject-specific graphs. We define the strength of local voxel-to-voxel connections using diffusion tensors and orientation distribution functions derived from diffusion-weighted MRI data. We study the graphs' Laplacian spectral properties on data from the Human Connectome Project. We then assess the extent of inter-subject variability of the Laplacian eigenmodes via a procrustes validation scheme. Finally, we demonstrate the extent to which functional MRI data are shaped by the underlying anatomical structure via graph signal processing. The graph Laplacian eigenmodes manifest highly resolved spatial profiles, reflecting distributed patterns that correspond to major white matter pathways. We show that the intrinsic dimensionality of the eigenspace of such high-resolution graphs is only a mere fraction of the graph dimensions. By projecting task and resting-state data on low-frequency graph Laplacian eigenmodes, we show, firstly, that brain activity can be well approximated by a small subset of low-frequency components, and secondly, that spectral graph energy profiles differ under different functional loads. The proposed graphs open new avenues in studying the brain, be it, by exploring their organisational properties via graph or spectral graph theory, or by treating them as the scaffold on which brain function is observed at the individual level.

              <h4><a href="http://connect.biorxiv.org/biorxiv_xml.php?subject=neuroscience">Decoding of the speech envelope from EEG using the VLAAI deep neural network.</a></h4>

              
                To investigate the processing of speech in the brain, commonly simple linear models are used to establish a relationship between brain signals and speech features. However, these linear models are ill-equipped to model a highly-dynamic, complex non-linear system like the brain, and they often require a substantial amount of subject-specific training data. This work introduces a novel speech decoder architecture: the Very Large Augmented Auditory Inference (VLAAI) network. The VLAAI network outperformed state-of-the-art subject-independent models (median Pearson correlation of 0.19, p < 0.001), yielding an increase over the well-established linear model by 52%. Using ablation techniques we identified the relative importance of each part of the VLAAI network and found that the non-linear components and output context module influenced model performance the most (10% relative performance increase). Subsequently, the VLAAI network was evaluated on a holdout dataset of 26 subjects and publicly available unseen dataset to test generalization for unseen subjects and stimuli. No significant difference was found between the holdout subjects and the default test set, and only a small difference between the default test set and the public dataset was found. Compared to the baseline models, the VLAAI network still significantly outperformed all baseline models on the public dataset. We evaluated the effect of training set size by training the VLAAI network on data from 1 up to 80 subjects and evaluated on 26 holdout subjects, revealing a logarithmic relationship between the number of subjects in the training set and the performance on unseen subjects. Finally, the subject-independent VLAAI network was fine-tuned for 26 holdout subjects to obtain subject-specific VLAAI models. With 5 minutes of data or more, a significant performance improvement was found, up to 34% (from 0.18 to 0.25 median Pearson correlation) with regards to the subject-independent VLAAI network.
